{"Headline": "Review: The Emmys Figured Out How to Handle Trump", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Sunday night\u2019s Emmys broadcast on CBS \u2014 after months of presidential tweets and savage national discord, much of it played out on (and sometimes directed against) television \u2014 the industry was ready. References to Mr. Trump were plentiful and pointed but contained, delivered with more steadfastness and polish than outrage. He was more a subject than a target.National division shared the spotlight with topics that already feel perennial: the overabundance of television shows, the ever-increasing ubiquity of streaming services, the industry\u2019s struggles with diversity and the dragon in the room, HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (ineligible for awards this year because no episodes aired within the right time frame).NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d with its nine awards (five in the earlier Creative Emmys), both symbolized the mood of quiet protest and benefited the most from the unquiet political situation. Alec Baldwin, accepting a supporting actor award for his occasional impersonations of Mr. Trump, got off one of the night\u2019s better zingers: \u201cAt long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy.\u201dThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d victories were not just a political statement but a rare bright spot for the broadcast networks, whose only other winners on the night were Sterling K. Brown for \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and the reality competition \u201cThe Voice\u201d (both, like \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d on NBC).Many of the night\u2019s other awards went to newer peak-TV voices. Donald Glover won directing and acting awards for his distinctive comedy \u201cAtlanta\u201d on the cable channel FX. Netflix\u2019s anthology series \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d won two awards, including best TV movie for its episode \u201cSan Junipero.\u201d Aziz Ansari and Lena Waithe won a writing award for the Netflix comedy \u201cMaster of None.\u201dAnd the night\u2019s triumphant show was another series from a streaming service, Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which took home best drama and best actress among its five awards on the night. (That show\u2019s Elisabeth Moss won for the first time after multiple nominations for \u201cMad Men.\u201d)Direct jabs at Mr. Trump were not infrequent, though it was perhaps surprising how many winners declined the opportunity to make any sort of reference to the national mood. Mr. Glover credited Mr. Trump with his award for actor in a comedy, saying he had made \u201cblack people No. 1 on the most-oppressed list.\u201dJulia Louis-Dreyfus, accepting her sixth comedy-actress award for \u201cVeep,\u201d joked that the show had considered an impeachment story line for its final season but abandoned it \u201cbecause we were afraid someone else might get to it first.\u201dThe broadcast went off with few hitches, though more winners than usual had to be played off the stage to meet the 11 p.m. Eastern ending time. The 92-year-old Cicely Tyson, presenting the award for outstanding limited series, stumbled at first but rallied strongly, to fierce applause. Celebrating the industry\u2019s inclusiveness, Hayma Washington, president of the Television Academy, made a possible Freudian slip when he cited its \u201cinsclusiveness.\u201dOne of the night\u2019s more touching moments celebrated a pioneering woman in the TV industry and a CBS hero: The In Memoriam segment ended with Mary Tyler Moore, who died in January at 80, turning off the lights in the fictional newsroom of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201d It had nothing to do with national politics, but it felt like an apt comment on current trends in the broadcast TV business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: When It Comes to New Marvel Shows, Skip \u2018Inhumans\u2019 and Try \u2018The Gifted\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarvel series have become their own genre, and it\u2019s one of the larger ones in the television-and-streaming universe: 13 live-action shows by next spring, if plans hold.(Fairness note: both networks only gave critics a pilot; for \u201cInhumans,\u201d that was a two-hour episode that\u2019s already played in IMAX theaters.)The problems with \u201cInhumans\u201d \u2014 whose showrunner, Scott Buck, also held that position on the first season of the much maligned \u201cIron Fist\u201d \u2014 set in right away, with a clumsily directed jungle chase that looks like a game of laser tag in the Home Depot plant section. IMAX\u2019s financial participation in the show was supposed to beef up its budget, but the pilot looks noticeably cheap.The setup \u2014 a superhuman minority with a royal family and a restless underclass \u2014 has echoes of another ABC fantasy, \u201cOnce Upon a Time,\u201d but it\u2019s presented in such a stilted, sluggish way that it mainly recalls costume epics like \u201cClash of the Titans,\u201d which at least had Ray Harryhausen\u2019s cool special effects.The royal Inhumans have a grab bag of powers \u2014 prehensile hair, hooves capable of generating shock waves, a deadly voice. (The last belongs to Black Bolt, meaning that Mr. Mount has to act mostly with his eyes and shoulders.) Ken Leung plays a cousin whose mutation is seeing the flaws in everything \u2014 he\u2019s a superpowered downer.Even the family pet is a mutant. He\u2019s about as adorable as a 6-foot-tall computer-generated teleporting bulldog could be, and you get the feeling that the show is going to lean heavily on scenes of humans grabbing his fur and ordering him to fly them to the moon or other locales. (Most of those will be in Hawaii, where the royal Inhumans find themselves exiled.)\u201cThe Gifted\u201d has a promising pedigree \u2014 it was created by Matt Nix (\u201cBurn Notice\u201d), who wrote the pilot. The Marvel veteran Bryan Singer was brought in to direct the pilot, presumably because of his extensive experience with the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies.The show features an original story and new characters not taken from comic books, but it\u2019s loosely situated in the \u201cX-Men\u201d continuum, with references to those more famous mutants having gone missing. Free of existing origin stories, the premise is simple: a young brother and sister manifest their powers, and their non-mutant parents take them on the run with the help of photogenic members of a mutant underground.The \u201cGifted\u201d pilot is all the things \u201cInhumans\u201d isn\u2019t: quick, tense, funny, occasionally moving. Exposition is at a minimum and the obligatory speeches about intolerance and conformity are kept short. Mutant abilities \u2014 telekinesis, teleportation, fire rays \u2014 are straightforward and effectively filmed.And the cast benefits from getting to play characters with recognizably human reactions to superhuman events. Natalie Alyn Lind, who has comic-book experience as Silver St. Cloud on \u201cGotham,\u201d is good as the sister, and the parents are ably played by Amy Acker and Stephen Moyer.(It\u2019s a little disappointing to see Ms. Acker, so good as an action hero-mad genius in \u201cPerson of Interest,\u201d portraying a churchgoing, minivan-driving mom here. But her character shows signs of feistiness in the pilot, so here\u2019s hoping she emerges as a derriere-kicking avenger.)There\u2019s room in Marvel\u2019s big tent for all kinds of shows, of course, not just traditional action dramas with family overtones like \u201cThe Gifted.\u201d But if you\u2019re scoring, only one of the two Marvel shows this weekend features a Stan Lee cameo, and it\u2019s not \u201cInhumans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discussing North Korea", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 23______Is there anything you think people don\u2019t fully understand about this conflict? What do you think people might miss?\u201cIt always helps to know a little bit of history on the Korean Peninsula, to see this current event in historical context. You have to remember that Korea used to be one nation, and it was divided against Koreans\u2019 wishes into a Communist North and a pro-American South at the end of World War II. That division was vastly unpopular among all Koreans, and that was the basis of the war; the war was a war for unification.North Korea wanted the whole country under Communist rule, and South Korea wanted to hold the peninsula under its own rule. The war, of course, ended in stalemate, with the Korean Peninsula still divided, and that rivalry and tension continued for the past 50 years.\u201dCan you imagine a unified Korean Peninsula in your lifetime? Can you imagine that as a possibility? I\u2019m just curious.\u201cI\u2019m a South Korean, and you know, since childhood, we have been taught to believe that unification with North Korea is national wish No. 1. And there is even a song called called our national wish No. 1, which is about unification with North Korea.So yes, I grew up with this sort of brainwashing or national belief that unification should have happened. And as a South Korean, yes I do want unification, but I don\u2019t think it will happen anytime soon. The North Korean government, whether we like it or not, is very, very durable, in my view.\u201dBelow (as usual) you\u2019ll find some other reports in The Times that piqued my interest this week, plus some music recommendations from my Australian colleagues.________________________As I\u2019ve been traveling a lot recently, I\u2019ve been diving into music again with input from my savvy Australian colleagues.

{"Headline": "A Plague and a Blessing in My Empty Nest", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week before I took my only daughter to college in another state this fall, our house became infested with fleas. Combined with the impending sense of child loss, it felt like a biblical plague. Bites accumulated around our ankles and feet, and on me at least, seemed to work their way up further every night toward my neck. By the time I dropped her off, we were both riddled with the raised itchy bumps that we have a shared penchant for scratching raw.Truth: I was dreading coming home. I didn\u2019t know what it would be like to return to my nest, sans child, and I ended up staying on for five nights in her new town. Day after day, I sat in a cafe near her dorm. \u201cJust in case you need anything,\u201d I told her. It was an arrangement that suited us both. She would stop by and we would go out and shop for additional items for her dorm room or just have coffee and talk. She was building up her fortitude for her new independent life. I was building up the fortitude to bear her absence.Plus, I knew the fleas awaited. Bombing didn\u2019t seem to help. Spraying either. I\u2019d felt like a one-person Monsanto, soaking the house in noxious poisons to rid a natural cycle. Further, someone told me the fleas were onto that stuff, had evolved to a resistance.When I finally returned home, I found I had acquired a secret weapon. Her name is Reem. She is an Egyptian student at the college where I teach who decided she would rather live in our house than her dorm for her final semester and had moved in, \u201cfor the peacefulness.\u201d She told me about her freshman roomie who brought in random guys for sex, played loud music and cut herself. I had a feeling it had gone downhill from there.Reem soon revealed a talent for the extermination of fleas. Online, she found the \u201clightbulb-over-dish-of-soapy-water\u201d trick, which produced a gray film of flea corpses each morning that lessened by the day. She also had the patience to remove fleas with a teensy comb from the fur of our cats, dropping their corpses (\u201canother live one!\u201d) into more soapy dishwater. She helped me vacuum and clean, and we bagged up all our blankets and loose clothing for sterilization. It was a pretty monumental undertaking.At the same time, I was going through the stages of Kubler-Rossian grief. I was sad; I was proud; I was accepting. It wasn\u2019t really happening. Some mornings, when I woke to wake my girl and realized she was gone, her absence was soul-bludgeoning.I texted her too often that first week (\u201cStop it!\u201d was her first reply). Then, one afternoon, she wrote me back a longer dispatch: \u201cI. AM. FINE,\u201d she wrote. And then, three minutes later: \u201cI am a college student now.\u201dI felt the oddest thing reading this \u2014 a combination of hurt and happiness in her newly boundaried independence, mixed with a deep pit of loneliness. For 18 years I had lived around our meals and activities, helping her with this and that, driving her here and there. Sewing final snaps on her ballet outfits. Sideline-sitting at the soccer games. Front row at the plays. Now what was I supposed to do?The answer: Kill fleas with Reem! We schemed away and celebrated small victories. \u201cI think we are getting somewhere,\u201d she would report. I would cheer. Then wake up bejeweled in bites. We weren\u2019t.One afternoon she texted me: \u201cTomorrow is Eid al-Adha and I wondered if I could invite over a few Egyptian students for a BBQ.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d I texted back. All of a sudden my full-on latent maternal instincts kicked in. I could buy some cute autumn-themed paper plates and napkins for them, bake cookies. Eid! Right in my own little Jewish house. It made the giant emptiness feel suddenly, importantly, full.In the days that followed, I began to self-diagnose myself as clinically depressed. I was on sabbatical. I hardly wanted to get out of bed. What was the point of even getting up? Small tasks like doing dishes seemed monumentally hard. I realized one day I was in my pajamas at 6 p.m. But there was Reem, combing out the fleas from the cats again. Checking the soapy water dishes under the light bulbs. She was so dogged. We became co-conspirators in their demise.We watched Netflix shows together, and she told me about her family, including a cousin who was \u201cmarried off to a Saudi\u201d and had to wear a burqa and stay inside. Reem likes wearing jeans and riding her bike all around our little college town. I couldn\u2019t imagine this fate for her.The days ticked by and the fleas began noticeably receding. One morning I realized I had not gotten a single new bite in several days. The next afternoon my daughter called me from college for the first time. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, and my lonely heart inflated.\u201cHi!\u201d I tried to sound casual. \u201cHow is it going?\u201d I had been worried she might not be ready for college or might not like it.\u201cGood!\u201d she said. She liked her classes but they were challenging. She liked her roommate but she was rarely there. She liked her town and had gone to see a play. She was exploring with new friends. She thought it might be good to make a time to call once a week, and talk.She was transitioning to her life beyond high school, and yes, beyond me. This was a good, good thing.Someone had once told me parenting was the only job which, done successfully, eventually fires you. At least from the day-to-day tasks. My sadness began to lift, gently, like a dissipating fog, as I vacuumed, after dusting the rooms with flea powder a final time. I had begun thinking about going to stay with an old friend in California, to do some writing. And maybe Costa Rica, to a small lodge near the Arenal volcano.\u201cI think we did it!\u201d Reem said, seeing the bagless vacuum cleaner parked in a corner one afternoon.It was as if a strange storm had passed. I got dressed and went out for a long walk through the autumn light, which was already painting a few southern-exposed maple leaves yellow, and dappling the ground with their shadows.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Eid al-Adha. It is the Feast of Sacrifice, not the celebration that concludes the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is Eid al-Fitr.Advertisement"}

It delved into the vibrant personalities, the media circus, the racial and celebrity dynamics behind Mr. Simpson\u2019s acquittal. It wasn\u2019t a whodunit. It was a whydoyoucareaboutit.\u201cMenendez,\u201d written by Mr. Wolf\u2019s longtime associate Rene Balcer, also borrows a tabloid murder case \u2014 that of Lyle and Erik Menendez (Miles Gaston Villanueva and Gus Halper), who were convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents in 1989.But it\u2019s more mechanical and less thoughtful, lacking a larger curiosity. Its first two plodding episodes play like the opening acts of a way-too-extended episode of the original \u201cLaw & Order.\u201dThe series, beginning Tuesday, opens on a lurid, slow-motion re-creation of the shotgun murder, then shifts into police-procedural mode. (We hear our first chung-chung! sound effect twelve minutes or so in.)This means spending a lot of time with the investigators, Detective Les Zoeller (Sam Jaeger) and Detective Tom Linehan (Cliff Chamberlain) \u2014 who are so personality-free my notes distinguish them only as \u201cMustache\u201d and \u201cNo Mustache\u201d \u2014 and the brothers, who are sullen question marks.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.This just-the-facts approach worked well in the original series\u2019s hourlong investigations. In the serial \u201cMenendez,\u201d whose details are readily Googled, there\u2019s no suspense nor vivid characters to make up for it.The potentially interesting part of the story involves Erik\u2019s attorney, Leslie Abramson (Edie Falco), who must construct a defense for a client she immediately assumes is guilty. But in the attempt to balance the \u201claw\u201d and \u201corder\u201d halves of this series, she\u2019s underdeveloped, with a only few flicks at rounding out her workaholic character.Ms. Falco makes the most of what she has to work with. So do Josh Charles and Heather Graham in a side story about the affair between Erik\u2019s psychologist, Jerome Oziel, and Judalon Smyth, which led to the leak of Erik\u2019s confession in therapy. That subplot at least has some soapy verve, but it feels like it belongs in another, less buttoned-down series.There is the barest germ of an animating idea in \u201cMenendez\u201d \u2014 the wealthy buy justice and get automatic benefit of the doubt from the police \u2014 but it\u2019s perfunctory and blunt. If you\u2019re not familiar with the Menendez story already, you may wonder why it was ever such a media obsession.The missing spark is underscored in the second episode, with the brief appearance of celebrity defense attorney Robert Shapiro (Douglas Olsson). In \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d John Travolta\u2019s eccentric interpretation resembled the real Mr. Shapiro hardly at all physically, but made his aggrieved vanity unforgettable.This Mr. Shapiro looks a bit more like the real one, but he\u2019s purely functional, there to deliver a line, advance the plot and prompt a fleeting \u201cHey, it\u2019s that guy!\u201d reaction. Like everyone else in \u201cMenendez,\u201d he\u2019s a courtroom-artist\u2019s sketch who never jumps off the page.Advertisement"}

And that\u2019s gold.It\u2019s not so much that the film or Bausch have influenced other choreographers, but that \u201cPina\u201d has helped make modern dance, which can look odd out of context, more palatable for general audiences.Despite the fact that there\u2019s still great dance happening in both big and tiny spaces, audiences are dwindling. And if a movie or a television show can give modern dance a boost and make it less intimidating or alienating, then I say well done.Mr. Wenders\u2019s \u201cPina\u201d has its faults. Without Bausch\u2019s eye, the film can veer into sentimentality. As the dancers take turns sharing memories about their mentor \u2014 their voices are heard on recordings as they gaze into the camera for video portraits \u2014 they seem mannered, self-conscious. It makes me wince just as much now as it did then.Dance of any kind isn\u2019t just about a physical body performing choreography. There must be something to give it depth, so even with a conceptual work, it\u2019s right to ask: What is the underlying emotion? What is the spirit? When you can tap into that, it\u2019s as if you are listening to \u2014 and perhaps even understanding \u2014 that hidden language that Mr. Wenders tries to reveal in his film.\u201cPina\u201d shows that you don\u2019t need to be moving yourself to get something out of dancing. Bausch\u2019s primal-pedestrian approach to choreography is nothing new, but the public\u2019s willingness to accept it is. \u201cPina\u201d may not change the way the world sees contemporary dance, but it has made a crack that grows wider each year. I\u2019m grateful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018The Mayor,\u2019 Brandon Micheal Hall Raps His Way to City Hall", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 In \u201cThe Mayor,\u201d a new ABC comedy series that premieres on Oct. 3, Brandon Micheal Hall plays Courtney Rose, a struggling rapper who runs for mayor of a small Northern California town in an ill-considered scheme to get the word out about his mixtape.Free publicity, no risk of actually winning \u2014 what could go wrong? Of course, Courtney does win, much to everyone\u2019s surprise. Had Mr. Hall ever been in a similar predicament, where he chased after something he figured he had little shot at, and then got it?\u201cI\u2019m actually having that experience right now,\u201d he said.In a Cinderella story that mirrors his character\u2019s, this is Mr. Hall\u2019s first leading role in a series, and by far the biggest role of his young career. The 24-year-old actor had appeared in six episodes on the TBS series \u201cSearch Party\u201d; before that, he had appeared in single episodes as a rookie cop (on CBS\u2019s \u201cUnforgettable\u201d), another rookie cop (in the Netflix series \u201cThe Characters\u201d) and a delivery guy (on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City\u201d).\u201cFor \u2018Broad City,\u2019 I got to kiss Abbi Jacobson, so that was fun,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall has strong comedic backup on \u201cThe Mayor,\u201d most notably Lea Michele (\u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cScream Queens\u201d) as his chief of staff and Yvette Nicole Brown (\u201cCommunity\u201d) as his mother. Rounding out the cast are the relative newcomers Marcel Spears and Bernard David Jones, as Courtney\u2019s old pals turned City Hall staffers. \u201cThose are my boys,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cWe\u2019re going through this journey together, because it\u2019s new for all of us. We\u2019re like a boy band.\u201dOn a recent morning, dressed in a black T-shirt and black jeans, Mr. Hall was in the North Hollywood Diner marveling at his good fortune. The actor had been in town for only four weeks, but had already claimed this no-frills, 24-hour joint as a favorite hangout. At one point, a customer began pounding on the diner\u2019s much-abused upright piano; later, a woman chattered loudly into her cellphone about how Jesus Christ \u201cdoesn\u2019t claim to know what\u2019s going to happen in the United States.\u201d Mr. Hall was wide-eyed, taking it all in. He led me over to a framed photo of Marlon Brando and Rita Moreno, signed by Ms. Moreno; Mr. Brando is flipping off the photographer. \u201cI love this place,\u201d Mr. Hall said, beaming.\u201cBut I think without naming anyone specifically, we\u2019re going to shine a light on what\u2019s going on in our world right now,\u201d Ms. Michele said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make our points. People will know how we feel.\u201dMr. Hall was born and raised in Anderson, S.C., a small, rural town about 30 miles outside Greenville. He remembers cookouts and walking his dogs and gorgeous sunsets over fields dotted with hay barrels. It\u2019s a Confederate state, he said, with racism \u201cbled into the soil\u201d \u2014 but even so, he found the place comforting. \u201cYou go to the church your grandma went to, that your great-grandma went to,\u201d he said. He grew up in a trailer park with his mom, a preacher \u2014 \u201cmy dad wasn\u2019t in the picture growing up,\u201d he said \u2014 and his older sister Octavia.While working on that show in New York, Mr. Hall auditioned for \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d The role called for a guy who could do comedy and drama, had the star presence to headline the series, and could rap. \u201cIt\u2019s not a given you\u2019re going to find that person,\u201d said Jeremy Bronson, the show\u2019s creator and showrunner, whose previous writing and producing experience includes \u201cLate Night With Jimmy Fallon\u201d and \u201cHardball With Chris Matthews,\u201d as well as \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d \u201cBut when he walked in that room, he lit the place up.\u201dThe second season of \u201cSearch Party\u201d wrapped at 4 a.m. on a Friday; the next day, Mr. Hall was on a flight to Los Angeles to start shooting \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d After he found an apartment in Studio City, Ms. Brown took him out to Bed Bath & Beyond to stock his new place (Mr. Hall still doesn\u2019t have a car). \u201cI\u2019m his designated driver,\u201d she said.Recently, the cast was filming one of the show\u2019s first episodes at CBS Studio Center in Studio City. The onscreen scene was chaotic: there was an ongoing bus strike, protesters had taken over City Hall, and the resulting hubbub had put a crimp in \u201cWhitney Day,\u201d a celebration of all things Whitney Houston. Offstage, however, things couldn\u2019t have been lighter. The cast was having fun and cutting up; between takes, crew members played hacky sack.If there is a certain looseness on the set, that might be because there are a lot of similarities between the lead character and the actor who plays him.\u201cCourtney Rose is the kind of person who can charm his way into and out of most situations, and Brandon is that dude,\u201d Mr. Diggs said. \u201cHe\u2019s the most charismatic dude I\u2019ve ever met.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m your host, Stephen Colbert. Thank you very much. This is exciting, can you feel \u2014 this is TV\u2019s highest honors. Us, celebrating us.[LAUGHTER]Tonight we binge ourselves, can you feel it? This room is crackling with the collective energy of people who for the last 48 hours have consumed nothing but distilled water and Crest white strips.[LAUGHTER]All the nominees look so beautiful this evening. So happy. So hopeful. Just a reminder: If you do win, don\u2019t forget to thank everyone who helped you get up here, mainly \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for not being eligible this year. Now personally, I have to take a moment here to thank CBS chairman Leslie Moonves. I literally have to thank him, it\u2019s in my contract.[LAUGHTER]Unfortunately, Les cannot be here tonight to receive my gratitude, so I accept it on his behalf. We did it.[LAUGHTER]But while we\u2019re thanking people, nobody deserves more thanks right now than our first responders.[APPLAUSE]They have been working tirelessly following the disasters in Texas and Florida. And we have to thank also the friends who showed up with the food. The neighbors with boats, the nuns with chain saws, the complete strangers who stepped up to help rebuild. And if you haven\u2019t donated to hurricane relief yet, you still can by going to handinhand2017.com and giving generously. I believe Billy Eichner is still standing by to take your call. How is it going, Billy?::CUTS TO BILLY EICHNER IN THE AUDIENCE HOLDING A PHONE::EICHNER: Stephen, I\u2019m on the phone, please. Don\u2019t embarrass me in front of Louie Anderson. Oh, they just hung up.::CAMERA PANS TO LOUIE ANDERSON SITTING JUST SEATS AWAY::COLBERT: I apologize to all of you. Well, what a year it has been for television. I mean the industry is booming. There were over 450 original scripted shows made this year. Of course, there is no way anyone could possibly watch that much TV other than the president, who seems to have a lot of time for that sort of thing. Hello, sir, thank you for joining us.[LAUGHTER]Looking forward to the tweets. And there have never been more platforms to get your TV than right now. You have broadcast. You have cable. You have Amazon. You have YouTube, Hulu, Voodoo, Netflix, Vitamix. You have Vimeo. You have Twitch, you have Crackle. Cruncho. Bumble. Twerk. Glorp. Flurp.Uber. Eyeball. and DintyMooreStew.com.

Rumor is Liev Schreiber is playing a brooding chunk of meat.Yes, just like that but with carrots and potatoes around him.[LAUGHTER]Of course, these days everybody loves streaming video. Just ask Ted Cruz.[LAUGHTER]But knock first. You don\u2019t want to just walk in.[LAUGHTER]Netflix alone raked in 92 Emmy nominations this year.[APPLAUSE]Yes, sure. Why not? And may I remind you, five years ago their hottest show was a scratched DVD of \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d?[LAUGHTER]Now we\u2019ve got amazing shows like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Millie Bobby Brown is here tonight.[APPLAUSE]She\u2019s amazing in that show, proving once and for all that there are roles in Hollywood for women over 12.[LAUGHTER]Of course, premium cable still has a ton of great shows. I am sure HBO will take home a lot of Emmys tonight, which they\u2019ll have to melt down to pay for next year\u2019s hacker ransom.[LAUGHTER]Too soon?[LAUGHTER]Broadcast TV also had its triumph this year. Remember broadcast? The TV O.G., where it started? Broadcast TV is breaking new ground. In fact, this season, CBS will have twice as many Sheldons as any other network in history.Many of this year\u2019s best TV shows are available to stream immediately. Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where.[LAUGHTER]All the broadcast networks have put out great shows this past year. Like \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d(applause)Incredible. But seriously, Milo, you are going to die this season, right? Just give us a hint. Do you slip in a bathtub? Is it bad clams? Are you mauled by a circus lion in a convenience store? What happens? I\u2019m just saying: Your fans want to see you dead.[LAUGHTER]It\u2019s a compliment. And this has been a great era for diversity in television. In fact, for the third year in a row this is the most diverse group of nominees in Emmy history.[APPLAUSE]That\u2019s impressive. I did not know you could applaud while patting yourself on the back at the same time. Well done. Lovely job. And there\u2019s so many talented African-American nominees. Jeffrey Wright. Viola Davis. Samira Wiley. Uzo Aduba. Anthony Anderson from ABC\u2019s \u201cblack-ish.\u201d[APPLAUSE]And of course Bill Maher. I assume he\u2019s black since he\u2019s so comfortable using the \u201cN\u201d word. I don\u2019t know. Good night, that\u2019s my time, everybody.[LAUGHTER]There are so many stars here tonight. Oprah, Oprah is in the front row right now.[APPLAUSE]Yeah. Oprah was snubbed this year. What is wrong with you people? What in \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\u201d is wrong with you people? I\u2019m so sorry, Oprah, I was really hoping this would be your breakout year.Hopefully next year you will have a better seat. I\u2019m sorry.[LAUGHTER]But if we\u2019re honest with ourselves \u2014 and as artists, I think we have to be honest with ourselves \u2014 we know that the biggest TV star of the last year is Donald Trump. Yeah. No, you may not like it but he\u2019s the biggest star. You know, and Alec Baldwin, obviously, you know.[APPLAUSE]You guys are neck and neck. And Alec, you\u2019re up against a lot of neck. And however you feel about the president, and you do feel about the president, you can\u2019t deny that every show was influenced by Donald Trump in some way. All the late-night shows, obviously.\u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the new season of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d and of course next year\u2019s Latin Grammys, hosted by Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Muy Caliente.[LAUGHTER]And we all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump. Because he was nominated multiple times for \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d but he never won. Why didn\u2019t you give him an Emmy? I tell you this. If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn\u2019t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You like Walter White. He\u2019s just Walter Much Whiter. And he never forgave you and he never will. The president has complained repeatedly that the Emmys are rigged. He even went after the host a few years back tweeting, \u201cThat Seth Meyers is hosting the Emmy Awards is a total joke. He is very awkward with almost no talent. Marbles in his mouth.\u201d Wow, marbles in his mouth. That\u2019s harsh.[LAUGHTER]That\u2019s quite an accusation, any response, Seth?::CUTS TO SETH MEYERS IN THE AUDIENCE WITH MARBLES FALLING OUT OF HIS MOUTH::[LAUGHTER]And even during the campaign, Trump would not let it go. This actually happened. This exchange actually happened in the debate.::CUTS TO VIDEO OF HILLARY CLINTON AND MR. TRUMP AT A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE::CLINTON: There was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged again.TRUMP: Should have gotten it.::END TAPE::COLBERT: But he didn\u2019t. Because unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.[LAUGHTER]Where do I find the courage to tell that joke in this room?Of course, what really matters to Donald Trump is ratings. You\u2019ve got to have the big numbers. And I certainly hope we achieved that tonight. Unfortunately, at this point, we have no way of knowing how big our audience is. I mean is there anyone who can say how big the audience is? Sean, do you know?::SEAN SPICER ROLLS OUT ON A PODIUM::SEAN SPICER: This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period.

Her father (Kompheak Phoeung) is a captain in the military police. A moment in which Loung reaches for the sky, trying to touch a helicopter overhead, recalls Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cEmpire of the Sun,\u201d a movie that, with its child\u2019s-eye view of war as a time of horror and wonder, might well have served as a template.The screenplay \u2014 Ms. Jolie and Ms. Ung are credited as a writing team \u2014 manages the tricky task of providing enough information to push the film along while only rarely straying beyond what a child might comprehend. Loung soon discovers that she and her family, with whom she\u2019s been forced to evacuate the capital, won\u2019t be returning home after the promised three days. She learns that she will work in service of Angkar (the name for the Khmer Rouge leadership); surrender personal property (foreign goods, in particular, are seen as symbols of an imperialist agenda); and be separated piecemeal from her parents and siblings.The most simultaneously stunning and appalling shot shows a high-angle view of Loung treading carefully through a mine-strewn forest as another woman runs through it \u2014 only to step on a mine and be killed.

What was unexpected was the potential for additional scrutiny of whether Fox would uphold broadcasting standards in Britain.On Tuesday, Ms. Bradley said that concerns about public interest and corporate governance issues warranted further investigation.An in-depth inquiry could take up to six months and would further delay the proposed transaction. That would be a setback for Mr. Murdoch, who founded the satellite broadcaster in the early 1990s and has long sought total ownership of it.An acquisition of Sky would give 21st Century Fox control of a Pan-European satellite network and rights to additional content, including broadcasts of English Premier League and other soccer leagues in parts of Europe.In a statement on Tuesday, 21st Century Fox expressed disappointment with the decision and the drawn-out regulatory review process.\u201cWe are surprised that after independent regulatory scrutiny and advice, and over four months to examine the case, the Secretary of State is still unable to form an opinion,\u201d the company said, referring to Ms. Bradley. \u201cWe urge the Secretary of State to take a final decision quickly.\u201dThe company noted that Ofcom had already undertaken \u201ca robust and rigorous review\u201d before concluding that 21st Century Fox was committed to the country\u2019s broadcasting standards.\u201cWe are therefore disappointed that the Secretary of State has chosen not to follow the unequivocal advice of the independent regulator, which is the expert body tasked with enforcing the Broadcast Code,\u201d 21st Century Fox said in a statement.The company said it anticipated that the deal would close by June 30, 2018, absent further delays.But the merger has drawn significant scrutiny in Britain, where Mr. Murdoch remains a divisive figure.A previous bid for Sky was withdrawn in 2011 after a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain, which engulfed Mr. Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper division.Fox said at the time that it had made concessions to address those concerns, but the British government said the remedies did not go far enough.Analysts had long anticipated a move by 21st Century Fox to gain full control of Sky as media companies seek to grow, control more content and distribute that content directly to customers in hopes of keeping pace with companies like Netflix and Amazon. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201dBut 21st Century Fox has struggled to move past the sexual harassment scandal.Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for several current and former Fox News employees who made sexual and racial harassment complaints against the network, has alerted British regulators about the details of those cases in the past several months. He said he was pleased that Ms. Bradley was leaning toward calling for a more thorough review.\u201cThere is a lot that they still can find out, especially with respect to people who are bound by confidentiality,\u201d Mr. Wigdor said. \u201cHopefully, they will take steps to get Fox to waive those so that other people can speak and that the government can make a determination as to whether they meet broadcasting standards with a full set of facts.\u201dEmily Steel contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.To paraphrase Sarah Lynn, the debauched child star who appeared alongside BoJack in the \u201980s sitcom \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around\u201d: that\u2019s too much to expect, man. The 12 episodes of the new season have episodes and moments equal to the show\u2019s best. They also have ideas that don\u2019t pan out, and an overall lack of cohesion \u2014 the main characters seem sequestered in separate story lines that don\u2019t really mesh. A weekend binge is still recommended, but it won\u2019t have the impact of the second or third seasons.For the uninitiated, \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is set in Hollywoo \u2014 so called since the D in the Hollywood sign was destroyed in Season 1 \u2014 and in a world where animals and humans coexist without comment. Ineffably silly animal jokes remain one of the show\u2019s chief pleasures. In the opening episode, the sassy bovine waitress at the Silver Spoon Diner announces, \u201cThis cow likes getting tipped.\u201dThere are changes, though. In previous seasons, as BoJack (Will Arnett) worked through his demons \u2014 the addictions and depression brought on by being best known for an inane, long-off-the-air sitcom \u2014 the plots were almost always organic to the entertainment industry. That\u2019s less true this time.In the most glaring example, a major story line has the dog actor Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins) running for governor of California, a development that doesn\u2019t exactly parallel the political rise of President Trump \u2014 Mr. Peanutbutter succeeds because of his cuddly likability \u2014 but is clearly inspired by it. \u201cEven though I have zero qualifications,\u201d the dog laments after an early setback, \u201cI honestly thought I would have been a better governor.\u201dWhile the topical jokes are funny enough, the plot feels forced, serving primarily as a vehicle for the marital tensions of Mr. Peanutbutter and his human wife, Diane (Alison Brie). Also forced is a running gag about Todd (Aaron Paul), BoJack\u2019s accidentally entrepreneurial slacker friend, creating a pediatric dental service staffed by clowns.BoJack, meanwhile, is less present than usual in his own show, and shares little screen time with his soul mate, Diane. Self exiled from Hollywoo when the season starts, he eventually returns in a season-long plot exploring his troubled family history (full of elaborate flashbacks) and his relationship to a potential new family member.Advertisement"}

British and European producers are a growing presence in American TV; Asian, not so much.\u2022 It\u2019s ridiculously easy to binge.

Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where. Tell us what mood you\u2019re in or what services you subscribe to and we\u2019ll help you out.That\u2019s probably about the right amount of time to devote to \u201cNeo Yokio.\u201d There\u2019s a fair bit of international pop-cultural cross-pollination taking place in the show, and there\u2019s pleasure in picking out the references. It will be a limited pleasure for many (if they feel it at all), but for the fan of this sort of thing, it will be sufficient.The show takes place in an everyday New York \u2014 the Guggenheim Museum, San Remo apartments, Midtown hot-dog carts \u2014 with some major differences. The city is underwater below 14th Street, as is much of Tokyo in the classic anime series \u201cNeon Genesis Evangelion,\u201d one of the many shows to which \u201cNeo Yokio\u201d pays homage.This submersion (only the Twin Towers peek above the waves) is presumably linked to demonic attacks the city began to suffer in the 18th century; the supernatural warfare, and a subtly archaic, courtly atmosphere, are also familiar from Japanese cartoons.Mr. Smith voices Kaz, a floppy-haired emo boy who happens to be a \u201cmagistocrat,\u201d part of a family endowed with demon-slaying powers. This gives him status \u2014 he\u2019s No. 2 on a leader board of the city\u2019s bachelors displayed above Times Square \u2014 but he\u2019s neo-riche, patronized as a \u201crat catcher\u201d by the old-money types he protects. And his job keeps getting in the way of his social life.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.The show derives a lot of its humor from Kaz\u2019s earnest attempts to belong, which occasion some reasonably subtle mockery of the city\u2019s social stratification and of a certain strain of tragic millennial mopiness. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s just a place for the children of the elite to socialize,\u201d he says, visiting his old prep school. \u201cBut I believe it\u2019s a place for the children of the elite to learn and grow.\u201dTold that the day\u2019s special at an uptown restaurant is squid ink fettuccine, he says approvingly, \u201cThat is the most melancholy pasta.\u201d (Actually, that sounds like something Mr. Smith might have ad-libbed.)The show\u2019s visual grounding in a simple, fluid style of anime is guaranteed by the involvement of two established Japanese production houses: Production I.G. (known for the various \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d TV series) and Studio Deen (\u201cRanma \u00bd,\u201d \u201cRurouni Kenshin\u201d).Here\u2019s a test: if a defensive reading of the line, \u201cYes, my girlfriend broke up with me to take a finance job in San Francisco,\u201d makes you chuckle, \u201cNeo Yokio\u201d may be for you.Advertisement"}

And \u201cVeep\u201d won for best comedy, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus winning best actress in a comedy.LOS ANGELES \u2014 It was inevitable that a streaming service would win an Emmy for best drama at some point. But no one expected Hulu to get there first.As the producers and cast gathered onstage to accept the award, they were joined by Ms. Atwood, who received a rousing ovation.The show\u2019s feature players swept the supporting comedy acting awards, with acting wins from Alec Baldwin, for his portrayal of President Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who played Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Jeff Sessions (among other characters).60 PhotosThe win by \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d is a blow to Netflix, which spent millions marketing its shows before Emmy voters, and once again fell short of winning best drama despite the fact it claimed nearly half of the nominated shows in the category.Here are the highlights from Sunday\u2019s ceremony:After pummeling President Trump nearly every week and scoring some of its highest ratings in years, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d took home several prestigious awards, including for best variety sketch show.Accepting that Emmy, the longtime executive producer of \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d Lorne Michaels, said that he thought the show would never have a season as \u201ccrazy, as unpredictable, as frightening, as exhausting or as exhilarating\u201c as the show\u2019s first in the mid-70s.\u201cTurns out I was wrong,\u201d he said.Mr. Baldwin, as expected, won as best supporting actor in a comedy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump. \u201cI suppose I should just say, at long last Mr. President, here\u2019s your Emmy,\u201d he quipped.Ms. McKinnon repeated as best supporting actress in a comedy. This NBC late-night show had already swept the two best guest actor categories at the Creative Arts Emmys (one for Melissa McCarthy and another for Dave Chappelle).Don Roy King added another award for \u201cS.N.L.\u201d later in the show, winning for best direction of a variety series.Mr. Colbert had been riding an anti-Trump wave all year to unanticipated ratings gold, and it was no different for his opening monologue Sunday. He spent a good chunk of his monologue talking about the president, declaring Mr. Trump the biggest story in TV last year, and spoofing Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to win an Emmy during his years as host of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u2019\u2019\u201cUnlike the presidency,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Colbert said, \u201cEmmys go to the winner of the popular vote.\u2019\u2019Of course, there is a risk in going political at an event that\u2019s supposed to celebrate television. The Emmys have set ratings lows for two consecutive years, and there are plenty of viewers out there who do not want to be lectured by Mr. Colbert or anyone from Hollywood about President Trump. And, from the opposite side of the political spectrum, there were many on social media who expressed anger Sunday night at what they saw as an attempted redemption of Mr. Spicer.Julia Louis-Dreyfus coming to the Emmys stage and collecting yet another trophy? Show us something we haven\u2019t seen.But this year, she made history.With Ms. Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s win for best actress in a comedy for her performance as Selina Meyer in \u201cVeep,\u201d she tied Cloris Leachman\u2019s record for eight prime-time acting Emmys. She also set the record for the number of wins by an actor playing one character, breaking a tie with Candice Bergen (\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d) and Don Knotts (\u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d).Holding a sheet of paper, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus declared her character (who has gone from vice president, to president, to ex-president over the last six seasons) as the \u201crole of a lifetime and an adventure of utter joy.\u201dContinuing the political comedy, Ms. Dreyfus added: \u201cWe did have a whole story line about impeachment but we abandoned it because we were worried that someone else might get to that first.\u201d\u201cVeep\u201d also won best comedy for a third year in a row, holding off significant competition from \u201cAtlanta.\u201d Mr. Glover, the star and creator of the \u201cAtlanta,\u201d won the Emmys for best actor and best director in the category.The good news for the competition? \u201cVeep\u201d will wrap up next year.As movie stars and audiences gravitate to limited series, this category has gone from a wasteland to arguably the most intriguing.Nicole Kidman won her first Emmy, for best actress in a limited series for her portrayal of an abused wife in \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d and she had some intense competition. Four Oscar winners were nominated in the category, including Ms. Kidman, Reese Witherspoon (\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d) and Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange (\u201cFeud\u201d).\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible year for women in television,\u201d said Ms. Witherspoon, an executive producer of \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d Ms. Kidman called for \u201cmore great roles for women.\u201d Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard won supporting acting awards, and Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e won for best director in a limited series, rounding out a dominant showing from \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201dRiz Ahmed won best actor in a movie or limited series for his breakout role in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of.\u201d And Netflix won best TV movie for \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201dHBO took home the most Emmys for the 16th straight year, winning 29, compared with Netflix\u2019s 20.HBO\u2019s triumph capped a year when TV networks took Emmys campaigning to a new level, spending millions to market shows before nominations were handed out.But there was no player more ostentatious than Netflix. The streaming service opened up its own 24,000-square-foot event space this spring, holding nearly daily parties to put potential Emmy voters in front of talent, free dinners and an open bar.Nevertheless, the result was the same: The streaming service went home empty-handed in the major acting awards and for best drama and comedy.An earlier version of a mobile summary for this article misspelled the given name of the actress who won the Emmy for best lead actress in a drama. As the article correctly notes, she is Elisabeth Moss, not Elizabeth.slide showAdvertisement"}

Standard-definition videos are less expensive to buy, often by about $5, and $1 or $2 less to rent in some online stores. Certain devices cannot fully display HD video anyway because the screens lack the needed resolution or the hardware is not compatible. (Some files may automatically download in standard definition anyway depending on the device you are using.)Because they contain more data, downloaded HD videos need more bandwidth to stream and, when downloaded, take up more space on your device. For example, the 720p HD version of \u201cThe Martian\u201d in Apple\u2019s iTunes Store is a 5.36-gigabyte file, while the SD edition weighs in at 2.54 gigabytes. If you are downloading a movie to a mobile device to watch offline, the SD edition is a space saver. If you plan to watch the movie on a high-definition television or high-resolution computer monitor, though, SD video can look flatter and less vibrant than the HD version.Advertisement"}

Today, however, thanks to the demands of millennials and their Gen Z counterparts, whose interest in personalized goods far exceeds that of their elders, the industry has realized it needs to make customization more readily available.\u201cMillennials were taught they were special and unique \u2014 the snowflake generation,\u201d said MaryLeigh Bliss, chief content officer at YPulse, a New York-based youth research firm. \u201cThat value of uniqueness as something to be embraced was instilled in them very young.\u201dAlthough luxury watchmakers probably would bristle at the suggestion that they share common ground with the fast-food chain Chipotle, there\u2019s no denying that the build-a-watch concept is growing.At the Baselworld watch and jewelry fair in March, Bulgari introduced its first customizable model, one of the house\u2019s Serpenti watch styles for women. Components including the case metal, dial color and strap can be chosen online, and customers can pick up the finished products at local Bulgari boutiques.\u201cOnce a combination is created, it is unique and not replicable by anyone else,\u201d said Domenico Oliveri, chief executive of Fendi Timepieces, a division of the Italian fashion house.Watchmakers in the luxury space are hardly the only ones to recognize the importance of customization. All Shinola stores \u2014 including the American brand\u2019s SoHo boutique that opened in New York in June \u2014 feature the Willard Bar, a spot where customers can choose watch cases, straps and buckles.Named for Willard Bixby, one of the founders of the shoe polish brand that inspired Shinola\u2019s name, the bar is designed to be \u201can environment in which you can really engage with the Shinola store team while you\u2019re having a Shinola Cola and listening to records on the Shinola turntable,\u201d Jacques Panis, the company\u2019s president, said. \u201cAfter you get your watch put together, you can go right around the corner to the embossing station and get your initials or symbol put into the strap.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mix rose gold and yellow gold on a watch, but some people would,\u201d Mr. Caruana said in June, when he introduced the line to American retail buyers at the JCK Las Vegas jewelry trade show. \u201cAnd those people should have that choice.\u201dAesthetic modifications, however, are only the half of it.\u201cOriginally it was a stopwatch and we changed the function to a light delivery system,\u201d Mr. Waite said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from being watch artisans to actual watchmakers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Library Cards Unlock Film Vaults", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingA few years ago, back when video rental stores were still around but clearly an endangered species (Tower Records had shut down, Blockbuster was in trouble and Netflix was still dealing in DVDs), I was chatting with a friend, a fellow cinephile experiencing an economic downturn. (As it happened, he had worked for Tower.) It was difficult to keep up with classic releases on home video, particularly stuff from the Criterion Collection, he said, but fortunately for him titles would eventually turn up at his local public library. And he didn\u2019t have to wait long for them either, since few people in his New Jersey town (which had once been mine) were keen on art or foreign films.People lucky enough to have a good amount of disposable income (or bad enough at managing money) don\u2019t often think of the library as a home entertainment option. Yet I know a lot of people who have Netflix, Amazon Prime or cable with a lot of premium channels, who will balk at shelling out an extra six or seven or eight bucks a month for a more curated movie streaming service. For them, there is a solution, and all they need is their library card.The service is also free if you are affiliated with a college or university, either as a professor or a student. Kanopy, which is accessible as an app on Roku and Android and iOS devices, and as a website, is available to 477 public libraries and 1,424 learning institutions across the United States.Kanopy\u2019s offerings vary depending on where you live. Some collections and some titles may not be available at all; some may be available to an education-affiliated account but not to a public library-affiliated account. The New York Public Library version of the service offers 420 movies from the Criterion Collection\u2019s deep library of international classics (from directors including Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin) and contemporary art house films.Kanopy works like a standard paid streaming service, with limitations. Just as when you take a book out from the library and have a circumscribed amount of time to keep it, so it is with the movies here. Once you press \u201cplay\u201d on a given movie, you have three days to watch it, as many times as you like, which uses up one play credit. The number of play credits for each user is determined by the library to which the membership is attached, not by the service. The New York Public Library offers Kanopy users 10 play credits a month. (Members affiliated with educational institutions get unlimited plays.)Scrolling down the home page of the app version is awe-inspiring. In horizontal rows, 18 categories are presented, beginning with Criterion films. The others include \u201cPopular Documentaries,\u201d \u201cIndependent Films,\u201d \u201cWorld Cinema,\u201d \u201cStaff Picks,\u201d \u201cAudience Picks,\u201d \u201cNew York Times Critics\u2019 Picks\u201d and my favorite, \u201cFilms Starring Actors From \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s a fair amount of cross-categorization \u2014 you have to scroll far into \u201cClassic Cinema\u201d before you find a non-Criterion title. I was struck, and not in a bad way, by the occasional randomness of the selection. The unsophisticated but often laugh-out-loud funny 1977 anthology comedy \u201cKentucky Fried Movie\u201d is here. As is the underrated 2000 prison drama \u201cAnimal Factory,\u201d directed by Steve Buscemi and starring Willem Dafoe. As is \u201cBoondock Saints,\u201d an elaborate 1999 boondoggle of a crime picture that has somehow managed to attract a cult, also starring Mr. Dafoe.In a phone interview, I asked Olivia Humphrey, Kanopy\u2019s founder and chief executive, about such results. Many of the titles on the site are added via a \u201csearch and find\u201d feature. College professors who need particular movies to assign to their students request titles, and Kanopy looks for them and tries to secure licensing rights.Licensing movies is a byzantine business. I know of an independent DVD label owner whose inquiries into various obscure and hard-to-find titles in studio vaults was met with the response that the films were of such low priority that it wasn\u2019t even worth it to do the paperwork to create an agreement. Ms. Humphrey told me that Kanopy had about 40 percent success with its searches, which is impressive, all things considered. \u201cAnd yes, the challenge is usually not in finding the movie but in acquiring the rights,\u201d she said. (I inferred from our chat that the presence of the two wildly disparate Dafoe films might have been because of some American academic researching the actor\u2019s work.)The site is a library vendor, not a nonprofit, and it splits revenues 50-50 with its licensees. This encourages the licensee to keep the movie on Kanopy for a long time, as it can yield a steady revenue stream. \u201cWe like to have full transparency with our licensees,\u201d Ms. Humphrey said. \u201cThey are able to log on at any time and see how their titles are doing.\u201dShe began the company in her native Australia in 2008. \u201cMy background was in film studios there,\u201d she explained. \u201cI became aware that universities that wanted to add film to their core curriculum had very little available in terms of resources. I saw college libraries with dusty DVDs and 16-millimeter cans on their shelves, so I wanted to create a way to address that.\u201d She moved the company\u2019s headquarters to the United States about four years ago, \u201cmainly because the interest we were getting was largely from American institutions.\u201dMs. Humphrey is gratified by how the site has been growing, and she sees Kanopy\u2019s role in the academic world as going substantially beyond providing course resources: \u201cAt this time in their lives young people are challenging assumptions, and we try to stay relevant by offering material related to that.\u201d She cites issues of identity as crucial to students, and points out \u201cwe have a lot of movies that address that.\u201d As a cinephile herself, she is fervent about spreading the love. \u201cI like to think of a whole world of other students, not enrolled in film school, watching Criterion titles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopefully encouraging them to press \u2018play\u2019 on movies they have never heard of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But its sharp-edged humor and stereotypes may feel out of step in the identity politics age.Supported byUNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. \u2014 Eleven years after parting ways, seemingly forever, the \u201cWill & Grace\u201d gang \u2014 same cast, same writers, same studio audience warm-up guy \u2014 reunited on the NBCUniversal lot here in mid-August. As they started work on 29 new episodes, Sean Hayes, returning to his role as the overly dramatic Jack, belted out a song from \u201cDreamgirls.\u201d Megan Mullally, who plays Karen, did a little dance and shouted, \u201cSass is in the house!\u201d\u201cThat really is the big question,\u201d Mr. Mutchnick said, crossing his arms.\u201cWill & Grace\u201d pushed well past the broadcast network comfort zone when it arrived with a finger snap in 1998. The show\u2019s framework was familiar \u2014 \u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d with twists \u2014 but its focus on gay characters was not. Being gay on TV was considered so taboo that \u201cWill & Grace\u201d writers waited until the second season to risk including a (modest) same-sex kiss.How will swishy, stereotypical Jack go over? That character, however hilarious, made some viewers wince the first time around. Mr. McCormack is straight. Will the fact that he\u2019s reprising his role earn him a pass from those who think gay characters should only be played by gay actors?\u201cI would imagine that there will probably be a bit more blowback,\u201d Mr. Kohan said of the show\u2019s politically incorrect humor. \u201cBut saying the most un-P.C. things has always been part of what makes the show funny, so I\u2019m hoping we get away with it.\u201dMr. Mutchnick added that he hoped that the show\u2019s pre-existing fan base, \u201cgrandfathers us in to a lot of forgiveness.\u201d\u201cWill & Grace\u201d \u2014 a throwback to an era when razzmatazz, laugh-track sitcoms had not yet been supplanted by single-camera comedies tailored for millennial tastes \u2014 was revived in a roundabout way. A few months before last year\u2019s presidential election, Mr. Mutchnick sent an email to his former cast members that said in part, \u201cThis monster must be stopped.\u201d He was referring to Donald J. Trump. Would they reprise their sitcom characters to make a get-out-the-vote video? Forty minutes later, he had four yeses.\u201cNext, we\u2019ll be doing a geriatric version,\u201d Ms. Messing said, sitting backstage between scenes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 2.0 except set in Boca and everyone will have bamboo purses.\u201d She added in a serious tone, \u201cI actually shouldn\u2019t say that too loud. He\u2019ll have us signing contracts in blood.\u201dNot everyone is hankering for more \u201cWill & Grace.\u201dMr. Greenblatt said \u201cWill & Grace\u201d stands apart, though, because all four of the original leads are back and because they rather miraculously seem not to have aged. (It\u2019s true. They\u2019re freaks of nature.)\u201cIt\u2019s literally the old show,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said.Indeed, the formula that made the show a smash hit and Emmy-winning machine the first time around is unchanged. The writers have decided to pretend that the 2006 finale, which found Will and Grace married (not to each other) with kids, never happened. Will and Grace are back to being single and living together. Jack still bursts through doors without knocking. Karen, still giggling about popping pills, sidles over from her mansion from time to time.Camped in his dressing room, Mr. McCormack said that he saw the back-to-basics setup \u2014 Will and Grace as roommates, even while pushing 50 \u2014 as perfectly plausible. \u201cIt\u2019s actually something kind of wonderful, and I think it will start a discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s people in midlife saying, \u2018Hey, wait. I\u2019ve tried, but I still haven\u2019t found anything better than this.\u2019\u201d\u201cNobody is coming back to this show with their tail between their legs,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has been sitting around waiting for someone to employ them \u2014 \u2018please, please, revive my old show.\u2019 Not one of us.\u201d\u201cRemember how we used to hate Camilla Parker Bowles?\u201d Will asks Grace in the third episode.\u201cWe were young,\u201d she answers. \u201cWe rushed judgment.\u201dSome episodes will deal squarely with aging. \u201cJack and Will are dealing with the fact that they\u2019re not 30 anymore,\u201d Mr. Kohan said. \u201cThere is real emotion there, whether it is anxiety or sadness or fear, which makes it really powerful. And they deal with it, of course, in absurd ways.\u201dKaren, on the other hand, has not changed for the better. \u201cShe\u2019s the same but worse,\u201d Ms. Mullally said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t tell you how fun that is. Some actors spend their lives desperately trying to distance themselves from their sitcom characters. I\u2019ll play Karen until I die if they let me.\u201dMs. Mullally said that Karen will be the one making most of the show\u2019s Trump commentary, albeit by accident. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving it to the character who is best friends with Donnie and Melania to inadvertently be the one delivering the most vicious jabs,\u201d Ms. Mullally said.There won\u2019t be too much of a political undercurrent, though. \u201cLittle doses,\u201d Ms. Mullally said. \u201cYou can\u2019t write anything too specific because \u2014 honey! \u2014 by the time it airs Trump will have done 10 other horrible things.\u201dToo much Trump bashing could also prove problematic in the ratings. NBC has plenty of affiliates in moderate areas of the country. The pass-me-the-remote masses are unlikely to want a civics lecture in the form of a sitcom.In other words, expect Glaad officials, for instance, to focus on the big picture where the revival of \u201cWill & Grace\u201d is concerned. So what if the feminine Jack is a stereotype?\u201cWe can dissect specific characters until the cows come home,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, chief executive of that media-focused advocacy group. \u201cWhat we know for sure is that this series had a profoundly positive impact on the culture during its original run, and we need its help again. LGBTQ acceptance is slipping in this culture, and hate crimes are on the rise.\u201d(For his part, Mr. Hayes said anyone miffed about Jack should get a grip.) \u201cI am a gay guy, and I act like Jack in real life sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what? I find Jack\u2019s level of gay to be a ridiculous subject to discuss. How can you be too gay?\u201dNot up for debate is how much fun the reunited \u201cWill & Grace\u201d family seems to be having. When it came time to tape the third episode of the new season, they bounded on stage and started hopping up and down as Cher\u2019s 1998 dance hit \u201cBelieve\u201d boomed on the sound system. Even Ms. Messing\u2019s back seemed to be in better shape, having had five days to heal. The studio audience roared its approval.As did the bevy of NBC executives who had gathered on the Stage 22 sidelines. Mr. Greenblatt was there snacking on a bagel. Nearby, Jennifer Salke, president of NBC Entertainment, stood laughing as Mr. Hayes, between takes, grandstanded for the audience. \u201cA high-maintenance actor needs a water!\u201d he shouted. \u201cIn five seconds! Or it\u2019s somebody\u2019s job!\u201dAs taping resumed, Mr. Greenblatt beamed.\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Attacked by Rotten Tomatoes", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood had a horrible summer.Between the first weekend in May and Labor Day, a sequel-stuffed period that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales, box office revenue in North America totaled $3.8 billion, a 15 percent decline from the same span last year. To find a slower summer, you would have to go back 20 years. Business has been so bad that America\u2019s three biggest theater chains have lost roughly $4 billion in market value since May.Ready for the truly alarming part? Hollywood is blaming a website: Rotten Tomatoes.\u201cI think it\u2019s the destruction of our business,\u201d Brett Ratner, the director, producer and film financier, said at a film festival this year.Some studio executives privately concede that a few recent movies \u2014 just a few \u2014 were simply bad. Flawed marketing may have played a role in a couple of other instances, they acknowledged, along with competition from Netflix and Amazon.But most studio fingers point toward Rotten Tomatoes, which boils down hundreds of reviews to give films \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201crotten\u201d scores on its Tomatometer. The site has surged in popularity, attracting 13.6 million unique visitors in May, a 32 percent increase above last year\u2019s total for the month, according to the analytics firm comScore.Studio executives\u2019 complaints about Rotten Tomatoes include the way its Tomatometer hacks off critical nuance, the site\u2019s seemingly loose definition of who qualifies as a critic and the spread of Tomatometer scores across the web. Last year, scores started appearing on Fandango, the online movie ticket-selling site, leading to grousing that a rotten score next to the purchase button was the same as posting this message: You are an idiot if you pay to see this movie.Mr. Ratner\u2019s sentiment was echoed almost daily in studio dining rooms all summer, although not for attribution, for fear of giving Rotten Tomatoes more credibility. Over lunch last month, the chief executive of a major movie company looked me in the eye and declared flatly that his mission was to destroy the review-aggregation site.How did a clunky website that has been around for 19 years amass such power?The 36 people who work for Rotten Tomatoes hardly seem like industry killers. The site\u2019s staff occupies a relatively ordinary Beverly Hills office complex \u2014 albeit one with conference rooms named \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cOz\u201d \u2014 and includes people like Jeff Voris, an easygoing former Disney executive with graying hair who oversees operations, and Timothy Ryan, a former newspaper reporter who is a Rotten Tomatoes senior editor and lists \u201cLeonard Maltin\u2019s Movie Guide\u201d as favorite reading.The employee with the pink mohawk is Grae Drake, senior movie editor. She does a lot of video interviews and lately has been helping to fill a void created when Matt Atchity left as editor in chief in July for a bigger job at TYT Network, an online video company.Jeff Giles, a 12-year Rotten Tomatoes veteran and the author of books like \u201cLlanview in the Afternoon: An Oral History of \u2018One Life to Live\u2019,\u201d writes what the site calls Critics Consensus, a one-sentence summary of the response to each film. (Disney\u2019s latest \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie was summarized as proving \u201cthat neither a change in directors nor an undead Javier Bardem is enough to drain this sinking franchise\u2019s murky bilge.\u201d)\u201cEveryone here sweats the details every day,\u201d said Paul Yanover, the president of Fandango, which owns Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cBecause we are serious movie fans ourselves, our priority \u2014 our entire focus \u2014 is being as useful to fans as we absolutely can be.\u201dHold on a minute. Fandango?Mr. Yanover said it was silly for studios to make Rotten Tomatoes a box office scapegoat.\u201cThere is no question that there is some correlation to box office performance \u2014 critics matter \u2014 but I don\u2019t think Rotten Tomatoes can definitively make or break a movie in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who says otherwise is cherry-picking examples to create a hypothesis.\u201dHe cited \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d which was the No. 1 movie of the summer, with $410 million in ticket sales. It was undoubtedly helped by a strong Tomatometer score of 92. \u201cDunkirk,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d all received high scores and drew huge crowds. Other films did not do well on the Tomatometer (\u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard,\u201d \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d) but still managed to find audiences.Some filmmakers complain bitterly that Rotten Tomatoes casts too wide a critical net. The site says it works with some 3,000 critics worldwide, including bloggers and YouTube-based pundits. But should reviewers from Screen Junkies and Punch Drunk Critics really be treated as the equals of those from The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker?For the studios, the question of how individual reviews get classified as fresh or rotten is also a point of contention. Only about half of critics self-submit reviews and classifications to the site. Rotten Tomatoes staffers comb the web and pull the other half themselves. They then assign positive or negative grades.\u201cWe have a well-defined process,\u201d said Mr. Voris, the vice president of Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cOur curators audit each other\u2019s work. If there is any question about how a review should be classified, we have three curators separate and do independent reads. If there still isn\u2019t agreement, we call the journalist.\u201dStaff members also fact-check what critics have self-submitted. In one recent instance, a review of \u201cAlien: Covenant\u201d that was submitted as fresh seemed rotten. The site reversed the categorization after contacting the critic for clarification.Mr. Voris brushed aside the studios\u2019 protests \u2014 shared by many critics \u2014 that the Tomatometer ratings damage films because they reduce nuanced reviews to blunt scores.Still, it is the Tomatometer scores that have become ubiquitous across the web. Rotten Tomatoes makes money through partnerships with companies like Apple, which lists the scores next to iTunes movie rentals and purchases. And to the dismay of movie marketers, Google has started to prominently display the scores even when users do not specifically search for them: Enter the name of a film into the search bar and the Tomatometer results pop up on the top right side of the results page, directly under the film\u2019s poster.\u201cRotten Tomatoes isn\u2019t new, but its omnipresence is,\u201d said Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s president of theatrical marketing. \u201cThe scores are even part of the local TV news on Friday going into the weekend.\u201dIn past years, studio publicists would occasionally lobby Rotten Tomatoes to include positive reviews from far-flung publications as a way of improving scores, especially for films with a 59 \u2014 on the line between receiving a red, plump fruit label (fresh) or the dreaded splotch of green goo (rotten). But Hollywood more or less lived with it.Four things changed.There was Fandango\u2019s integration of Tomatometer scores with its ticketing platforms, which service about 28,000 movie screens in North America. Now, when Fandango customers buy tickets to a movie in the days leading up to its release, they are confronted by the film\u2019s Tomatometer score. After the movie is released, a different Rotten Tomatoes rating \u2014 one based on audience response, which is invariably positive \u2014 begins to pop up on Fandango next to the Tomatometer score.Then there is Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 growth into a very popular hub. In 2009, the site, which sells advertising, attracted about 1.8 million unique visitors per month. It now attracts as many as 14 million unique visitors a month. The broader Fandango portfolio of sites reaches 60 million unique visitors a month.Consumer behavior is also changing. People increasingly rely on review aggregation sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor to make all kinds of spending decisions. The trend is especially visible among young people, who make up Hollywood\u2019s most important audience. According to National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm, 34 percent of American teenagers now check Rotten Tomatoes before buying a ticket, up from 23 percent in 2014.Most importantly, studios are panicking because moviegoing is no longer a habit for most Americans. Because of climbing prices and competition from other forms of entertainment, a trip to the multiplex has become a special event. In particular, more movie fans are ignoring low- and mid-budget films when they are in theaters: Ehh, let\u2019s wait until they show up on Netflix.Studios are trying to battle Rotten Tomatoes on multiple fronts.Another way to undercut Rotten Tomatoes involves restricting reviews until the last possible minute. Sony set a review embargo of opening day for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which left the Tomatometer blank until after many advance tickets had been sold and families had made weekend plans. \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which ultimately received a Tomatometer score of 8, squeezed out decent opening-weekend ticket sales of $24.5 million.If Rotten Tomatoes is a monster, the studios helped create it. As much as they fear and loathe low scores, they love high ones. Sony recently ended its trailer for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d a heist thriller, by flashing the Rotten Tomatoes logo and \u201c100 percent,\u201d the film\u2019s Tomatometer score at the time. (It later slipped to 94.) Annapurna did the same thing for \u201cDetroit\u201d in television ads. (Not that it helped; that drama flopped.)And Rotten Tomatoes is getting stronger. The site is working to build its Tomatometer scores for TV shows into a more formidable force. Also in development are a half-dozen video series, including one built around a cheeky event created by Ms. Drake, the senior movie editor, called Your Opinion Sucks.At that event, which started at the Comic-Con International fan convention in San Diego a few years ago, movie fans debate critics.

{"Headline": "\u2018Friends,\u2019 the Sitcom That\u2019s Still a Hit in Major League Baseball", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen he returns home from the stadium, Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Freddy Galvis often gets into bed and watches reruns of \u201cFriends.\u201d Even though Galvis, 27, is from Venezuela and grasped English late in life, he is so addicted to the sitcom that he has watched every episode of the 10-season run at least five times \u2014 and counting \u2014 to the exasperation of his wife.\u201cIt\u2019ll be the same episodes I\u2019ve seen already,\u201d he said, \u201cand my wife is like, \u2018Yet again?\u2019\u201dYankees pitcher Luis Severino, 23, who is from the Dominican Republic, can relate. So can Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder David Peralta, 30, who is Venezuelan, and Miguel Gonzalez, 33, the Texas Rangers pitcher who was born in Mexico, as well as other Latino players throughout Major League Baseball.For at least one generation of Americans, \u201cFriends\u201d endures as a cultural touchstone, a glowing chunk of 1990s amber. But its runaway popularity stretched far beyond the United States, and for some Latino baseball players it is something more: a language guide, a Rosetta Stone disguised as six 20-somethings commingling in a Manhattan apartment.And also just a funny show.What has the sitcom done for his English proficiency?\u201cIt\u2019s near perfect,\u201d said Flores\u2019s teammate, Jerry Blevins, who is from Tennessee. \u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t know something, it\u2019s surprising.\u201dFlores, Peralta and Galvis built a rudimentary command of English in school in Venezuela. \u201cBut I always got bad grades because I didn\u2019t like that way of learning,\u201d Galvis said.Gonzalez, who was surrounded by Spanish, his first language, at home, also had English classes in school when he moved to Southern California. Some players also received English instruction after signing with a team.But these players said that they learned more when they arrived in the United States and fully plunged into English. In terms of immersion, few things compare to landing in a small minor-league town with few Spanish speakers \u2014 and needing to order food.Popular culture, especially \u201cFriends,\u201d was education through entertainment.\u201cThe basics you can learn in a classroom,\u201d said Flores, who was interviewed in Spanish, along with most of the players, for ease. \u201cBut to speak the language, that comes from here in the clubhouse, on the street or from television.\u201dFlores said he cannot remember exactly when he first watched \u201cFriends,\u201d but it was sometime early in his minor league career in the United States, perhaps when he was in Class A as a teenager and far from home. Although he said he understood enough English then, he was too unsure to respond in conversation. As he grew more comfortable, he soaked up words from teammates and bought the DVD\u2019s for all 10 seasons of \u201cFriends,\u201d which ran from 1994 to 2004, so he could watch it again at home in the off-season.Flores said he still watches it almost every day, and that he had seen every episode at least seven times. \u201cMy mom thinks I watch it too much,\u201d he said.Gonzalez speaks perhaps the best English of this bunch because he was exposed to it at a young age growing up in San Fernando, Calif. Yet he still had help from movies and television shows, including \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d \u2014 and \u201cFriends,\u201d which he watched with an uncle.\u201cThat\u2019s what he watched, so we\u2019d sit there and watch TV with him,\u201d Gonzalez said.For Galvis, the English-language broadcast with Spanish subtitles on Venezuelan television, was an excellent learning tool. \u201cYou can compare what\u2019s going on that way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they say \u2018happy,\u2019 you see he\u2019s happy and the subtitle says \u2018feliz\u2019, then you can learn. You might not learn 100 percent, but you\u2019ll learn to associate.\u201dAnd if Severino did not understand a word from the show, he would ask teammates or friends for help.Peralta said that listening to music in English and marrying an American woman were also beneficial. He does not need subtitles anymore to watch \u201cFriends,\u201d and still watches it daily despite having already seen every episode.\u201cWhen we\u2019re in Arizona, it starts at 11 p.m. on Nick at Nite, so I watch until 1 a.m. and then I go to sleep,\u201d he said.Most of the players said Joey, the floundering actor played by Matt LeBlanc, was their favorite character. The show\u2019s comedy appealed to them even though \u2014 or perhaps because \u2014 the lives of six white Americans in the West Village hardly resembled their own.The New York that Flores has come to know playing for the Mets is not like the one represented in \u201cFriends.\u201d \u201cIn photos, it all looks the same, but the traffic and driving around is way different,\u201d he said.Like Flores, Galvis is evangelical about \u201cFriends.\u201d He tells young Spanish-speaking players that he is living proof that consuming popular culture in English can help. And although he is now a capable English speaker, he still watches \u201cFriends\u201d with subtitles in Spanish so that his wife can learn English.Marta Kauffman, one of the creators of the show, said she was delighted to hear about its unlikely and unintended impact on certain players. She compared the phenomenon to how Viagra was originally designed to treat heart problems but later was embraced for a very different purpose.\u201cYou always want your show to be enjoyable and for people to say, \u2018Oh my God, I love watching your show,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut what you don\u2019t expect is for it to accomplish something, and this feels mighty fine.\u201dKauffman added that she would love to meet the \u201cFriends\u201d-loving players one day. But she offered one regret: \u201cTo the player whose wife is sick of watching it so much, I apologize.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Wants You to Wake Up With Alexa, and That\u2019s Just the Start", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon released the first Echo smart speaker three years ago, not long after the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone proved to be a humiliating failure.So far, the results for the Echo have been anything but humiliating. Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities.On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks.Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick \u2014 aggressive pricing \u2014 and by finding ways to embed Alexa\u2019s hooks more deeply into customers\u2019 lives.If the strategy works, Amazon could gain an edge in a new wave of computing. Most big technology companies are convinced that voice commands and intelligent assistants will be primary ways that people interact with technology, perhaps more vital than touch screens and keyboards.David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said Wednesday that the company had about 5,000 employees working on Alexa projects. The company held its event on the 30th floor of one of its high-rise buildings in Seattle, where it had created a living room and kitchen to test how the Alexa devices worked in a homelike setting.The company has identified music, communications and controlling smart home appliances as the most popular uses of Alexa. Although Amazon has not released specific sales figures for Alexa devices, Mr. Limp said tens of millions had been sold.\u201cThey\u2019re literally scattering them around the house, putting them in hallways, workshops and garages,\u201d he said.Echo Spot, a $129.99 spherical device with a 2.5-inch touch screen, is Amazon\u2019s version of an alarm clock. In addition to displaying the time and weather, its microphones will allow people to make phone calls, turn lights on and off and ask how long a morning commute will take. A tiny camera makes videoconferencing possible.The device, and its camera, could also provide a test for Amazon. Whether customers feel comfortable having a camera aimed at their beds will depend partially on whether they trust Amazon to protect their privacy.Also introduced Wednesday was an updated version of the original, cylinder-shaped Echo. The new iteration is shorter, with sleeves made of fabric, wood veneer and other materials that allow it to blend in better with the rest of a home\u2019s d\u00e9cor. The company said it had improved the device\u2019s speakers as well. The biggest change is the price: $99.99 instead of the original Echo\u2019s $179.99.Another new device, Echo Plus, resembles the original Echo, but comes with technology that helps control certain household devices like light bulbs that are automated. Echo Plus, priced at $149.99, is designed to find many of those automated devices with little configuration required.A new version of Fire TV, the company\u2019s device for streaming internet video to televisions, is small enough to dangle from the back of a television\u2019s video port. Amazon said that media companies including Bravo, Netflix and Showtime planned to use a new Alexa capability that lets people use voice commands to control Fire TV video apps.Amazon also said that BMW Group had agreed to embed Alexa in its BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles starting next year, the latest in a series of relationships that Amazon has entered with carmakers to spread the use of Alexa outside the home.Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research said he believed Amazon\u2019s goal was to strengthen the loyalty of its customers, especially those enrolled in its Prime membership program.\u201cOverall, today\u2019s announcements felt like Amazon doubling down on its Echo and Alexa strategy,\u201d he said, adding that the company was \u201creminding all of us that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make money on Echo hardware for the strategy to be successful.\u201dMr. Dawson said the strategy created \u201cinteresting competitive challenges for others like Google and Apple who don\u2019t have such obvious non-hardware revenue streams associated with their smart voice speakers.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the devices introduced by Amazon on Wednesday. Is the updated version of the original Echo, not the Echo Plus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Weird Brilliance of Joaquin Phoenix", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "He\u2019s the greatest screen actor of his generation, but also a reluctant celebrity.Supported byHis performances are inquisitive and improvisatory, and he\u2019s resolutely a screen actor. (When in talks about doing a play, Phoenix learned how long the run would be: \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018At least five months?!\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re outta your mind!\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019) Time means more to him now than it ever has. When asked if he\u2019d ever do a Marvel movie, he says, \u2018\u2018Something that\u2019s going to demand six months of my time? I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u2019 Part of his reluctance to discuss acting is that he works in an intuitive, untrained way, lately in idiosyncratic, large-scale auteur movies helmed by James Gray and Paul Thomas Anderson. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s just instinct,\u2019\u2019 he says. He has no idea where his craft comes from. He\u2019s suspicious of the actor who \u2018\u2018nails\u2019\u2019 it, and he doesn\u2019t like rehearsing: \u2018\u2018If I figured it out, I would be much happier and more confident and less anxious every time I work. But I enjoy not figuring it out. Bad acting is being self-conscious. Sometimes it\u2019s a couple weeks on set before it feels like I find something.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018The best directors I\u2019ve worked with always adjusted to what was happening with the actor,\u2019\u2019 he says. For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director\u2019s hands \u2014 it\u2019s ultimately the director\u2019s world he\u2019s entering. \u2018\u2018On set I\u2019ve seen things when actors have given great \u00adperformances and once it\u2019s cut together you don\u2019t feel it, you don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve done stuff that I thought was garbage and then it\u2019s put together and it\u2019s really effective.\u2019\u2019 He says this with a combination of sincerity and befuddlement, as if he\u2019s caught between two truths. \u2018\u2018When I was younger I thought the idea was to construct a character, figure out its arc \u2014 now I think arcs are kind of BS. The director creates the arc.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s one of his finest performances \u2014 naked, hilarious, obscene, an act of mad self-immolation. Any trace of magnetic sexy leading man is erased: fat and bearded with a matted rat\u2019s nest of dreadlocks, disheveled and ranting, Phoenix is at the center of this elaborate hoax, one so poker-faced that it caused epic confusion in the entertainment press as it was being shot. Playful but lacerating, it\u2019s a riveting spectacle of celebrity burnout that seems both real and staged, and for anyone who has been in proximity to the L.A.-N.Y.-Vegas-Miami orbit of youngish celebrity, the movie is unnervingly authentic. It reaches its peak with the infamous David Letterman interview with \u2018\u2018Joaquin,\u2019\u2019 ostensibly there to promote \u2018\u2018Two Lovers\u2019\u2019: sullen, mumbling, chewing gum, refusing to remove his sunglasses, barely interacting with Dave \u2014 the audience tittering uncomfortably \u2014 and then lashing out at him. The interview made Phoenix more famous than he\u2019d ever been, and was endlessly parodied around the globe.When asked why he felt the need to make \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Still Here,\u2019\u2019 he says the process was \u2018\u2018terribly humiliating\u2019\u2019 but that he thought it was important to do. Phoenix says it started as a joke, a 10-\u00adminute short in the vein of a \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\u2019 skit, but that Affleck pushed Phoenix to announce he was retiring from acting to a TV reporter. Phoenix didn\u2019t think it would go anywhere, and instead it went viral, and the idea for an actual feature grew from the media\u2019s response: the notion being that Phoenix gives up his career and then desperately tries to get it back, all of this invented but played straight in public. Phoenix was aware the movie might fail but it was also the ultimate distillation of how he likes to work. \u2018\u2018An amazing experience: not finding your light, not hitting the mark, not memorizing lines,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It allowed me to be bold in my decisions instead of being safe.\u2019\u2019For two years after, he didn\u2019t work, even after admitting \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019\u2019 was a stunt. There were offers, but nothing he would have considered. When he returned it was as Freddie Quell in \u2018\u2018The Master,\u2019\u2019 the drunken disciple of Lancaster Dodd, an L. Ron Hubbard-esque cult leader played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Many consider this Phoenix\u2019s greatest performance \u2014 he had lost all the weight from \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019\u2019 and appears taut, almost gaunt. Perhaps his most powerful scene on film is the \u2018\u2018processing\u2019\u2019 sequence, with Dodd intensely interrogating Quell about his troubled childhood, the camera staying close on Phoenix as his innocence morphs into possessed rage.HE ADMITS HE HAS a mortgage and that he needs to work but adds that \u2018\u2018I never did anything for money,\u2019\u2019 and when you look over his filmography, you realize this is probably true. When asked why he decided to play Jesus in the upcoming \u2018\u2018Mary Magdalene,\u2019\u2019 a retelling of the New Testament story by the director Garth Davis, he says, \u2018\u2018I was looking for something meaningful. I was looking for an experience. I was friends with Rooney.\u2019\u2019 (Rooney Mara plays Mary Magdalene in the movie. The two are now a couple.) Jesus, in the film, is \u2018\u2018just a man\u2019\u2019 and playing him was \u2018\u2018just instinct, just a gut feeling.\u2019\u2019Phoenix\u2019s life is remarkably simple compared to what people might imagine. He lives with Mara in the Hollywood Hills (he\u2019s never been married and has no children) and is usually asleep by 9 p.m. and up at 6. When he\u2019s not working his daily routine consists of answering emails, \u2018\u2018chilling\u2019\u2019 with his dog, meditating, taking a karate class, eating lunch, reading scripts and dinner \u2014 but for most of last year he\u2019d been on location. He watches documentaries on Netflix (and he watched the 10-hour true-crime doc \u2018\u2018The Staircase\u2019\u2019 recently because Mara wanted to) but rarely watches new movies. When asked if any recent films have excited him, he thinks about it, stuck, and then answers, genuinely surprising himself: \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Moana\u2019! I thought it was beautiful.\u2019\u2019 (He later corrects himself and says it was actually \u2018\u2018The Lost City of Z,\u2019\u2019 James Gray\u2019s latest \u2014 Phoenix has starred in four of Gray\u2019s seven films.)Twelve years ago Phoenix went into rehab for alcoholism. \u2018\u2018I really just thought of myself as a hedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn\u2019t engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to. I was being an idiot, running around, drinking, trying to screw people, going to stupid clubs.\u2019\u2019 There was no intervention, Phoenix says, he just checked himself in. \u2018\u2018I thought rehab was a place where you sat in a Jacuzzi and ate fruit salad. But when I got there they started talking about the 12 steps and I went: \u2018Wait a minute, I\u2019m still gonna smoke weed.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 He offers a startled, questioning look, and then later admits: \u2018\u2018I think at the core of the program is a spirituality that is important to me, but .\u2009.\u2009. I am a hippie, you know.\u2019\u2019 Though he still drinks when he flies (the last drink he had was a month ago on a flight to \u00adLondon) he has stopped smoking marijuana. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s too many things I enjoy doing and I don\u2019t want to wake up feeling hungover. It\u2019s not a thing I fight against \u2014 it\u2019s just the way I live my life. Some of it\u2019s probably age.\u2019\u2019Grooming by David Cox for Art Department using R + Co.

Ten minutes later, she was back. Shiloh\u2019s beloved bearded dragon, Vlad, had fallen ill and was now, to Shiloh\u2019s distress, convalescing at the vet\u2019s. \u201cThat will be the rest of my day,\u201d Ms. Jolie said, settling into a cushioned patio chair, \u201clearning all about the health issues of the bearded dragon.\u201dMs. Jolie went on to lament the imbalance of a world where Californian pets get cushy care while millions of people the world over lack access to proper medical treatment. It went unmentioned that she was saying this from her $25 million two-acre hilltop estate, in a gated pocket of the Los Feliz neighborhood, a home she bought for herself and her six children in the spring, following her split from Brad Pitt.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious plan of, I was going to make war films, it\u2019s just what I was drawn to,\u201d she said.The grace and humility she saw in the Cambodian people, along with the lasting effects of the genocide, threw Hollywood life into unflattering relief.\u201cOnce you get exposed to what\u2019s really happening in the world, and other people\u2019s realities, you just can\u2019t ever not know, and you can\u2019t ever wake up and pretend it\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said, \u201cYour entire life shifts.\u201d\u201cThe real will to survive, and the strength of the human spirit, and the love of the human family becomes so present, and that\u2019s how we should all be living,\u201d Ms. Jolie said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re around it, it\u2019s quite contagious, and you know to learn from it.\u201dThe air pressed in hot and close as she spoke, and the sun was climbing its way toward a broiling midday. I was all but keeling over, but Ms. Jolie, who adores the heat, was as composed as a sphinx. (We soon moved to the air-conditioned climes of her kitchen.)Ms. Jolie is a contained and poised presence, yet also light, breaking every now and then into lilting laughter. She is as visually arresting as she appears onscreen; the sculpted lines of her face alongside the soft O\u2019s of her eyes and mouth make hers an otherworldly beauty. Though slight as a sylph, she says she doesn\u2019t exercise, beyond dipping into the pool with her kids and vaguely intending to someday jump on a treadmill.I asked Ms. Jolie if she ever felt like the coach of a small team, and she replied that more often she felt part of a fraternity.\u201cThey really help me so much. We\u2019re really such a unit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the best friends I\u2019ve ever had. Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.\u201dShortly afterward, Ms. Jolie and the kids moved out of Mr. Pitts\u2019s estate, living in a rental for nine months as she struggled with the decision about whether to buy a new home.\u201cIt took me a few months to realize that I was really going to have to do it. That there was going to have to be another base regardless of everything,\u201d she said, her voice falling quiet and low, as it would each time the subject of the split arose. \u201cThat there was going to have to be a home. Another home.\u201dThe new house, a Beaux Arts manse that was once the residence of the legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, is a beaut, with a library, rolling lawns, cascading fountains that burble into the pool, and a view of the Griffith Observatory. Ms. Jolie had an elaborate treehouse built \u2014 \u201cmore a parkour treehouse,\u201d she said \u2014 and the kids helped decorate and pick out the furniture for the whole house. They have an agreement, Ms. Jolie said, that not everyone can agree on everything, but you have to try to like it if you don\u2019t hate it. If you do hate it, you can overrule.\u201cIt has a lot of moments,\u201d Ms. Jolie said of the home, \u201cIt\u2019s happy. Happy and light, and we needed that.\u201dI asked how everyone is doing now.\u201cNone of it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy,\u201d she said quietly.Are they? \u201cThey\u2019re getting better,\u201d she said, her voice approaching inaudibility.\u201cLoung had such horrors in her life but also had so much love, and that is why she\u2019s all right today,\u201d Ms. Jolie said. \u201cThat is something I need to remember.\u201dMs. Ung said Ms. Jolie, who has Cambodian citizenship, shares her countrymen\u2019s sensibilities. \u201cIn Cambodia you don\u2019t raise your voice, you speak kindly to people, you greet people with your hands together and bow,\u201d Ms. Ung said. \u201cAll of this comes naturally to her.\u201dAs our interview wrapped, Ms. Jolie joked that she would next work on a comedy. \u201cI will get funny at some point,\u201d she said, adding that she was working on \u201cMaleficent 2,\u201d a sequel to the Disney fractured fairy tale. \u201cThat was a little funny,\u201d she said, wryly.\u201cI never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,\u201d Ms. Jolie said, walking me down her driveway, \u201cAnd that\u2019s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.\u201dShe quickly embraced me goodbye, and I set off into the sun and the heat, as the heavy security gate slowly drew shut behind.Advertisement"}

They are suddenly interested in working with you.\u201dWhich goes some way toward explaining why a cadre of nominees and presenters at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday night chose to march in lock step, decisively turning their backs on the intentionally contour-shrouding looks that have overtaken the high fashion runways.Cutting-edge fashion, as defined by a noisy claque of magazine editors and bloggers, is not their friend, they know. Better to stick with tradition, some reasoned, swapping vanguard style for old Hollywood vavoom.Shailene Woodley seemed to have embraced that brief. The best supporting actress nominee in a limited series, for the HBO show \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d wore a custom Ralph Lauren dress in witchy green velvet, its V-form neckline dropping to her waist.Still, red-carpet veterans like Nicole Kidman had other ideas. Ms. Kidman, named best actress in a limited series for \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d chose to underscore her stature as a worldly fashion muse. Deftly negotiating the wobbly line between steaminess and cool, she wore a scarlet ballerina-length Calvin Klein dress of silk gazar, demure except for its coyly slit neckline.Image-savvy and by no means trend-averse, Zo\u00eb Kravitz of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d reinforced her reputation as tastemaker in Christian Dior couture, the varicolored panels of her dress embroidered in tufts of feathers.That dress was one in a series of departures from the vaunted midcentury throwback, the trumpet-skirted mermaid gown. Claire Foy, who had been nominated as the lead actress in a drama series for her role in the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d wore a crystal-trimmed black Oscar de la Renta jumpsuit, racy in its sleekness. It was topped for sheer nerve by Evan Rachel Wood\u2019s riskier, if more memorable, choice: a white dinner jacket, bustier top and tails whipped up for the HBO \u201cWestworld\u201d best actress nominee by Jeremy Scott of Moschino.The event\u2019s stroll of fame did, unexpectedly, spawn a few trends. Any number of stars were sheathed goddess-style in molten silver. But Millie Bobby Brown of the Netflix series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d at 13 one of the Emmys\u2019 youngest-ever contenders, opted quite consciously for something more virginal, strolling the carpet in a strapless, full-skirted white Calvin Klein gown that could have doubled as a wedding dress. In a similar mood, Elisabeth Moss, named best actress for her role in \u201cA Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from Hulu, chose a pale pink confection by Prabal Gurung that had all the freshness, and calculated na\u00efvet\u00e9, of a 1950s prom gown.Ms. Kravitz herself advanced this tender theme with a gamine look that brought to mind a waifish Mia Farrow. Sure, her incongruous accents to her Dior gown, strings of Tiffany diamonds setting off her scattered tattoos, flirted with the cutting edge.But her look over all felt quite magical, she told Jason Kennedy, a host on E! \u201cIt\u2019s fairylike,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I would go for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Vietnam War Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.As before, Ward has written a weighty companion book to the series. \u201cThe Vietnam War: An Intimate History\u201d tells once again the painful tale of America\u2019s protracted, divisive and (most would now agree) futile involvement in the fight to keep South Vietnam unconquered by the Communist North. After filling in the historical background, the book ranges over two decades, from Dien Bien Phu in 1954, when the French left their former colony in defeat, to the 1975 fall of Saigon, when the United States left. It\u2019s all here: the Gulf of Tonkin and the Tet offensive, the Perfume River and the Ho Chi Minh Trail, napalm and draft notices and teach-ins and My Lai, P.O.W.s and fragging and Kent State and the Christmas bombing, and much more.And yet to those who\u2019ve read in the existing literature, many of these soldiers\u2019 stories will sound awfully familiar. We hear from Lt. Col. John Paul Vann (featured in Neil Sheehan\u2019s \u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d), Philip Caputo (the author of \u201cA Rumor of War\u201d), W.D. Ehrhart (the poet and memoirist) and others already famous from well-known books. Besides, the recollections in \u201cThe Vietnam War,\u201d though often moving or insightful, don\u2019t always advance the book\u2019s narrative. In \u201cThe Civil War,\u201d epistolary excerpts from soldiers like Elisha Hunt Rhodes and Sam Watkins were brilliantly employed to convey the grunts\u2019 experiences while simultaneously providing needed exposition. Here, the individuals\u2019 anecdotes tend to stand alone as set pieces, disconnected from what follows.One major problem for any narrative account of the Vietnam War lies in the nature of the conflict. The Civil War ground on from clash to clash, place to place, progressing relentlessly and suspensefully toward its culmination, with key battles like Gettysburg and Vicksburg providing dramatic pivots. The Vietnam War played out differently, in countless skirmishes that lacked strategic consequence. Questions of who was winning and losing were forever murky, and not only because Presidents Johnson and Nixon deceived Americans about the prospects for victory. In the face of implacable North Vietnamese resolve, even successful military campaigns simply didn\u2019t do much. Thus, when recounting some of the important battles \u2014 Ap Bac early in the war, the fighting at Hue during the 1968 Tet offensive \u2014 Ward\u2019s writing comes alive, but only for a short spell. And he\u2019s chosen to cover so many topics that after each combat tale, the reader is inevitably diverted elsewhere.In \u201cThe Civil War,\u201d priority went to the military story, then to politics and last to society and culture. That ordering may have been old-fashioned, but it made sense given how crucial combat was to determining the war\u2019s outcome. By contrast, with Vietnam, especially by the late 1960s, the political narrative \u2014 not the battlefield developments \u2014 most compelled Americans\u2019 interest. Readers of this volume, like Americans in the 1960s or \u201970s, won\u2019t be waiting for a game-changing victory like Ulysses Grant\u2019s hard-won 1865 triumph at Petersburg. Rather, they will look to the political dramas: Lyndon Johnson\u2019s decision to forsake re-election in 1968, the Moratorium protests of October 1969, Henry Kissinger\u2019s exhaustive Paris peace talks. We wait expectantly not for a victory at the front lines but for the moment when America consents to withdraw.Over all, this political history is well told, though Ward makes one big error. In 1968, Richard Nixon, the Republican presidential nominee, secretly worked a back channel to the South Vietnamese to undermine Johnson\u2019s diplomacy. That subterfuge was illegal and immoral, but there\u2019s scant evidence that it alone led the South Vietnamese president, Nguyen Van Thieu, to reject Johnson\u2019s terms. Ward wrongly asserts that Nixon \u201cscuttled the negotiations.\u201dOne highlight of the book is the five brief stand-alone essays that seek to examine a single question about the war in depth. In particular, the meditations by the Harvard historian Fredrik Logevall, on whether John F. Kennedy would have become embroiled in the war, and by the onetime antiwar activist Todd Gitlin, on the movement\u2019s legacy, offer original assessments in the kind of personal voice that\u2019s mostly missing from the book. However, one otherwise evocative rumination by the novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen is marred by a surprisingly blinkered dismissal of not just the entire corpus of American films about the war, but also most of the \u201cAmerican books about the war, fiction or nonfiction.\u201d So much for \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d \u201cThe Best and the Brightest,\u201d \u201cDispatches,\u201d \u201cFire in the Lake,\u201d \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d and other filmed and written works that provided source material for this very volume.Perhaps the most worthwhile contribution of \u201cThe Vietnam War\u201d is its compilation of hundreds of astonishing photographs. Ward and Burns reproduce now-famous images like Eddie Adams\u2019s picture of a Vietcong prisoner being shot in the head at close range and Nick Ut\u2019s shot of a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm raid. But they also include powerful and less familiar scenes of rubble-strewn streets, desperate villagers, bewildered squadrons, and Americans and Vietnamese alike who are wounded, maimed, dying or freshly killed.If \u201cThe Vietnam War\u201d falls short as scholarly or even bedside reading, though, it remains a vivid and often captivating volume \u2014 and, construed literally as a companion to the television series, a valuable resource. Twenty-seven years after it aired, the \u201cCivil War\u201d documentary is now streaming on Netflix, as gripping as ever, still a spark for conversations and learning and discovery. The companion volume is not what people remember.David Greenberg, a professor of history at Rutgers University, is the author, most recently, of \u201cRepublic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Hayes was naked, holding up two black signs that said \u201cSpoilers\u201d \u2014 River Song\u2019s catchphrase \u2014 over her breasts and pubic area.And if not everyone in the audience understands the inside jokes, deep cuts and nods to source material, that\u2019s O.K. \u2014 the performers\u2019 sincerity and the audience\u2019s excitement are entertainment enough.\u201cWe tend to stick with the things that we love ourselves, that we\u2019re true fans of,\u201d said Joseph Naftali, who works at a costume company. He helped create Hotsy Totsy 10 years ago and co-produces its shows. \u201cWe\u2019re always paying homage to these things, we\u2019re not making fun of them.\u201dThe references delighted fans in the audience, who instantly recognized her as one of the show\u2019s characters: Sarah Lynn, a drug-addicted, former child actress who released a highly sexualized single titled \u201cPrickly Muffin.\u201d And for non-fans, it was still an opportunity to see a curvy woman\u2019s nearly naked body.The burlesque performer known as Moe Cheezmo, who did not want to reveal his name for fear of losing his job, said the appeal of nerdlesque for fans is that it is more fun \u2014 and risqu\u00e9 \u2014 than just talking plot points and exchanging finale predictions. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a staged version of a \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 fan fiction, no one is going to come to that,\u201d he said.But put nudity into the mix, and you\u2019re giving people a forum for a kind of sexual exploration that seems less lewd than a strip show. \u201cThey can square it in their head with their own value system,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to exploit people who are taking their clothes off,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to support my fandom.\u201dNeoburlesque, as it\u2019s known, also embraced performers whose bodies, sexual identities and ages weren\u2019t often seen onstage. This is even more the case with nerdlesque.When Cyndi Freeman, a writer and podcast producer who plays the ditsy, pink-haired Cherry Pitz in Hotsy Totsy shows, joined the burlesque community a decade ago at 43, it was a defiant act against ageism and a declaration of pride for her body.\u201cI was hearing people say, \u2018You\u2019re too old,\u2019 \u201d she said. But she was adamant: \u201c \u2018This is what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019 \u201dAt the end of the \u201cDoctor Who\u201d show that night, Ms. Freeman, wearing her signature pink bouffant wig, seductively removed her fishnet stockings, black tutu and silky blue corset \u2014 which recalled the police box the Doctor uses for time travel \u2014 to reveal a black thong and light-up nipple covers. A few minutes later Mr. Lawrence, dressed as the Tenth Doctor, re-emerged for some witty banter and Whovian humor.Almost nonstop for the duration of the act, the crowd screamed for more \u2014 more skin, more dancing, more merriment, more nerdiness.Before the performance, Mr. Lawrence had considered why people came to these shows. \u201cLife is hard, and work is tedious,\u201d he had said. Fans watch a funny strip tease with their favorite characters, they laugh, they drink. \u201cThey feel better at the end of it.

It\u2019s not an idea that stretches effectively over eight episodes, though, even at a half-hour each.

The \u201cfilmmakers\u201d re-enact the \u201ccrime\u201d to test the time frame. They even produce an animated re-creation of an alleged instance of third-base sexual contact on a summer-camp dock.

But you can\u2019t fault the execution \u2014 Mr. Yacenda, Mr. Perrault and the showrunner, Dan Lagana, never let the facade slip.They\u2019re not as reliable with tone, however.

{"Headline": "Mass Psychology Supports the Pricey Stock Market", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThat was the observation of John Maynard Keynes, who suggested that investors do not actually make money by picking the best companies, but by picking stocks that waves of other traders will want to buy.Investing, in other words, is an exercise in mass psychology.I\u2019ve spent decades studying it, and believe that one way to predict future market moves is to sort through the narratives that sweep through the population and influence decisions on whether to buy or sell. Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.The current number is troubling. After the ratio\u2019s peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market\u2019s history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.The notion that investors were laboring under \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: \u201cSTOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED.\u201dIn early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with \u201c.com\u201d in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing \u201cdot-bombs,\u201d articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.So where are we today?That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else. I don\u2019t really know.That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no danger of a crash. But at the moment, the psychological preconditions for a spiraling downturn don\u2019t appear to be in place.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Renews Offensive on Silicon Valley With Tax Reforms", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s offensive against Silicon Valley looks as though it is likely to resume, as officials in Brussels consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by digital titans like Facebook and Amazon.The new proposals, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times on Wednesday, broadly aim to tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.But the plans will give ammunition to critics who argue the European Union unfairly targets the United States technology sector. Though the bloc\u2019s leaders deny that they single out American firms, opponents point to an array of investigations against household names for suspected violations ranging from how they handle user data to antitrust complaints.But it was not clear whether the latest effort by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, would gain sufficient traction. Any such reform would require the unanimous approval of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states. While several major countries like France have pushed for a crackdown, others do not want to change a system in which some of them can attract corporations with tax incentives and other inducements.In seeking to tax revenue rather than profit \u2014 one of the options being considered \u2014 European regulators want to ensure that major internet companies pay taxes to national treasuries where they do business. For example, Amazon, a target of the commission in the past, operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000, and so can take advantage of its low taxes.\u201cThe main challenge is to reform the international tax framework, which was first designed at the start of the 20th century and is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d the report said. It will be published by the commission on Thursday.The existing system \u201chas worked well for traditional \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 companies but as business activities have become more globalized and digitalized the old rules work less well,\u201d it continued.It found that companies that did their business online were paying an effective tax rate of 8.5 percent, or less than half that paid by more traditional businesses.The European Union stepped up its efforts to curb tax avoidance, by companies as well as wealthy individuals, after the financial crisis, which forced many of its member states to adopt belt-tightening measures, slashing public services and raising taxes.The commission said in its latest proposals that it wants to agree to a long-term solution with other countries around the world. But that could take a long time to negotiate, and may not close enough loopholes, so it put forward several shorter-term plans that could wind up meaning companies like Amazon, Facebook and Netflix pay larger tax bills in Europe much sooner.\u201cIn the absence of adequate global progress, E.U. solutions should be advanced,\u201d the commission said, adding that it could make more formal proposals on taxation in the coming months.The potential reforms it outlined include taxing companies based on their revenue rather than their profits, allowing national authorities to tax payments made by consumers to digital businesses, and allowing individual countries to tax revenue generated from advertising by internet companies.France has thrown its weight behind the first of those reforms, in particular. But questions have been raised over whether taxing revenue is a viable plan. Businesses that turn a hefty profit could effectively pay the same as a company of a similar size that has narrower margins, or even loses money.\u201cThe fundamental question is where is the business really being conducted,\u201d said J. Scott Marcus, an analyst at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe devil is in the details with a digital service across borders \u2014 the service can be made anywhere.\u201d\u201cThe question is who gets the tax,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine challenge.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simple Investing for Nonprofits", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe boards of small nonprofit organizations must make major investment decisions, but they are often flying in the dark.There is a simple answer, which works for many small institutions as well as for individuals saving for retirement. It is to put money into low-cost stock and bond funds, allocate the money appropriately and rebalance periodically. But the boards of nonprofits don\u2019t always find this straightforward approach appealing for a variety of reasons, many of them psychological.For one thing, not every nonprofit has board members who want to take responsibility for decisions that could affect their institution\u2019s financial health. Even members with financial expertise may feel ill equipped to make an investment decision in a stressful market.Hiring outside money managers to handle these burdens comes at a price and with no guarantee of success. Assembling a team of superb money managers, as Yale, Princeton and other universities have tried to do, may not be realistic for nonprofits that don\u2019t have an enormous endowment.That\u2019s why Larry Kochard, who oversees the University of Virginia\u2019s $8.6 billion endowment and sits on the board of the $18 million Virginia Environmental Endowment, says the simple solution, equity and bond index funds, makes sense for smaller institutions.Finding good outside advisers is possible for institutions without deep pockets, he said, but it is very difficult. \u201cThe odds of a small endowment finding the right managers are very slim,\u201d Mr. Kochard said.For the most part, he advocated modest goals, saying: \u201cIf we are watching our allocations and spending and rebalancing, we are meeting our obligations.\u201dMs. Shuman also favors index funds for nonprofits, but warns that the success of index funds over the past several years has largely been driven by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\u201cThey drove a disproportionate return,\u201d she said, and if these stocks decline, the indexes will fall, too. She recommends Vanguard\u2019s managed equity and international funds for low-cost but actively managed alternatives.When considering whether to hold hedge funds, which often do not allow immediate liquidation of investments, many nonprofits may need to examine whether they can afford to forgo access to their money for long periods.That\u2019s not always an issue, however. Before Patti Birch died in 2007, for example, she directed that her Patti and Everett B. Birch Foundation spend down all of its funds in the years ahead. The foundation\u2019s president, Vartan Gregorian, said it still gave money to \u201cthe arts, women\u2019s rights, religious and ethnic tolerance, freedom of speech and strengthening American democracy,\u201d all causes that were important to Ms. Birch. Mr. Gregorian is also president of the Carnegie Corporation.The foundation\u2019s remaining funds are all being held in low-risk short-term bonds, said Mark Imowitz, whose firm, Imowitz Koenig and Company, handles the finances.\u201cPatti was not worried about having great appreciation in her investment assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was natural to keep them in low-return funds since the money was being spent down.\u201dMany nonprofits have to think much longer term, however, and don\u2019t have the luxury of holding all of their assets in a single low-risk asset class.Roughly 80 percent of it is allocated to Commonfund\u2019s multistrategy equity fund, which includes a smattering of hedge funds, and it underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by 2.5 percentage points in the three years through April, Mr. Kempner said. The fund has improved lately, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a manager underperforms their benchmarks, you should not just immediately trade managers. You have to understand what is wrong and how can they plan to fix it \u201cFees vary widely and are not always transparent. Commonfund, which manages about $24 billion in nonprofit money for about 1,400 clients, charges an average fee of 0.3 percent directly, according to Keith Luke, Commonfund\u2019s president. But because the managers selected by Commonfund for nonprofit portfolios also charge fees and because there are additional expenses, the overall fee paid by nonprofits is about 1 percent on average, he said.Commonfund \u201cis like an institutional mutual fund,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cWe create a commingled investment vehicle of managers who pick stocks across all strategies.\u201d\u201cThere is scaled pricing,\u201d he said, \u201cand the larger the portfolio, the smaller the fee.\u201d For sizable portfolios \u2014 about $20 million \u2014 the overall fee would be less than 0.14 percent with Vanguard, he said.Geraldine Fabrikant is a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit.Advertisement"}

He and another Parks Canada official went to Washington to see how historic sites and museums there deal with issues like George Washington\u2019s slave ownership.\u201cSir John A. Macdonald is a well-known character, but we really needed to have a more interesting conversation about his legacy,\u201d Mr. Ostrom said. \u201cWe were given an opportunity to share a more meaningful story for all Canadians and not just the old high-school history lesson.\u201dThe most obvious results are two timelines in different colors that zigzag around three walls of the visitor center. One offers a history of Macdonald and the system of government he helped create. The other band designates the times Canada fell terribly short of its ideals, like the internment of Japanese-Canadians during World War II.Churchill, Manitoba, is to polar bears as Kingston is to Macdonald.But the 1,056 miles of railway that are its only land link to the south washed out in several places in May, and there is no obvious sign it will be repaired.Our Toronto bureau chief, Catherine Porter, and the photographer Ian Willms took a plane to Churchill to assess the effects of the cutoff, which has driven up prices in the community and had other unwelcome effects. I asked her about the trip:A huge sign greets you at the airport: \u201cWelcome to Churchill, Manitoba: Polar Bear Country.\u201d It lists the dos and don\u2019ts: always be alert, and never walk after 10 p.m., for example.Polar-bear warning signs dot the town\u2019s edges and flash from most store windows. An eerie siren sounds every night as a reminder that it is time to get out of claw\u2019s way.Almost every discussion I had with residents included bears.\u201cPolar bears are why the town is here,\u201d said Paul Ratson, a local nature guide.While Churchill was once a Hudson Bay post, a port and a military town, it now largely relies on tourism to survive. And most of the tourists come during polar bear season: six weeks, starting in the middle of October, when polar bears are most likely to be seen around town, waiting for the sea ice to bump against the shore so they can rush off in search of seals.The town\u2019s population, normally 900, grows, with tour operators moving in to work seven days a week. Mr. Ratson said he makes 60 percent of his income during those six weeks.So the big question on most minds was: Would the broken train line affect polar bear season? If Churchill was hobbling now, that would sound its death knell.Most tour operators I spoke to remained confident it would not. Merv Gunter, the founder of Frontiers North Adventures, said tourists paid up to 11,000 Canadian dollars ($8,744) for a four-day polar bear package and booked a year and a half in advance. A bump in food prices would not deter those tourists.The Tundra Inn owner Belinda Fitzpatrick agreed. While she had lost 30 percent of her summer bookings, she was not expecting any cancellations in October. \u201cThere are no independent tourists in bear season,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all fly in.\u201dBe sure to join Ms. Porter on a dog-sled ride near Churchill through her 360 Video. A link is embedded in her article.The Times Book Review sat down with Louise Penny, author of the crime novels featuring Armand Gamache, a police inspector in a fictional town in Quebec\u2019s Eastern Townships. The interview produced some surprises, at least for me.

Wolves are their main predator. A study led by Robert Serrouya, a biologist with the University of Alberta in Edmonton, has found an unexpected way to keep the two species in balance: moose hunting.More than a decade ago, I worked with Clifford Krauss when he was The Times\u2019s Toronto bureau chief. He moved from there to Houston to report on the energy industry, a topic which we still collaborate on.On Friday, Mr. Krauss said that he and his family were well and staying with friends in Houston.

{"Headline": "Lena Waithe Made History, and She Gave an Emmys Speech for Right Now", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a speech that felt thoroughly, almost preternaturally, attuned to its moment.Her remarks tugged at the heartstrings of a sympathetic audience in Los Angeles (Anna Chlumsky looked unraveled) and many more who toasted the milestone on social media.Ms. Waithe, 33, may have been topical, but her speech took its cues, in part, from a vintage award-show encomium delivered more than 15 years ago. In a telephone interview Monday evening, Ms. Waithe connected her remarks to Halle Berry\u2019s famous, misty-eyed acceptance speech at the 2002 Oscars, when she became the first African-American woman to win the best actress award, for \u201cMonster\u2019s Ball.\u201d Like Ms. Berry, Ms. Waithe connected her win to the multigenerational struggle of African-American women for representational parity onscreen.Her award \u201cchanged me,\u201d she said of Ms. Berry, who dedicated her Oscar to \u201cevery nameless, faceless woman of color\u201d in Hollywood. \u201cIt made me know that we as a community were really embraced by Hollywood in a real way.\u201dIf that message has gone stale in intervening years (Ms. Berry remains the only African-American best actress winner), Ms. Waithe said she hoped to revive and expand it for a new era.The winning episode of \u201cMaster of None,\u201d she said, was \u201cabout what it means to be queer, what it means to be a woman, and what it means to be a person of color. So for me, when I went up there, I wanted to make sure that all of those people knew that I shared that moment with them.\u201dThe episode, \u201cThanksgiving,\u201d has been a fan favorite since it was first released by Netflix in May. Tracing the childhood roots of the friendship between Ms. Waithe\u2019s character, Denise, and Mr. Ansari\u2019s, Dev, it follows the two over annual Thanksgiving dinners, as they navigate Denise\u2019s first efforts to articulate her sexuality. Denise\u2019s mother, like Ms. Waithe\u2019s, is socially conservative and worries that her daughter will face obstacles beyond the ones familiar from her own experiences as a straight black woman.Ms. Waithe said Mr. Ansari heard her story and immediately felt it should appear on \u201cMaster of None.\u201d His instinct has paid dividends.\u201cThe tremendous reception to that episode proves what I\u2019ve continually found to be true,\u201d Mr. Ansari wrote in an email. Personal stories, he continued, no matter how \u201cspecific they may seem, when told with honesty and heart, can connect universally with everyone.\u201dBoth Ms. Waithe and Mr. Ansari belong to a generation of young filmmakers of color who have challenged historical (more precisely: \u201cwhite\u201d) notions of what a television protagonist should look like \u2014 the fruit, they say, of penetrating structural barriers in Hollywood that had long held them back.\u201cMaster of None,\u201d like Donald Glover\u2019s \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d and Justin Simien\u2019s \u201cDear White People,\u201d is the beneficiary of pitched demand over the past few years for distinctive and demographically inclusive television programming brought on by the arrival of aggressive competition from Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.\u201cWhenever a new network starts, they look for the novel, they look for the new, they look for the unheard voices,\u201d said Mr. Simien, who is a longtime friend of Ms. Waithe\u2019s. \u201cAnd when Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and all these places opened up, we were just really ready for that moment.\u201dMs. Waithe\u2019s triumph on Sunday \u2014 and that of Mr. Glover, who became the first African-American to win a directing Emmy for a comedy series for his work on \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 is a sign that these shows are making an impact.\u201cA lot of times, when we tell our stories, they are regarded as niche or for a specific audience, even if they\u2019re well reviewed or well loved,\u201d Mr. Simien said. \u201cI think because of the fact that there are so many spaces for black stories on TV now, there\u2019s more black content, and at a certain point you can\u2019t deny it anymore.\u201dFor Ms. Waithe, who began her career by assisting an earlier generation of black female auteurs (including Mara Brock Akil, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Ava DuVernay), the Emmy win adds fuel to an already skyward trajectory. Next year, she\u2019ll make her debut as the creator of her own television show with \u201cThe Chi,\u201d a Showtime series about young black men living in inner-city Chicago.She\u2019s also working on a feature film and a TV series about \u201cqueer women in their 20s\u201d and has a supporting role in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One.\u201d (He \u201csent a lovely note,\u201d Ms. Waithe said of Mr. Spielberg\u2019s response to the Emmy.)\u201cSo many other people could have won, but I think that, for whatever reason, there\u2019s a person that is the vessel,\u201d Ms. Waithe said, paraphrasing Ms. Berry\u2019s 2002 speech. \u201cI hope to leave a path for others to follow, and to break down doors for others to walk through.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then he starts goose-stepping around the room and gives a heil as he departs.That scene ought to be sickening or hilarious. Ideally both. But at a recent performance the push to laugh or squirm was pretty mild. The production still felt provisional, with the lighting leaving a couple of characters in shadow, and a general uncertainty as to how broadly to play the roles.

{"Headline": "With Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Help, Tab Media Targets Young and Cheeky on Campus", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American news operations of Tab Media are on a Brooklyn side street in a nondescript brick building that also houses an acupuncture studio and a mortgage lender.Most of the 13 editors working out of the office are younger than Taylor Swift. A white picnic table strewn with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts cups and magazines like Teen Vogue and The New Yorker doubles as a meeting hub. A box of wine is perched on a kitchenette microwave.The d\u00e9cor fits the mission. Tab, a British import that recently received financing from backers including Rupert Murdoch and the Knight Foundation, is largely unknown to the general public but is gaining currency on college campuses around the country. It relies on a network of unpaid student journalists who write about youth and campus culture. It also has a small cadre of writers commenting, usually snarkily, on issues of interest to young women.\u201cThe mind-set we\u2019re looking for is super hungry, anti-establishment and a little subversive,\u201d said Joshi Herrmann, who, at 28, is both editor in chief and office elder.Ambition is also part of the mix. Since starting in the United States two years ago, Tab has set out to become a touchstone for the 18-to-22-year-old demographic it believes is underserved by other news organizations.Jack Rivlin, who founded Tab Media with two other Cambridge University students in 2009 and now splits his time between New York and London, envisions the enterprise as a generation-defining media brand \u00e0 la MTV.Other publications should beware, said Mr. Rivlin, 28, who jokes that he has only recently begun to grow facial hair: \u201cI want to eat their lunch.\u201dIn Tab\u2019s Williamsburg office \u2014 there\u2019s another in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 story ideas slingshot around the room, from the Pennsylvania State University hazing trial to wedding training programs at high schools to potential Dream Act-related deportations. There was also an idea from one correspondent to report on local sex parties by participating in several.Tab uses traditional journalism tools like Freedom of Information Act filings, door-to-door sleuthing and libel training. But it also digs deep into Reddit, excavates meme chains and cultivates gossip.Tab Media has two parts: The Tab, which publishes the college-centric content, and Babe, a website for young women that specializes in \u201cgood news reporting, trash trends, personal stories\u201d and stories about men with certain unappealing qualities and \u201cthe pettiest celebrity drama.\u201dEach month, 40 million people watch videos that the two outlets post on social media, according to data the company compiled from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. Ten million people a month visit Tab sites, with roughly two-thirds going The Tab and the rest to Babe, according to Tab\u2019s Google Analytics data.In the past year, 2,300 students globally have written for the organization, nearly 1,000 of them regularly. The Tab has outlets at every Ivy League university and plans to expand to more than 100 American campuses.Mr. Rivlin and The Tab\u2019s other founders came up with the idea for company while working for the Cambridge student newspaper, a stuffy publication that none of their friends read, he said.The Tab\u2019s name is a play on \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201cCantab,\u201d a nickname for Cambridge alums. The enterprise initially drew criticism for its \u201cTab Totty\u201d feature, which showcased photos of scantily clad female undergraduates. While that feature was quickly eliminated, two of The Tab\u2019s British outlets still run a \u201cRear of the Year\u201d competition.But the website, which soon spread to other British campuses, also featured exclusive stories about a student who fought for ISIS and a Cambridge student in white tie burning cash in front of a homeless man. In the United States, much larger media organizations made reference to The Tab\u2019s reporting on campus protests, and the publication delivered a scoop last year by reporting on Malia Obama\u2019s decision to attend Harvard.Mr. Herrmann, who first wrote for The Tab at Cambridge and later for The London Evening Standard, said that many of the volunteer writers sign up out of curiosity but eventually pursue media careers.That is partly because The Tab offers its reporters training about sourcing, social media and privacy and sends out regular emails with journalism job listings. Editors at the two headquarters are paid, but few of the reporters are, and only for significant projects.Roughly 70 percent of Tab Media\u2019s revenue \u2014 $600,000 in August, the company said \u2014 comes from sponsored stories commissioned by companies like Spotify and Unilever and written to resemble news articles. The rest comes from display advertising from companies like Netflix and Ikea.The company completed a round of financing this year that brought in $6 million for website improvements, training and special projects. The lead investor was News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.Mr. Rivlin said he and George Marangos-Gilks, one of the other founders, pitched the site to the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, using a 100-page book of printed Tab stories. Mr. Rivlin attended the meeting wearing shoes borrowed from a friend\u2019s father. He still had traces of glitter on his face from a music festival he had recently attended.The Tab is often compared to other youth-focused websites such as The Odyssey Online, launched from Indiana University in 2014, which also uses volunteer writers to cover a range of topics. Spoon University, which was bought in May by Scripps Networks Interactive, compiles articles about food contributed by college students and other young writers.Balderton Capital, a venture capital firm in London, chose to invest in Tab Media. Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner, said he was impressed by company\u2019s high engagement rates and reader loyalty.\u201cIn a world where most new media titles basically push themselves on social media with click-bait headlines and hope for a random click, The Tab was able to write high quality journalism on serious and fun topics and have a community of readers come back loyally every week and sometimes every day,\u201d Mr. Chandratillake wrote in an email.Alumni of The Tab have gone on to work for Vice, The Guardian, Reuters, Huffington Post and many other publications. Several have stayed on to help shape the company as it evolves.\u201cIn five years, what we\u2019re going to be doing might be a bit broader,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep passing this on, kind of recklessly throwing the keys to very young editorial people and see what they come up with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everything I did took 100 percent of my energy. It was by far the most exhausting character I\u2019ve ever done, physically and mentally.\u201dLike the shark in \u201cJaws,\u201d Pennywise doesn\u2019t get much screen time in \u201cIt,\u201d making his sudden appearances all the more shocking. Mr. Skarsgard didn\u2019t begin to work on the film until a month and a half into production, long after the actors playing the high school outcasts who unite against the psycho clown had started. The director, Andy Muschietti, suggested Mr. Skarsgard stay away from his young co-stars before he shot his first scene in character.\u201cPennywise was this looming force they knew was coming but hadn\u2019t seen yet,\u201d Mr. Skarsgard said. \u201cThat built an excitement in the kids you could feel when they saw him for the first time. They were probably a bit scared.\u201dMr. Skarsgard felt fear himself when he landed the role after a long audition period that included \u201ca callback, a screen test and sending additional self-tape from Stockholm before it was official,\u201d he said. \u201cI was equally as excited as I was terrified when I booked the job, because now these people expected me to pull it off. It was a nervous time.\u201dAfter extensive preparation that involved makeup and costume tests and consultations with a clowning coach, Mr. Skarsgard came up with a conception of the character in line with Mr. Muschietti\u2019s vision. \u201cPennywise is constantly on the level of bursting,\u201d the actor said. \u201cHis voice is this shaky, crackly thing. At almost any moment, he could lunge at you.\u201dThe villain is so far removed from the soft-spoken Mr. Skarsgard\u2019s own personality that he\u2019s not concerned about getting typecast. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with one character, because I want to be able to do different roles,\u201d he said. \u201cPennywise looks and sounds so different from me that I could do a rom-com next, and people probably wouldn\u2019t even know I was the same guy.\u201d (In fact, his next role is in another Stephen King-inspired project, the Hulu drama series \u201cCastle Rock.\u201d)No matter what lies ahead in his career, Mr. Skarsgard can count on the support of his family, including his older brother Alexander and father, Stellan, also a renowned actor (\u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d \u201cBreaking the Waves\u201d). \u201cThey were always encouraging, but I\u2019ve tried not to seek advice from them, because I wanted to feel independent,\u201d Mr. Skarsgard said. \u201cAs I grow older and more comfortable with who I am, I realize asking for help is important.\u201dHe said Alexander saw \u201cIt\u201d at its recent Los Angeles premiere and praised his work.\u201cI\u2019m proud of the film, and it means a lot when I get to show it to my family and they appreciate it,\u201d Bill Skarsgard said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Milestone for BMI: More Than $1 Billion in Music Royalties", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBMI reached its goal one year early.The organization, whose hundreds of thousands of members include stars like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Sting, announced on Thursday that it had $1.13 billion in revenue and distributed $1.02 billion in royalties during its most recent fiscal year, which ended in June. BMI and other performing rights organizations, like its rival Ascap, collect money whenever songs are played on the radio, streamed online or piped into a restaurant.\u201cRevenue is a great number,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said in an interview, \u201cbut distributions are actually what goes into a songwriter\u2019s pocket.\u201dAs record sales have fallen, so have the \u201cmechanical\u201d royalties associated with that format. At the same time, the performing rights licensed by BMI, Ascap and a handful of others have grown, helped by the rise of music streaming services and by deals with new types of businesses like Netflix and Hulu.Still, the value of the music publishing business, the side of the industry that deals with the copyrights for songwriting and composition, keeps rising. According to the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, the United States publishing business generated $2.65 billion last year.BMI\u2019s collections in its most recent fiscal year were up almost 7 percent from the year before, and its royalty distributions were up 10 percent. Its media licensing category, which includes radio, broadcast television and cable, generated $524 million in revenue, an annual gain of $32 million.But those types of businesses now make up less of BMI\u2019s overall pie than they used to. In 2010, for example, media licenses accounted for 82 percent of BMI\u2019s domestic revenue, and are now 63 percent, according to BMI reports.The biggest gains in recent years have come in so-called general licensing \u2014 which includes restaurants, retail stores and doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 and, especially, from online services. In 2010, BMI collected $20 million from what it then called \u201cnew media,\u201d accounting for just 3 percent of its domestic revenue. In its most recent year, that category, now called digital, took in $163 million, nearly 20 percent of the total.Over the last year, BMI, whose full name is Broadcast Music Inc., processed nearly 1.4 trillion performances, up 40 percent from the year before, the organization said. Of that total, 1.35 trillion were digital.For both BMI and Ascap, their recent gains have come under a cloud of uncertainty, as major publishers have threatened to withdraw their catalogs and the entire process of collective licensing has come under scrutiny by the federal government.Mr. O\u2019Neill said that no matter what the outcome of the appeal, BMI would continue to work to make money for its members.\u201cOur goal is to make sure that songwriting can continue as a profession,\u201d he said, \u201cand not simply a hobby.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You don\u2019t have to scroll down too far on the site\u2019s home page to find \u201c200 Essential Movies to Watch Now,\u201d touting several movies that received Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 \u201ccertified fresh\u201d scores; the top row of the movies offered from $1.99 up features \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201cThe Third Man,\u201d \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d and \u201cAll About Eve.\u201d In what may strike some as slightly paradoxical, this \u00e0 la carte site is actually doing more to promote classic film than Netflix. (In fairness to Netflix, which is more and more often being castigated for its indifference to classic film, the site never sold itself as a portal for any such thing.)FandangoNow, in addition to being a stand-alone video-on-demand transaction site, also wants to be \u201ca full movie-life-cycle marketer,\u201d as Mr. Rockmore put it. The ticketing site has an editorial component; on Fandango, the managing editor Erik Davis, whose numerous television appearances present him as an amiably gruff friendly neighborhood movie lover, contributes blog posts; on FandangoNow, Alicia Malone, whose book on women working in film, \u201cBackwards & In Heels,\u201d was published earlier this year, contributes an energetic indie movie guide.Fandango does remarkably well in the ticket-selling business. Its sales accounted for more than 25% of the opening weekend box office of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Blockbuster seasons aren\u2019t the only good time for the operation. During the coming awards season, Fandango and FandangoNow can promote Golden Globe and Oscar contenders both in theaters and beyond. Mainstream entertainment mavens can love that kind of synergy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Dealer Who Saved My Life", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes when I dream, I imagine the sky over Harlem is a lofty arc of stained glass. A dusted copper heaven streaked with gold and siphoned from Klimt\u2019s aureate imagination. A profanely ornate firmament raining down with the cherubic drug dealers I grew up with in the 1970s. A legion of natty angels, felled by the hubris of fraudulent invincibility. One might envision them as the offspring of Icarus. I call them The Scramblin\u2019 Kids of Harlem.Bad Boy not only launched the career of Christopher Wallace \u2014 \u201cThe Notorious B.I.G.\u201d \u2014 but it also transported an urban folklore from the streets of the South Bronx, Harlem and Bed-Stuy to the runways of New York, London and Paris. Not unlike Jean-Luc Godard and Jacques Demy with cinema\u2019s Nouvelle Vague or Matisse and Derain with Fauvism, Diddy\u2019s Bad Boy milieu of ghetto-fabulous grew into a global movement.Unquestionably, Mr. Combs\u2019s sensibilities in music and fashion have been imbued by his experience of growing up in Harlem. Although I am more than a decade older than him, I share a similar experience, as our formative years were sculpted in the same neighborhood, Esplanade Gardens.A honeycomb of high-rise co-op apartments, Esplanade brought together African-American families from every socioeconomic stratum. I can fondly remember the fierce games of 21 on the basketball courts of I.S. 10 (currently known as the Frederick Douglass Academy), where I played against kids who not only attended Dalton and Hunter Prep, but also Brandeis, Julia Richman and my own high school, Charles Evans Hughes (now renamed the Humanities Educational Complex).Though we all came from disparate walks of life, we were united in the efficacy of becoming constructive, productive and dignified young black men.We also wanted to look good. Just like the Scramblin\u2019 Kids.Back in the day, I used to hear guys compare the process of milling raw heroin with the way eggs were scrambled. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s where the term derived from, but whatever the case, I wanted to dress like a Scramblin\u2019 Kid. I wanted to rock a dope herringbone Pierre Cardin blazer without selling dope.I admired the gear of the fashionable boy soldiers who crossed West 116th Street and Eighth Avenue as if it was their own personal Rubicon. The corner boy warriors who carried cargoes of ill-gotten gains in Sloan Super Market shopping bags and who knew there was no turning back.These nickel-bag bombardiers wore designer labels like sartorial armor. The Scramblin\u2019 Kids rocked Gucci and YSL in the bleachers of the Rucker tournament in the summer, and beneath silent snowfalls of winter adorned themselves in Roffe ski suits and Timberland boots as they supplied the roaring addicts.I saw the Scramblin\u2019 Kids as the Special Forces of Sorrow, and they became my collective template for the characters I would later create for the screen, like Nino Brown in \u201cNew Jack City,\u201d Birdie in \u201cAbove the Rim\u201d and Romello and Raynathan Skuggs in \u201cSugar Hill.\u201dI can distinctly remember one day in June in 1978 when I ran into two contemporaries of mine in front of the Kentucky Fried Chicken on 146th and Lenox Avenue. (Yes, I still say Lenox Avenue and not Malcolm X Boulevard.) They were resplendent, in the most incredible suits I had ever seen. When I asked one kid \u2014 I\u2019ll call him Billy \u2014 what he was wearing, he laughed and said, \u201cThis is Armani. You don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 \u2019bout this.\u201dIt was Billy who admonished me when I was trying to make a purchase at his alfresco coke bazaar on 129th and St. Nicholas. The year was 1976, and I was about to leave New York to attend my freshman (and only) year at North Carolina Central University.I had tried cocaine as a Hughes High School senior, on a bathroom break during my psychology class. (We were reading Freud\u2019s \u201c\u00dcber Coca.\u201d Go figure.) I didn\u2019t like cocaine, but cocaine meant status for an insecure 17-year-old trying to fit in. It didn\u2019t work.Back to the street mise en scene: As I tried to purchase a $20 foil of \u201cflake,\u201d Billy made a beeline directly to me. \u201cYo, Barry, does Mrs. Cooper know you\u2019re out here?\u201d he yelled as he shoved his unsuspecting worker to the side.I never went back to that block. Billy may have saved my life that day.It was also Billy who, a few weeks after my \u201cScared Straight\u201d encounter, professed his admiration for me. It happened after I saved up enough from my Neighborhood Youth Corps summer job to buy a pair of $105 Nino Gabriele loafers. (The brown color of the boutique\u2019s distinctive plastic valise generated the name of the character that would make Wesley Snipes a household name.)Tragically, Billy was murdered a few years after he chased me away from that street corner. The scene in \u201cSugar Hill\u201d with Wesley Snipes\u2019s Romello and Donald Faison\u2019s young and fatally foolish Kymie is dedicated to him and that epiphanic moment in my life.Barry Michael Cooper, a filmmaker and journalist, wrote the screenplays for \u201cNew Jack City,\u201d \u201cSugar Hill\u201d and \u201cAbove the Rim.\u201d He is also a producer and writer of Spike Lee\u2019s Netflix series, \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d which will have its premiere in November.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Shape of Water\u2019 Takes Top Venice Film Festival Prize", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuillermo Del Toro\u2019s \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d was awarded the Golden Lion for best film at the 74th Venice International Film Festival by the jury led by Annette Bening. In the film, set in the 1960s, a mute cleaning woman (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with a fishlike hominid in a top-secret laboratory.\u201cAs a Mexican, I want to say this is a first for a Mexican storyteller,\u201d Mr. Del Toro said in his acceptance speech.The Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize went to Samuel Maoz\u2019s \u201cFoxtrot,\u201d about an Israeli family\u2019s grief over their soldier son. Mr. Maoz won the Golden Lion for \u201cLebanon\u201d in 2009. The Silver Lion for best director was given to a tearful Xavier Legrand for his family drama \u201cCustody,\u201d which was also awarded the Lion of the Future Luigi De Laurentiis Award for a Debut Film.In the performance categories, Charlotte Rampling received best actress for Andrea Pallaoro\u2019s \u201cHannah\u201d and in her speech recalled making her first feature in Italy. Kamel El Basha won best actor for his role as a Palestinian foreman in \u201cThe Insult,\u201d which he described as his first major feature film role after years in theater.The British playwright Martin McDonagh won the best screenplay award for his latest film, \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d The Special Jury Prize went to \u201cSweet Country,\u201d Warwick Thornton\u2019s period drama of the Australian outback.The festival\u2019s first ever competition prize for best VR was given to \u201cArden\u2019s Wake (Expanded)\u201d by a jury led by the director John Landis. Laurie Anderson\u2019s \u201cLa Camera Insabbiata\u201d won for best virtual reality experience, and \u201cBloodless,\u201d about a camp town serving United States Army soldiers in South Korea, won for best virtual reality story.The festival\u2019s Orizzonti competition, sometimes home to more adventurous works, awarded best film to the music biopic \u201cNico, 1988\u201d by the director Susanna Nicchiarelli. The Iranian film \u201cNo Date, No Signature\u201d won two prizes, for best director and best actor. The section\u2019s special jury prize was bestowed on \u201cCaniba,\u201d whose directors Verena Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor gave their thanks in a video message featuring floating heart effects.Golden Lions for Lifetime Achievement were presented last week to Jane Fonda and Robert Redford, who starred in the out-of-competition selection \u201cOur Souls at Night.\u201dThe official competition was notable for big films that approached issues of social concern from surprising angles. The festival\u2019s opening film, Alexander Payne\u2019s \u201cDownsizing,\u201d received raves from Variety and The Hollywood Reporter for its tragicomic story starring Matt Damon as a man who undergoes a popular shrinking process in order to cut costs. George Clooney\u2019s latest directorial effort, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d is a slow-burn caper set in a 1950s suburban development that has accepted its first black family. It is scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen and also stars Mr. Damon alongside Julianne Moore, and evoked some comparison to the race-based mob violence last month in Charlottesville.Mr. Wiseman\u2019s \u201cEx Libris\u201d and Mr. Del Toro\u2019s \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d were two very different favorites on the Lido, the Venetian island where the festival takes place. The fantastical premise of \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d is set against the backdrop of Kennedy-era America with an emphasis on the attitudes of the period. Michael Shannon plays a bigoted government investigator in a cast that includes Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, and Michael Stuhlbarg. The Hollywood Reporter called the result \u201ca portrait of morally corrupt early-1960s America with an outsider tale of love and friendship molded by a master storyteller.\u201dMr. Wiseman\u2019s \u201cEx Libris\u201d takes a three-hour-plus tour of the New York Public Library system and its myriad literary activities and social services. \u201cSimmering just below the surface is a political message about libraries as places of social and intellectual engagement, empowered memory and pursuit of the truth in an America where such values are under attack,\u201d Screen Daily wrote. Mr. Wiseman previously won a Golden Lion for lifetime achievement in 2014.Mr. McDonagh\u2019s darkly comic \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d also evoked comparisons to the strife in Charlottesville in August. It stars Frances McDormand as a mother who protests the handling of her daughter\u2019s murder by the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson). The film won passionate applause at its premiere and was a favorite in a poll of international and Italian critics, alongside \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d and \u201cEx Libris.\u201dOther noted films were two coming-of-age stories: Andrew Haigh\u2019s \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d with a well-liked lead performance by the up-and-comer Charlie Plummer, winner of the Marcello Mastroianni Award for an emerging actor; and Anne Fontaine\u2019s \u201cReinventing Marvin,\u201d the winner of the Queer Lion award for films on gay culture, starring Finnegan Oldfield. Finally, the Venice slate also included a new virtual reality work by Tsai Mingliang and the six-part Netflix series \u201cWormwood,\u201d from Errol Morris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Visited the Catskills and Decided to Stay", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRentersLike most Brooklyn renters, Robert Collignon never expected to buy a snow shovel, let alone a Subaru Forester.\u201cThe idea was that I\u2019d come up here and buckle down for a few months, but I really fell in love,\u201d said Mr. Collignon, 35, sipping a beer one late-summer afternoon on the deck of the cabin he rents in Hobart, N.Y., about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from the city. \u201cI kept on adding one month, then another. Then I stayed through the winter.\u201dA year and a half later, he has no intention of returning to the city. Hence, last winter\u2019s purchase of a snow shovel and \u201cthe requisite Subaru,\u201d with four-wheel drive and heated seats.The renovated hunting cabin, which he rents for $1,000 a month (a little less than half of his Williamsburg rent), lies down a long dirt driveway, off a quiet country road. It\u2019s surrounded by a large lawn \u2014 he devotes about an hour each week to mowing it \u2014 which slopes down to a marshy pond.But like his two cats, who were once confined to his Brooklyn one-bedroom but now prowl indoors and out \u2014 catching, by his estimate, two mice a day, in addition to the occasional rabbit and snake \u2014 Mr. Collignon has come to love the rural life.\u201cThe property is growing on me. In the spring, all of a sudden baby animals are everywhere. The birds all came back, and I watched the geese grow up,\u201d he said. \u201cI sit here in the mornings, drinking coffee, and I can\u2019t complain.\u201dThe cabin is small, about 600 square feet, with one bedroom downstairs and a low-ceilinged loft, reached by a ladderlike staircase, that runs the length of the building. It is unusual for the area, he said, both in its size and aesthetic. The space has modern, airy feel \u2014 large windows offer expansive views of the surrounding mountains \u2014 and the walls and wood floors have been painted white.\u201cMost stuff up here is like ski lodges or vacation houses; it\u2019s much larger. And I didn\u2019t need or a want a three-bedroom log cabin. This is better for a single person,\u201d said Mr. Collignon, who found his place through a local broker he discovered on Craigslist. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything else like this, either. It was all either grandma-chic, with drapes and doilies everywhere, or decorated like a hunting lodge.\u201dEven so, it took a little while to get used to some aspects of country life, like hearing strange rustlings in the bushes at night and seeing people with shotguns walking on the side of the road in the morning when he was driving to work. \u201cHunters,\u201d he\u2019d remind himself. The closest movie theater is an hour away, and most of the area restaurants are closed Monday through Wednesday.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block, however, has been the lack of internet service. The cabin gets only satellite service, which means no streaming movies or binge-watching television shows. \u201cI have to get Netflix DVDs in the mail. That\u2019s basically the evening entertainment. That and cooking. It\u2019s lonely at times, for sure,\u201d said Mr. Collignon, adding that he does his best to entice friends to visit, an easier task in summer than winter.The early stages of their courtship were a little complicated, but now, in some ways, they have the best of both real estate worlds. He has an apartment where he can stay in the city and she has a country house. She has even hinted that she might be willing to join him upstate someday \u2014 if the internet situation were to improve. (So she could work from upstate, that is.)\u201cAt first, I really missed the city and wanted to go down a lot and see people, but at some point it flipped,\u201d Mr. Collignon said. \u201cI miss my friends now, but I don\u2019t really miss Brooklyn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney Plots Streaming, From \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and Marvel to Pay-Per-Sports", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Disney\u2019s two planned streaming services took clearer shape on Thursday, as the entertainment giant vowed to bring \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Marvel movies to one and proposed a novel approach to the other: sports \u00e1 la carte.\u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference in New York.On Thursday, Mr. Iger said that the company\u2019s Hollywood-oriented service would be introduced in \u201clate 2019\u201d and would include all new-release movies made by Walt Disney Studios, which includes Disney\u2019s core film factory as well as Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. That means the \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Marvel movies will eventually leave Netflix, which has been paying Disney handsomely for streaming rights.Also available on Disney\u2019s entertainment service will be older films from its vaunted library, which includes more than 400 titles.Mr. Iger said Disney is also working on five original, live-action, Disney-branded movies that will be delivered exclusively through the service. Additionally, it will offer a handful of original Disney-branded shows, several original TV movies, recent seasons of Disney Channel hits and 7,000 episodes of older shows.The service will also roll out overseas.\u201cA very, very rich treasure trove\u201d is how Mr. Iger described the offerings. He declined to say how much subscriptions would cost.The ESPN service will arrive sooner \u2014 \u201csometime this spring,\u201d Mr. Iger said \u2014 and include, as previously disclosed, thousands of events not currently shown on ESPN, including hockey, baseball, tennis, college sports. But Mr. Iger said that Disney is hoping to provide a different buying model, at least eventually. Rather than charging one price for subscriptions, Disney\u2019s sports service may allow users granular control over what they pay to watch \u2014 \u201ca season, a league, maybe a conference,\u201d Mr. Iger said.\u201cThink about iTunes,\u201d he hinted.Disney also used the investor conference to set earnings expectations for its 2017 fiscal year, which will conclude in a few weeks. Mr. Iger said that earnings per share would be \u201croughly in line\u201d with results for 2016, when it had per-share profit of $5.72. Higher costs related to a new N.B.A. programming deal and the lack of a major \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie will contribute to Disney\u2019s flat 2017 results. Mr. Iger also said that Disney will feel some financial effects from Hurricane Irma, which has disrupted Disney Cruise itineraries.Disney shares fell 4 percent after his remarks, to about $97.51 in midday trading. Contributing to the sell-off may have been a warning from Comcast at the same conference: Matt Strauss, a Comcast executive vice president, said his company expected to lose 100,000 to 150,000 subscribers in the third quarter. Analysts had expected a gain. Comcast shares traded down 7 percent, to roughly $38.26.Advertisement"}

Bright lines are dividing those supporting President Trump and those vilifying him, and Hollywood has never been shy about signaling where it stands.And so Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards, as much as they were a celebration of artistic accomplishment, were also a statement that, eight months into a Trump presidency, topical and decidedly progressive shows rule the day in television \u2014 at least among the industry insiders who dole out the accolades.\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which revived its fortunes last season with a weekly skewering of Mr. Trump, claimed the most awards of any show Sunday. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a dystopian drama that tapped into fears about authoritarianism in America, nabbed best drama and several other awards. And individual winners like Alec Baldwin, Donald Glover and John Oliver took the stage to spoof Mr. Trump and give voice to the liberal worldview that prevails in much of the entertainment industry.A few hours after the ceremony, the former Emmy winner Jon Hamm described it as \u201cthe most diverse, most different, most interesting Emmy show I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dWhen his former co-star on \u201cMad Men,\u201d Elisabeth Moss, was asked if she had seen an Emmys quite this political, she was emphatic.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, holding an Emmy in each hand, including the one she won for best actress for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve also never seen anything like where our country is right now.\u201dAll year, late night shows with an anti-Trump bent and left-leaning cable news shows like Rachel Maddow\u2019s on MSNBC have seen their ratings soar, and now that political posture has received the seal of approval from Emmys voters.But it also means that the Emmys, and all awards shows, for that matter, are part of a broader cultural divide. And to its critics, Hollywood may be proving yet again that it lives in an elite, self-congratulatory bubble, showering awards on shows that reflect its worldview while ignoring the millions of people who prefer \u201cNCIS\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\u201cRemember, it\u2019s California,\u201d said Margaret Atwood, the author of the novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d on which the Hulu show was based, as she glided into her first Emmys party at age 77. \u201cThis would not happen in a lot of other states. This would, in fact, be a lot different. This is its own world here.\u201dThe show did not draw a big audience. The ceremony, hosted by Stephen Colbert, attracted just 11.38 million viewers, Nielsen said, in line with last year\u2019s total, which was a record low.On Fox News on Monday morning, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said viewers were \u201ctuning out\u201d because of how politicized the Emmys have become, and suggested that Hollywood\u2019s anti-Trump posturing had become tiresome.\u201cThey got plucked and polished and waxed, and some of them didn\u2019t eat for two months, and all for what?\u201d she said. \u201cTo sound the same?\u201dStill, the heated political climate produced some startling changes for the Emmys.\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has never appealed much to Emmy voters, and they had not given it a top show award in more than two decades. But just two years removed from inviting Mr. Trump to host \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d the NBC late night show excoriated him this past season, and reaped the rewards: Mr. Baldwin won an Emmy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who portrayed both Ms. Conway and Hillary Clinton, won an Emmy as well.\u201c\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 had a career year,\u201d said Warren Littlefield, a longtime Emmy voter who is a former NBC executive and a producer of \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cYou had to watch \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 to get an appreciation of the world we\u2019re living in, and it helped us endure what we\u2019re all living with.\u201dOther shows benefited as well, including Mr. Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d which won the prize for best variety talk show for the second consecutive year. Mr. Oliver delights in using Mr. Trump as a punching bag on his show.Mr. Glover of \u201cAtlanta\u201d and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of \u201cVeep\u201d were among the many winners who mocked President Trump on stage. And after Mr. Baldwin won, he alluded to the fact that Mr. Trump had long coveted an Emmy but never won one. \u201cI suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,\u201d Mr. Baldwin quipped.What benefited those shows, however, appeared to have hurt dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d both of which were decidedly retro and unpolitical.\u201cStranger Things\u201d was a sci-fi homage to movies like \u201cStand by Me\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d was a heart-on-your-sleeve family drama that took inspiration from the 1983 tear-jerker \u201cTerms of Endearment.\u201dStill, Hulu\u2019s success was a shock in its own right. Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, Comcast, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, has a smaller programming budget compared with those of streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon.But \u201cHandmaid\u2019s,\u201d which was in development long before the Trump administration, struck a chord with viewers concerned about women\u2019s rights, and its creators proudly embraced the fact that some regarded their show as eerily timely.\u201cPolitics is at the front of everybody\u2019s head, not in the back of everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d said Bruce Miller, an executive producer for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI think all of the media, including the fictional and nonfictional media, are benefiting from taking that head-on. I have been told that you don\u2019t talk about religion and politics in kind company. Well, there\u2019s no company now where you don\u2019t talk about politics these days.\u201d\u201cPeople are talking about and thinking about some serious things and things that are uncomfortable,\u201d he added. \u201cShows that directly address difficult topics are having their day in the sun.\u201dEarly reviews for the series, which had its premiere three months after the inauguration, were positive, and it has been the show of the year for many TV critics.Hulu\u2019s marketing department took no chances. The streaming service bought its first-ever Super Bowl ad for an original series, even though the event was months before the premiere. And throughout the year, Hulu hired actresses to don red capes like characters in the show, and circulate in cities like Austin (during the South by Southwest Festival), New York, Los Angeles and Washington to create word-of-mouth buzz.Because Hulu does not release viewership data, it is impossible to know how popular \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d was, but it was far more successful than its previous iteration. In 1990, the novel was adapted into a feature film that was a flop at the box office and did not receive warm reviews.\u201cWe got a Trump bump!\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a producer behind both the movie and the TV show. \u201cTiming is everything. If we didn\u2019t have the president we have now, I don\u2019t know if it would have been this successful.\u201dMs. Atwood underscored that point as well.\u201cI wrote it in 1985,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some incredulity then: \u2018Margaret, you\u2019re way over the top! it could never happen here.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t hear any of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It\u2019 Breaks September Records, Supercharging the Box Office", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe R-rated movie, adapted from Stephen King\u2019s 1986 novel about a demonic clown, Pennywise, who emerges from a sewer to prey on children, had been expected by box office analysts to take in roughly $70 million over its first three days \u2014 a total that seemed almost unbelievable in itself, given that the previous record-holder for a September release was the PG-rated \u201cHotel Transylvania 2,\u201d which arrived to about $50 million in 2015.\u201cParanormal Activity 3,\u201d which had about $58 million in initial ticket sales in October 2011, after adjusting for inflation, was the previous record-holder for a horror movie released at any time of year, according to comScore.What clicked with \u201cIt\u201d in such spectacular fashion?\u201cWhenever a movie overperforms to this degree \u2014 becomes a tent pole \u2014 there is some kind of cultural accelerant at play,\u201d said Toby Emmerich, president of Warner Bros. Pictures Group. \u201cIt,\u201d which did particularly well in Imax theaters, collected an additional $62 million overseas. Mr. Emmerich already has a sequel in the works.But \u201cIt\u201d is not a typical horror film. \u201cThe message of the movie is actually hope,\u201d said Dan Lin, an \u201cIt\u201d producer. \u201cIf we stick together and rely on one another\u2019s strength, loyalty and goodness, we can \u2014 like the kids in the film \u2014 overcome our fears and the evil in the world.\u201dHorror movies (in particular one about killing kids) are tricky to sell to a wide audience; playing down the scary parts might make non-horror fans more interested, but that strategy risks driving away the core fan base. \u201cYou have to be very careful not to deteriorate the scare,\u201d Ms. Rich said.An article on Monday about the commercial success of the new horror film \u201cIt\u201d misstated the given name of the film\u2019s director. He is Andy Muschietti, not Anthony.Advertisement"}
