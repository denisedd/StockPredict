{"Headline": "The World According to Dan Brown", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileRYE BEACH, N.H. \u2014 Anyone who has read Dan Brown\u2019s work \u2014 and with 200 million copies of his books in print, you know who you are \u2014 is familiar with his signature technique of inserting little chunks of expository information into the narrative. Among the topics addressed in his latest thriller, \u201cOrigin\u201d: the wide-ranging talents of Winston Churchill, the elusive appeal of abstract art, the exciting peculiarities of Gaudi\u2019s Sagrada Familia cathedral and the latest insane developments in the world of artificial intelligence.This is central to the Brown approach, because he himself prefers literature that is instructive and, ideally, not wholly invented. \u201cI feel like if I\u2019m going to take time reading, I better be learning,\u201d he said recently. He was sitting in his large and cunningly designed house here in the New Hampshire countryside. Of his novels, he said: \u201cThis is the kind of fiction I would read if I read fiction.\u201d\u201cOrigin\u201d is Mr. Brown\u2019s eighth novel. It finds his familiar protagonist, the brilliant Harvard professor of symbology and religious iconography Robert Langdon, embroiled once more in an intellectually challenging, life-threatening adventure involving murderous zealots, shadowy fringe organizations, paradigm-shifting secrets with implications for the future of humanity, symbols within puzzles and puzzles within symbols and a female companion who is super-smart and super-hot.As do all of Mr. Brown\u2019s works, the new novel does not shy away from the big questions, but rather rushes headlong into them. Here the question is: Can science make religion obsolete?\u201cOrigin,\u201d is to be published by Doubleday Oct. 3, with an initial printing of 2 million copies, eventually extending to several dozen countries in 42 languages, according to the publisher. Readers will find in it a familiar swirl of big ideas and nonstop action, so that those who aren\u2019t enchanted by the erudition can find relief in the plot, and vice versa.Mr. Brown, 53, spent four years writing and researching the book. He is nothing if not disciplined. He rises at 4 a.m. each day and prepares a smoothie comprising \u201cblueberries, spinach, banana, coconut water, chia seeds, hemp seeds and \u2026 what\u2019s the other kind of seed?\u201d he asked. \u201cFlax seeds, and this sort of weird protein powder made out of peas.\u201d He also makes so-called bulletproof coffee, with butter and coconut oil, which he says changes \u201cthe way your brain processes the caffeine\u201d so as to sharpen your mind.His computer is programmed to freeze for 60 seconds each hour, during which time Mr. Brown performs push-ups, situps and anything else he needs to do. Though he stops writing at noon, it\u2019s hard for him to get the stories out of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s madness,\u201d he said of his characters. \u201cThey talk to you all day.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s books have made him rich, but he does not have the aura of a rich person. His house, concealed behind gates, is not so much the home of a flashy millionaire as that of a person with the means to alter his surroundings in any wildly idiosyncratic way he (and his wife) want to.He showed me around on condition that I didn\u2019t present the house as \u201cincredibly ostentatious.\u201dNo, more like fantastically bonkers. Push a button on a library shelf, and it swings around to reveal a secret shelf that contains the first Brown book (\u201cThe Giraffe, the Pig, and The Pants On Fire,\u201d written when he was 5) and an exotic scientific-looking object that turns out to be the antimatter prop used in the film of \u201cAngels and Demons.\u201d Touch the corner of a painting in the living room, and it slides aside to expose a hidden room whose walls are decorated with gold records, awarded to Mr. Brown as a result of vast audiobook sales in Germany.Outside a bathroom is an antique Bible opened to Job 38:11 \u2014 \u201cHitherto shalt thou come, but no further.\u201d (\u201cThat means it\u2019s occupied,\u201d Mr. Brown said.) The inside of the door is covered top to bottom with a replica of a page from one of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s notebooks, written in backward handwriting. \u201cIt\u2019s one of his famous quotes, which you cannot read until you close this door and position yourself on the toilet or at the sink and read it in the mirror,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Also, look over there. It\u2019s the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d smiling enigmatically from her canvas on a different wall.The house is also full of paintings, sculptures and unexpected additional works by Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Blythe, who has a taste for the macabre. A dining room sideboard contains a tableau featuring taxidermied animals like a fox and a pheasant; a table in the kitchen holds a Hieronymus Bosch-like sculpture replete with tiny skeletons and other objects churning together in a hellish configuration.\u201cBlythe has a fixation with death,\u201d Mr. Brown said cheerfully. \u201cOnce she literally took me on a date to a cemetery.\u201d The two met more than 20 years ago in Los Angeles, where Mr. Brown moved after graduating from Amherst College. He grew up in Exeter, N.H., and went to high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father taught math. (I was at the school as well and knew him slightly.)At the time, Mr. Brown was a not-successful musician; his future wife, more than a decade older than he is, was the director of artistic development at the National Academy for Songwriters. Because of their unequal work relationship, they dated in secret for seven years, Mr. Brown said, at one point even attending the Grammys together, along with fake dates, to conceal the romance.Among other features of their house: a shirt signed by the members of Germany\u2019s 2014 World Cup-winning soccer team; a cantilevered staircase built right out of the wall, with no supports from above or below; and two pillars that are exact replicas of those in Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, which appeared in \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d and was quickly overrun by Brown enthusiasts searching for the Holy Grail.Downstairs, there\u2019s a medieval suit of armor, moved here after an unsuccessful sojourn in a more prominent spot.\u201cWe built a niche for it in the library, and it was just overkill,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIt sort of felt like \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019 or something.\u201dIts owner seems a little bit bemused to find himself in possession of such a rarefied object. \u201cI\u2019m not a car person,\u201d he said. \u201cThree years after \u2018The Da Vinci Code\u2019 came out, I still had my old, rusted Volvo. And people are like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have a Maserati?\u2019 It never occurred to me. It wasn\u2019t a priority for me. I just didn\u2019t care.\u201dEventually, he bought a Lexus hybrid SUV, and then after that a Tesla sports car, which also did not sit easily with him.\u201cI felt like a jerk,\u201d he said. \u201c I felt like I needed a gold chain and a ponytail or something. This one feels like the minivan of Teslas.\u201dHe and I got into the car, which indeed looked kind of minivan-esque until it accelerated from 0 to 60 in under three seconds, right in the (not very long) driveway, and then switched lanes by itself on the highway.We were on the way to Exeter, where Mr. Brown was going to a service in honor of his mother, who died several months ago. (\u201cOrigin\u201d is dedicated to her; her initials, C.G.B., appear, very faintly, on the back cover of the book.) Mr. Brown credits his father, now 81, with instilling in him a love of science, math and intellectual puzzles, and his mother, who was religious but became disillusioned with church politics, with instilling in him a wonder for the mysteries of the world.Though Mr. Brown comes out strongly in favor of science, both in person and in his novels, he cannot give up the possibility that there is something else out there.\u201cIt\u2019s probably an intellectual weakness,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I look at the stars and I say, \u2018there\u2019s something bigger than us out there.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Self-Driving System Faulted by Safety Agency in Crash", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as the government moved Tuesday to open a clearer path for automakers to develop driverless cars, its leading safety agency waved a new warning flag.The agency said the system, known as Autopilot, had performed as intended, but lacked safeguards to prevent drivers from using it improperly.In the Florida case, the driver was able to use the system on a road for which it was not designed, and to turn his attention away from the road for an extended period just before the crash, the N.T.S.B. said.\u201cThe combined effects of human error and the lack of sufficient system controls resulted in a fatal collision that should not have happened,\u201d Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the N.T.S.B., said at a meeting during which the board\u2019s report was approved.The renewed attention to the Tesla system came as automakers are jockeying to push driverless technologies forward, while lawmakers and regulators scramble to keep pace, with the Trump administration putting forward its approach on Tuesday.The Transportation Department unveiled voluntary guidelines for testing autonomous vehicles on Tuesday as part of a broader government effort to encourage automakers\u2019 development of self-driving technology.The guidelines replace policies set down by the Obama administration last year that called for automakers to submit safety assessments of their self-driving models before testing them on public roads.Under the new guidelines, it will be left to automakers and other companies to decide whether to submit safety reviews to federal regulators. While the Trump administration will encourage public disclosures of such assessments, the documents will not be subject to federal approval.\u201cThis is not an enforcement document,\u201d Ms. Chao said. \u201cThis is a guidance document.\u201dThere will be no waiting period for a company to begin testing autonomous models, although the vehicles remain subject to broader safety rules and standards for equipment and parts.Industry officials lauded the less restrictive guidelines, which are intended to be a model for state policies. \u201cThe guidance provides the right balance, allowing emerging innovations to thrive while government still keeps a watchful eye over new developments,\u201d said the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group.In addition to Tesla\u2019s efforts, the competition to develop self-driving cars has become fierce among auto industry giants such as General Motors and Ford Motor, as well as technology companies including Google and Apple.The companies have been accelerating their testing and have backed legislation exempting autonomous vehicles from current motor vehicle laws.Some safety campaigners and consumer groups have been critical of the move toward voluntary rules covering self-driving technology, including the guidelines introduced by Ms. Chao, saying they reduce federal oversight that was already too limited.\u201cThe voluntary policy announced today is a retreat from the already flawed guidance provided in 2016,\u201d said Jason K. Levine, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. He said the lack of required safety assessments cedes power to automakers \u201cwho have frequently proven they cannot be trusted to protect the public interest in their race for profits.\u201dAutomakers and government officials contend that self-driving technology could reduce vehicle accidents and traffic fatalities, which rose by nearly 8 percent in 2015 to more than 35,000 deaths. Tesla reiterated that safety potential Tuesday after the transportation safety board issued its report on the Florida crash.The system\u2019s forward-looking camera failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky, and neither Mr. Brown nor the Autopilot system activated the brakes. Data from the car showed it had been traveling at 74 miles per hour at the time of the crash and that Mr. Brown had ignored several warnings to keep his hands on the steering wheel. A preliminary N.T.S.B. report found that he had at least seven seconds to notice the truck before impact.Like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the N.T.S.B. found that the version of Autopilot in Mr. Brown\u2019s car had performed as it had been designed to.But Mr. Sumwalt said that version of Autopilot \u201cgave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.\u201d He also said it was intended for use on limited-access highways rather than routes with cross traffic and intersections, such as the state highway Mr. Brown was traveling on.In a statement, Tesla said it \u201cappreciates\u201d the N.T.S.B.\u2019s analysis and will evaluate the agency\u2019s recommendations. \u201cWe will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times,\u201d the company said.Since the accident, Tesla has modified Autopilot to warn drivers more frequently to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the system cannot be engaged without stopping and restarting the car.Tesla has also modified how Autopilot\u2019s radar and camera sensors interact to improve its ability to recognize obstacles. The Autopilot upgrade was rolled out a year ago.Tesla introduced Autopilot in October 2015, to great fanfare. And for a time it seemed that Tesla was far ahead of the big, established automakers as the notion of self-driving cars caught the imagination of both the media and technology enthusiasts.But before long, some drivers, including Mr. Brown, began to post videos on YouTube showing that it was possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel. Some videos show drivers reading while at the wheel; in one, a driver climbs into his car\u2019s back seat.Even before the fatal crash, Tesla had come under criticism for releasing Autopilot without greater safeguards to prevent improper use. And early on, the company referred to it as a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version, suggesting it was a work in progress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Mark Zuckerberg \u2018Like\u2019 This Column?", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The idea of Mark Zuckerberg running for president was always sort of scary.But now it\u2019s really scary, given what we\u2019ve discovered about the power of his little invention to warp democracy.All these years, the 33-year-old founder of Facebook has been dismissive of the idea that social media and A.I. could be used for global domination \u2014 or even that they should be regulated.Days after Donald Trump pulled out his disorienting win, Zuckerberg told a tech conference that the contention that fake news had influenced the election was \u201ca pretty crazy idea,\u201d showing a \u201cprofound lack of empathy\u201d toward Trump voters.But all the while, the company was piling up the rubles and turning a blind eye as the Kremlin\u2019s cyber hit men weaponized anti-Hillary bots on Facebook to sway the U.S. election. Russian agents also used Facebook and Twitter trolls, less successfully, to try to upend the French election.Finally on Thursday, speaking on Facebook Live, Zuckerberg said he would give Congress more than 3,000 ads linked to Russia. As one Facebooker posted: \u201cWhy did it take EIGHT MONTHS to get here?\u201dRobert Mueller\u2019s team, as well as House and Senate investigators, are hotly pursuing the trail of Russian fake news. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security told 21 states, including Wisconsin and Ohio, that Russian agents had tried to hack their elections systems during the campaign.Some lawmakers suspect that the Russians had help in figuring out which women and blacks to target in precincts in Wisconsin and Michigan.Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee looking into Russia\u2019s intervention in 2016, has a suspect in mind. \u201cPaul Manafort made an awful lot of money coming up with a game plan for how Russian interests could be pushed in Western countries and Western elections,\u201d Heinrich told Vanity Fair.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s C.O.O., apologized for this on Wednesday and promised to fix the ad-buying tools, noting, \u201cWe never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way \u2014 and that is on us.\u201dRoose noted that in addition to the Russian chicanery, \u201cIn Myanmar, activists are accusing Facebook of censoring Rohingya Muslims, who are under attack from the country\u2019s military. In Africa, the social network faces accusations that it helped human traffickers extort victims\u2019 families by leaving up abusive videos.\u201dThe Sandberg admission was also game, set and match for Elon Musk, who has been sounding the alarm for years about the danger of Silicon Valley\u2019s creations and A.I. mind children getting out of control and hurting humanity. His pleas for safeguards and regulations have been mocked as \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201cpretty irresponsible\u201d by Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg, whose project last year was building a Jarvis-style A.I. butler for his home, likes to paint himself as an optimist and Musk as a doomsday prophet. But Sandberg\u2019s comment shows that Musk is right: The digerati at Facebook and Google are either being na\u00efve or cynical and greedy in thinking that it\u2019s enough just to have a vague code of conduct that says \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d as Google does.In July, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX told a meeting of governors that they should adopt A.I. legislation before robots start \u201cgoing down the street killing people.\u201d In August, he tweeted that A.I. going rogue represents \u201cvastly more risk than North Korea.\u201d And in September, he tweeted out a Gizmodo story headlined \u201cHackers Have Already Started to Weaponize Artificial Intelligence,\u201d reporting that researchers proved that A.I. hackers were better than humans at getting Twitter users to click on malicious links.(Musk also tweeted that it was a cautionary tale when Microsoft\u2019s chatbot, Tay, had to be swiftly shut down when Twitter users taught her how to reply with racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic slurs, talking approvingly about Hitler.)Vladimir Putin has denied digital meddling in the U.S. elections. But he understands the possibilities and threat of A.I. In a recent address, the Russian president told schoolchildren, \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d Musk agreed on Twitter that competition for A.I. superiority would be the \u201cmost likely cause of WW3.\u201dOn Thursday, touring the Moscow tech firm Yandex, Putin asked the company\u2019s chief how long it would be before superintelligent robots \u201ceat us.\u201dZuckerberg scoffs at such apocalyptic talk. His project this year was visiting all 50 states, a trip designed by former Obama strategist David Plouffe, which sparked speculation that he might be the next billionaire to seek the Oval Office.Yep. Very scary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: SoFi Chief Executive to Step Down", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMike Cagney, the co-founder and chief executive of Social Finance, is to step down from the online lender by the end of the year.The financial technology start-up known as SoFi, which has been accused of having a toxic office culture, joins a substantial list of companies grappling with cultural issues in the workplace.\u2022 Several former employees said that Mr. Cagney had inappropriate relationships with SoFi employees. Mr. Cagney often overstepped personal and business boundaries, according to interviews with more than 30 people familiar with the company.\u2022 In 2012, Mr. Cagney sent sexually explicit text messages to an executive assistant named Laura Munoz. The company and its board agreed to pay Ms. Munoz a $75,000 settlement. The same year, he also pursued a relationship with another employee.\u2022 A spokesman for SoFi said that the board had investigated a dispute between Mr. Cagney and a former employee and found no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship. The company reached a settlement after the investigation.\u2022 Mr. Cagney may have been overaggressive in expanding the business, skirting risk controls and compliance rules, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The SoFi spokesman disputed this.\u2022 There were also questions about one of its initial products. The company said it had raised $90 million in debt financing for one of the loan products that it sold to investors in 2012, but that financing never took place. The issue was brought to the board, which made no changes. SoFi eventually bought the loans back from investors.These kinds of problems have been far from rare in Silicon Valley.Venture capitalists have faced questions about their behavior toward women entrepreneurs, while accusations of sexual harassment and questions about business tactics have led to an exodus of senior leaders at Uber.On the face of it, yes.Advocates of the Milton Friedman school of free-market theory contend that anti-gouging measures discourage people from conserving goods or suppliers from bringing in goods exactly when demand is highest.Take hotel rooms, for example.If a hotel were to double the price of a room during an emergency, a family might choose to rent fewer rooms at the higher price, or they might choose to tough it out at home if their house were damaged but livable.Either option would increase the supply of hotel rooms, making them available to those who most need them, argues Matt Swolinski, director of the Center for Ethics, Economics and Public Policy at the University of San Diego.There could be even more insidious side effects of anti-gouging laws.Maybe the lesson is that during national emergencies \u2014 the ultimate distortion in daily economic activity \u2014 a free market can make the distortion worse.The question remains: How can resources be made available to poor individuals and families in a fair way?Related Reading: Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee have demanded more details from Equifax about the data breach that may have compromised sensitive information of about 143 million people.The device has a storied history, but with competition catching up, Apple has to do something big for the iPhone to remain the trendsetting device of a generation, Mr. Manjoo writes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Boosts Car Battery Power During Irma, Raising Questions of Control", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla drivers in Florida got an unexpected assist this weekend as they scrambled to evade Hurricane Irma.Owners of certain Model S sedans and Model X S.U.V.s noticed that the battery capacity of their electric cars had increased, giving them as much as 40 extra miles of range to outrun the deluge. Range anxiety \u2014 the fear that an electric vehicle will run out of charge before reaching its destination \u2014 can be magnified in emergency situations.Tesla confirmed that it had remotely enabled a free software upgrade for vehicles in the path of the storm, motivated by one customer who requested the change while making evacuation plans. The free upgrade will expire on Saturday.Many Tesla owners cheered the temporary enhancement ahead of Irma, which made landfall in Florida on Sunday.Some, though, said the company was kneecapping vehicle range under normal circumstances in pursuit of profit. Others were concerned that the magnanimous move overshadowed the troubling extent to which Tesla can command customers\u2019 cars.Most other auto manufacturers \u201csell vehicles that are incapable of learning and improving and are highly vulnerable to obsolescence,\u201d Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in July. But not Tesla, which has become an industry leader in what\u2019s known as over-the-air vehicle upgrades \u2014 the ability to make instant fixes without being anywhere near the car.It\u2019s an efficient method: Wirelessly communicating improvements to a digitally equipped vehicle means that customers don\u2019t have to come in for every small tuneup. But some updates, like a strict speed cap that Tesla rolled back this year, also raise concerns about consumer privacy and control.Starting in 2016, Tesla produced a run of Model S and X cars equipped with battery packs built to have 75 kilowatt-hours of capacity but constrained by software to have access to only 60 to 70 kilowatt-hours of power. The company began producing cars this way to streamline manufacturing; it could produce the same type of battery but provide different price points, charging customers up to $9,500 for an upgrade to full capacity.Tesla has since stopped offering the software-limited batteries.A spokeswoman for Tesla declined to comment, and did not specify how many Tesla owners had benefited from the upgrade.For Chris Forman, a pilot, the $6,000 discount for a 60-kilowatt-hour battery instead of a 75-kilowatt-hour version was enough to persuade him to spend roughly $70,000 on his Model S in November.\u201cI never thought I was paying for a car that was neutered \u2014 I was paying less to get less range,\u201d he said.Mr. Forman, who lives in Broward County, Fla., had flown to St. Louis for work on Friday when he checked his Tesla app and saw that his car, plugged in at home, had reached 242 miles of range and was still charging. He had never seen the vehicle exceed 215 miles.\u201cI was totally blown away. It was super awesome of them to do that,\u201d Mr. Forman said of the software upgrade. \u201cTesla is always thinking outside the box.\u201dTesla owners said lines for the company\u2019s roadside Supercharger charging network were uncommon over the weekend. Drivers said they were worried about reliability of the Florida electrical grid during the hurricane.But some critics said that Tesla\u2019s ability to make the upgrade overshadowed its good intentions by raising larger questions of corporate greed. And even as Irma weakened, customers worried about Tesla\u2019s ability to alter their vehicles on its own from afar.That has raised security concerns, regardless of when the changes occur. As cars become more connected, the ability of criminals to remotely hack into them has also improved. At a meeting of the National Governors Association this summer, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said one of the company\u2019s top priorities was preventing \u201ca fleetwide hack.\u201dThe Irma upgrade was the first wireless enhancement that Tesla conducted for a particular event, said Colin Rusch, a managing director at Oppenheimer, the investment bank. More may come.\u201cYou\u2019re bringing a consumer electronics mentality to a durable-goods product,\u201d Mr. Rusch said. \u201cAdding incremental functionality is an ongoing process for Tesla. We\u2019ll see them continue to participate in that over-the-air market.\u201dAn article on Sept. 12 about Tesla\u2019s decision to extend the range of vehicles owned by individuals in Florida described incorrectly criticism of the decision. Critics said that the ability to make the upgrade raised questions of corporate greed, not that the upgrade itself was an act of greed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maye Musk, 69, Is Now a CoverGirl", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe news came after recent announcements that CoverGirl would add Issa Rae and Ayesha Curry to its roster.Though Ms. Musk has over 50 years of accomplishments racked up, the last few have been particularly impressive from a modeling perspective. She has appeared on the covers of New York magazine and Elle Canada; starred in campaigns for Target, Virgin America and Clinique; and been photographed for Vogue Italia, Vogue Korea and Vanity Fair.Below, she discusses her modeling trajectory, her decision to stop dyeing her hair, nutrition and eating disorders in the industry, and her family.I just love that CoverGirl wants to do diversity. They haven\u2019t had a model this old in their campaigns. I\u2019m turning 70 in April of next year. I think that women will be really inspired to see that even at 69 you can get a beauty campaign.Aging has been good for me. You develop confidence, you\u2019re able to handle the knocks a little easier. I model for my age. I\u2019m not trying to hide it and say I\u2019m 50. I\u2019m so proud that I\u2019m going be 70.I don\u2019t dye my hair. It\u2019s so fabulous. I had brown hair for so long. I was always getting my roots done. Sometimes I did it myself because I couldn\u2019t afford to go to a hair salon. When I turned 60, I decided to see what color I am underneath. I started dyeing my hair a very light blond and then I let it grow out. I cut it very short.And what happened? Suddenly I have all these editorials and bookings, and everybody is loving it.When did you first start modeling?At 15. I was a science nerd. I have two science degrees. I enjoyed the sciences, nutrition, so I always modeled part time, thinking it would end. And it hasn\u2019t, of course. \u201cJust getting started\u201d is my hashtag. I had three kids in three years, so that slowed me down somewhat. I was 28 and the oldest model in the city.What advice would you give to young models today?Be nice to everybody. Keep your brain active. Read a lot.Did you ever involve your kids in your modeling work?When I didn\u2019t have a nanny, the shows weren\u2019t long, so they would have their books and sit in the front row. I tried to get them to model, but they found it boring. They didn\u2019t have iPads back then. When you\u2019re on set you stand a lot and you wait, wait, wait. Tosca was doing runway with me and she was about 11, and they did her hair in a style she hated and she refused to step on the runway. And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the end of your modeling career.\u201d And that was fine with me, too.What do you love about makeup? For me, it makes a huge difference because my face is pretty plain, and I\u2019m very fair with very few eyebrows and very short eyelashes. Makeup transforms me. I feel like I\u2019m in disguise when I walk my dog without makeup on.I was 12 or 13 when I started experimenting. At 15, I was modeling. I had to do my own hair and makeup. I also made my own clothes because I grew up in South Africa, where fashion was six months behind because of the seasons.We wore a lot of makeup. It took us an hour to get ready. The eyelashes on top, the black eyeliner in the crease of the eye that you can see in photos from the \u201860s, the beehive hairstyle.The modeling industry has a lot of issues with eating disorders and underweight workers. What\u2019s your perspective on that as someone who studies nutrition? There are models who are naturally skinny, but the thing is that many of them are emaciated. You can tell because they have hirsutism. There\u2019ll be some hair on their face. It\u2019s to protect their body and keep it warm because they\u2019re too skinny. They also don\u2019t have good energy. I\u2019m surprised how many of them can do so many shows.Modeling agencies would send me their models. If they were a swimsuit model, they would have to lose 10 pounds to do runway. I would say, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect. You don\u2019t need to lose weight.\u201d They would say, \u201cBut I have to lose 10 pounds to do couturier work.\u201d I would say, \u201cYou have to eat perfectly. You have to keep your energy, and you can\u2019t look gaunt or tired. You can\u2019t share pizza with your friends, you can\u2019t have alcohol, you can\u2019t have dessert.\u201d That\u2019s hard for young girls.You walked in two shows at New York Fashion Week. What was that like?Concept Korea wanted me to open and close the show with two new young designers, completely different looks and makeup. I opened the show, all the young models came after me, I changed in a minute, and three makeup artists worked on my face to change the makeup look for the finale for the second designer.About a year ago I walked for Malan Breton, who found me on Facebook. I\u2019ve walked for Bloomingdale\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Eileen Fisher. Not fashion week. They weren\u2019t looking for women around 70.I hope it\u2019s a larger change happening. People are living longer and enjoying their lives more and know they don\u2019t have to disappear at 65 when they retire. I will never retire. My mom never retired. I\u2019ll work until no one wants me anymore, and then I\u2019ll find something else and I\u2019ll still be a dietitian doing nutrition research, which I love.I haven\u2019t gotten the 3 yet.

{"Headline": "In the Future, Warehouse Robots Will Learn on Their Own", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 The robot was perched over a bin filled with random objects, from a box of instant oatmeal to a small toy shark. This two-armed automaton did not recognize any of this stuff, but that did not matter. It reached into the pile and started picking things up, one after another after another.\u201cIt figures out the best way to grab each object, right from the middle of the clutter,\u201d said Jeff Mahler, one of the researchers developing the robot inside a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.For the typical human, that is an easy task. For a robot, it is a remarkable talent \u2014 something that could drive significant changes inside some of the world\u2019s biggest businesses and further shift the market for human labor.Today, robots play important roles inside retail giants like Amazon and manufacturing companies like Foxconn. But these machines are programmed for very specific tasks, like moving a particular type of container across a warehouse or placing a particular chip on a circuit board. They can\u2019t sort through a big pile of stuff, or accomplish more complex tasks. Inside Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers \u2014 where sorting through stuff is the primary task \u2014 armies of humans still do most of the work.The Berkeley robot was all the more remarkable because it could grab stuff it had never seen before. Mr. Mahler and the rest of the Berkeley team trained the machine by showing it hundreds of purely digital objects, and after that training, it could pick up items that weren\u2019t represented in its digital data set.\u201cWe\u2019re learning from simulated models and then applying that to real work,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, the Berkeley professor who oversees the university\u2019s automation lab.The robot was far from perfect, and it could be several years before it is seen outside research labs. Though it was equipped with a suction cup or a parallel gripper \u2014 a kind of two-fingered hand \u2014 it could reliably handle only so many items. And it could not switch between the cup and the gripper on the fly. But the techniques used to train it represented a fundamental shift in robotics research, a shift that could overhaul not just Amazon\u2019s warehouses but entire industries.\u201cThis can extend to tasks of assembly and more complex operations,\u201d said Juan Aparicio, head of advanced manufacturing automation at the German industrial giant Siemens, which is helping to fund the research at Berkeley. \u201cThat is the road map.\u201dPhysically, the Berkeley robot was nothing new. Mr. Mahler and his team were using existing hardware, including two robotic arms from the Swiss multinational ABB and a camera that captured depth.The Berkeley team began by scouring the internet for CAD models, short for computer-aided design. These are digital representations of physical objects. Engineers, physicists and designers build them when running experiments or creating new products. Using these models, Mr. Mahler and his team generated many more digital objects, eventually building a database of more than seven million items. Then they simulated the physics of each item, showing the precise point where a robotic arm should pick it up.That was a large task, but the process was mostly automated. When the team fed these models into a neural network, it learned to identify a similar point on potentially any digital object with any shape. And when the team plugged this neural network into the two-armed robot, it could do the same with physical objects.When facing a single everyday object with cylindrical or at least partly planar surfaces \u2014 like a spatula, a stapler, a cylindrical container of Froot Loops or even a tube of toothpaste \u2014 it could typically pick it up, with success rates often above 90 percent. But percentages dropped with more complex shapes, like the toy shark.What\u2019s more, when the team built simulated piles of random objects and fed those into the neural network, it could learn to lift items from physical piles, too. Researchers at Brown University and Northeastern are exploring similar research, and the hope is that this kind of work can be combined with other methods.\u201cPicking an object up is the first thing you want a manipulator robot to do,\u201d said Stefanie Tellex, a professor at Brown. \u201cA lot of more sophisticated behavior begins with that. If you can\u2019t pick it up, game over.\u201dThe research demonstrated how a task learned in the digital world can be transferred to the physical. Since the camera on Berkeley\u2019s robot could see depth, it captured three-dimensional images that were not unlike the CAD models the team uses to train its neural network.For this reason, some organizations are hoping to train robots using complex virtual worlds \u2014 digital recreations of our physical environment. If a system can train itself to navigate a car racing game like Grand Theft Auto, the thinking goes, it can navigate real roads.This is still largely theory. But at places like Berkeley and Northeastern, researchers are showing that digital learning can indeed make the leap into the real world.\u201cThis is a challenge,\u201d said Rob Platt, a professor at Northeastern. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenge we\u2019re dealing with.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Taiwan, Modest Test of Driverless Bus May Hint at Big Things to Come", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Rolling with a barely audible hum beneath banyan trees, a brightly painted shuttle bus cruised through a university campus here.The electric vehicle crawled along at a speed of no more than six miles per hour. And only 12 passengers could fit inside. But the bus also drove itself, raising hopes in Taipei that autonomous public transportation would be up and running here within a year.\u201cThe idea of one day being able to ride around this city in driverless vehicles is quite exciting,\u201d said Amber Chen, who was riding with her son Ruey-She, 8.The bus tests are partly to prove that the autonomous-driving technology is safe to deploy on the city\u2019s busy streets, and partly to gather the data needed to improve the artificial intelligence that steer such vehicles. The effort, one of the earliest in Asia, could help position Taiwan as both a pioneer in autonomous public transportation and, if things go according to plan, a producer of driverless buses.So far, the bus being tested, the EZ10, has breezed through its trials on the campus of National Taiwan University, which have been in progress since May.But successful testing on a closed course at low speeds can only reveal so much about how the buses would fare in traffic. Getting them on the road at busy times is the next step, and the program\u2019s backers are eager to see that happen quickly.One obstacle: Despite active support from Taipei\u2019s municipal government and its mayor, Ko Wen-Je, the testing has only tacit approval from the central government, said Wei-Bin Lee, commissioner of Taipei\u2019s Department of Information Technology.\u201cThe rest of the world isn\u2019t going to stop and wait for you just because you\u2019re sputtering along,\u201d he said.Such situations abound in Taiwan, which has 23.5 million people and is home to more than 150 universities and colleges, 100-plus industrial parks and 15 theme parks, as well as densely urbanized sections on its northern and western coasts. In August, the EZ10 began late-night trials on a short stretch of Xinyi Road, a six-lane artery in downtown Taipei.\u201cOur ultimate goal is to autonomize the entire Xinyi Road main line,\u201d Mr. Ko, the mayor, told local media when the trials started.Mr. Ting said he hoped to import three more buses next year and begin manufacturing them under a license from EasyMile by the end of 2018, with the goal of getting half of the components from Taiwanese suppliers. That would eliminate the 45 percent import tax, saving approximately $200,000 per bus.Then EasyMile could seriously consider other Asian markets, he said.The EZ10, with a top speed of 25 m.p.h., achieves \u201cLevel 4\u201d automation under the standards of the global engineering association S.A.E. International, meaning its route is chosen by humans but there is no one behind the wheel and it can avoid obstacles on its own. Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is considered Level 2, although Elon Musk, the company\u2019s chief executive, said this year that Tesla was only two years away from Level 5: complete autonomy.For any level of vehicle autonomy to work, urban infrastructure must be updated. Traffic lights, for example, would require special signals to direct autonomous vehicles.Then there is the issue of creating three-dimensional maps, and developing the computing power needed to use them for detection and navigation. In a dense, urban area like Taipei, they must account for the way tall buildings can distort GPS signals.\u201cYou need to make a map with 99.999 percent accuracy, which is not easy,\u201d Mr. Ting said. \u201cIt takes time and money.\u201dHe added that processing all of the data would require cloud computing and a high-speed wireless connection.Technological hurdles aside, national lawmakers in Taiwan have more important priorities than autonomous vehicles, including a contentious infrastructure package. And political concerns make many lawmakers cautious about embracing even an experimental system, knowing that any accident could derail long-term plans. Nonetheless, the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen has made creating \u201csmart cities,\u201d which include technological innovations like autonomous vehicles, a national priority.Jason Hsu, a legislator who visited Silicon Valley with Mr. Ting, said that Taiwan could set itself apart, especially in Asia, by focusing on public transportation with Level 4 vehicles. Many countries in the region, including China, are involved in autonomous vehicle research and development, he noted.\u201cThe U.S. government is using autonomous vehicles to kick off a whole new industry centered around data-driven platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue in Taiwan is that our legislation is lagging behind.\u201dMr. Hsu said he planned to introduce an alliance for smart mobility and autonomous vehicles this month that would help push the central government on the issue.Unlike California, where dozens of companies have obtained permits to put autonomous vehicles on the road, Mr. Hsu said that Taiwan had not licensed any companies, including 7StarLake.\u201cThe cars are available but we cannot collect data, which is very dangerous as the vehicles need data and experience to fine tune their algorithms and minimize the chance of accident,\u201d he said.\u201cTaiwan is democratic and free,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has its own advantages.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They mocked the reporter\u2019s fusty brown oxfords, and whooped as their leader clambered onto the roof of the KTLA van (\u201cJake, I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d the reporter warned), where he stood triumphant \u2014 symbolically, at least \u2014 over the old-media landscape.Facing a scene that looked like a boy-band version of \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d the reporter grilled Mr. Paul: \u201cThey say that you have created a living hell out here, that you\u2019ve created a circus.\u201dMr. Paul responded with a smirk: \u201cBut people like going to circuses, right?\u201d\u201cIt was gold,\u201d he said.And all that, basically, has been a warm-up act. Even as controversies stack up and the #jakepaulisoverparty hashtag circulates, Mr. Paul is leveraging a Johnny Knoxville taste for outrage with mogul-size ambition to build an empire out of that sprawling Beverly Grove house, serving as a Svengali and star maker to the YouTube stars of tomorrow. Think of it as a factory of social-media talent, a scrubbed, web version of Berry Gordy\u2019s Motown Records for pre-tweens.A genius or a jerk? A punk or a prophet? In a media landscape where clicks are money, does it even matter?\u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Paul said in a rare interview at his home two weeks ago. \u201cBut, like, literally, I want to create an empire of dozens of talent under me, to take my power and multiply it so that I become bigger than myself.\u201d\u201cMy personal goal,\u201d he said, \u201cis to be a billionaire.\u201d\u201cThere was real-life opportunity to make a career for ourselves, for the rest of our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were working with brands and advertisers. I was, like, 17 years old, making more money than my parents.\u201d\u201cI saw what he did,\u201d Mr. Paul said of that N.W.A. rapper turned mogul, \u201chow he was a celebrity himself, and then he took that, brought people under his wing, taught them how to make music, and then put those people in front of his audience. Out comes Eminem, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Tupac. And then he used that network to launch different companies and go into merchandising, obviously his big one being Beats by Dre.\u201dNot yet old enough to legally drink alcohol, Mr. Paul was now a mix of talent manager, executive producer, life coach and motivational guru to a constellation of rising YouTube vlog stars, several of which had more than two million subscribers. He also acted as a resident adviser, given that a half-dozen of them bunked full-time at the social media \u201cincubator\u201d that was the Team 10 house.Not that those Generation X references would mean much to Mr. Paul\u2019s target audience, who were born in the George W. Bush or Barack Obama years. And the brand stakes its existence on keeping these attention-challenged adolescents coming back for more.Because it really is every day, bro \u2014 to cite Mr. Paul\u2019s mantra. It has been for more than 335 straight days and counting.That is why Mr. Paul decided one day in May, on a whim, to transform himself into a rapper. \u201cI woke up, and I was like, \u2018What if I make a song today, and make a music video for it, all in one day?\u2019\u201d he said.As Mr. Paul tells the story, he spent a few hours tracking down a producer and booking a studio, maybe 30 minutes scribbling out some rhymes for himself and his crew, and another few hours to record the track. That afternoon, Mr. Paul secured a glassy hilltop mansion in Coldwater Canyon as a location to shoot the video (it seemed like the perfect parody location of a clich\u00e9 hip-hop video, he said) and rustled up a white Lamborghini as a prop.\u201cTo me, the whole thing was a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, I\u2019m going to morph into a rapper and just go for it, 100 percent.\u201dFlexing like a \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d extra and grabbing his crotch like LL Cool J circa 1987, Mr. Paul threw himself into the role, rapping: \u201cIt\u2019s everyday, bro, with the Disney Channel flow, 5 mil on YouTube in six months, never done before.\u201dNo one was going to confuse it for Kendrick Lamar. But the pre-tweens of the Jake Paul Army scarcely cared.By 9 a.m. on a sweltering Tuesday in late August, a cluster of teenage girls was already padding around the leafy sidewalk outside the angular white stucco house near Hollywood\u2019s Fairfax district where Team 10 is based, waiting for a chance to squeal \u201cJake!\u201d or \u201cErika!\u201d or \u201cKade!\u201dStrolling around the house that morning, it was not hard to find evidence of the youthpocalypse portrayed in media reports. In the backyard, next to a giant trampoline, an overturned office chair teetered at the edge of the \u201cbonfire\u201d pool, now filled with water, but with a flat-screen television lying facedown on the bottom.A spirit of anarchy, however, was noticeably absent. Inside the cavernous and scarcely furnished main floor, the house felt more like the office of a Silicon Valley start-up than a modern, teenager-filled \u201cAnimal House.\u201d Handwritten notes exhorted housemates to tend to their trash. A mini-basketball hoop hung on one wall. A pink tie-dyed banner emblazoned with the Team 10 logo blanketed another.The daily vlog is \u201can extreme version\u201d of reality television, he said, and the Jake Paul who is the current scourge of greater Los Angeles is merely a character. \u201cLiterally, by saying the word \u2018bro\u2019 I do try to come off like a high school kid having fun,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would a junior in high school say? What would their slang be? They use the word \u2018savage,\u2019 they use the word \u2018lit.\u2019 That isn\u2019t my personal vocabulary. But it comes out on camera.\u201dThe morning calm doesn\u2019t last long. The YouTube channels demand fresh content, and by 10 a.m. the team and its dewy-cheeked cameramen piled into a convoy of sport utility vehicles and headed off to the gym.\u201cYo, what about just pouring milk into cereal?\u201d Mr. Paul asked the group, his eyes partly hidden by his trademark \u201cyellers,\u201d or yellow aviator sunglasses.Too dull.\u201cWe need to do something where we light something on fire,\u201d one team member said.An hour later, the crew assembled at a parking lot and giddily began emptying their grocery bags. As the Phantom camera rolled, team members swatted a cup of Jell-O with a tennis racket, blasted Mr. Tepper in the face with mini-marshmallows fired from a T-shirt gun and dropped an egg onto the blades of a drone hovering at shoulder level, splattering several members of the team with an al dente aeronautic omelet as they doubled over in laughter.For the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, Mr. Paul attempted a fire-breathing stunt involving dish soap, butane and cornstarch. Over Mr. Tepper\u2019s firm warnings (\u201cDude, I\u2019m serious\u201d), a cameraman ignited a puff of flammable foam in Mr. Paul\u2019s palm. The Team 10 leader then blew a pillow-size fire ball into the warm Hollywood air, then turned to the camera triumphantly, squawking, \u201cI\u2019m a dragon!\u201d as he flapped his arms melodramatically, cornstarch cascading from his mouth.\u201cA lot of people get this awesome feeling when they go to a club, or they\u2019re out with their friends every night having fun,\u201d he said later. \u201cBut the feeling for me is freedom. Like, I can literally do whatever I want, whenever I want.\u201dThat has proved a blessing and a curse.His overnight transformation into a rap star, for example, was a breakthrough moment, but it also made him, to some, hater bait of Vanilla Ice proportions.To Mr. Paul, the point was becoming clear: As a budding captain of industry, he might have to learn to steer the Team 10 ship through the ice fields without ramming every last iceberg.\u201cAll I can do is control myself,\u201d he said.Following the fire-breathing stunt, Mr. Paul\u2019s grueling day was far from done. Around 8 p.m. he gathered the crew around the kitchen table for the weekly Team 10 meeting.\u201cFirst of all, we hit 80 million,\u201d Mr. Paul announced, gesturing toward a flat-screen television glowing orange with a graphic that read \u201c80,095,981,\u201d Team 10\u2019s current subscriber base. \u201cAnd we\u2019re also doubling the Kardashians in monthly growth.\u201d Team members, many wearing Team 10 hoodies and T-shirts, erupted in applause.\u201cI really think in the next six months, we can triple that, if not quadruple that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about coming together and pushing your boundaries every single day.\u201dAfterward, Mr. Paul retreated to the only quiet place he could find \u2014 his Tesla, charging in the garage \u2014 to discuss his tumultuous summer. He seemed contrite. As was obvious to any Jake Pauler, he was making a big effort of late to atone for his perceived sins, to stress the positives of the Team 10 mission.\u201cThe people who are really close to me would walk in here and tell you that I\u2019m a great person and that I\u2019ve done nothing but good for them in their lives,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m a good person,\u2019 because no one cares. Anyone can say they\u2019re a good person.\u201dThen again, what is hate, really, but just more content?Later that evening, Mr. Paul headed back to the studio to answer his critics in the best way he knows how, a new rap video. Channeling Eminem in \u201c8 Mile,\u201d he cut a feisty track in which he owned up to seemingly every last insult the haters had hurled at him.\u201cFake wife, fake life, no talent at all,\u201d he rapped. \u201cLet me tell y\u2019all about all of his flaws.\u201d\u201cSometimes I wanna quit it all, sometimes I wish I wasn\u2019t involved, sometimes I wish I could hate Jake Paul.\u201dIt is safe to assume that impulse passed.As of this week, the video had attracted almost 25 million views.An article last Sunday about the social media entrepreneur Jake Paul, using information from a publicist, misstated the name of Mr. Paul\u2019s company. It is TeamDom, not TeenDom. The article also referred incorrectly to the nature of a YouTube video featuring Justin Bieber, in which he appears to be reacting to Mr. Paul\u2019s video \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro.\u201d The video was a parody that used footage from an interview that Mr. Bieber gave about Selena Gomez\u2019s video \u201cHands to Myself,\u201d in which he refers to her video co-star as \u201ca chump.\u201d Mr. Bieber did not call Mr. Paul \u201ca chump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After directing me down a series of increasingly narrower country roads, it now wanted me to head into the driveway of a modest suburban house. The children in the backseat were laughing; my wife, to my right, was not.\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. What are we going to do?\u201dIt was April 2015 \u2014 it is always April when we take these trips \u2014 and the sky had turned a striking orange behind the just-budding branches of the trees and the occasional windmill that glided by the windows of our rental car. My wife, Helene, poked with increasing aggravation at the malfunctioning device on the dashboard.\u201cMommy \u2014 what\u2019s going to happen? Belgian bandits?\u201d This was my son, Dean, who sat behind me. \u201cThis is fun.\u201dWe hadn\u2019t seen a soul for at least a half-hour. And the engine shut off every time I stopped. So at the moment: complete Belgian silence.\u201cO.K. \u2014 I\u2019d dead-reckon,\u201d I said.\u201cLet\u2019s go into the driveway!\u201d said my daughter, Paulina.\u201cNo!\u201d my wife said.Dead-reckon I did. Bruges is near the coast, right, and the water had to be to the west, right? I backtracked to the last major road and kept the waning sun in front of us. And then 30 minutes later, emerging in the distance in jagged blue-gray shapes \u2014 and unmistakable \u2014 were the sharp spires of the medieval city, piercing that orange and announcing that we\u2019d arrived, modern devices be damned.***The episode has become legendary in my little family, one of those moments from our travels that we all recall in short hand \u2014 \u201cThe crazy Belgian GPS!\u201d \u2014 and probably always will.There are quite a few others.Like the English couple running a bed and breakfast in Normandy who kept their place shiveringly cold; did not speak French; had never been to Paris; and went on and on, unbidden, about how much they disliked the French.We could hear him laughing as we headed down the hill. For the remainder of our time in Japan, whenever we sat down to a meal, \u201cUnscented Pork!\u201d was a family rallying cry.I\u2019m writing this now because that trip to Japan, in April of this year, was something of a final chapter for Helene, Dean and Paulina and myself. Dean is 17 and off to college. For seven years, we have taken an ambitious trip during spring break. Everyone has had a vote in our destination \u2014 Europe four times, Hawaii, the West Coast (spiritually a different country than Brooklyn, where we live, right?) and Japan.Their public school vacations always lined up, making planning a snap. But that won\u2019t happen anymore with Dean in college. Also, we\u2019ll be broke.Helene and I went all in on these trips \u2014 dipping into the home equity account some years, and letting my American Express travel account grow alarmingly \u2014 because we saw a brief window when Dean and Paulina, who just turned 14, would be old enough to get a lot out of these journeys, and be fully mobile, yet young enough that they enjoyed spending time with us. These windows snap close fast.We developed a model, and certain patterns emerged. We\u2019ve mixed food and history with views and long walks and mastered transit systems. We plan but not too much. We try to fly nonstop, and accept that at some point someone will get sick. We don\u2019t worry about the weather. (April is unpredictable and it\u2019s always April.) And we\u2019ve accepted that togetherness is great, but so is breaking down into smaller units, even units of one.It seems a shame not to be able to put this knowledge to use; so maybe I can pass it on to other parents whose sons and daughters are nearing the late single digits, and who want to get back out there and see the world, along with the fresh eyes of children. It can be done. Debt or not \u2013 these trips were worth every penny.***First, the destination.Serendipity, individual interests and price always play roles. The first trip was to Ireland for the simple reason that we saw an ad for $400 round-trip flights on Aer Lingus. Scotland came next because Helene\u2019s niece was in school in Glasgow, but also because the flight was $1,000 per person, and flights to Paris \u2013 Dean\u2019s top choice \u2013 were $1,400. Also, I\u2019d learned in Ireland that I\u2019m pretty good at driving on the wrong side of the road, and I wanted to have another go.A year later, Paris was $1,000 a person, so off we went. Paulina\u2019s dream was Hawaii, so that came next; at $750 a person on Hawaiian Airlines, it felt like a bargain. Japan is my thing, so we\u2019d decided that it would be the grand finale. I booked the roughly $1,000 fare on Japan Airlines nine months in advance on Expedia.The basic model was to stay in one place and take trips: Paris for 10 days, with a night in Normandy; Amsterdam for five days, Bruges for two. We saw much of Ireland from our bed-and-breakfastbase in Oughterard. But some trips involved more running around: driving a circle route around Scotland and the nonstop, even frenzied train journey around Japan, rail passes in hand.Sometimes Helene took the lead in researching and booking hotels, sometimes I did. She did better. We\u2019d poll friends and family, search the Travel section and put the internet to use.We bunked together at the Falls of Dochart Inn in Killin on our first night in Scotland, the falls themselves just audible through the windows; stretched out in a suite at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco (a splurge), the trolley cars clanging on Powell Street; and slept deeply in that Japanese farmhouse (stone cold silence). The former sugar plantation workers\u2019 cottage in Kauai (my find) was cheap at roughly $250 a night, and truly memorable \u2014 red sunsets behind palm trees lining the black-sand beach; Paulina in the pool for hours.Not quite so successful was the apartment I rented through a friend near the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, where the heat was out for three days and where I broke the washing machine.***The flights and hotels booked, the preparation phase began.The DVD player went into overdrive. Before Ireland, we watched John Ford\u2019s \u201cThe Quiet Man,\u201d with John Wayne \u2014 the stone bridge glimpsed near the opening is outside Oughterard \u2014 and David Lean\u2019s epic, \u201cRyan\u2019s Daughter,\u201d with Robert Mitchum. Paris was previewed in Truffaut\u2019s \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d; Hawaii with Alexander Payne\u2019s \u201cThe Descendants.\u201dIn the weeks before Amsterdam and Bruges we watched \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d and \u2014 bad parenting alert! \u2014 \u201cIn Bruges,\u201d Martin McDonagh\u2019s R-rated, blood-soaked hitman comedy.And we read. Paulina tore through \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d before Amsterdam, and Helene read us the opening pages of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cA Movable Feast\u201d before Paris. Dean finished \u201cGiving Up the Gun\u201d \u2014 a slim but fascinating volume on how the samurais reverted to the sword in the 1600s \u2014 just before we took off for Japan.I\u2019m not sure if these little culture dives enhanced Dean and Paulina\u2019s experience, but I\u2019m pretty sure they gave some depth to the vistas they saw \u2014 a three-dimensional understanding that these were not just places to view and photograph, but to experience as others had before.***There is no way to sugarcoat it \u2014 the first flight is always a misery. Coach seats are plenty big for children, and the entertainment options keep them busy for a while, but Dean and Paulina slept fitfully if at all on our trans-Atlantic flights and were weary by the time we landed. My wheels-on-the-ground exclamations to cheer them up \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re in Amsterdam, start of our Grand Tour of the Low Countries!\u201d \u2014 drew only sleepy eye-rolls.Dean was looking pretty green as we headed down the aisle to get off the double-decker Air France A380 Airbus that had delivered us to Charles de Gaulle airport. It was while we passed through first class that he threw up. To this day I\u2019m thankful for the flight attendant\u2019s nonchalant charm and grace in the face of Dean\u2019s and my mutual mortification; she was either the kindest person who\u2019d ever lived, or an actress on par with Catherine Deneuve, to whom she bore a not slight resemblance.Now, for all parents \u2014 hear what I say: if at all possible, book a hotel room for the night before you arrive so you can go right in and take a three-hour nap. Otherwise, you might find yourself waiting with two exhausted children for several hours for your room to be available, as we did in Scotland.Because when that nap is over, the fun truly begins.To see Paulina\u2019s eyes widen as we stepped out of our hotel into Shinjuku, in Tokyo, with its rushing crowds, flashing neon and bird-tweets emitting from the walk signs was to see a child\u2019s world expand exponentially. \u201cOh my god this is like another planet.\u201dSame with Dean as we first walked across the Pont des Arts over the Seine in Paris and his brown eyes took in the Pont Neuf, the Ile de la Cite, the towers of Notre Dame and all the rainy-gray and muted brown stone buildings arrayed before us.***The key to making plans is not making too many.Too little structure and we\u2019d end up wandering the same neighborhoods; too much and the trip becomes a forced march. We always book a few restaurants and, in more recent years, as the crowds have increased, a museum or two.But that\u2019s all. We reserved a specific time at the Rijksmuseum our first day in Amsterdam, and it was a great morning. Enthused, we decided to try for two museums in a row but balked when we saw the long lines at the nearby Van Gogh Museum. So we had a rijsttafel lunch at an Indonesian restaurant we stumbled across. Then we spent some time in a Tesla showroom, for no particular reason.We don\u2019t have to be together, all of us, every minute. Dean started taking long walks by himself in Japan, especially along the river in the mountain city of Takayama, and Helene and I sneaked out to a jazz bar in Kyoto one evening while the two of them luxuriated in their yukata robes back at our ryokan (Japanese hotel).We sat at a small table inside. (It was an especially chilly April.) I had a Calvados, and he had an elaborate virgin cocktail. He asked about my drink and I let him dip his pinkie in and try it. He winced.\u201cDo you drink that because you like it, or because you want to be a cool guy?\u201dGood question.\u201cHmmm. I guess a little of each.\u201d***But even if you only make a few plans, there comes a moment to let them go. The pattern is familiar. At some point, Helene starts to wind down. I have come to strangely enjoy watching her vacation energy arc switch from Let\u2019s-get-going exuberance to exhaustion.She agreed, and we sat beside a glass-clear stream on the castle grounds as Dean and Paulina played with the resident Shorthaired Pointer. Helene fell asleep on the grass -\u2013 the start of an epic nap that, after a brief interruption, was continued back at our bed and breakfast. I went in to check on her several times to make sure she was alive. Then I took the kids back down to the pub.I got three dirty looks and we were soon taking our seats, English menus in hand.Paulina said what was on everyone\u2019s mind.\u201cDo they have unscented pork?\u201d***And so, despite all the great food, and the spectacular views, and the visits to pubs and grand cafes, and the museums, the most rewarding parts of these trips have been the explorations of my own family.As they\u2019ve gotten older, acquiring friends and devices, Dean and Paulina have become less the little team they used to be. Their main interaction when we are all together in our house seems to be about who stole the other\u2019s headphones, or keys, or MetroCard.\u201cI hate you!\u201d she\u2019ll tell him with steely eyed rage at the dinner table over this or that imagined slight.\u201cHey!\u201d I\u2019ll jump in. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that word. Don\u2019t say \u2018hate.\u2019 Just say, \u2018I really, really, really, really don\u2019t like you.\u2019\u201d\u201cOk \u2013 I really, really, really, really don\u2019t like you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201dBut not on our trips. They revert to the wee ones who played with that Shorthaired Pointer on the castle grounds.What sounded like an argument in the backseat as we drove up the Pacific Coast Highway \u2014 Our Grand California Road Trip \u2014 was actually some game they\u2019d invented. I forget if they were trying to touch the other\u2019s arm, or grab something the other had, or win a thumb war \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter. Given time, children fill it.But they are old enough, too, to enjoy the fine meal we had in candlelight the night before at Deetjen\u2019s Big Sur Inn, or the ricotta-stuffed roast chicken we had the next night at Tosca Cafe in North Beach. Opinions, insights and observations fly around the dinner table. We\u2019d talk about past trips each of us remembering details that the others had forgotten.Those trips were a time of perfect balance.And I got to check off some important boxes for myself, too.I\u2019d first seen Deetjen\u2019s as I drove along the coast with friends the year after college, in 1988, and swore I\u2019d go back one day. I\u2019d read about the Waimea Plantation Cottages on Kauai in a travel magazine in the early 1990s. It took 22 years to get there. I\u2019d never imagined then being able to share them with my family, or even of having a family.It\u2019s a shame these trips have to end, that spring breaks will cease to line up, that life is so expensive, or that we never made it to several places we\u2019d all wanted to go \u2014 Kenya, Germany or Istanbul or Cairo.Although, then again \u2026We\u2019ll all still be free around Christmastime, right? And isn\u2019t that the off-season in places?Hmmm.Excuse me a minute while I check prices on Expedia. Where\u2019s my credit card?Wendell Jamieson is Metro editor of The New York Times.Advertisement"}

In 2015, another company, Hyperloop Transportation Technology, announced a plan to build a track in Quay Valley, Calif.Although its technology is still being developed, Hyperloop One, whose first government partnership was a feasibility study with Dubai\u2019s transportation authority, viewed the agreement with Colorado as a strong endorsement.\u201cThis is unprecedented and demonstrates how quickly the public-private sectors can partner to make Hyperloop systems a reality around the world,\u201d Rob Lloyd, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cStudies like this bring us closer to our goal of implementing three full-scale systems operating by 2021.\u201d\u201cThe Hyperloop technology could directly align with our goals of improving mobility and safety in Colorado, and we have been encouraged by the continued progress the technology is taking,\u201d said Shailen Bhatt, executive director of the state transportation department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ellen Pao Is Not Done Fighting", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery day, Ellen Pao receives written messages of support from all over: to her office, through her lawyers, over email, on LinkedIn, in postcards she keeps in a small wooden box on her desk.\u201cThank you for paving the way for women to come forward,\u201d writes someone in Florida. \u201cThank you for putting Silicon Valley on notice,\u201d reads another message. \u201cYou were a pioneer.\u201d \u201cI believe O\u2019Reilly would still have a job except for steps taken by you and so many others.\u201d\u201cSometimes people just want you to tell them they\u2019ll get through it,\u201d Ms. Pao said. \u201cSometimes they want specific advice. Sometimes it\u2019s hard \u2014 our connection is through something so unpleasant. But you\u2019ve been through something that really binds you.\u201dMs. Pao, 47, was the junior venture capital partner and former interim C.E.O. of Reddit who, in 2012, filed a gender discrimination suit against her employer at the time, the powerful venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In a case that captivated Silicon Valley, she accused her bosses of not promoting her because of her gender and retaliating against her for complaining. She turned down a seven-figure settlement to testify in a jury trial, seeking $16 million in lost wages and tens of millions in punitive damages.Ms. Pao lost. But in the process she gave many women in corporate America a crash course in gender discrimination (the subtle kind). \u201cI think in many ways it was an affirmation: that these aren\u2019t outliers, this is a very real problem,\u201d said the law professor Anita Hill, whose testimony against Clarence Thomas taught an early-1990s world what \u201csexual harassment\u201d meant \u2014 in turn prompting a flood of complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\u201cI called it at the time a \u2018gender-bias training for the nation,\u2019\u201d said Joan C. Williams, who is a legal scholar and professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and the founder of the center for WorkLife Law there. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure the nation was paying that much attention, unfortunately.\u201dMs. Pao hopes they\u2019re paying attention now. This month, she is releasing a book, \u201cReset,\u201d chronicling the details of her lawsuit and its aftermath, which, she writes, \u201calmost ended my career in tech, cost me half a million dollars, and launched a thousand hit pieces on me and on my family.\u201dIt follows her time at Kleiner Perkins, from early days as chief of staff to John Doerr, a partner; the tangled affair with a married colleague she said harassed and retaliated against her; to the trial and what happened after, including the Reddit stint and her time now as an evangelist for corporate diversity and the co-founder and C.E.O. of a nonprofit called Project Include.It is also the story of what led her, the daughter of Chinese immigrants to New Jersey, to this particular place.Ms. Pao is the middle of three girls, an introverted high achiever who got perfect scores on almost all her tests. Her mother, one of the first women to receive a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania, taught her to code: a skill Ms. Pao is now passing down to her own daughter, who is in elementary school.She majored in electrical engineering at Princeton, where her father, a math professor, had received his Ph.D., and then got degrees in law and business from Harvard. \u201cMy family, except for my younger sister who was the indulged baby of the family, is generally very stoic,\u201d she writes.Ms. Pao today may speak of social justice, intersectional feminism, the difference between \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cequity,\u201d and the moral responsibility she felt to speak up (\u201cI had the money and the conviction,\u201d she said). But she was a belated activist. In the book, she describes declining to join a sit-in at law school protesting professors\u2019 claims that African-Americans and women were not qualified to teach, because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable \u201ctaking a side publicly.\u201dThen came her first job out of law school: the male partner who\u2019d brush up against female employees in the hallway, whom she tried to ignore; a female lawyer sent home for wearing pants; after-work trips to the strip club Scores.\u201cAt the time, I tried not to think much about those incidents, hoping that just working hard and keeping my head down would help me push past and ignore them,\u201d she writes.By her own account, Ms. Pao was a rule follower. She chose not to hire a publicist during the trial and willingly turned over hundreds of thousands of emails to the opposing counsel, which she now regrets. She goes to church on Sundays, doesn\u2019t drink, and is extremely hesitant to talk about her personal life.Believing in meritocracy, she thought she could power through any inequity by working twice as hard. \u201cI had faith in the system,\u201d she writes.In written evaluations and performance reviews Ms. Pao was given high ratings, yet she was passed over for a senior-level promotion. She was criticized both for being too passive but also too pushy; for not speaking up enough but also being too opinionated.\u201cEverything was conflicting: You talk too much/not enough. You\u2019re too data-oriented/you don\u2019t bring enough information,\u201d Ms. Pao said, sitting in the shade of a roof deck at the Kapor Center, a social-impact fund where she is an investor and head of inclusion and diversity. She was sipping a glass of hot water. \u201cThere was no consistency, and it was just baffling to me. How do I improve?\u201dMuch of the behavior she experienced was inappropriate. But could it be proven illegal in court? Unclear. This wasn\u2019t overt pay discrimination or being barred from certain jobs because of her gender, the stuff of Title VII lawsuits of the 1970s or episodes of \u201cMad Men.\u201d This was a subtler sexism, the kind that \u201cday by day, water cooler comment by water cooler comment, microaggression by microaggression\u201d ate away at you, she writes.It was harder to document, to explain and ultimately to prove, but, she argues, just as damaging. \u201cTaken all together, these seemingly minor moments, these 1,000 paper cuts, create an unwelcome, subtly hostile culture,\u201d she writes.She sent a letter to her bosses outlining her complaints. They brought in a private investigator, who found no wrongdoing by the company. And so Ms. Pao sued, retaining the services of a lawyer who had won a $7 million sexual harassment case against a powerful Silicon Valley law firm in the 1990s. For five months, she also continued going to work.\u201cPeople can argue and do about the merits of the trial, but nobody can argue with her unflappable mental strength,\u201d said Ms. Wang, the founder and C.E.O. of Evertoon.\u201cI was toxic to people for a long time,\u201d Ms. Pao said.No court case is simple. But for those who hoped hers would serve as a watershed moment for Silicon Valley, Ms. Pao\u2019s was viewed as particularly complex.She was not particularly well-known. She declined to speak to the press.\u201cThis is the right issue and the right time, but the wrong case,\u201d the defense would say repeatedly, led by a female lawyer, Lynn Hermle.But at the crux may have been the fact that her claims, to many women, almost seemed ordinary. The kind of stuff they put up with every day.Sarah Lacy, the founder and editor in chief of the tech website Pando, said: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a clear smoking gun \u2014 and for this to be the big Silicon Valley trial over gender, she was hard to rally around.\u201dMs. Lacy said she remembered thinking at the time that if Ms. Pao had a case, then so did every woman in America. \u201cI think ultimately the same thing that hurt her made women all look at their own lives very differently, and say, \u2018O.K., this is not acceptable. This should not be a part of doing business.\u2019\u201dMs. Pao may not be a natural leader. \u201cIt\u2019s not my personality,\u201d she said, recounting going to see Steve Jobs speak and watching him be swarmed by people afterward. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t ever want that job.\u2019\u201dYet to a certain cohort she has become one, or at least a kind of mentor.Earlier this year, she appeared on stage with Anita Hill at a sold-out event in San Francisco. The Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick had not yet been fired, but he would be soon after; that week, the University of California, -Berkeley had announced it would pay $1.7 million to a woman who accused its former law school dean of sexual harassment and Bill O\u2019Reilly had been fired from Fox News.Since then, dozens of women in Silicon Valley have come forward, speaking out about discrimination and harassment. Men have apologized, shot back, stepped down, created \u201cdecency pledges,\u201d written manifestoes, been fired for manifestoes.The outcomes are different, but what founder after founder, lawyer after lawyer, academic after academic, keeps saying is the same: None of that would have been possible without Ellen Pao.\u201cI\u2019ve been here since 1999,\u201d said Ms. Lacy. \u201cThere is no one \u2014 man, woman, founder, V.C., the most aggressive feminist, no one \u2014 who would have thought a male V.C. would get fired for propositioning a woman. It\u2019s just a radical change.\u201dNear Ms. Pao\u2019s office in Oakland, the street sign on the corner \u2014 Broadway \u2014 has been spray painted to read \u201cBro Way.\u201d On her way back from lunch, Ms. Pao laughed and snapped a photo.Later, she pulled up an email from a woman named Gesche Haas, an entrepreneur who had spoken publicly about being propositioned by an investor and emailed Ms. Pao to offer her support during the trial.\u201cThere is this saying that all positive comments we receive we deflect like Teflon while negative comments we hang on to like Velcro,\u201d Ms. Haas wrote. \u201cRealizing that we do this helped me focus on the people that deserved my energy.\u201dMs. Pao has thought about these words more than once.\u201cIt takes a village,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really took dozens of women speaking up to make anyone listen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She hopes that the photograph will provoke thought and conversation about what makes us human.\u201cI know that some people believe very strongly that a portrait of someone shows the viewer a deep psychological insight of the person who isn\u2019t in the camera,\u201d Ms. Tammi said. \u201cWe make the story of what we see in the portrait.\u201dErica is the creation of Hiroshi Ishiguro, a professor at Osaka University\u2019s Intelligent Robotics Laboratory in Japan. She was designed to have natural conversations with humans, integrating voice recognition and body language like blinking and head tilting. But for now, her conversational responses are limited and she is unable to move her arms or walk.The decision to include an android\u2019s portrait in the shortlist is controversial. The rules for the international competition, hosted by the National Portrait Gallery in London, say that the picture \u201cmust have been taken by the entrant from life and with a living sitter.\u201d The rules define portraits as \u201cphotography concerned with portraying people with an emphasis on their identity as individuals.\u201dLaura McKechan, a senior communications manager at the National Portrait Gallery, said that the gallery had decided against barring the portrait from the competition, though it would consider whether the rules need to be changed in the future.\u201cIt was felt that the subject of this portrait, while not human, is a representation of a human figure and makes a powerful statement as a work of art in its questioning of what it is to be alive or human and asks challenging questions about portraiture,\u201d Ms. McKechan wrote in an email. \u201cThe ambiguity of this portrait makes it particularly compelling.\u201dMs. Tammi spent half an hour with the android, accompanied by a researcher who helped position the android for the photograph, adjusting the tilt of the head or moving the eyes.\u201cThe researcher told me that Erica had said that she finds Pokemon Go scarier than artificial intelligence,\u201d Ms. Tammi said.Erica\u2019s portrait will compete for the top prize with C\u00e9zar Dezfuli\u2019s portrait of a migrant in the Mediterranean Sea and Abbie Trayler-Smith\u2019s portrait of a young woman fleeing from the Islamic State.

He is a rich man who often behaves like the caricature of a rich man \u2014 a brash, big-talking native New Yorker who flaunts his cars (\u201cI have all the Teslas\u201d), humblebrags about a popular podcast he hosts (he guesses it makes about $1 million in annual revenue, \u201cbut it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s brand-building\u201d), and even promotes his own branded paper coffee cups.\u201cHave you seen my new cups?\u201d he asked by way of greeting during an interview last month. \u201cI love my cups. They\u2019ve got my tagline: \u2018Do The Work.\u2019 \u201dMr. Calacanis, 46, admits his personality is not for everyone. \u201cMost folks think I\u2019m lucky, some say I\u2019m a complete fraud, and a handful think I\u2019m a brilliant hype man, and I don\u2019t agree with any of them \u2014 I agree with all of them,\u201d he writes in his new book, published in July, whose full title is a mouthful: \u201cAngel: How to Invest in Technology Startups \u2014 Timeless Advice From An Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000.\u201dYet there is something refreshing and clarifying about Mr. Calacanis\u2019s frankness regarding his tech-fueled riches. He states plainly what many in Silicon Valley believe but are too politic to say \u2014 and which has lately been dawning on the rest of the world: that the tech industry is decimating the rest of the planet\u2019s wealth and stability.Still, Mr. Calacanis is offering a much more dismal view of the disruptions caused by tech \u2014 and a more radical, if also self-serving, plan for dealing with it. To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future \u2014 and you need to learn Silicon Valley\u2019s ways rather than expect to defeat it.\u201cMost of you are screwed,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel,\u201d arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America. \u201cThe world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which you\u2019re reading this.\u201dMr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead. \u201cIn my mind, candidly, we\u2019ve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dBe warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as \u201cangel investing.\u201d Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing \u2014 he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.\u201cI want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors,\u201d he says.Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice. They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks. Invest in start-ups with your \u201cfun money\u201d but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.Even other tech investors aren\u2019t sold on Mr. Calacanis\u2019s movement. Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms. \u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to lose all your money, you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Walk said.Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups. His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacanis\u2019s isn\u2019t without its apparent grifts. Mr. Calacanis runs a \u201csyndicate,\u201d a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets. The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate \u2014 and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors\u2019 returns.Not that he\u2019s shy about any of this. \u201cOf course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dYou could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades. He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, \u201cWhat would it be like to be rich?\u201dHe got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York. Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million. Along the way, he made dozens of connections \u2014 he casually name-drops every big name in tech \u2014 and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into \u201cdeal flow,\u201d getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.One charge against Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice is that his wins aren\u2019t widely replicable \u2014 not everyone can make a fortune off their friends\u2019 billion-dollar ideas, after all.But Mr. Calacanis isn\u2019t suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to wind up being the GOAT,\u201d he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.\u201dInstead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business. He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his. Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals. He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort \u2014 people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.And he is frank about the risks. The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, \u201cDON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.\u201dBut to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking. The world seems to have lost its moorings; it\u2019s changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.So shouldn\u2019t you do something big? As Mr. Calacanis argues: \u201cNo gamble, no future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: What It Means to Be a \u2018Sanctuary State\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles.For months, lawmakers in Sacramento have debated what it would mean for California to become a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d with strict regulations over how much law enforcement agencies could do to help federal immigration authorities. On Monday, Gov. Jerry Brown and Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the state Senate who introduced the legislation, reached an agreement that seemed to appease both supporters and critics.The compromise bill prohibits law enforcement agents from asking about a person\u2019s immigration status or participating in any program that uses them as immigration agents.But the legislation stops short of many of the changes Mr. de Le\u00f3n initially included in the days after President Trump\u2019s election, including preventing immigration agents from interviewing inmates in jails and allowing them access to law enforcement databases. The bill also exempts the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation from many of the restrictions, though it does require them to offer more protections for immigrant inmates.The amendments also expand the types of criminal convictions that allow local law enforcement agents to transfer and share information about inmates.For Mr. de Le\u00f3n, the legislation was the most high profile attempt to expand protections for undocumented immigrants in the Trump era. But from the beginning, the California Sheriff\u2019s Association opposed the effort, saying it would increase public safety risks. And Gov. Brown voiced reservations in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month. Immigrant rights activists staged protests for the legislation, arguing it was necessary to defend people from expanded deportation efforts and assuage fears in immigrant communities.The bill still needs to be approved by the Assembly before the legislature adjourns at the end of this week, where it is expected to pass.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)You\u2019ve heard of bomb-sniffing dogs. But a yellow labrador retriever has been putting his nose to the ground on Santa Cruz Island in an effort to sniff out a different kind of threat: a species of invasive ant.The dog, Tobias, is working with the Nature Conservancy group, helping them in their search for Argentine ants that researchers attempted to wipe out in 2009 after they were found disrupting local wildlife.So far the labrador has been unsuccessful in his search, which suggests that the scientists\u2019 effort eight years ago paid off.Though he was unruly at first, his new owners soon found that he was extremely skilled at hunting down toys, and began to train him to sniff out certain species. Along with the ants, he has also helped to detect quagga mussels, another invasive species, in Montana.According to his biography on the organization\u2019s website,\u201cHe brings total commitment to each search and is rewarded with his Wubba toy.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "For the New Cadillac, Now Comes the Real Test", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsFor the last three years, Johan de Nysschen has led a daring effort to revive Cadillac, the storied but tarnished luxury-car brand of General Motors.He has secured the ability to run Cadillac from New York, updated its range of sedans, and cut discounts and incentives to improve profitability and resale values. He has also instituted new engineering standards to raise the quality and desirability of future vehicles.But judging solely by the domestic market, the endeavor does not seem to be going very well. Cadillac\u2019s sales in the United States have stalled at around 170,000 cars a year. It last sold more than 200,000 cars a year \u2014 a key benchmark for the top luxury brands \u2014 a decade ago. In the first seven months of 2017, sales have fallen 4.9 percent.So why does Mr. de Nysschen, a 57-year-old South African, have a spring in his step?Thanks to booming sales in China, Cadillac is growing steadily on a global basis, despite its difficulties at home. Profits from China, he said, are providing the money G.M. is investing to remake and expand the brand.And soon, the first tangible products from the new Cadillac will appear, putting his strategy to the test.The first of Cadillac\u2019s new offerings will be a semiautonomous driving system called Supercruise. It will be available as an option by the end of the year in Cadillac\u2019s flagship sedan, the 2018 CT6. Supercruise will allow drivers to zip along on major highways without touching the steering wheel. It is intended to rival Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology, which requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel.\u201cWe want to signal that Cadillac is at the forefront of technological achievement,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said. \u201cSupercruise is a proof point for that.\u201dLike Autopilot, Supercruise uses radar and cameras to see the road. But it supplements those with lidar, a kind of radar that uses lasers. The system operates only on divided, limited-access highways that are free of cross traffic, intersections and pedestrians.When Supercruise is engaged, drivers are only required to look at the road ahead. A tiny camera mounted on the rearview mirror tracks the driver\u2019s eyes and triggers a warning sound if the driver looks away for too long. \u201cTheoretically, you could drive from New York to Los Angeles without putting your hands on the steering wheel,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said.Autopilot and similar technologies from Volvo and other luxury automakers beep and flash warnings if drivers take their hands from the wheel for extended periods of time. For some people, that makes them more annoying than useful.For Tesla, getting the right balance between too few and too many warnings has been a difficult challenge. Autopilot does not have a camera to track the driver\u2019s eyes, and an earlier version let drivers keep their hands off the steering wheel for several minutes under certain conditions.In 2016, an Ohio man died when his Tesla Model S crashed into a tractor-trailer while Autopilot was engaged. The system\u2019s forward-looking camera and radar failed to recognize the truck in the roadway, and neither Autopilot nor the driver applied the brakes. Federal investigators determined the driver had ignored several warnings to keep his hands on the wheel.Supercruise will be followed next year by Cadillac\u2019s introduction of a new small sport-utility vehicle, called the XT4. That model is the first to break from the angular styling of other Cadillacs, setting the company on a new design path.The whole push is a giant gamble. Returning the luster to a damaged brand is no easy task, and previous attempts by G.M. have fallen short. The overhaul Mr. de Nysschen is leading will cost the automaker several billion dollars by 2020, by which time its model line will most likely have been completely remade.Success, however, would resurrect what was once one of the most admired American brand names \u2014 one that was long a synonym for luxury.Mr. de Nysschen spent most of his career at Audi, and ran its United States unit during a period of rapid growth from 2004 to 2012. He then took over Nissan\u2019s Infiniti brand, but left after just two years to become the president of Cadillac.At Mr. de Nysschen\u2019s urging, G.M. reorganized Cadillac as an independent division and has moved the brand into its own gleaming headquarters in Manhattan, far from Chevrolet and G.M.\u2019s other, more down-market, brands back in Detroit. Existing models have been updated and given new names: the CT6 sport sedan replaced the CTS. The XT5 sport-utility vehicle replaced the SRX.Mr. de Nysschen said the headquarters move had helped \u201credefine what Cadillac stands for,\u201d and focus the staff precisely on \u201cexcellence of execution\u201d \u2014 one of the values the new Cadillac wants to be known for.Rick Mastria, the owner of a Cadillac franchise in Raynham, Mass., said he was \u201cblown away\u201d by the plans Mr. de Nysschen outlined when he first arrived in 2014. But the wait for the new models has been difficult. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the move to New York City has done anything for the brand,\u201d Mr. Mastria said.It will take a lot to change consumer perceptions, too. Chris Kanuit, a retired manufacturing executive in Jacksonville, Fla., has considered buying Cadillacs a few times in the last several years, but always ended up sticking with BMW instead.\u201cYou look at a Cadillac and there\u2019s a lot of bling,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a splashy look. BMW is not as showy.\u201dThat is one of the next issues Cadillac will address, Mr. de Nysschen said. The forthcoming XT4 S.U.V. will have some of the design elements Cadillacs are known for \u2014 the distinctive grille and the vertical lighting theme. But the wedge-shaped look of the current models is on the way out.The new look will be more curvaceous and sculpted, he said. The beltline \u2014 the line where the doors meet the windows \u2014 will be lowered, and the wheels moved closer to the corners.\u201cThey will be drivers\u2019 cars,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said.The intent of the design changes is to appeal to the current generation of premium car buyers. In the past, baby boomers wanted luxury cars that advertised their success, Mr. de Nysschen said. Younger generations want a more subtle expression of luxury. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily scream out their success to the rooftops, and if you\u2019re not relevant to them, you\u2019ll face a lot of headwinds,\u201d he said.Within a year, China will most likely surpass the United States as Cadillac\u2019s largest market. Even so, Mr. de Nysschen thinks the new Cadillac has a chance to win back market share at home \u2014 and compete head-to-head with the German brands and Lexus.\u201cWe realize it\u2019s a long-term journey still,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Survive the Apocalypse", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, the world is clearly coming to an end. But is there anything you can do to prepare?That is not a philosophical question, or a theological one. And if it is a question that seems to beg any explication, you may stop reading now.But if you are among the swelling class of weekend paranoiacs of affluent means who are starting to mull fantasies of urban escape following the endless headlines about disasters, both natural and manufactured, you may be starting to see a different image in your mind when think \u201csurvivalist.\u201d You may no longer see the wild-eyed cave dweller in camouflage fatigues, hoarding canned goods. You may even see one in the mirror.These suddenly chic survival satchels, also known as go bags, are typically lightweight military-grade backpacks stocked with provisions for at least 72 hours. Ready-made bug-out bags containing staples like water purification tablets, a 20-hour body warmer and a multifunction shovel are available on Amazon for under $200.Unlike gold, which is hovering around $1,300 an ounce, these old silver coins come in small enough denominations to barter for a loaf of bread or a socket wrench in an economic \u201cMad Max\u201d scenario. Even so, some survivalists remain silver skeptics. \u201cFor $100, let\u2019s say you get five silver coins,\u201d said an urban preparedness expert who goes by the nom de guerre Selco. \u201cWhy not buy 100 cans of soup?\u201dImagine a true economic apocalypse, one that makes the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, with its wheelbarrows of near-worthless paper currency, look like a hiccup. To prepare for the worst worst-case scenario, some doomers prefer daily staples like tampons, vegetable seeds and cigarettes (that timeless prison medium of exchange) to silver or gold as an alt-currency.\u201cIf we look at examples of systematic social breakdowns, like Argentina in 2001, or the war in the Balkans, goods that people understood on an intrinsic level clearly carried the most value when trading \u2014 cans of food, gas, batteries, cheap Bic lighters,\u201d he said. \u201cA good rule of thumb: If you\u2019d find it useful in an emergency, you\u2019ll be able to find someone who will trade for it in an emergency.\u201dWhen President Trump issued his threat to North Korea at the United Nations, many preppers had an almost Pavlovian response: to check their nuclear survival kit. Ever since the backyard bomb shelter went the way of tail fins, survival in the face of mushroom clouds has seemed highly relative.Or people may just want to stock up on Snuggies, chocolate Easter bunnies, Hummel figurines or vintage Backstreet Boys paraphernalia, which will do about as much good in the event of a direct strike.Manhattanites face challenges unknown to their Western counterparts hunkering in remote desert bunkers. Their home turf, after all, is not only a prime target, but an island. In the event of a cataclysmic emergency, bridges and tunnels may be closed, or choked off by marauding mobs, forcing survivors to consider waterborne escape.Sure, there is the cost \u2014 about $250,000, which the company is hoping to bring down \u201cto the price of a luxury car.\u201d For now, just think of it as the survivalists\u2019 Maybach.The dome houses are so rugged, according the company\u2019s founder, Don Kubley, \u201cyou could buy one today and your grandkids will be playing in it.\u201d One can only hope.Should disaster not strike? They make a great man cave or backyard cabana.In normal times, this international historical-re-enactment organization seems like little more than a harmless bunch of Renaissance Faire types playing dress up on weekends and celebrating the arts, skills and costumes of pre-17th-century Europe.But should Armageddon arrive \u2014 say, in the form of a limited nuclear exchange, global pandemic or cyber mega-attack \u2014 these hobbies could mean your survival. In other words, chivalry may not be dead after all.There is bugging out, and then there is really bugging out. In a scorched-earth scenario where even a jet pack is not enough to escape harm\u2019s way, preppers with deep pockets and a taste for Arthur C. Clarke might consider the ultimate escape: launching their DNA into space.Who knows \u2014 some ultra-intelligent alien being may discover it in the future, and use your genetic code to reanimate a race of humans on a distant planet. Let\u2019s just hope those humans don\u2019t choose to blow themselves up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Physical Limits All in Our Heads?", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingMere firepower isn\u2019t what will roll me out of bed at 3:15 a.m. to follow along online, though. Instead, it\u2019s the subplot created by a curious anomaly. The world record, set on the same Berlin course three years ago by the Kenyan star Dennis Kimetto, is 2:02.57. But one of the men in this year\u2019s field has covered the marathon distance of 26 miles and 385 yards more than two and a half minutes faster than that, in 2:00.25, powered, like Kimetto, only by his own legs and lungs \u2014 albeit with an asterisk.It\u2019s a truth universally acknowledged in the sporting world that the toughest obstacles to surmount are those we erect in our own minds. A barrier like the four-minute mile, we\u2019re told, is impregnable \u2014 until someone like Roger Bannister shows, as he did in 1954, that it can be breached, and then everyone else follows. Kimetto\u2019s world record, having been bested by such a large (though unofficial) margin, has lost much of its mental force. So will it, as the bookies seem to anticipate, be swept aside with ease?To me, the bout in Berlin seems like not just a clash of three heavyweights but a real-life test of the \u201cmental barriers\u201d theory of human endeavor. Faith in the primacy of mind over body is a trope as eagerly embraced in board rooms as in locker rooms and Nike commercials \u2014 and it\u2019s a message we\u2019ve lapped up, without much evidence, for centuries.This empowering idea is now ubiquitous. For the ambitious athlete who seeks to overcome a favored foe or break through to a new level of performance, the right attitude to overcoming obstacles is laid out clearly by the king of self-help books, Norman Vincent Peale, in \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking\u201d:\u201cJust stand up to it, that\u2019s all, and don\u2019t give way under it, and it will finally break,\u201d Peale counsels. \u201cYou will break it. Something has to break, and it won\u2019t be you, it will be the obstacle.\u201dThe logic here isn\u2019t totally crazy. Often forgotten is that in 1953, a year before Bannister\u2019s big run, he ran an exhibition race in which he was paced all the way to the finish, in part by one of his teammates who had deliberately allowed himself to be lapped. His time of 4:02 wasn\u2019t ratified as a British record, because it violated the same pacing rules as the Breaking2 marathon did \u2014 but it served its purpose. \u201cOnly two painful seconds now separated me from the four-minute mile,\u201d Bannister recalled in his autobiography, \u201cand I was certain I could cut down the time.\u201dThe four-minute mile is now an allegorical staple of the self-help literature. Bannister\u2019s feat shattered an imposing mental barrier much like the one holding you back from climbing El Capitan or getting promoted at work. \u201cWithin one year,\u201d asserts \u201cThe Winning Mind Set,\u201d a fairly typical self-help tract from 2006, \u201c37 other runners did the same thing. In the year after that, over 300 runners ran a mile in less than four minutes.\u201dNow, be honest for a moment: Did you smile a bit when you read that quotation? I know I did. Motivational slogans are great, but 26.2 miles is still 26.2 miles, and you can\u2019t simply will your muscles to keep contracting as their fuel supplies dwindle.But all three men are marathon veterans who under normal conditions have never cracked 2:03. While the exact magnitude of Kipchoge\u2019s boost in Italy is impossible to calculate, it seems likely that the drafting formation alone, which won\u2019t be duplicated in Berlin, saved him one to two minutes. So, back under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions in Berlin, why should we expect any of these men, all in or approaching their mid-30s, to suddenly burst through to a new level \u2014 unless what limited their previous efforts was more mental than physical?As a hard-nosed empiricist who laughed off the sports psychology seminars I was forced to sit through as a college track athlete, the skeptical take is my default position. I\u2019ve sneered at the bromides of self-help for as long as I\u2019ve known them.Four months later, that still feels true. A once-unthinkable time like 2:01-something no longer sounds that fast \u2014 because a human has run 2:00.25.So, if the weather is good and the stars are aligned, I expect to see Kipchoge set out at an impossible pace, in pursuit of an impossible time. And because any man can do what any other has done, I expect Bekele and Kipsang to follow. The tension will mount as the trio clip off mile after reckless mile, and we\u2019ll hold our breaths waiting for the inevitable moment when the physiological debt comes due. I expect to see carnage and mayhem and beauty and truth in the final miles.Something will have to break \u2014 but, despite myself, I don\u2019t think it will be Kipchoge. I think he\u2019s going to run 2:01-something. And if he does, I\u2019ll start writing my self-help book on Monday morning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Two-Minute Commute", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntDr. Robert J. Cerfolio is all about efficiency.So when Dr. Cerfolio, a surgeon, planned his move to New York, he told his real-estate agent he needed to be within walking distance \u2014 preferably no more than four blocks \u2014 of his workplace, NYU Langone Health.Dr. Cerfolio, often called Cerf, was coming from Birmingham, Ala., where he had been chief of thoracic surgery at the University of Alabama Hospital. (He performs non-heart chest surgery, primarily of the lungs and esophagus, including robotic surgery.)In the winter, he began preparations for his new position as chief of thoracic surgery and inaugural director of the Lung Cancer Center at NYU Langone\u2019s Perlmutter Cancer Center. Dr. Cerfolio, 55, was unfamiliar with the neighborhood, on First Avenue in the 30s, at the edge of Murray Hill.He and his wife, Lorraine, had lived in New York for a year during some of his medical training, in the early 1990s. \u201cWe wanted to have children and didn\u2019t think New York was ideal for a young family,\u201d he said.They spent more than 20 years in Alabama, but four years ago, Lorraine died of cancer. Dr. Cerfolio\u2019s parents still live in New Jersey, where he grew up; two of his three siblings live in the Northeast; and the youngest of his three sons just started at Columbia University. So now it made sense to return to New York City.Though Dr. Cerfolio prefers to own, renting seemed feasible for the moment. \u201cI\u2019m still learning about the area and not ready to commit to a long-term place just yet,\u201d he said.He knew he wanted at least two bedrooms, so his sons could visit. He wanted a good view, a washer-dryer, an excellent gym and outdoor space where he could exercise in the sun \u2014 all within blocks of the hospital.\u201cI am not going to throw away my valuable time sitting in the car or stuck on a subway,\u201d he said. In Birmingham, his drive to work took just 14 minutes in the early morning hours; the same trip home, in traffic, consumed an hour.Last winter, the hospital referred him to Steve Hallerman, an associate broker at Citi Habitats, for help with the hunt. Mr. Hallerman, familiar with what was available in the immediate area, nudged Dr. Cerfolio\u2019s four-block range up to 10 or more blocks. And one Sunday, Mr. Hallerman took him out to see some options.\u201cThe budget was $8,000, $10,000, $12,000, whatever,\u201d Mr. Hallerman said of the monthly rent. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what he would get for his dollar. It is like buying a car: I will show you a Volkswagen and a Tesla. He was unfamiliar with Manhattan, and I wanted to give him a feel for different buildings.\u201dDr. Cerfolio rejected some buildings partly because they had unimpressive gyms. One building\u2019s demographic skewed too old. Another\u2019s skewed too young.He liked a four-bedroom with two balconies at the Future, a condo, for $12,000 a month. \u201cI thought if my kids come, they could have a private room,\u201d he said. But the view wasn\u2019t ideal, as it was partly obscured by neighboring towers.At $9,000 a month, a beautiful three-bedroom on a low floor at the Abbey Condominium, a former church parish house near Stuyvesant Square, had no views and lacked amenities. And in any case, Dr. Cerfolio\u2019s taste tended toward modern buildings. He also didn\u2019t relish a 20-minute walk to work on cold winter mornings.But just north of the hospital, on First Avenue, the American Copper Buildings were rising: two copper-clad towers connected by a skybridge, in the shape of a crooked \u201cH.\u201d Dr. Cerfolio loved the unusual exterior, gleaming in the sun.Although construction was still under way, Mr. Hallerman later visited the buildings and \u201cknew this was perfect,\u201d he said.Dr. Cerfolio scrutinized the website and visited in the spring. The West Tower was already open for renters, while the East Tower won\u2019t be ready for leasing until later this year.He chose a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit \u2014 one of three, out of 761 units, with a terrace \u2014 for $14,100 a month. The view is of the East River and Queens in one direction and the Empire State Building in the other.His new home is far smaller than his Alabama residence, but the transition was not difficult. \u201cMy kids were out of the house and my wife had passed away, so I was looking forward to a new phase,\u201d he said.The building amenities, including a pool and gym, should be ready later this month, according to the developer. Until then, Dr. Cerfolio has been working out on his terrace nearly every morning.The building has smart elevators, so his wait for an elevator is brief. And his efficiency in getting to work is unparalleled.\u201cThe median time is two minutes and 20 seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go in under two if I go really fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
