Some previous victims of data breaches have also taken to Twitter.David Anderson said his personal information had been stolen four times in four years.In 2015, an intrusion into computer systems for the government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management affected 21.5 million people. Mr. Anderson, a business school professor in New York, was one of them.And then there was the breach at Equifax, one of the country\u2019s three major credit monitoring agencies. Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers and other sensitive data for 143 million Americans were in the mix, the company said.But Mr. Anderson was lucky: The thieves have not used his information so far.But hackings often go unnoticed \u2014 at first.One man said the thieves had so ruined his credit, he was unable to secure a needed mortgage refinance.Janis Barbour said her Social Security number was used to fraudulently file taxes in Ohio. She and her husband live in Berkeley, Calif.They learned of the theft only when the Internal Revenue Service confronted them for not declaring a tax refund as income. And that was just one problem.Her credit card details were stolen in data breaches at Target and Home Depot, she said. A digital attack at her health insurance provider made more private information vulnerable.She said she had spent nine months trying to get the I.R.S. to agree that her identity was stolen. She had to report the intrusion to local police, then file an affidavit, then contact the credit bureaus and then the Ohio government.Ms. Barbour, a retired marketing researcher, said she has never had a physical credit card or Social Security card stolen. Several years ago, she and her husband locked their credit reports from activity from outside parties.Then on Friday, she learned she and her husband were included in the Equifax breach. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s nothing you can really do to protect yourself,\u201d she said.As a result, consumers like Kate Fairweather say they feel that they cannot prevent their information from leaking into the shadows of the internet.\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, here we go again\u2019,\u201d said Ms. Fairweather, an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who found out this week that the Equifax attack made her data vulnerable two years after it was stolen in the Office of Personnel Management hacking.Michael Harwood, an engineering manager in Melbourne, Fla., said his information was stolen two years ago.\u201cInitially, it\u2019s really terrifying, especially having your Social Security number taken,\u201d said Mr. Harwood, who noticed a mysterious attempt to transfer $1,000 from his bank account. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about the tremendous implications this could have and the possibility of it going on for years.\u201dHe said he had managed to trace the transaction through his PayPal account to his eBay profile, where he discovered an intrusion that laid bare a trove of personal information.He spent the next month trying to repair the breach. He went to the local police station, set up a program to screen for suspicious activity stemming from his Social Security number and financial data, changed his eBay password and created a new bank account.That meant a long wait for new credit and debt cards, a temporary freeze of his assets and a hold on withdrawals and transfers while the bank handled the move.\u201cThat was a major pain,\u201d Mr. Harwood said, adding that his original account and routing numbers had been linked to a slew of automated payments and shopping sites, including Amazon and travel booking sites. \u201cIt ends up being fairly far-reaching and inconvenient \u2014 you\u2019re still making discoveries months later that there\u2019s another account you have to correct.\u201dHe said he now watched his accounts closely and signed up for services from LifeLock, an identity theft protection company. He also counts his blessings.\u201cIt could\u2019ve been much worse.\u201dThere are more reasons than ever to protect your personal information, as major website breaches become ever more frequent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Save These Dying Italian Towns?", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "Near-empty villages try to hold on to an endangered way of life \u2014 and some of the country\u2019s most important artisanal traditions.Supported byTHE FIRST THING that must be said about the ancient town of Civita di Bagnoregio, just two hours away from Rome and Florence, is that it is beautiful. From a distance, it looks literally otherworldly: The town sits so high atop a perilously steep pinnacle of eroding volcanic rock that it seems as if it\u2019s perched upon clouds rather than tethered to the earth. Its very sediment is strafed with 2,500 years of architectural history: Etruscan caves, ancient remains, medieval dwellings and Renaissance villas.Originally a center along ancient trade routes, Civita di Bagnoregio was prosperous from Roman times through the late Middle Ages. But after a devastating earthquake in 1695, most residents fled for lower ground, and so began the city\u2019s long decline. By the end of World War II, nearly all of its inhabitants had left in search of work in cities or abroad. For the last half century, its population has hovered around 10 or so full-time residents.Because the erosion of the hill is so severe (houses have been tumbling off its sides since the 1700s), Civita di Bagnoregio will eventually be reclaimed by the landscape. Residents and visitors alike must park at the base and ascend a steep footbridge to enter through a huge Gothic archway. Past the backless facade of a Renaissance house, with several of its windows open to the sky like a stage set, lies a small, dusty piazza with a church, a fine seventh-century medieval tower, a small bar and not much else. There is no pharmacy or school, no hospital, none of the necessities that somehow serve to make a place a place. There are only a couple of inns, and a few restaurants. Civita is real without being actual, if that makes any sense.FOR ALL THE ANCIENT Italian hill towns and villages that delight the traveler \u2014 the San Gimignanos, Montepulcianos and Fiesoles \u2014 there are scores of others (many equally or more beautiful) where few venture and in which very few reside today. According to a 2016 Italian environmental association report, there are nearly 2,500 rural Italian villages that are perilously depopulated, some semi-abandoned and others virtual ghost towns. A primary narrative of Italy in the 20th century has been what followed the collision of poverty, urbanization, mass emigration and natural disaster, a confluence of events that has devastated many towns that had otherwise managed to thrive, or at least get by, for centuries. These towns, most of which are in the historically impoverished south, had already lost tens of millions of inhabitants in the great waves of migration from the late 19th century to the mid 1970s; in the last 25 years, they lost another 15 percent. Now, houses and schools sit empty and fields fallow; shops are unattended.These rural places were once intricately tied to the countryside around them, their inhabitants working as farmers and merchants, craftsmen and shepherds. But when these towns die, it\u2019s not just the population that suffers: so too do the unique traditions and skills associated with each place, as well as the landscape that supported them. This phenomenon is, of course, not unique to Italy: Small towns across the developed world, including in the United States, are left behind as technologies and economies change, rendering the industries and the know-how that once sustained them obsolete, forcing their populations to relocate to urban centers. What is particular to Italy, however, is the exquisite architectural character of its hill towns, as well as the quality of the handiwork and traditions that were born, cultivated and perfected here. These towns and their craftsmanship are what we think of when we think of Italy \u2014 as fundamental to the country\u2019s identity as its important cities and grand artistic legacies. It isn\u2019t far-fetched to say that what\u2019s at risk of being lost with their obsolescence is nothing less than Italy\u2019s rural soul.But though these towns may represent the essence of Italian history and the country\u2019s artisanal tradition, the government has done little to help preserve them, aside from declaring 2017 \u2018\u2018The Year of the Villages\u2019\u2019 in hopes of boosting tourism. It has therefore fallen to locals \u2014 citizens and mayors \u2014 to try to change their fates, often through inventive, sometimes ingenious, methods that mingle humor with a deep sorrow and desperation. One picturesque medieval hamlet in Tuscany, Pratariccia, sold itself on eBay for $3.1 million several years ago. Another, Calsazio, tried to follow, offering itself for only $333,000, listing the item\u2019s condition as \u2018\u2018used.\u2019\u2019 In Calabria, the mayor of Sellia (population 530) signed a decree banning death and illness in his town, and recently opened an adventure park with a giant zip line he thought would lure visitors. Most recently, the mayor of Bormida in Liguria floated a provisional offer on his Facebook page: $2,100 to anyone who moved there in order to keep it populated. (There was so much interest that he had to delete the post.)And then there are towns like Civita di Bagnoregio. Like so many of the others, it has been preserved by the very forces that doomed it: poverty and abandonment. Unlike the others, however, Civita was saved by having been \u2018\u2018discovered\u2019\u2019 by fashionable Romans (including Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele) and expats over the last 20 or so years, who have made summer houses or weekend places of its exceptionally fine, deserted buildings, drawn by the romance of Civita\u2019s remarkable situation \u2014 and its proximity to Rome. The restoration of the entire town is eerily pristine; there\u2019s nary a yellowing leaf on the potted geraniums and colorful hydrangeas that grace the exterior of every perfectly renovated house.These days, Civita has become a tourist destination for day trippers, who arrive by the busload and pay a small fee to enter. Sometimes up to 5,000 people a day wander the town, which at its seasonal height sleeps only about 100. The effect of all these people \u2014 selfie sticks moving through the air like antennae \u2014 gives the place the unfortunate air of a Disney set: a hyper-clean, historically accurate medieval town as realized on a Universal Studios back lot. There is nothing to mar the scene \u2014 no pizzerias or Starbucks or even cars. And just as one starts to wonder what kind of town is one in which there are no children or families, no banks or offices, dusk starts to fall, and the tourists and the white heat of the day retreat. Things go quiet, the light glows pink and the \u2018\u2018locals,\u2019\u2019 many from Rome and the U.S., start to appear \u2014 there are drinks on terraces and quiet dinners in the side streets, conversations in private gardens among neighbors and friends who know one another, and who all love and care for this enchanted, imperiled piece of history.BUT THE FARTHER ONE gets from major cities like Florence or Rome, the more difficult it is to attract weekend tourists. Deep in Sicily, off a terrible road whose signs resignedly warn of potholes, lies the isolated town of Sutera, built around the base of a steep mountain. In 2013, at the behest of its mayor, the town opened its doors \u2014 and its empty houses \u2014 to survivors of the catastrophic Lampedusa shipwreck, which killed more than 360 refugees. Sutera\u2019s population had dwindled from 5,000 in 1970 to just 1,500, and the mayor recognized the humanitarian and economic opportunity the migrants could provide for his moribund town. To help the refugees, most of whom are from sub-Saharan Africa, integrate into the community, they are paired with local families, and required to take Italian lessons, given to them by the town\u2019s citizens. (The European Union provides funding for food, clothing and housing, which can spur the creation of jobs for both migrants and locals.) Initially, there was some resistance, but that has disappeared with the energy these newcomers have brought to the area. Today, one can find young Nigerians taking their morning espresso alongside the old men, and local children kicking soccer balls in the street with their new playmates. And each summer the town hosts a daylong festival featuring the traditional food, music and dance of the immigrants.One of the first towns to invite migrants into its walls was Riace, in Calabria, whose mayor, Domenico Lucano, was named one of Fortune\u2019s \u2018\u2018World\u2019s 50 Greatest Leaders\u2019\u2019 last year. By 1998, when it took in a group of Kurdish refugees, Riace\u2019s population had fallen to around 800 from 2,500 after World War II. Today, its population is 1,500, with migrants from over 20 countries. Some of these are apprenticing artisans, learning old skills like embroidery, glass mosaic and pottery that were themselves dying out, and so helping keep Italian culture alive. Lucano told the BBC, \u2018\u2018The multiculturalism, the variety of skills and personal stories which people have brought to Riace, have revolutionized what was becoming a ghost town.\u2019\u2019 Other towns have taken Riace\u2019s lead, too: an act of humanity that has become an act of self-preservation as well.UNLIKE URBAN CENTERS, hill towns were built to be connected to the countryside, which provided each its particular raison d\u2019\u00eatre, from its subsistence to its commerce. Even physically, the towns appear like natural outcroppings, terraced along the sides of hills, as if sprouting from the earth beneath them.In the region of Abruzzo, surrounded by the high peaks of the Apennines, the stunning fortified medieval hilltop village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio sits atop a ridge overlooking a dramatic and lush plateau. Once a bustling center of agriculture and wool production, it began to shrink when the Italian wool industry went into decline, crippled by competition from abroad. By the 1990s, the town had only about 100 full-time residents. Santo Stefano is just two hours from Rome and is surrounded by countryside that resembles the Austrian hills of \u2018\u2018The Sound of Music\u2019\u2019: expansive fields of wildflowers backed by majestic snowcapped mountains. It is a sublime place for hiking or bicycling in summer and skiing or snowshoeing in winter. And yet, Abruzzo, long considered poor and backward, has never been particularly beloved by Italians, and consequently, not much considered or well known.The ancient hill town came as a shock, a revelation really, to Daniele Kihlgren, the renegade scion of an Italian concrete fortune, when he came upon it while on a motorcycle ride in the late 1990s. Although semi-abandoned, its medieval character and architecture were completely intact \u2014 unruined, ironically, by concrete, the material Kihlgren is the first to acknowledge has disgraced so much of Italy. How, he wondered, might places of such distinct and exquisite beauty be revitalized without wrecking their historic identity? And how might their local traditions, from food to domestic handicrafts, be organically preserved? \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t compete with China in mass production, and we can\u2019t compete in technology,\u2019\u2019 Kihlgren says, \u2018\u2018but we have what no one else in the world has,\u2019\u2019 which is the beauty of these villages and the cultural history of its people, the stuff he calls Italy\u2019s minor patrimony. \u2018\u2018And if we don\u2019t ruin it, it can be what saves southern Italy.\u2019\u2019It is also what has helped revive it. Thanks largely to Sextantio, there are now new jobs, thousands of tourists annually, nearly two dozen new bed-and-breakfasts and several restaurants, galleries and shops. But Kihlgren has sunk his fortune into this project \u2014 as well as into other villages that he has bought, either outright or partially, with the intention of resurrecting them using the same model. While his is primarily a cultural project, he is keenly aware that unless it can make money and be replicated, it is just a folly in his grand quest to resuscitate southern Italy. And indeed, there have been many difficulties and setbacks \u2014 from his own high standards to the devastating earthquake that rocked the region in 2009. This past July marked the first month since the project\u2019s inception in which he made a profit.Still, Kihlgren remains optimistic \u2014 and how can anyone who loves Italy not root for his success? \u2018\u2018If I, someone with no business skills at all, can make this work,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018then there is hope \u2014 hope that the values contained in these small historical places can be the engine to revitalize them.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nintendo\u2019s Super NES Classic Edition Is Nostalgia, Revisited", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the original Super NES console was introduced in the United States in 1991, it was beloved by a generation of fans because it introduced games with narrative adventures that demanded a new level of engagement compared with previous systems, whose games merely replicated the endless levels and high scores of arcade games.The Super NES Classic, which is being released on Friday, looks exactly like the original, except it is small enough to sit in the palm of your hand. The $80 console comes preloaded with 21 16-bit games from Nintendo\u2019s early 1990s glory days, including \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario World\u201d and \u201cYoshi\u2019s Island,\u201d as well as third-party titles like \u201cFinal Fantasy III\u201d from Square and \u201cSuper Castlevania IV\u201d from Konami. As a bonus, the game package also includes a never-released sequel to \u201cStar Fox,\u201d one of the first three-dimensional games developed by Nintendo.So what was it like to delve into the past? I spent a long weekend testing the Super NES Classic, with a little help from my 8-year-old niece Caroline, who provided a fresh perspective on a console that became obsolete long before she was born.Here\u2019s a taste of what Caroline and I experienced playing the Super NES Classic Edition.The console is easy to set up: Just plug it into a TV via the included HDMI cable.After that, I had a blast exploring the dungeons of Hyrule in \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d and tossing TNT barrels in \u201cDonkey Kong Country.\u201d In fact, I played so long, a creeping ache lead to worries about the onset of the dreaded \u201cNintendo thumb.\u201dBut as fun as the retro games are, Nintendo did little to update the gameplay for modern audiences. The Super NES Classic has no internet connection, so there is no way to compete online with friends. (The console does come with a pair of controllers, allowing for two-player mode at home.)And in a time of wireless technology that allows controllers to be used in any spot in a room, the Super NES Classic controllers are wired and plug into the console, which limits a player\u2019s mobility and leaves a mess of cables draped over the floor. The cables are longer than those of the NES Classic, but they are still only about five feet long. I had to place the console on a chair in the middle of the room to play from the comfort of my couch.Another limitation: The Super NES Classic has no slot for game cartridges, so if you hung on to your old Super NES games in the hopes of using them again, you are out of luck. They will not work on this system.But the Super NES Classic does have a few new and nifty features.One is called Rewind, which lets players back up a minute or so in a game to restart difficult challenges. And each game has four \u201csuspend\u201d points, allowing players to save a game midlevel \u2014 unlike in the original system, which forced you to rush to finish a level because your mother was calling you to dinner.A feature called Frame also allows players to pick a border around games to fit today\u2019s wider-screen TVs. The console also offers three display choices: the original 4:3 aspect ratio of the games, a CRT filter that replicates the same blurry look of cathode-ray tube TVs, and a Pixel Perfect mode that makes the games look crisp and clean.It\u2019s hard to imagine that today\u2019s youth would want to play 16-bit games on an outmoded system when they are accustomed to ergonomic controllers, powerful processors, surround-sound audio and high-definition screens. And the simple, side-scrolling gameplay of the past is no match for the interactive worlds created by augmented and virtual reality games.So the real draw of the Super NES Classic is nostalgia. That\u2019s a theory I tested with Caroline.Over the hour we played with the console together, she was drawn to the characters she recognized (Mario, yes; Samus Aran of \u201cSuper Metroid,\u201d not so much). She wanted to play \u201cSuper Mario World,\u201d which she loved once she learned how to make Mario ride Yoshi.\u201cI couldn\u2019t see what I was doing,\u201d she said of the fast and furious racing game. \u201cMinecraft is simpler.\u201dThe target for the Super NES Classic Edition is adults who grew up with the original console, which is still a big audience. Learning a lesson after many outraged fans who sought the NES Classic last year were left empty-handed, Nintendo said it would increase inventory of the Super NES Classic this year. It also said that the NES Classic would return to retail shelves next year.The games of the Super NES Classic still stand the test of time as some of Nintendo\u2019s finest. But they feel trapped in the amber of an outdated console.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stranger in Maryland, Touched by a Hurricane Story, Sends 3 Cups to Houston", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 As we walked through Shirley Hines\u2019s flood-battered Houston neighborhood on Sunday, we passed pile after pile at the curb \u2014 the soggy, ruined contents of people\u2019s homes, mixed with floorboards, Sheetrock and insulation.I suddenly felt a tinge of embarrassment. My 8-year-old son carried a box containing small, pretty things: three red-striped cups, fragile and ordinary kitchen-cabinet objects. In a place where everything was broken, what good was something so shiny and little and whole?The three cups were a gift for Ms. Hines, from a stranger in Maryland.I first met Ms. Hines a few days after her neighborhood was flooded by Hurricane Harvey. The inside of her house was outside at the curb, in a tall messy mound. I was asking her and her neighbors one question for an article I was writing for The New York Times: Amid so much loss, what did you manage to save?Her granddaughter had answered the question for her, pulling a trash bag from the pile and digging through it until she found them \u2014 a collection of damaged Fitz and Floyd cups that had belonged to Ms. Hines\u2019s late mother. Ms. Hines was getting rid of all of the cups, and she was having a hard time even talking about it.After I spoke with her for a while, about the cups and what they meant to her, Ms. Hines changed her mind: She decided to keep a few that were not as damaged as the others.And there I was on Sunday, back on Ms. Hines\u2019s block, this time with my wife, my 5-year-old daughter and my son. Ms. Hines, seated outside on her lawn with friends and neighbors, was stunned. She unwrapped the Bubble Wrap around one of the cups and fought back tears. She had kept three of the original cups, but had gotten rid of three others. Now she had three new ones.I told Ms. Hines that I had started to feel awkward bringing her these little gifts amid so much devastation.\u201cNo, no,\u201d Ms. Hines told me. \u201cThis has really made my day, really made my day. It\u2019s unbelievable, the identical cups. It\u2019s very touching. Oh, my God. That is wonderful.\u201dMs. Hines asked for Ms. Dahms\u2019s address. She wanted to send her a thank-you note.Ms. Dahms sent me an email explaining why and how she did it \u2014 and she gave me permission to publish it.She wrote:I was reading The Times over breakfast Wednesday morning and while drinking my morning coffee, I saw the photo of Ms. Hines and her broken coffee cup, one of the few she saved after her mother\u2019s passing. She had said, \u201cWhen I was really feeling down, I\u2019d get one and drink me some coffee.\u201d I went to the Fitz and Floyd site and sent a note to them asking to buy a cup, and included a link to the NYT article.Fitz and Floyd replied within a few hours. They sent a link to an eBay site selling the particular mug, and noted that because the coffee cups \u201cwere manufactured before 1979, it can be very difficult to track down some of our vintage products, but after searching online, we were able to find 3 of them available for purchase, the only place where more can be purchased at this time.\u201d I clicked the link, bought all three available, and wrote the vendor asking that the treasured little cups be sent directly to Texas.I desperately wanted to replace that broken cup. The world is a broken place, but also a place of great strength, dignity, and personal courage. That\u2019s what I wanted to honor. Also, I figured that the cups could also be from her mother, just a long way around, hopping a few decades in the journey.Thanks.AnnAdvertisement"}

Russia has 56 times the territory and more than twice the population of Italy. Yet Italy\u2019s economy, troubled as it is, is 44 percent larger than Russia\u2019s.Nor is it sheer scale. China\u2019s G.D.P. may eventually outstrip America\u2019s. But per capita Chinese G.D.P. is lower than Mexico\u2019s, making it a rich country of relatively poor people.A better measure of national greatness is the ability of nations to cultivate, attract and retain human capital. People tend to vote with their feet. To trace the rise or decline of nations is to watch where those feet go \u2014 and where they leave.Take Hungary. Since 1960, seven Hungarians have won the Nobel Prize. Not bad for a small country \u2014 except that all of them left Hungary to make their lives and careers elsewhere.The United States provides the opposite example. The American economy is 12 percent larger today than it was at the time of the financial crisis. We\u2019re also taking in roughly half a million legal new arrivals a year. The foot-voting continues, and we\u2019re still coming out on top.A common American conceit is that we attract brilliant foreigners because we have brilliant things: great universities, vast financial resources, a dynamic economy, high-tech. That gets things mostly backward. It\u2019s because we have brilliant foreigners that we have those things in the first place. Google. Comcast. eBay. Kraft. Pfizer. AT&T. They all had immigrants as founders.Opponents of a liberal immigration policy often insist they welcome legal immigrants and only object to illegal ones. Rubbish. The immigration reform bill introduced in Congress this year by Republicans Tom Cotton and David Perdue and endorsed by Donald Trump aims to cut legal immigration by half.Restrictionists also argue that we need to favor newcomers with \u201cskills\u201d and educational credentials. More rubbish. Jan Koum arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine in 1992 as a 16-year-old boy with his mother, living off food stamps. She worked as a babysitter. He later dropped out of college. In 2009 he came up with an idea for a mobile messaging app. Five years later Facebook purchased WhatsApp for $22 billion.Should it make any difference to WhatsApp\u2019s billion-plus users that Koum arrived in the United States legally? And if it turned out that he hadn\u2019t, should he be required to leave the country, presumably so he can pay income tax \u2014 and create jobs \u2014 in his native Ukraine?That would be self-defeating. But it\u2019s the fate that may soon await 800,000 or so young people who were brought without visas to the United States as children, grew up in the country, in some cases only speak English, and now face deportation because the Trump administration seems poised to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that allowed them to stay in school or their jobs.Lose that faith, and lose what\u2019s best about America, too.Advertisement"}

The couple was lured by the remoteness of the area, which the ancient Romans called \u2018\u2018Finibus Terrae\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the ends of the earth \u2014 and by a layered history that had been shaped not merely by the Greeks who settled there, but by the Norman conquests, the Ottoman invasions and by an ancient Indo-European tribe called the Messapii.Despite their shared loved of the region, the two men were at odds when they began looking at properties: While Miller wanted to live in the isolated countryside, Panebianco \u2014 who is half Sicilian and half Calabrese \u2014 was determined to find a place in one of Salento\u2019s numerous small towns, where simple buildings are clustered around a central piazza.

Once inside, though, beyond the dust and the desolation, they noticed that colorful late 19th-century floor tiles patterned with extravagant floral and geometric motifs had, miraculously, survived intact in three of the rooms. There was also a poetically overgrown private garden busy with tangerine, bitter orange, persimmon and pomegranate trees. They knew they had found the ideal compromise between Panebianco\u2019s need for village life and Miller\u2019s bucolic dream.BUT MILLER\u2019S worldview and verve for collecting has an even longer reach than did James\u2019s: Beylik, the name he and Panebianco chose for their Salento property (Turkish for \u2018\u2018territory under jurisdiction of the Bey\u2019\u2019), pays tribute to the curator\u2019s interest in Islamic art and gardens as well as his devotion to the European cultural canon. In his extensive Middle Eastern travels he has amassed collections that range from Syrian glass to Anatolian textiles and ceramics, all of which are now integrated into the aesthetic of the Salento home.After buying the smaller house next door and opening up a courtyard between the two, the construction began. \u2018\u2018We worked by subtraction, aiming to release space rather than adding extra rooms,\u2019\u2019 Panebianco says, noting that this is a very un-Italian thing to do. Construction also uncovered several architectural gems, which is very Italian: Here, the original courtyard of pietra leccese \u2014 slabs of local, hand-cut, honey-hued stones \u2014 was buried beneath a foot of earth. The couple also discovered two elaborately designed archways \u2014 relics, Miller believes, of settlers from Venice and the Middle East who made Salento their commercial base in the 17th and 18th centuries \u2014 that join the dining room and kitchen. With their access to the garden via gothic-style doorways, these two rooms have become the heart of the house.Although the public areas have been kept relatively spare, with only suggestions of Miller\u2019s vast collections in evidence, the sitting room, library and guest bedrooms are lively with his finds. In the sole room with salvageable paint on the walls (a bright pistachio hue crowned with minuscule frescoed decoration), Southern Italian votives from as early as the 18th century are now mounted above a 19th-century French country bed. A slew of wooden painters\u2019 palettes from flea markets in Paris and Rome decorate an intimate parlor adjacent to the library.The garden, too, has a Middle Eastern flair, and recalls a riad with its intimate seating areas and hanging lanterns. Miller redesigned the terraces, creating raised paths bordered by agapanthus and roses. There is a kitchen garden of aromatic Mediterranean herbs, and at one end of the expanse is a narrow, raised pool inspired by those commonly found in Middle Eastern gardens. Panebianco, a fine cook, makes marmalades from the citrus trees, as well as basil pesto and liqueurs from distilled laurel leaves and myrtle berries.Back in the city, the couple, who now live in a sunny apartment adjacent to the American Academy, still enjoy the discoveries yielded by Rome\u2019s ancient labyrinthine alleys and antiques shops, but the long stints in Salento are a voyage to another era, a Jamesian detour into an Eden suffused with light. \u2018\u2018When Giovanni and I announced to a Parisian friend we were about to embark on this adventure,\u2019\u2019 Miller recalls, \u2018\u2018he said to me something that stayed with me \u2014 that making one\u2019s home in a place so remote and so forlorn, cultivating your garden and your pleasures, is the most radical action one can take.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Helmut Lang Returns! Or Does He?", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn fashion, where hysteria is the dominant mode of expression and praise is often ladled out in heaps rather than spoonfuls, coronations can be instantaneous, new gods and icons minted every season. And then there is Helmut Lang.Even among the great and the good, Mr. Lang stands apart. For those who followed fashion during his halcyon days in the 1990s and early aughts, his pieces were the stuff of cult fascination. His jeans were the only jeans (and he was one of the early few with the temerity to charge hundreds of dollars for them); his T-shirts were the perfect T-shirts; his coats were the must-have coats.Within five years, Mr. Lang had left his company amid rumors of disagreements with the Prada Group, and retired to Long Island to pursue life as an artist. (In 2011 and 2015, he created shows out of the remnants of his archive, which he shredded and made into sculpture.) The Helmut Lang brand, sold in 2006 to the Link Theory group, continued. But its new designers never recaptured the energy and influence that Mr. Lang had marshaled.\u201cMy personal voice cannot be replaced by a design group,\u201d Mr. Lang had told The New Yorker, and though the Lang brand continued selling new designs with some success, it seemed he was right.As many of his contemporaries have faded from memory, Mr. Lang has remained influential. His clothes are endlessly riffed upon and knocked off outright, and many top designers acknowledge him openly.The moves he made that seemed daring in the \u201990s \u2014 borrowing details from fetish gear and military garb, showing his collections online, presenting men\u2019s wear and women\u2019s wear together, casting his shows with friends and models of all ages, shooting conceptual advertising campaigns that did not always display clothes \u2014 have become standard practice. The influence of the \u201990s is bounding back into fashion. The time may be right to bring back Helmut Lang, in spirit if not in fact.Andrew Rosen, the chief executive of Helmut Lang and of Theory, dismissed the longtime Helmut Lang designers, the husband-and-wife team of Michael and Nicole Colovos, and changed its course. In place of a new designer, Mr. Rosen hired Isabella Burley, the editor of the British fashion magazine Dazed, to be Helmut Lang\u2019s first editor in residence, essentially operating a fashion label along the lines of a magazine.She reached backward into the Lang archive, but also brought a necessary infusion of the new. She invited Shayne Oliver, the designer of Hood by Air and one of the many who cite Mr. Lang as a reference and inspiration.\u201cI referenced him so much it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Mr. Oliver said in an interview. Now he will be Helmut Lang\u2019s first designer in residence, working on a capsule collection to debut at New York Fashion Week on Monday.Like Ms. Burley, Mr. Oliver, 29, is of a different generation from Mr. Lang. Ms. Burley, who is 26, admitted to having missed the first wave of Helmut obsession. \u201cI think in a weird way having that distance is a benefit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe legacy of Helmut Lang is so strong and so important to acknowledge. We were really thinking how to be actively engaged with the legacy and the history of the brand.\u201dIf Helmut Lang has not been quite Helmut Lang without Helmut Lang, one of Ms. Burley\u2019s projects is to put him back into circulation. The company will reissue a revolving selection of pieces designed by Mr. Lang from past collections, a \u201cre-edition\u201d (in the manner of an artist\u2019s estate) of Helmut Lang originals \u2014 the kind of pieces that still do a steady trade on eBay and resale sites like Grailed. The first 15 pieces, including a silver motorcycle jacket (from 1999), paint-splattered jeans (from 1998) and a horsehair bag (from 2004) went on sale at Helmut Lang stores and on helmutlang.com Friday.Mr. Lang collaborated with artists (in particular, with his friend Jenny Holzer) on his ad campaigns; Ms. Burley has invited a dozen artists, including Carolee Schneemann, Walter Pfeiffer, Carrie Mae Weems, Adrienne Salinger and the estates of Peter Hujar and Mark Morrisroe to express their vision of the brand for T-shirts, posters and limited-edition items.But Helmut Lang also needs urgency and novelty, the kind Mr. Oliver, who put his Hood by Air line on hiatus, is well positioned to provide. His collection, to be called Helmut Lang Seen by Shayne Oliver, will be only a small part of the Lang whole. He is not overseeing the main commercial collection that is Helmut Lang\u2019s bread and butter, which remains in the hands of an in-house design team. Without the pressure to speak for the entire company or set its course, he has been given free rein to design a collection to make waves.Hood by Air\u2019s shows were flamboyantly theatrical, thumping celebrations of chaos that seemed to herald a new world order. Mr. Oliver set frenetic dancers free to disrupt his shows, hobbled models with mutant boots that seemed to walk in both directions, collaborated with PornHub and eschewed gender entirely. But he freely acknowledged his debt to Mr. Lang, whose quieter, more minute renovations of fashion orthodoxies, from the design of clothes to the culture around them, informed his own.Mr. Lang\u2019s clothing is, in general, subtler than Mr. Oliver\u2019s. Though, with his suggestions of fetish and pornography \u2014 clothes dangled straps that implied bondage, a famous top bared its wearer\u2019s nipple \u2014 Mr. Lang had his more provocative moments, too. Mr. Oliver cited those as particularly influential. \u201cIt\u2019s horny,\u201d he said of Mr. Lang\u2019s fashion. \u201cWhich for me is very important.\u201dYet Mr. Oliver welcomed the moment to step back from his wildest moments. The whole industry, he said, has been moving in an extravagant direction, and he has lost interest in much of New York fashion. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re in \u2018Best in Show,\u2019\u201d he said, making a reference to Christopher Guest\u2019s mockumentary about preening owners competing in dog shows. \u201cThat\u2019s how every show feels to me.\u201dThere is still a flavor of Hood by Air in his Helmut Lang pieces, including some that Mr. Oliver first tried there. He designed less in imitation than in homage, taking the broad strokes of Mr. Lang\u2019s oeuvre \u2014 sharp tailoring, outerwear, slinky long dresses \u2014 and recasting them in his own image. \u201cWe kind of ignored everything Helmut, to be honest,\u201d he said.\u201cOh, work,\u201d Mr. Oliver said quietly to a metal-ringed harness that looked borrowed from a bondage shop.\u201cOh, work,\u201d he said to a sleek leather overcoat with an asymmetric closure.\u201cOh, work,\u201d he said to the photographer who sat on the couch, waiting to take his picture, for which he strapped on one of his new Helmut Lang bra bags, a leather brassiere with card holders sewn on the back. (It zips up, cups together, to form a globelike satchel.)If taking on as hallowed a name as Helmut Lang\u2019s has cowed Mr. Oliver, he didn\u2019t say so. \u201cI have no anxiety because it\u2019s more simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more chic. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m not used to.\u201dBy the time it hits the runway on Monday at 9 p.m., it may look less simple. \u201cYou\u2019ll gag,\u201d he said. (This is a good thing.) \u201cHopefully Andrew lets it go down the runway.\u201d\u201cI check in regularly,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cNot a lot happens that I don\u2019t know about. But these guys work independently of having to worry about what I say every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Neo-Nazis in Your Streets? Send in the (Coup Clutz) Clowns", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesIn Olympia, Wash., in 2005, a march of about a dozen brown-shirted neo-Nazis was met by protesting clowns, goose-stepping, Nazi-style. Hundreds of counterprotesters turned the occasion into a celebration of diversity and unity.Two years later in Knoxville, Tenn., residents countered a white supremacist march with a hastily assembled group calling itself the Coup Clutz Clowns. The clowns pretended not to understand the shouts of \u201cWhite power!\u201d\u201cWhite flour?\u201d the clowns cried, throwing some in the air. \u201cWhite flower? Tight shower? Wife power!\u201d For wife power, some of them put on wedding dresses.Responding to far-right demonstrators with mockery originated in Europe, where one outstanding recent example took place in the German town of Wunsiedel. Unable to dislodge annual marches with ordinary counterprotests, the town took a new tack in 2014. For every meter the neo-Nazis marched, the town donated 10 euros to an organization that helped people leave right-wing extremist groups. Residents hung silly signs along the route and threw confetti at the end, leaving the neo-Nazis responsible for raising $12,000 against their own cause.Humor has a long and honored place in American politics as well.And counterintuitive though it may seem, ridicule and mockery have long been an effective way to disarm protesters who espouse bigotry and racial supremacy. If you want to resist those who would stir up violence, using humor is more effective than staying at home when they march, and far better than rewarding their provocations with a melee in the streets.Here\u2019s what white supremacists want to do when they stage a rally:\u2022 Legitimize their views.\u2022 Strengthen their self-image as part of the downtrodden.\u2022 Unite their squabbling factions.\u2022 Attract new people to the movement.\u2022 Control media coverage.\u2022 Feel powerful and heroic.\u201cFor the far-right groups, violence is central to their way of looking at the world,\u201d said Peter Simi, associate professor of sociology at Chapman University. \u201cThe idea of having violent confrontation and conflicts fuels and energizes them. They feed off it.\u201cIt also helps perpetuate their own narrative about victimization and persecution \u2014\u2018Look, we can\u2019t even have a free speech rally without being attacked.\u2019 \u201dFor the same reasons that violence by counter-protesters helps the far right, mockery hurts. \u201cRidicule makes the far right look less attractive to the type of people they want to attract,\u201d said Cas Mudde, an associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable portion who are there for the thrill. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t believe in the broader ideology, but they really enjoy the potential violence. They want to feel dangerous and important. They don\u2019t want to feel like part of a sketch.\u201d He thinks that\u2019s true for the Antifa as well.After all, which plan is more attractive to young macho men? \u201cWe\u2019ll face a small group of masked tough guys\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ll face a large number of men, women and children wearing silly hats and big red noses\u201d?Humor and mockery are also good strategies for classic political protest \u2014 whether against politicians who enable white supremacists, or policies like tax cuts for the rich. A good joke creates a memorable, clear message, allowing the protesters to reframe the issue and attract supporters. Humor engages people on an emotional level and \u2014 if it is not meanspirited \u2014 it can open them to your message. And it can expose absurdity. A social-change strategist, John Jackson, calls it \u201cmaking the invisible visible.\u201dHere\u2019s a famous example:In 1992, Mattel released a Teen Talk Barbie. Her conversation was predictable: \u201cParty dresses are fun!\u201d \u201cDo you have a crush on anyone?\u201d But there was also this gem: \u201cMath class is tough!\u201dThis made some people mad. The American Association of University Women called on Mattel to retire that utterance, and Mattel complied \u2014 a small victory. What was really needed, however, was a national conversation on gender stereotyping. Mattel\u2019s critics on this issue wanted people to talk about the damaging messages sent to little girls by Barbie\u2019s entire conversational repertoire (not to mention her waist-to-hip ratio).\u201cEat lead, Cobra!\u201d surgically altered Barbie said. \u201cVengeance is mine!\u201d\u201cWill we ever have enough clothes?\u201d GI Joe asked.Since then, the Yes Men have staged dozens of attention-getting actions designed to make some of the world\u2019s absurdities unforgettable. \u201cPeople remember stories much better than they remember information,\u201d Bichlbaum said.Bichlbaum often impersonates a representative of corporate interest to announce good behavior \u2014 as it did with the W.T.O. The spoofed organization must then, embarrassingly, deny it.On Poland\u2019s annual day honoring the secret police (you can\u2019t make this stuff up), the Orange Alternative carried banners and posters proclaiming complete devotion: \u201cLove the People\u2019s Police!\u201d \u201cLong Life to Undercover Agents!\u201d During the annual celebration of the Russian Revolution, the group shouted Bolshevik slogans, and during a state-supported referendum in the city of Wroclaw, Orange Alternative marchers chanted \u201cVote Yes Twice!\u201d as they called for a \u201c200 percent voter turnout.\u201dThe police found themselves in a conundrum. They couldn\u2019t let the protesters continue. But by making arrests, they acknowledged that no one could possibly believe in the Communist orthodoxy \u2014 and anyone who said they did must have been joking. Most Poles already knew that, of course, but the Orange Alternative forced the state authorities to make it visible.Soon Congress will be considering proposals to drastically cut taxes for the rich and services for the poor. What\u2019s the message? \u201cNo tax cuts for the rich\u201d? \u201cProtect social services\u201d?Congress rebuffed Bush. His unpopularity and opposition from AARP and other groups were the likely reasons, not the Billionaires. But the reframing \u2014 making the invisible visible \u2014 by the Billionaires didn\u2019t hurt.It seems too basic to even say, but the rule is violated again and again: Successful political activists are strategic. They ask: \u201cWhat will reach, and motivate or convince, the people we need?\u201dVery often, the answer is: Make \u2019em laugh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Madonna. No Geena Davis. But Still in a League of Their Own.", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOUTH ELGIN, Ill. \u2014 Strike one. \u201cYou swing like a girl!\u201d the pitcher barked, heckling yet another player at the plate. Sonja Bushnick of the Rockford Peaches lifted her wooden bat again. She passed on one ball and fouled off another. On the next pitch she hit a short pop-up that the pitcher caught with ease. He laughed at her.The pitcher \u2014 wearing suspenders, a necktie and a newsboy cap \u2014 was Jody McQuarters, the husband of the Peaches right fielder and a designated ham. At the sound of gunfire from a nearby military re-enactment, he pretended he had been shot in the backside and limped around the infield.Many games, like the one here in South Elgin in June, coincide with World War II re-enactments and rely on players recruited from the crowd, including men who cross over from the military scenes. Jody McQuarters filled in as a Peaches opponent on the mound, temporarily abandoning his usual role.\u201cWe use him as our manager-owner,\u201d said his wife, Cathy McQuarters. The couple, like most everyone else connected with the Peaches, live in the Chicago area. \u201cHe dresses up in the business attire, and most of the time we use him for pitching. I didn\u2019t know he was this good at baseball until I wanted to re-enact.\u201dThe Peaches were reborn about seven years ago as part of the WWII Girls Baseball Living History League, a tribute to the league that was founded in 1943 and that was recreated on screen with Madonna in the outfield, Geena Davis behind the plate and Tom Hanks in the dugout, managing the team with a memorable emphasis on no tears.\u201cAfter I got the uniform,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m like \u2018Gosh, I\u2019d really like to play ball in this.\u2019\u201dTulloch knew of men\u2019s baseball leagues that dressed up in vintage uniforms and played by old-time rules, but she could not find any groups recreating the games played by women during the World War II era. So she made an obvious decision: She formed a league of her own.Tulloch started recruiting by word of mouth, aiming for a league composed of the four original teams: the Rockford Peaches, the South Bend Blue Sox, the Racine Belles and the Kenosha Comets. So far only the Peaches have been reconstituted; this summer, about 20 players have regularly participated.\u201cMy dream is to eventually have all four teams filled with players,\u201d Tulloch said. \u201cThen we can have a real league where teams play each other at events, and then have a championship at the end, like the original league.\u201dThe league\u2019s uniforms and equipment are, as much as possible, faithful reproductions of items from the World War II era. Players scour eBay and antique stores for vintage gloves and bats. In the dugout here, there was a bucket filled with smooth-worn pancake gloves.\u201cThey are teeny,\u201d said Jamie Mulvihill, who has played softball most of her life and, when there weren\u2019t enough girls for a team, spent a season on a boys\u2019 baseball team. \u201cThey definitely bring you back to the Little League days where you catch with two hands \u2019cause the ball will fall out and bop you if you don\u2019t.\u201dProper softballs can be hard to procure. They must be 12 inches in circumference, the biggest size produced, white and made of real leather. With the prevalence of Optic Yellow softballs today, white ones have become less popular, and they tend to be made of synthetic leather. A dozen white leather 12-inch balls cost around $80, compared with $30 for a synthetic dozen.During the game here, an infantry re-enactor hit a foul ball that flew into the nearby Fox River. It was not recovered.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that when the league started in 1943, they didn\u2019t play baseball, like in the movie \u2018A League of their Own,\u2019\u201d Tulloch said. \u201cThey were playing 12-inch underhand fast-pitch softball, the reason being because none of the women knew how to play baseball.\u201dOnly during the league\u2019s last couple of years, after the war had ended, did the women switch to baseball \u2014 partly in hopes of making the games exciting enough to attract fans of the reinvigorated major leagues.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t join another team after this. This is the best. I love 12-inch,\u201d Joy Hyzny, a player in her early 50s, said as she tossed a ball with her teammate Kathy Suyko, firing it hard enough to make a smacking sound in Suyko\u2019s antique glove. \u201cMy high school team went down to 8, and after that, there was no more 12-inch \u2014 I couldn\u2019t find it in the area. I love it. It\u2019s such a great group of women. All ages, diverse backgrounds. It\u2019s so much fun.\u201dThe players\u2019 footwear gets a pass on authenticity. Everyone wears modern black athletic shoes or cleats, but the logos must be blotted out. Jenny Hale blackened the swoosh symbol on her Nikes. She also wore retro sunglasses that were in style during the World War II years. She said she became interested in the Peaches when she spotted them at a fair.\u201cI joined them first for a September or October game, and it was on the original Peaches field,\u201d Hale said. \u201cIt was sort of surreal because I really like the movie and the whole era.\u201dHer sister, Lisa Hale, was sitting out because of a shoulder injury. Instead of dressing up as a player, she wore a white blouse and a pencil skirt to play the role of the chaperone, a character in the movie. She described her job: \u201cEscort the team on away games. Make sure they are not doing anything unsavory. No drinking, no men, no smoking. Always wear your lipstick.\u201dThe season runs from late April to early autumn, and this one included the 25th anniversary of the film. Next year the tribute league plans to honor the 75th anniversary of the original league\u2019s inception. Players from the wartime games have held several reunions, some attended by actresses from the movie, including Anne Ramsay, Kathleen Marshall and Megan Cavanagh. Current Peaches have also shown up.\u201cYou think we\u2019re having fun? They must have had a blast,\u201d said Tulloch, who has been to three reunions. \u201cFor being 80 and 90 years old, when they go to these reunions, I think it takes them back to their 20s because their eyes light up and they are 20 again. It\u2019s fantastic.\u201dAt the end of the game in South Elgin, the modern-day Peaches gathered for a team photo. There was no smartphone or fancy digital camera. Instead, in their commitment to historical accuracy, they smiled at a Kodak Brownie.Advertisement"}

Created by artists outside Hollywood, these hand-drawn beauties are not only better than most fan art, they\u2019re often better than the real thing.To be fair, most official posters today aren\u2019t made to be beautiful or even art \u2014 they\u2019re made to sell tickets. In the \u201990s, studios figured the best way to do that was to skip hand-painted posters in favor of gigantic photos of stars\u2019 heads. The creators of alternative movie posters, however, don\u2019t care about big heads or bottom lines. They\u2019re concerned, often obsessively so, with reminding us just why we love these films so much.The artists are an eclectic and talented bunch. Here are seven to watch:WashingtonMs. Ching has created gorgeous concert posters for Kings of Leon and graphics for small-batch beer cans (Brewdog Pump Action Poet). But it\u2019s her vibrant, spellbinding movie posters that have led to work at Sony (\u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d) and AMC (\u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d). \u201cShe does official stuff, but there are a lot of rules from the studios about \u2018so-and-so\u2019s face has to be so big,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chojnacki said. \u201cSo I think she\u2019ll always continue to do the alternative stuff, just for her fans.\u201d Among his favorites: her takes on the Stanley Kubrick classics \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d and \u201cThe Shining.\u201dMontrealWhen Ms. Bergeron was enlisted to create a poster for \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d she pictured a decapitated horse, neck bones exposed, rearing up on its hind legs. For \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d: a lone soldier, making his way upstream through a waist-deep river of blood. Ms. Bergeron has created album covers, video-game-inspired triptychs, and a recruiting poster for Imperial stormtroopers (\u201cSupport the Boys in White\u201d) for the Harper Design book \u201cStar Wars Propaganda.\u201d \u201cShe has a talent for painting emotions,\u201d Mr. Chojnacki said. \u201cEvery time you see one of her posters, you know it\u2019s her.\u201dTorontoSydneyTorontoAustin, Tex.Montevideo, UruguayAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Boys of Brexit: Tony Blair and Nigel Farage", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "OpinionThe veteran pols on either side of the vituperative, vertiginous Brexit debate spar.Supported byLONDON \u2014 It seems like an impossible feat. But Tony Blair has done it. He has made himself even less popular in Britain.And this, on the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana\u2019s death, when everyone should be grateful that he helped save the monarchy by forcing the royal family to put aside its distaste for Di\u2019s modern, confessional, subversive ways, climb out of its crusty shell and pay more respect to \u201cthe people\u2019s princess,\u201d as Blair ingeniously christened her.The 64-year-old Blair is more gray, but his eyes are bright blue and he looks trim in a navy suit, sans tie. The country he once worked to unite is fractured now over Brexit and he \u2014 a decade after his time as prime minister \u2014 finds himself as a key player in trying to undo what voters did last year. Nigel Farage, the Brexit ringleader, has blamed Blair, in part, for throwing open the borders to \u201crub our noses in diversity.\u201dThe two men, one working in London and one in Brussels, are not fresh faces in Britain. But they are facing off as nemeses, like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Moriarty wresting on the edge of a cliff, over where the country will go next.Recalling his intervention with the royal family, Blair said, \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to make sure that you try and keep the country together and united and, look, it was an extraordinary time because I\u2019d literally just come into office.\u201d He related those days as we sat in his Mayfair office \u2014 the same one used by John Adams when he was the ambassador here \u2014 and sipped coffee out of white porcelain cups.\u201cIf you think back to when she became queen, roughly when I was born,\u201d he said of Elizabeth, \u201cthere was still an age of deference around. We\u2019re past the age of deference. So what she understood was, the monarchy could only stay the monarchy if it could justify itself on its own terms. That process of modernization of the monarchy was very important. But you have to do it without losing that mystique and mystery.\u201dHe says he has never seen Michael Sheen\u2019s take on him in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d and he has not watched \u201cThe Crown,\u201d its twin jewel in Peter Morgan\u2019s prodigious effort to put a shine back on Queen Elizabeth after the Diana debacle.(He has seen the famous Hugh Grant dance from \u201cLove Actually,\u201d and said he did it himself, not as well, after winning the Olympics bid in 2005 and almost did it again after the Irish peace deal was struck.)Did Blair ever think he would see a time when the royal family would keep calm and carry on as the queen\u2019s grandson moved toward marrying an American TV actress who is divorced and half black?\u201cYeah, I mean, it\u2019s great,\u201d he said.And for Blair, all deference disappeared when the British had their suspicions confirmed that the selling of the Iraq invasion was based on sexed-up evidence, and that their prime minister\u2019s role as W.\u2019s enabler and simultaneous translator had helped pave the path to endless war and ISIS.Blair has plunged back into the fray as a leading advocate for overturning Brexit. His office \u2014 along with David Geffen\u2019s yacht, to which Blair is no stranger \u2014 is ground zero for the global elite. Although he bristled at that term. \u201cOn this elite thing, the progressives are just going to stand up for themselves and push back against\u201d that hooey, he said, using a stronger word. \u201cThe idea that the handful of right-wing media proprietors here are some ordinary Joes from the street, I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous. There are elites on both sides.\u201dWhile we\u2019re on the subject of right-wing media proprietors, I broached the subject of his former benefactor and buddy Rupert Murdoch, who cut him off when he came to believe that Blair had been involved with his then-wife, Wendi. (Blair denies it.) Will they ever be friends again?\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll comment on that one,\u201d Blair said with a tight smile.I asked if his quixotic push against Brexit was an expiation for his push for the Iraq war \u2014 even though he maintains that, as he looks at Syria, he still feels it was right to go into Iraq.\u201cNo is the answer to that,\u201d he replied.I\u2019ve always thought Blair was one of a handful of people who could have stopped the Iraq war, and I was fierce in my criticisms of him.In London, though, I stopped short of doing what some here, including a bartender at a hip London restaurant where Blair was dining, have done: a citizen\u2019s arrest for crimes against peace. (A website called arrestblair.org \u2014 with a current pot of over 10,000 pounds \u2014 offers a reward for Blair\u2019s capture, or attempted capture.)Even though he stiffened, I asked why he helped W. switch 9/11 villains from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein.\u201cWhat I would say is that our anxiety, particularly straight after 9/11, was that you would end up in a situation where these unstable dictatorships, you know, which combined with terrorism to cause mass destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned about this issue is that there\u2019s no point in me trying to relitigate it with people.\u201dI asked about speculation that he had bonded with W. over their strong Christian faith. \u201cNot really,\u201d he replied.He\u2019s Teflon Tony no more. I wondered if he thought he could ever get beyond it, the way W. has become more popular in contrast to President Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t know is the truthful answer,\u201d he said.Some Britains even blame Blair for Brexit, arguing that the emotional release he encouraged in the stiff-upper-lip country after Diana\u2019s death uncorked a reservoir of decidedly un-British visceral feeling.\u201cDrawing a line from Princess Diana to Brexit is a bit of a stretch, I would say,\u201d he said curtly.Blair\u2019s office is decorated with paintings and a map of the Middle East, where he served as special envoy for the \u201cquartet\u201d of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U. and Russia. W.\u2019s book of paintings sits on a shelf.Blair knows Jared Kushner \u2014 he has not met Trump \u2014 so I asked what he thought of the son-in-law\u2019s epic task of making Middle East peace.\u201cThe fact that someone\u2019s not got a long institutional experience of these issues isn\u2019t necessarily a disadvantage,\u201d Blair said.Certainly, the Iraq war proved that a consortium combining decades of experience is no guarantee of wisdom.The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change may sound like a front for the restoration of the global elite. But Blair said he has struggled to understand the forces that led to Brexit and Donald Trump: \u201cMaking sense of it is very hard. I feel like a student of politics again.\u201d Odd, he added, since \u201cI spent most of my political life in a state of reasonable certainty.\u201dHe said he still talks to his old Third Way pal, Bill Clinton. \u201cSpending time in his company is well spent because he\u2019s got an amazing political mind,\u201d Blair said. And he\u2019s still in touch with W.The central question, he said, is whether politicians can change the status quo enough to steer people through this period when they feel they\u2019ve lost control.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can adopt a politics that essentially says that those grievances are unjustified or irrelevant,\u201d he explained, \u201cor say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to focus on something else because that\u2019s really more important than your grievance.\u2019\u201dHe could have been describing What Happened with Hillary\u2019s campaign, when she and President Barack Obama sniffed at the rise of Trump and Bernie Sanders.The anger that buoyed Trump, he said, \u201cis not unjustified. You can\u2019t sit there and essentially blame the people.\u201dThat approach can lead to the rise of strongmen, or what he called \u201cthe Putinist model.\u201d \u201cThe strongman form of government says, \u2018I\u2019m just going to bust through the systems not delivering for you and I\u2019m going to deliver,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got an appeal.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI think the threat to what I would call traditional democracy is bigger than we think.\u201dThe weekend I talked to him, he told me he was publishing a report on how to deal with the immigration issue, which he said \u201cagonized\u201d progressives because they \u201chate the tinges of racism and sometimes the overt racism that comes with anti-immigrant feeling.\u201dHis report represented a radical pivot. He now believes that Brexit can never be undone \u201cunless we have an immigration policy that makes sense of the fact that people do worry about pressure on services and wages that can come from large accumulations of migrant labor and frankly, anxieties people have about whether there\u2019s a cultural divide from migrants, particularly if they come from a majority of Muslim countries.\u201cI think the only way of changing the Brexit situation is to say, \u2018We\u2019ve listened, we\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re going to act on these problems, but we\u2019re going to act in a way that is sensible, that is consistent with our values.\u2019\u201dHis U-turn showed up as a banner headline in The Sunday Times: \u201cTony Blair Gets Tough on Migrants 13 Years After Opening Doors.\u201d The paper outlined Blair\u2019s \u201cexplosive\u201d backtrack: Calling on Theresa May\u2019s government to force European Union migrants coming to Britain to register or face being barred from renting a home, opening a bank account or claiming benefits; recommending curbing unemployed migrants\u2019 access to free health care and permitting businesses and universities to discriminate in favor of British citizens.Upon hearing the news, British tabloids, not to mention Cockney taxi drivers, went nuts.\u201cMigrant U-Turn Fury,\u201d shrieked The Sun. \u201cBlair Bitch Project.\u201d\u201cButt Out Blair \u2014 You Ruined This Country,\u201d blared The Daily Star\u2019s headline.The Daily Express lead editorial, headlined \u201cTony Blair Is the Reason That We Are Leaving the EU,\u201d huffed about the jaw-dropping shift: \u201cIf he had a shred of decency or integrity we would never hear from him on this subject again.\u201d It reminded readers that Blair\u2019s consigliere, Lord Peter Mandelson, said in 2013 that the Labour Party had \u201csent out search parties for immigrants\u201d in what the paper called \u201ca cynical move\u201d to expand its voting base and be in a position to label Tories racist if they objected.Farage called Blair\u2019s new stance \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d When I mentioned to Blair that Farage is surrounded at the E.U., where he is a member of Parliament, by people who loathe him, the former prime minister shot back, \u201cHe rejoices in that fact.\u201dI flew to Brussels to track down Farage, who managed to turn Britain upside down after 20 years of not being taken seriously.Although he thinks Blair was once a \u201cgenius\u201d politician, Farage said, \u201cThe thing about Blair is that, in terms of British public opinion, he\u2019s a busted flush.\u201d He added that May is \u201ca very, very cold fish.\u201dThe 53-year-old hell-raiser was in his office in a modern Parliament building, the skunk at the garden party. All day long, E.U. members try to hammer out the terms of the blistering divorce with Britain. And here is the renegade who led the lemmings off the cliff, holed up, wearing a natty dark suit, wreathed in Camel smoke despite the no-smoking rules, sipping Welsh whisky and trashing his colleagues.He told Herman Van Rompuy, who was then president of the E.U., in front of the whole European Parliament that he had \u201call the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.\u201dNext to his desk Farage has installed a black coffin emblazoned with a golden emblem of the euro. \u201cI bought it on eBay for 180 euros,\u201d he said gleefully, \u201cwhich for a properly made coffin didn\u2019t seem bad.\u201d He has in a frame the infamous picture of him and Trump in front of a gold elevator at Trump Tower, gloating, thumbs up, the week of Trump\u2019s upset victory.Farage loves Trump. He admits that padding around the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington with a large glass of red wine is one of his favorite nocturnal activities.When Trump tweeted in November that Farage should be named ambassador to the U.S., it caused an uproar at 10 Downing Street.Farage mused that it would have been interesting to do something constructive, rather than stay on his usual destructive path, but the former banker said that those in the British establishment \u201clook upon me as a member of the lower orders.\u201dAlthough The Guardian reported that Farage had been named \u201ca person of interest\u201d in the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation, Farage shrugged it off, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got no Russian connections.\u201dDespite his stunning success with Brexit, Farage is now a man without a party. He resigned as leader of UKIP, which has basically sputtered out.\u201cWhat are political parties for?\u201d he said, philosophically. \u201cAre they there for their own sake? If you\u2019re in politics because you want to be something, then parties are essential. If you\u2019re in politics because you want to do something, parties are vehicles.\u201dHis friend Trump, he said, took over his party. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete hijack and I love it,\u201d he laughed, hoarsely. He called Trump the \u201cextreme alpha male, the silverback gorilla.\u201dBut even those who like Trump, he said, wonder \u201cwhy he\u2019s picking a battle on so many fronts simultaneously\u201d \u2014 especially with his own party. You know you\u2019re in trouble when Nigel Farage thinks you\u2019re picking too many battles.Reviled by many at home in London and at work in Brussels, Farage is spending the autumn giving speeches all over Europe.He recently got a standing ovation at a rally for a far-right, anti-immigration party in Berlin, where he said Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to maintain open borders during the refugee crisis was the \u201cworst decision by any leader in modern political history.\u201d He was invited by his fellow Parliament member Beatrix von Storch, a leading member of the far-right Alternative for Germany Party and a granddaughter of Hitler\u2019s finance minister.\u201cThe hard left has made my life a complete misery over the last four or five years,\u201d Farage said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to live with 24/7 security. I\u2019ve had threats, physical assaults against me, my family. And this is all from people who are in organizations that profess themselves to be about love and hope and optimism, all right?\u201dFarage, who once dismissed France under the stewardship of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as \u201ca pipsqueak,\u201d said that with Emmanuel Macron, France would become even more of a pipsqueak. He loved Melania\u2019s hurricane stilettos, is excited about Kate Middleton\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely bloomin\u2019 marvelous!\u201d \u2014 and thinks that Prince Harry should not marry Meghan Markle. \u201cI don\u2019t think Harry\u2019s ready to marry anyone yet,\u201d he said.He called Gary Cohn wrong to have publicly chastised Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville and denied that Javanka\u2019s presence in the Oval was a detriment to the president, saying \u201che needs family around him.\u201dNot only can the sun set on the British Empire. It can set on Nigel Farage. At dusk, we walked across the street to a favorite haunt, the Beer Factory, where he had a red wine.He waved his hand at the crowded square, shrugging off the very idea of Brussels. \u201cBelgium\u2019s not a nation,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cBrit-bashing here in Brussels is about to become a registered E.U. sport, as every single one of them lines up to say we are wrong, we are deluded, we are stupid, we made a deplorable decision and they won\u2019t budge a millimeter in the negotiations and that we\u2019re going to be taught a jolly good lesson.\u201dFarage is the proverbial cat on a hot tin roof. The victory is just staying on it, I guess, as long as he can.Advertisement"}
