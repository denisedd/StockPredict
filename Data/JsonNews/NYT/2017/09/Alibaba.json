In recent months, the president has turned more critical of Beijing, accusing it of failing to do more to restrain the nuclear ambitions of North Korea.Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who studies Chinese investment, said that the administration\u2019s decision over Lattice was intended to send a political message. \u201cWe could let it die quietly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to kill it loudly.\u201dThe White House said on Wednesday that it prevented the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor, in part because the United States government relies on the company\u2019s products. The integrity of the semiconductor industry, it said, was vital.The White House also raised concerns over the buyer\u2019s close ties to Beijing. The investment group included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by state-backed entities, the White House said.The decision could foretell trouble for other Chinese deals under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency group that examines takeovers of American companies by foreign buyers and makes recommendations to the president. The group, which operates largely in secrecy, is also looking at the proposed purchase of MoneyGram International by Ant Financial, an affiliate of the Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group.China on Thursday objected to the decision. Gao Feng, a spokesman for China\u2019s commerce ministry, said that countries should not use security reviews as a way to push protectionism.Mr. Trump has sought to take a tough line on China\u2019s trade and investment practices, threatening on the campaign trail to enact sweeping tariffs. Although his moves in office have so far been more modest, he has stoked tensions between the two countries.In August, the White House began an investigation into claims of Chinese violations of American intellectual property, an inquiry that could result in tariffs or another negotiated outcome. Mr. Trump also called for a report on the steel industry, where China is dominant.By blocking the deal for Lattice Semiconductor, the president is taking direct aim at China\u2019s industrial policy.The deal for Lattice Semiconductor played to those ambitions.The company announced an agreement last November to sell itself to a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, for $1.3 billion. The initial funding for the firm, based in Palo Alto, Calif., came from China.Cfius raised warning flags about the deal. Although the review process takes place behind closed doors, Lattice disclosed on Sept. 1 that the committee planned to recommend that the president to block the deal.Lattice instead tried to appeal to the president. In a filing, the company said it would offer measures to resolve any outstanding national security concerns.The administration was not convinced. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the chairman of the review committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that its recommendation on the deal was \u201cconsistent with the administration\u2019s commitment to take all actions necessary to protect national security.\u201d\u201cCfius and the president assess that the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that cannot be resolved through mitigation,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Reformist Central Banker Could Be a Tough Act to Follow", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUHAN, China \u2014 Throughout much of China\u2019s economic rise over the past three decades, one Chinese official quietly played a pivotal role in pushing an embrace of free markets.That official, an urbane central bank official named Zhou Xiaochuan, is widely expected to retire soon. His replacement may be unwilling or unable to follow in his footsteps, leaving uncertain whether China will tackle problems that could threaten its growth.Today, that effort appears to be ebbing.Now 69, Mr. Zhou is well past the usual mandatory retirement age for someone of his ministerial rank.One potential successor is Jiang Chaoliang, the leader of Hubei Province in central China. Mr. Jiang is a skillful bureaucrat within the Communist Party and has academic training as an economist, but he climbed China\u2019s political ladder while steering clear of the party\u2019s market reformers and skipping economic conferences with free-market themes. In a speech earlier this year, Mr. Jiang called for \u201cspreading Marxist scientific theory with self-confidence, and persistently using Xi\u2019s speeches to arm students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 minds.\u201dMr. Jiang quietly made a few market-oriented changes during the four years that he ran the Bank of Communications, one of the larger state-run banks, where he led an initial public offering of shares on the Hong Kong stock market. But some advocates of a more market-based financial system have been discouraged by Mr. Jiang\u2019s emergence as a leading candidate.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a passion for financial reform, you can\u2019t make that happen, and I don\u2019t think Jiang Chaoliang has that passion,\u201d said Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, based in Shanghai.Should Mr. Jiang get the nod, it would signal a shift away from Mr. Zhou, an English-speaking familiar face for many foreign leaders. By contrast, Mr. Jiang is perceived overseas as a bit of a mystery.Officials did not respond to requests to interview Mr. Jiang. The People\u2019s Bank of China declined to comment.Residents in Wuhan, Hubei\u2019s capital, said that they were not especially aware of Mr. Jiang, who unlike some provincial leaders has not pursued a propaganda campaign to burnish his personal image. Recent appearances in the state-controlled news media included meetings with leading tycoons including Jack Ma of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.Experts say he appears to enjoy a strong relationship with Mr. Xi.\u201cJiang seems to be very tight with Xi Jinping,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a Chinese politics specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThe international community doesn\u2019t know him very well, but Xi Jinping doesn\u2019t seem to worry about that.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces a New World as Officials Rein In a Wild Web", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a muggy, late spring evening, Tuan Pham awoke to the police storming his house in Hanoi, Vietnam.They marched him to a police station and made their demand: Hand over your Facebook password. Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called \u201cMother\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d which criticized how the communist country was run.One line read, \u201cOne century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?\u201dThe diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cGovernments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.\u201dFacebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet\u2019s fragmentation \u2014 and increasingly, its consequences.The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people \u2014 about a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Google Gets Serious About Producing Better Phones", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle once owned a phone maker. It didn\u2019t work out. Now it\u2019s trying a different approach.Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.A beefier hardware team should also help Google bring much more of the design in-house. It should also help it realize some of its bigger smartphone hardware ambitions, which include things like making its own SoCs and building machine learning coprocessors.FlashbackGoogle was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later.The decision to buy Motorola was \u201cthe extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that\u2019s not a fixer-upper.\u201dStandard & Poor\u2019s move, which cut China\u2019s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999.

It is believed the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk.The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.\u201cSo, as you may have read, I was fired by the president of the United States.\u201dThe HighlightAt the start of the podcast, Mr. Bharara recounted his interactions with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to his dismissal as a United States attorney.

This is urgent, and we only have a few months to act.DealBook ExtraTPG\u2019s co-chief executives, Jim Coulter and Jon Winkelried, were among the co-signers of Wednesday\u2019s letter. But their firm is doing something else as well.The investment firm said that it would essentially cover portfolio companies\u2019 expenses in helping so-called Dreamer employees renew their DACA status before the Trump administration\u2019s Oct. 5 deadline. (The initiative is specifically for DACA recipients whose legal status expires on or before March 5.)The ContextProcter & Gamble is locked in a fight with Trian Partners\u2019s Nelson Peltz, who wants a seat on the board of the consumer product giant.\u2022 The company is building its own software to find unused internet fiber, and has rewired much of that infrastructure itself.\u2022 Pilot says its service is now used by more than 50,000 users at 1,000 customers.\u2022 It now operates in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington and Boston.\u2022 Its 23-year-old founder, Joseph Fasone, was previously at WeWork.The telecommunications industry is undergoing consolidation, and a company like Pilot would seem to be a candidate for acquisition. But Seth Levine of Foundry Group told DealBook of the start-up: \u201cIt can truly build a public-scale business.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the total amount of financing raised by Pilot, the Internet service start-up. The company has raised $32.3 million, not $35 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s the U.N.\u2019s Week, but Executives Make It a High-Minded Mingle", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat do you get when you combine more than 100 heads of state, a few hundred chief executives and several thousand hangers-on in Midtown Manhattan?Besides a traffic jam, it is the United Nations General Assembly week in New York, also known as #UNGA.Or it\u2019s the Concordia Summit.\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to call this week anymore,\u201d said Valerie Keller, head of the Beacon Institute, a division of EY, the accounting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s everything.\u201dWhat began as a bureaucratic gathering of diplomats at the United Nations has in recent years morphed into a business and political free-for-all, a champagne-soaked workweek of panel discussions, private dinners and high-minded pronouncements of important initiatives. Among the many business leaders making appearances are Tim Cook of Apple, Bill and Melinda Gates, and Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of Alibaba.For those who fancy themselves important actors on the world stage, the gravitational pull to New York City this week is strong, and each year, more new events are added to an already overstuffed schedule, providing more excuses to show up, and adding a few more black S.U.V.s to the crowded streets.Sipping cocktails and nibbling canap\u00e9s on a terrace overlooking the MoMA sculpture garden, the 150 or so guests were entertained by the musician Butterscotch, a \u201cretro-futuristic, voice percussionist virtuosa,\u201d as her website says.Among those in attendance were Dara Khosrowshahi, the new chief executive of Uber; Richard Branson of the Virgin Group; and Arianna Huffington. The goal, the invitation proclaimed, was \u201cto help galvanize a movement of businesses with purpose at their heart.\u201dBut what does that mean? What comes of so much shoulder-rubbing?\u201cI ask myself that,\u201d Ms. Keller said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? Are we just throwing a purpose party?\u201dPerhaps. But Ms. Keller argued that there was intrinsic merit simply in bringing together like-minded people who aspire to make capitalism a bit more equitable.\u201cActually, there is real value in all these individual points of light coming together and saying there is a collective vision for a world that works for everyone and an economic system that works for all, including our planet,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you collide enough of the people that care about these issues, they start remembering that this is real and it\u2019s happening.\u201dMs. Keller and the B-Team steered clear of making any tangible promises on Monday, but others were more than happy to use the collective attention of the global press corps to announce grand new projects.The Bloomberg event on Wednesday, hosted at the opulent Plaza Hotel, drew some of the biggest names in town, including the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau; Mr. Ma of Alibaba; the PepsiCo chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi; and Mr. Clinton himself, who delivered the opening remarks. Travis Kalanick, the recently departed chief executive of Uber, roamed the halls.\u201cThe Clinton Global Initiative caused business to think about New York this week as a destination,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation. \u201cThe end of CGI left a void, and this is filling that.\u201dMr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that if he were a head of state, \u201cI\u2019d want every smart person coming into my country.\u201d\u201cSmart people create jobs,\u201d he said onstage, in an allusion to immigration policy. \u201cI\u2019d have a very aggressive plan not to just let a few people in. I would be recruiting.\u201dAjay Banga, the chief executive of Mastercard, said he was using the day to speak with peers about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a set of targets meant to improve quality of living for people around the world.\u201cThey\u2019ve convened good conversations with people who are deeply committed to the SDGs,\u201d Mr. Banga said in an interview on the sidelines of the event. \u201cThe SDGs really matter. More people should be thinking about them.\u201dNot all the dialogue was so serious, however.During an afternoon session, David Rubenstein, the billionaire founder of the private equity firm Carlyle Group, asked Mr. Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, if his financial support for medical advances meant people would live longer.\u201cI\u2019m not working on that problem,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cThere are other Silicon Valley billionaires who want to live forever.\u201d\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t whether we can solve poverty or climate change or income inequality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether or not we can work together. The willingness to just get together and talk \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201dBut Mr. Ulukaya had to run. On Thursday, his charity for refugees, the Tent Foundation, was hosting an event announcing new partnerships and featuring the Unilever chief executive, Paul Polman, and Airbnb\u2019s co-founder, Joe Gebbia. There were last-minute preparations to attend to.After that, of course, was a private dinner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Wisconsin, Foxconn Vowed Big Spending in Brazil. Few Jobs Have Come.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a news conference in Brazil, Foxconn officials unveiled plans to invest billions of dollars and build one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing hubs in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The government had high expectations that the project would yield 100,000 jobs.Six years later, Brazil is still waiting for most of those jobs to materialize.\u201cThe area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,\u201d said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even expressed an interest in meeting us.\u201dFoxconn\u2019s experience in Brazil and other parts of the world illustrates how difficult it has been for it to replicate its enormously successful Chinese manufacturing model elsewhere.But the model does not translate easily to other countries, where Foxconn must navigate different social, political and labor conditions.In Brazil, Foxconn\u2019s plans unraveled quickly. The administration that had wooed the company was soon swept from power amid corruption allegations and an impeachment vote. Some of the tax breaks that had been promised were reduced or abandoned, as economic growth and consumer spending slumped.Today, Foxconn employs only about 2,800 workers in Brazil.Foxconn does the \u201cbig song and dance, bringing out the Chinese dragon dancers, ribbon cuttings, toasts and signature of the usual boilerplate agreements,\u201d said Alberto Moel, an investor and adviser to early-stage tech companies who until recently was a technology analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThen, when it gets down to brass tacks, something way smaller materializes.\u201dFoxconn said in a statement that it was committed to investing billions of dollars in building facilities outside China. But the company also said it had been forced to adapt to changing conditions in markets like Brazil, where the economy had stagnated.\u201cThis and the changing needs of our customers that our proposed investments were designed to serve have resulted in scaled down operations in the country at this time,\u201d the company said in its statement.With regard to the Wisconsin project, Foxconn has said it plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturing campuses in the southeastern part of the state. The company expects the buildings that will make up the campus to total 20 million square feet \u2014 about three times the size of the Pentagon \u2014 and to help transform the region into a major production center for flat-panel display screens.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, called the Foxconn deal a \u201cgame changer\u201d that could help spur a manufacturing revival in the Midwest. At the White House in July, President Trump hailed the agreement as a great one for American manufacturing, American workers and \u201ceverybody who believes in the concept, in the label, Made in the U.S.A.\u201d Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin officially approved the deal on Monday.Foxconn has good reason to diversify its manufacturing operations. About 95 percent of the company\u2019s 1.1 million employees work in China. Building a large work force elsewhere could reduce the company\u2019s reliance on a single locale, lowering its risk if countries imposed tariffs or other trade barriers on Chinese exports.But exporting Foxconn\u2019s Chinese strategy is virtually impossible.The global supply chain for electronics remains firmly rooted in Asia, where advantages like low-cost labor and an abundance of skilled engineers have been crucial to the region\u2019s development as a manufacturing base.What makes Foxconn\u2019s Chinese operations really hum are the extraordinary level of government subsidies and support, and the sheer scale of those operations. Local governments often finance and build the company\u2019s factories, manage its dormitories and recruit tens of thousands of workers. Some government officials have gone door to door in small counties to recruit workers.The government aid can reach into the billions of dollars.Foxconn began to shift large-scale production operations beyond China in about 2009, when it opened plants elsewhere in Asia, including Vietnam and India. The company now has factories in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, and a large plant in Mexico that employs 18,000 workers.When several countries began to require that some components be made locally as a way of encouraging production at home, Foxconn stepped up its efforts to build outside China. And company executives essentially followed the same playbook they had used inside China.Foxconn\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, met with high-ranking leaders, including Brazil\u2019s president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Mr. Gou made pledges; won tax breaks and government concessions; and announced plans to spend billions of dollars to create tens of thousands of jobs in multiple countries. Brazil called one of the planned Foxconn sites the \u201cCity of the Future.\u201dThen reality set in.Labor strikes in India and Vietnam prompted Foxconn\u2019s operations in those countries to be shut down temporarily. Political and economic turmoil in Brazil led the authorities there to scale back some of tax breaks it had offered the company. A plan to invest $1 billion in the construction of a plant in Jakarta, Indonesia, collapsed, partly because Foxconn could not develop the supply chain it had hoped to, according to analysts and government officials.Foxconn\u2019s plans also fizzled in Pennsylvania. In 2013, the company, which has a small office in Harrisburg, said it intended to build a $30 million factory in the state that could employ 500 workers. The plant has yet to be built.Pennsylvania officials declined to comment on why the factory had not been built, but said that they had not given up hope. (Foxconn also did not comment.)\u201cWe do not believe Pennsylvania is out of the running for any particular project,\u201d David Smith, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development in Harrisburg, said about Foxconn\u2019s commitment in the state.For Foxconn, the move to Wisconsin offers political benefits.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump skewered China over what he deemed its unfair trade practices. He vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States and said his administration might impose a border tax on imports, raising the prospect of a trade war.After the election, Foxconn joined a parade of global companies bearing promises.Jack Ma, the executive chairman of the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, arrived at Trump Tower in New York and pledged to create one million jobs in America. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank of Japan, said his company would invest $50 billion in the United States. And at around the same time, Foxconn said it was planning to build production facilities in the United States.Wisconsin lawmakers pushed it through nonetheless, and when Mr. Walker approved the deal on Monday, he called it \u201ca truly transformational step for our state.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Brazil, and Joe Cochrane from Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Clintons Step Back From Global Stage, Bloomberg Steps Up", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut after Bill and Hillary Clinton announced the end of their signature conference during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and billionaire, has stepped unto the breach.On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will host a reorganized and rebranded Bloomberg Global Business Forum at the Plaza Hotel, drawing a high-powered crowd and speakers from Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, to President Emmanuel Macron of France.In a symbolic passing of the guard, Mr. Clinton will be the first speaker on the day\u2019s agenda almost exactly a year after he urged attendees \u201cyou have to keep this alive\u201d in a farewell address at the last Clinton Global Initiative.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just happen to be the first speaker,\u201d said Kevin Sheekey, one of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s top advisers and a key organizer of the event. \u201cThere is a bit of a handoff.\u201dA generational baton-passing this is not. Mr. Clinton is 71. Mr. Bloomberg is 75. But the event will still represent a marked shift. The festivities around the Clinton Global Initiative, which ran from 2005 through 2016, were fueled by the star power of one past president and a potential future one. The Clintons raised millions to underwrite the event, sometimes stirring accusations of pay-to-play along the way. Mr. Bloomberg is paying for the forum himself through his philanthropy.There will still be some star power \u2014 the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James has recorded a video introducing the event \u2014 but it is expected to have a different feel. The 2017 version is slimmed down from a three-day affair to a day of speakers, panelists and meetings.Under the Clintons, billions of dollars were pledged year after year by attendees for charitable commitments worldwide, from AIDS relief to global poverty. That is not a part of the initial Bloomberg forum.\u201cBill Clinton and his team figured out something fundamental,\u201d Mr. Sheekey said. That the United Nations annual meeting \u2014 a week when the leaders of 193 countries all descend on Manhattan \u2014 is \u201cthe time and place in which more powerful people get together than any place in the world.\u201dEven though Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency is expected to be a dominant topic at the Bloomberg forum, only one administration official is participating in a panel: Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce.\u201cThere is a close working relationship that he and the former president have had,\u201d Mr. Sheekey said of Mr. Bloomberg, \u201cand he is very respectful of what the former president was able to do.\u201dMr. Sheekey first reached out to Doug Band, a Clinton adviser who helped start the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005, about a year ago to discuss the possibility of hosting the event after the Clintons announced 2016 would be their last.Angel Urena, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the former president\u2019s \u201chope when he started the Clinton Global Initiative is that it would show by example that partnership and innovation can make a measurable difference \u2014 and he is glad to see those ideas being carried forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
