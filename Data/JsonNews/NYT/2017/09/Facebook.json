{"Headline": "Trump Seriously Considering Ending DACA, With 6-Month Delay", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is strongly considering a plan that would end the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, but only after giving Congress six months to come up with a potential replacement for the popular initiative, according to three administration officials briefed on the discussions.Officials working on the plan stressed that Mr. Trump could still change his mind, and some key details had not yet been resolved. Among them: whether beneficiaries of the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would be allowed to renew their protected status during the six-month period.The compromise, which could lead to legislation superseding President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order, is intended to address a growing chorus of Republican lawmakers, led by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who have implored the White House to keep some form of the program.The temporary solution has been the subject of quiet negotiations between Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative staff and members of Mr. Ryan\u2019s staff, according to an administration official familiar with the talks.But administration aides concede that Congress may be unable to agree on a legislative fix, given the headwinds that previous legislation has run into for years. It is unclear exactly what would happen after six months if Congress does not act.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, had no response to questions about the negotiations, other than to say Mr. Trump still intended to make some kind of announcement after Labor Day.One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that Mr. Trump was sympathetic to the plight of the young immigrants, known as Dreamers \u2014 many have known life only in the United States and have few connections to the countries of their birth \u2014 but had been told by Justice Department lawyers that his predecessor\u2019s program would not survive a court challenge.Last week, John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, told associates that he did not see how the State of Texas, which has led the charge against the DACA policy, could proceed with a lawsuit while parts of the state are still underwater from Hurricane Harvey.Democrats and corporate leaders, as well as Republicans, have urged Mr. Trump to preserve the program, and public opinion polls have found overwhelming support for allowing the young immigrants to stay and work in the United States.But Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his former aide, Stephen Miller, who is now the president\u2019s top national policy adviser, have been pushing Mr. Trump to end the program. Both are immigration hard-liners who see ending DACA as a core campaign promise that the president must adhere to.The president has sent wildly divergent signals about the DACA program, publicly agonizing over the fate of the initiative for months. He has vowed to prevent deportations of minors in college while promising to crack down on all forms of immigration. Most of those in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House, including his own family, support lenience toward immigrants in the program.The president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who are both advisers to the president, back extending the DACA protections.The policy change would affect about 800,000 undocumented immigrants currently shielded under the DACA program, potentially rescinding their legal status and subjecting them to deportation.Immigration advocacy groups have said that ending the program would be a coldhearted step that would yield no benefit to the nation while endangering large numbers of young people raised in the United States who are seeking to work and pay taxes.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what anybody thinks we gain by taking away people\u2019s ability to work and subject them to deportation,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who helped create the program as the chief domestic policy adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cThe positive benefits of DACA are so abundantly clear.\u201dSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, told Republicans in a Twitter message that \u201cyour moment has come\u201d to preserve the program. \u201cEvery Democrat will join you,\u201d he said. \u201cShow the courage and grace to save these children, and our nation.\u201dEven as his supporters who favor curtailing illegal immigration have sought to hold him accountable to his campaign promise, Mr. Trump has publicly expressed reservations about ending DACA.In an April interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump said that those protected under the program should \u201crest easy\u201d about their status. He insisted that his administration was \u201cnot after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is our policy.\u201dBut Mr. Sessions has sought to enforce immigration laws as they exist now, and has balked at Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions in internal debates, administration officials said.Any move to end the DACA program will not improve Mr. Trump\u2019s already testy relations with Silicon Valley tech companies.On Thursday, a group of top tech chiefs \u2014 including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook \u2014 signed an open letter to the president and congressional leaders urging them to preserve the program.Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blaufr\u00e4nkisch From Austria: The Rewards of Exploration", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolA lot of people who love wine and are curious enough about it to participate in our Wine School enterprise have never heard of blaufr\u00e4nkisch.Not much, I had to admit. But with ready access to the proper reference books, I was able to reply authoritatively that grasevina, also known as welschriesling, is the most widely planted white grape in Croatia. My son described the wine as \u201cordinary, but in a nice way,\u201d which made sense to me as a good description of a modest but tasty bottle.A willingness to explore wines is fundamental to improving the quality of the ones you drink, finding good values and developing confidence in your taste. So much pleasure in wine exists on what seem to be its margins \u2013 \u201cout on the fringe,\u201d as an impatient reader once put it \u2014 where the names and places can be unfamiliar but also offer great potential.Why bother with the fringe? Historic wines, like Burgundy and Bordeaux, are often too expensive for most people nowadays. So are many good wines made with the famous grapes of these regions (pinot noir, chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon), especially those that are carefully farmed and conscientiously produced.It\u2019s easy to find cheap pinot noirs, chardonnays and cabernets in any supermarket. These wines often achieve their low pricing by using grapes grown in the wrong places, where it is easy to farm cheaply and cynically. They are then produced like soft drinks, processed to meet predetermined flavor specifications.Some people like these wines, which are often fruity and sometimes sweet, and always, like all wines, deliver a buzz. But if you love wine for its potential to express the characteristics of a place and a culture, these cheap commodities have nothing to offer.Enter blaufr\u00e4nkisch, a grape that is little known outside its home territories of Austria, Hungary (where it\u2019s known as kekfrankos) and Germany, where it\u2019s often called lemberger. Here at Wine School, we live for wines like Austrian blaufr\u00e4nkisch, wines of beauty and place that, for myriad reasons, are not well known or highly valued, and therefore are relatively inexpensive.It hasn\u2019t been this way for long. When I first began tasting blaufr\u00e4nkisches, wines made in the 1990s and early part of the 21st century, many were stolid and blockish, aiming for the density, power and oakiness that were then in vogue. It was not the best face for blaufr\u00e4nkisch, and once producers like Moric began to demonstrate the innate beauty of blaufr\u00e4nkisch made with elegance in mind, the evolution was swift.In drinking these wines I sensed a joyousness, particularly in the Nittnaus. Its aromas of fresh, spicy, purple fruits seemed so inviting. On the palate was a chalky mineral flavor, a touch of citrus and a sensation of spicy, bright warmth unrelated to alcoholic heat with a delicious bitterness that seemed to give the wine shape and hold it all together.Best of an excellent group, I thought, was the Moric. While the others exhibited a sort of friendly flamboyance, the Moric was precise, controlled and linear. Maybe it was not as engaging at first, but its freshness, subtlety, salinity and complexity made each sip a delicious adventure that kept calling for more.I should point out that each of these wines is an entry-level bottle, satisfying in its own right but also offering just a taste of the possibilities. Each of these producers also offers more expressive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 blaufr\u00e4nkisches, made from older vines or single vineyards. These wines are deeper, more complex and can age and evolve.\u201cThis is the kind of wine one hopes to discover,\u201d he said.\u201cCan we keep this our little secret?\u201d he asked.So why on earth aren\u2019t these wines better known?Partly it is history. Americans have had decades, if not centuries, to learn the names of French grapes. Blaufr\u00e4nkisch may need a little more time, and perhaps it needs the support of restaurants and sommeliers, who in the first decade of the 21st century helped transform the Austrian white grape gr\u00fcner veltliner from a complete unknown into a wine list staple.Naysayers often charge that critics and sommeliers explore the wine fringes in an arrogant, self-aggrandizing desire to show off something new and different. Not at all. Exploration is not a rejection of what\u2019s already known and loved. In the absence of a fortune to spend on benchmark wines, it is a means of pursuing pleasure and great value.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bannon Will Address Berkeley, a Hotbed of Conflict Over Free Speech", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe University of California, Berkeley, has erupted this year in response to planned speeches by conservative flamethrowers like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter. On Tuesday, another figure was added to the mix: Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing media executive and former chief strategist to President Trump.Bryce Kasamoto, The Berkeley Patriot\u2019s spokesman, confirmed in a Facebook message on Tuesday evening that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Yiannopoulos would appear at the event, which runs from Sept. 24-27. He indicated that there would be additional speakers but said that he could not name them yet because his group was \u201cstill working with the university and law enforcement to finalize our itinerary.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a valuable opportunity to have such a high-profile figure, who rarely speaks in public, come to our university,\u201d Mr. Kasamoto, a senior at Berkeley, said of Mr. Bannon in an interview on Wednesday. He added that he and his fellow organizers \u2014 Mike Wright, also a senior, and Pranav Jandhyala, a sophomore \u2014 had invited both conservatives and liberals to speak.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t agree with him politically,\u201d he said, Mr. Bannon \u201cwas one of the most influential figures in the 2016 election.\u201dMr. Mogulof said that university officials had already let some deadlines slide, but that they could not wait beyond the end of this week.\u201cThis is all about providing to them the security they want and we want to offer for their events, and it can\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d he said. For a speech by the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro on Thursday, organized by the Berkeley College Republicans, the university is bringing in \u201ca huge number\u201d of police officers and \u201cspending hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d he added. \u201cThe logistics are exceedingly complex.\u201dMr. Kasamoto said that he, Mr. Wright and Mr. Jandhyala had met Wednesday morning with the university\u2019s events coordinator, and that they wanted \u201cto make this a positive, collaborative experience.\u201d In his Facebook message on Tuesday, he wrote, \u201cWe hope that \u2018campus officials\u2019 will contact us directly about any of their concerns regarding our efforts to make this event a success for the Berkeley community.\u201dMr. Mogulof said Tuesday that the student organizers \u201cknow exactly\u201d what the requirements are and that university officials had \u201crepeatedly asked\u201d them to provide specific documents.Berkeley has been a hotbed of controversy this year, with a series of planned \u2014 and, in some cases, later canceled \u2014 speeches by conservatives whom opponents accused of promoting bigotry.But when Mayor Jesse Arreguin of Berkeley asked the university last month to cancel Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s Free Speech Week address, the university declined, saying it would not reject student groups\u2019 invited speakers based on their political beliefs.Mr. Kasamoto said that the organizers were working with the university police and the Berkeley Police Department \u201cto plan for the worst situation that could happen,\u201d but that they hoped guests would come in search of \u201chealthy discussion.\u201d\u201cThis event is meant to serve as an example for the rest of the country that we can engage in political conversation without violence,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Courts Brand-Name Teachers, Raising Ethics Issues", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedMAPLETON, N.D. \u2014 One of the tech-savviest teachers in the United States teaches third grade here at Mapleton Elementary, a public school with about 100 students in the sparsely populated plains west of Fargo.\u201cI will embed it in my brand every day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said of Seesaw. \u201cI get to make it better.\u201dTheir ranks are growing as public schools increasingly adopt all manner of laptops, tablets, math teaching sites, quiz apps and parent-teacher messaging apps. The corporate courtship of these teachers brings with it profound new conflict-of-interest issues for the nation\u2019s public schools.Moreover, there is little rigorous research showing whether or not the new technologies significantly improve student outcomes.Teachers said that more established start-ups gave them pricier perks like travel expenses to industry-sponsored conferences attended by thousands of teachers. In exchange, teacher ambassadors often promote company products on social media or in their conference talks \u2014 sometimes without explicitly disclosing their relationships with their sponsors.Many public schools are facing tight budgets, and administrators, including the principal at Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, said they welcomed potentially valuable free technology and product training. Even so, some education experts warned that company incentives might influence teachers to adopt promoted digital tools over rival products or even traditional approaches, like textbooks.\u201cTeachers can\u2019t help but be seduced to make greater use of the technology, given these efforts by tech companies,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.Public-school teachers who accept perks, meals or anything of value in exchange for using a company\u2019s products in their classrooms could also run afoul of school district ethics policies or state laws regulating government employees.Ms. Delzer and other educators forcefully argue that they\u2019re motivated by altruism, and not company-bestowed status or gifts. \u201cI am in this profession for kids,\u201d Ms. Delzer said, \u201cnot for notoriety or the money.\u201dAnother important draw for teachers, who already often feel underappreciated: Having tech companies, the icons of American society, seek their views provides welcome attention. \u201cTeachers have really responded well to feeling like they are being listened to,\u201d said Carl Sjogreen, a co-founder of Seesaw.The benefits to companies are substantial. Many start-ups enlist their ambassadors as product testers and de facto customer service representatives who can field other teachers\u2019 queries.Microsoft and Apple said they worked with schools to make sure any conference travel expenses they covered for teachers complied with district ethics rules. Google said it provided meals but not teachers\u2019 travel expenses.An Amazon representative, responding to a question about the gift cards that TenMarks offered to certain teachers last year, said that the company had not given that incentive recently and that it had procedures \u201cto ensure our compliance with applicable laws and to help facilitate teachers\u2019 obligations to their schools.\u201dSo far, no teacher has asked for the payment, said Melissa Davis, GoEnnounce\u2019s chief executive. Still, she said, teacher referrals accounted for 20 percent of GoEnnounce\u2019s first-year sales.\u201cThese champions are really essential in giving us a really powerful foot in the door to meet with districts and schools,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Unlike industry influence in medicine, however, the phenomenon of company-affiliated teachers has received little scrutiny. Twitter alone is rife with educators broadcasting their company-bestowed titles.\u201cIf medical experts started saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Google Certified Doctor\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Pfizer Distinguished Nurse,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm.This is true for celebrities and teachers alike. And it applies equally to conferences, YouTube videos, personal blogs or Twitter posts.Some teachers and start-ups said they were not aware of those guidelines.\u201cIf you are receiving any sort of incentive to promote the company\u2019s product, that is what we call a material relationship,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, associate director of the trade commission\u2019s division of advertising practices, \u201cand that has to be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the endorsement message.\u201dFor some teachers, corporate relationships can be steppingstones to lucrative speaking or training engagements. Schools often hire company-connected educators to give training sessions to their teachers. And technology conferences for teachers often book influential teachers as speakers.Ms. Delzer said her fees for such events started at several thousand dollars a day. Some veteran education influencers charge much more.To do it all, Ms. Delzer negotiated a special contract with her district, allowing her to take 10 unpaid days off a year. She uses those days off to give speeches and run teacher workshops for other schools.\u201cIt\u2019s like two full-time jobs,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.Just before 8:30 a.m. on school days, Ms. Delzer, 32, stations herself at the classroom door. She greets each of her third graders by name, ushering them in one by one with a brief shoulder squeeze. \u201cI want them to feel love when they walk in,\u201d she said.If her classroom looks less like a traditional schoolroom and more like a den \u2014 with a colorful rug and inspirational signs exhorting children to \u201cDREAM\u201d and \u201cLAUGH\u201d \u2014 that is no accident. A few years ago, Ms. Delzer decided to remodel her classroom to foster the kind of independent work habits she thought her students would need in life.So she ditched the standard-issue desks and rearranged the room to look more like the place where she goes to work on her conference talks: her local Starbucks. Today, her third graders sit wherever they please \u2014 on cushions, rocking chairs, balance balls.\u201cIf I\u2019m just feeling like relaxing, I usually sit on the rockers or the ball chairs or the beanbag chairs,\u201d Jennings, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class last spring, explained. \u201cBut if I want to be really, really focused, then I usually feel like going on something a little harder so that I don\u2019t lose concentration.\u201dSitting in her local Starbucks in West Fargo, Ms. Delzer noted: \u201cIf you Google \u2018Starbucks Classroom,\u2019 it\u2019s a thing now.\u201dBut Ms. Delzer said she did not start out seeking to influence the practice of teaching. It was serendipity, she said, and an iPad experiment.In 2011, Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, in Thief River Falls, Minn., bought a few iPads and asked her to try using them in class. Two years later, her school\u2019s technology director suggested that they speak at an education conference about her experiment.That was when Ms. Delzer realized, she said, that by addressing her peers, she could reach vastly more students.\u201cI see the ripple effect on teachers who leave the conference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to know that those classrooms are better because of it.\u201dToday, so many teachers from other districts want to visit her classroom that Mapleton Elementary has set aside every Tuesday to host them. \u201cWe limit it to four teachers a day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.One morning last spring, Ms. Delzer assigned her third graders a math problem to solve on their iPads using Seesaw. Developed by two former Facebook product managers, Seesaw lets students produce and share their schoolwork as written notes, diagrams, audio recordings or videos.Some children love the sharing aspect. \u201cThey can see what you are doing now that we have Seesaw,\u201d McCoy, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class, said of his parents. \u201cOther years they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were only able to see on your papers.\u201dTeaching, by nature, is a helping profession. And educators have a long tradition of sharing ideas with colleagues.Ms. Delzer said she did not see a conflict between her teaching and other activities. She said she deliberately divided her work, devoting herself to her students during school hours while giving conference talks on days off and working with companies on some school nights.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep the two things separate,\u201d she said.She added that she worked only with companies whose products she personally believed in. Those relationships, she said, gave her valuable access to resources that could benefit her students, colleagues and teacher followers.\u201cIf I am going to put my name on it, it either has to make learning better for students or teaching better for teachers,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.But companies that tap public-school teachers to use or promote their products in exchange for perks are effectively engaging the educators as consultants \u2014 a situation that could conflict with teachers\u2019 obligations to their employer: schools.\u201cVendors offering free technology to teachers for their personal or professional use in exchange for teachers promoting it to students or other teachers is a very questionable activity,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Tim Jacobson, the principal of Mapleton Elementary School, where Ms. Delzer teaches, offered a different view. He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201dMr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201dOne evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.He had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.Now, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.Mr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.This teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.If the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.But there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.Mr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.He left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.Among other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.And Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Linda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.The Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.Last year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.Kittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.It was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.An hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.After dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.Ms. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.If her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.Every fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201dLest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It unfolded so naturally, older people worried, that the young did not fully understand the risk they were taking.\u201cYou see how it is going to end,\u201d said Mr. Juanico\u2019s mother, Serafina Sabat\u00e9, 89.She said it sharply: Under the fascist government of Francisco Franco, her father was imprisoned for six years for producing fabric for the republican army. She asked her grandson, who was elated about the vote, what he would do if the government sent tanks.\u201cLook, we have lived through a war,\u201d Ms. Sabat\u00e9 said, her voice shaking. \u201cIf people go to the street, if someone does something against the state, they will jump on him. Anyone who has lived through the war wants these days to pass by.\u201dThe city of Terrassa, an old textile manufacturing center just outside Barcelona, seemed preternaturally calm last week, the sidewalk cafes full and a yearly theater festival underway. Under the surface, however, there was the sense of an approaching collision \u2014 one that was days away, and then hours.The mayor had mostly disappeared from public view, explaining in a Facebook post that he had come under a torrent of abuse when he had tried to remain neutral on the vote. Elementary school principals had received letters warning that they might face sedition charges if they opened their doors for voting. Teenage activists \u2014 joyful, full of expectation \u2014 talked about blocking security forces with their bodies.\u201cWe have been waiting for this moment for 300 years,\u201d said Guillem Carbonell Vidal, 18, who is studying to be a theater technician. He was excited, and sleep-deprived, having spent the past week running from one political meeting to another, debating such matters as whether to print a new currency and nationalize the banks.\u201cI am 18, and I will be able to live the way I want,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be able to build a new future. We have to build a society that is anti-patriarchal, where women don\u2019t have to suffer violence, which anyway is created by men, and where the working class has power.\u201dThe last few weeks, he said, have been \u201ca dream.\u201dOpinion polls suggest that about half of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million people support breaking away from Spain, but the separatists\u2019 influence ballooned in 2015, when independence parties won a majority in the region\u2019s Parliament. There was already resentment that the Spanish government was siphoning too much of the region\u2019s wealth.Madrid \u2014 which allowed a nonbinding referendum on independence in 2014 \u2014 has taken a hard line this time, arguing that a unilateral act of separation flies in the face of the rule of law, and sets a dangerous precedent for other European countries struggling with similar movements.Ask \u201cindependistas\u201d why the need to break away from Spain is so urgent, and the answer goes back to 1714, when Philip V of Spain captured Barcelona during the War of the Spanish Succession, bringing an end to the Catalan principality. This was a period of consolidation across Europe, as strong monarchies absorbed smaller, weaker neighbors. In Catalonia, this is not obscure history: It is common, these days, to hear the archaic insult \u201cbotifler,\u201d which means a supporter of Philip V and his ally, the French house of Bourbon.Many Catalans have grown to adulthood believing that they were, simply, not Spanish. Under Franco\u2019s dictatorship, which ended in 1975, the government tried to stamp out all Catalan institutions and the language, and thousands of people were executed in purges. Virtually no Catalan family emerged from that period unscarred.But Terrassa, as a manufacturing city, also has a large population that moved to Catalonia from other parts of Spain. In those neighborhoods, it can be difficult to find anyone who supports independence. Gabriel Zafra, who leads an association of migrants from Extremadura, a region in western Spain, said the mounting demand for independence had made it politically risky to question, even for elected officials.\u201cThey have created a monster of illusion and excitement,\u201d said Mr. Zafra, a retired janitor who has lived in Catalonia since 1974. \u201cThey have promised them the land of Narnia. They have promised them a Catalonia full of flowers, where happy people go to church on Sunday. That is a lie.\u201dThe other people in Mr. Zafra\u2019s neighborhood bar, a place with one-armed bandit slot machines and a heavily tattooed bartender, thought that breaking away from Spain would lead to economic collapse. Eva \u00c1lvarez, whose family owns the bar, said she had needed to reassure her 12-year-old son that if Catalonia became independent, they would not have to leave.\u201cNationalism is a kind of racism,\u201d Mr. Zafra said, wondering aloud if ethnic violence would follow. \u201cI don\u2019t want to compare it to Serbia, but if this continues, I might have to.\u201dAs the weekend approached, there was no way to know how many in Catalonia would defy the orders from Madrid, but time for speculating was running out.When school ended on Friday, the police were expected to seal buildings normally used for voting. In the doorway of an elementary school on Carrer de Sant Marian stood its headmaster, Marta Suana Rovira, 48, a slight woman who wears braces and laughs almost incessantly.Spain has warned headmasters that if they open their buildings to voting they could face a charge of sedition, which under Spanish law carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Plainclothes officers from the Catalonian police force, the Mossos, had appeared in her office, asking to see her identification and noting her home address and the names of her parents.It had been a long week, and she was having trouble sleeping.\u201cMy family says they will visit me in prison, and bring me a file inside a loaf of bread,\u201d she said. \u201cI tell them, \u2018No, chocolate.\u2019\u201dMs. Rovira assured the police she had not provided anyone with keys to the facility ahead of the vote. But the question of keys is a tricky one, she added with a twinkle: The teachers have them, the parents have them, and so do any number of community groups. She spread her hands, as if to show that she was helpless in the matter. \u201cIt is impossible to control,\u201d she said, and then went off into a gale of laughter.On Friday the time had finally come, and she stood outside her building, scanning the street for police cars. Instead, she saw a parade of parents \u2014 mothers in tank tops and sweatpants, fathers in T-shirts and blazers \u2014 who had volunteered to occupy the school all weekend, in shifts, to keep it open for Sunday\u2019s vote, advertising it as a \u201cFall Festival.\u201d Some had brought backpacks with toothbrushes and changes of clothes. They sat cross-legged on the playground, as if this were a normal meeting of the parent-teacher association.\u201cWe will stay until Sunday,\u201d said Belen Parra, 44, and then she raised a clenched fist in the air. \u201cOn Sunday, we will resist entirely.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuban Doctors Revolt: \u2018You Get Tired of Being a Slave\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 In a rare act of collective defiance, scores of Cuban doctors working overseas to make money for their families and their country are suing to break ranks with the Cuban government, demanding to be released from what one judge called a \u201cform of slave labor.\u201dBut the doctors get a small cut of that money, and a growing number of them in Brazil have begun to rebel. In the last year, at least 150 Cuban doctors have filed lawsuits in Brazilian courts to challenge the arrangement, demanding to be treated as independent contractors who earn full salaries, not agents of the Cuban state.Cuban artists and athletes have defected during overseas trips for decades, most of them winding up in the United States. But the lawsuits in Brazil represent an unusual rebellion that takes aim at one of Cuba\u2019s signature efforts. Sending doctors overseas is not only a way for Cuba to earn much-needed income, but it also helps promote the nation\u2019s image as a medical powerhouse that routinely comes to the world\u2019s aid.\u201cThe end of the program was a huge blow to us,\u201d said Maireilys \u00c1lvarez Rodr\u00edguez, another of the doctors who sued in Brazil. \u201cThat was our way out.\u201dThe end of the visa program means that the future of these doctors now rests in the hands of the Brazilian courts. They have mostly ruled against the doctors, but some judges have sided with them, allowing the doctors to work on their own and get paid directly.The doctors\u2019 defiance puts them at risk of serious repercussions by the Cuban government, including being barred from the island and their families for years.The seeds of the rebellion were planted a year ago in a conversation between a Cuban doctor and a clergyman in a remote village in northeastern Brazil.Anis Deli Grana de Carvalho, a doctor from Cuba, was coming to the end of her three-year medical assignment. But having married a Brazilian man, she wanted to stay and keep working.The pastor was outraged to learn that, under the terms of their employment, Cuban doctors earn only about a quarter of the amount the Brazilian government pays Cuba for their services.He quickly put her in touch with a lawyer in Bras\u00edlia, the Brazilian capital. In late September of last year, she sued in federal court to work as an independent contractor.Within weeks, scores of other Cuban doctors followed Dr. Grana\u2019s lead and filed suits in Brazilian courts. The Brazilian government, which struck the deal with Cuba in 2013 to provide doctors in underserved parts of the country, is appealing the cases that doctors have won and thinks it will prevail.Dr. \u00c1lvarez said that the stipend offered by the Cuban government to work for a few years in Brazil seemed appealing to her and her husband, Arnulfo Castanet Batista, also a doctor, when they signed up in 2013.\u201cIt was a pretty acceptable offer compared to what we made in Cuba,\u201d Dr. \u00c1lvarez said.The World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, helped broker the deal. Under it, Brazil pays Cuba roughly $3,620 a month for each doctor, or nearly four times what Cuban doctors earn through the arrangement. Approximately 18,000 Cuban doctors have done stints in Brazil; roughly 8,600 remain in the country.The United Nations has called the program a success story, noting that it has lowered Brazil\u2019s infant mortality rate and extended care to indigenous communities.Doing so, some Cuban doctors contend, would perpetuate an injustice. Soon after arriving in Santa Rita, a poor village in the northeastern state of Maranh\u00e3o, Dr. \u00c1lvarez and her husband began to feel uneasy about the terms of the contract they signed, particularly after befriending doctors from other countries.\u201cWe began to see that the conditions for the other doctors were totally different,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could be with their family, bring their kids. The salaries were much higher.\u201dHundreds of miles away, in Minas Gerais State, Dr. Jim\u00e9nez, 34, found the work rewarding, but also began to harbor feelings of resentment.\u201cYou are trained in Cuba and our education is free, health care is free, but at what price?\u201d she said. \u201cYou wind up paying for it your whole life.\u201dMonths before their three-year tour was up last fall, some Cuban doctors who had married Brazilians were offered the chance to extend their stay. Others, including Dr. \u00c1lvarez and her husband, were told to prepare to head home.Cuban doctors unhappy with their situations formed a group on WhatsApp. Andr\u00e9 de Santana Corr\u00eaa, a Brazilian lawyer, said his cellphone began buzzing constantly as Cuban doctors across the country started to text him seeking help.After analyzing their contracts, Mr. de Santana concluded that the agreements were at odds with the equality protections in Brazil\u2019s Constitution.Late last year, judges issued temporary injunctions in some cases, granting Cuban doctors the right to remain as independent contractors, earning full wages. One federal judge in the capital denounced the Cuban contracts as a \u201cform of slave labor\u201d that could not be tolerated.But the federal judge who handled Dr. Grana\u2019s case ruled against her, finding that allowing Cuban doctors to walk away from their contracts posed \u201cundue risks in the political and diplomatic spheres.\u201dSoon after the first injunctions were issued, Cuban supervisors in Brazil summoned doctors who had filed suits and fired them on the spot, several doctors said. Each was given the chance to get on a plane to Cuba within 24 hours \u2014 or face exile for eight years.\u201cMany of us seem to have forgotten, when we embarked on this mission, the contract we signed,\u201d the post says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you get weaknesses and errors that start eroding the worthy values our parents raised us with.\u201dWhen it became clear that a majority of the doctors were losing in court, the WhatsApp group became a place for doctors to strategize and commiserate.\u201cWe keep one another strong,\u201d said Dr. Jim\u00e9nez, who says she has been unemployed since being fired in June and is now barred from re-entering Cuba for eight years.Dr. \u00c1lvarez and her husband were among the lucky ones to keep their jobs and get what amounted to a huge pay raise. They also managed to bring their children to Brazil.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to leave your family and friends and your homeland,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here we\u2019re in a country where you\u2019re free, where no one asks you where you\u2019re going, or tells you what you have to do. In Cuba, your life is dictated by the government.\u201dMr. Barros, the Brazilian health minister, said the Cuban doctors should not feel as if they were being poorly compensated, because their salaries were similar to what Brazilian doctors earned during their residencies.\u201cNone of them, to this day, has come to me to complain about their work conditions,\u201d he said.Mr. de Santana, the lawyer, says he hopes Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court will take up the case. But because Brazil\u2019s top court is so backlogged, a definitive ruling may take years.Lis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s War Games With Fake Enemies Cause Real Alarm", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The country does not exist, so it has neither an army nor any real citizens, though it has acquired a feisty following of would-be patriots online. Starting on Thursday, however, the fictional state, Veishnoriya, a distillation of the Kremlin\u2019s darkest fears about the West, becomes the target of the combined military might of Russia and its ally Belarus.The nation was invented to provide an enemy to confront during a six-day joint military exercise that is expected to be the biggest display of Russian military power since the end of the Cold War a quarter-century ago.Zapad, \u201cwest\u201d in Russian, used to include military forces from countries under the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led military alliance whose non-Soviet members have now all joined NATO. Today, the military exercise has shrunk to just two participants \u2014 Russia and Belarus \u2014 but it is still viewed warily by military planners in the West.It comes at a time of deteriorating relations between Russia and the West, with Washington and Moscow trading diplomatic penalties seemingly weekly. From bitter experience over Russian election meddling and military adventurism in recent years, Western officials have developed a deep distrust of the Kremlin\u2019s motives and its proclamations of good intentions.\u201cNATO will be monitoring the exercises closely,\u201d the alliance\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview recently in Brussels, the site of NATO\u2019s headquarters. Russia, he said, is entirely within its rights to train its forces, but has stirred unease by routinely skirting mutually agreed upon rules designed to calm jitters.The Baltic States and Poland, which fear that the fictional nations invented by Zapad planners are thinly disguised proxies for their own countries, say they believe that the number of Russian troops taking part in Zapad-2017 could reach 100,000.Russia, Mr. Stoltenberg said, has a record of exploiting loopholes in the Vienna Document, habitually understating the number of troops taking part in war games by tens of thousands.Moscow and Minsk insist that this week\u2019s Zapad exercise will involve just 12,700 troops. This means that, like all previous Russian military exercises since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, it weighs in just under the 13,000-troop threshold and is therefore is free of observers from the West.But Estonia\u2019s defense minister, Margus Tsahkna, has pointed to a tender issued this year by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense for more than 4,000 railway wagons to transport military equipment and soldiers to Belarus. The figure suggests that far bigger military contingents would be on the move than declared, the minister said, a sign that Moscow may intend to leave some behind.The United States military has echoed such worries, with Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who heads the Army forces in Europe, describing Zapad as a possible \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that would send in Russian forces but not take them out.Belarus, which depends on Russian supplies of cheap energy to keep its economy afloat and shares Mr. Putin\u2019s belief that the West is plotting to sow division and even to invade, says it has no such concerns itself.Military exercises, including those conducted by NATO, often feature invented enemies, a practice that blurs their real purpose and avoids upsetting real countries that do not like to be used as a punching bag for military training \u2014 especially when this involves simulated nuclear attacks. Western experts say they believe that Russian war games in 2009 and 2013 included simulated nuclear strikes against Warsaw and Stockholm.\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the concentration of Belarusian military equipment at the borders of Veishnoriya,\u201d reads one message posted by the nonexistent nation\u2019s Foreign Ministry. Others include a call for volunteers from \u201cbrotherly countries\u201d to repel an invasion from the east and warnings that Veishnoriyans are \u201cwarlike beasts\u201d who will not surrender.Russia has dismissed Western anxieties over Zapad-2017, saying that the exercises are purely defensive. Fueling unease is Russia\u2019s silence on what exactly the exercises will involve. Belarus has invited foreign military attach\u00e9s based in Minsk to watch and released some details of its war games with Russia, including airstrikes and tank battles on Sunday and Monday.But it is not clear that the attach\u00e9s will have the freedom they need to move about and to talk with soldiers. Moscow, for its part, has said only that the exercises threaten nobody and will involve operations in Belarus, in Russia\u2019s Western Military District and in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, next to Poland.This vagueness, according to NATO officials in Brussels, continues a pattern of obfuscation deeply entrenched since the Soviet era.A declassified C.I.A. report on Soviet military exercises prepared in the 1980s said that deception was always a central feature of Moscow\u2019s training program, with Soviet forces deploying elaborate ruses to camouflage the real number of troops and purpose of their major exercises. It noted that a Soviet naval exercise designed to practice landing troops on islands off Denmark, a member of NATO, had been disguised as training devoted to the defense of Soviet shores.Measures taken to deceive NATO, the C.I.A. report said, included leaking fake information on Soviet radio frequencies monitored by the West and planting disinformation through human agents. In some cases, the Soviet military deployed special \u201ccamouflage forces\u201d that operated \u201cin totally different regions\u201d from those taking part in a real exercise \u201cso as to mislead NATO intelligence.\u201d It also generated phony radio traffic \u201cin a manner intended to deceive foreign intelligence to the type of the exercise, its aim, conduct etc.\u201dMr. Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said he could not speculate about the real purpose of Zapad-2017, saying that this would become clear only once it was over next week. At the same time, he noted, the exercise fits a \u201cpattern of a more assertive Russia\u201d that is \u201cexercising more aggressively\u201d and, through its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, has shown that \u201cit is willing to use military force against its neighbors.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Just Another Weekend of Washington Protests", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Bound for the Lincoln Memorial, thousands of demonstrators ambled block after block through the city, shouting obscenities, their faces streaked with sweat and clown paint.The marchers, known as Juggalos \u2014 the tightknit supporters of the rap-metal duo Insane Clown Posse \u2014 had descended on the capital to proclaim their right to free speech and to denounce their classification by the F.B.I. as a criminal gang.But Washingtonians had nothing to fear. In fact, they barely blinked. It was just another day in the capital\u2019s summer of protest.On Saturday alone, in addition to the Juggalo gathering, there was the Mother of All Rallies \u2014 an exhortation to the red-cap-wearing faithful to \u201ctake our country back\u201d \u2014 and, blocks away, a counterprotest opposing white supremacy. Near the White House, there was a protest against Russia\u2019s election interference. In all, more than 30 events were booked on federal land in the city.It seemed a potentially combustible mix, but clashes were limited to a few harsh words exchanged near some porta-potties, and the city went about its usual business.\u201cThis is the new normal,\u201d said Helen Brosnan, a Washington resident who said she often encountered rallies in front of the White House on her way to work at a progressive nonprofit group. She was sipping iced coffee at a brunch spot called A Baked Joint. Next to her was a table of rowdy Juggalos.\u201cBrunch and a protest,\u201d she added.Among the brunching Juggalos was Jake Jones, known as Sidehawk Ninja to his fellow rap-metal fans. He sat on a curb nibbling on a $3 piece of multigrain toast and complaining about the $5 orange juice. His five-inch lime-green mohawk stretched sideways, from ear to ear, like a tiara, bobbing forward as he rapped expletives. He keeps it upright with real glue, he said.Another Juggalo, Jeremy Baca, a 27-year-old with a Hatchetman tattoo on his arm, said the followers were \u201chippies \u2014 just rough around the edges.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weird music, that\u2019s why weird people like it,\u201d he said. He had come to Washington with his girlfriend, the rainbow-dreadlocked Valarie Wakefield, whom he met when both were exiled from the school cafeteria in seventh grade. \u201cEveryone here is one of the outcasts from high school \u2014 the ones the prep kids picked on. We rally around this music, but we aren\u2019t violent.\u201dThe Juggalos \u2014 the name comes from an Insane Clown Posse song called \u201cThe Juggla\u201d \u2014 were classified as a gang after self-proclaimed members committed a series of crimes. The Insane Clown Posse, along with several fans and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, alleging discrimination. A judge dismissed the case, but the A.C.L.U. is appealing.After they reached the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the marchers heard testimony from fellow Juggalos who said they had lost their jobs, military status and even children because they had been listed in gang databases.An older man climbed atop a ledge and unleashed onto the crowd a sticky round of the tribe\u2019s drink of choice, Faygo soda, inciting cheers. A face-painted toddler in a clown costume snuggled on the lap of a stranger, and his father \u2014 in a Clown Lives Matter T-shirt \u2014 nodded approvingly.\u201cLook at that, even my little guy knows we\u2019re all family,\u201d he said.To the east of the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall was a much smaller rally more in line with the sorts of protests that have filled the summer, like those about Black Lives Matter, science and climate research, immigration, women\u2019s rights, and President Trump\u2019s tax returns.The Mother of All Rallies was billed as \u201cnot a left or right rally,\u201d though it featured the familiar Trump Unity Bridge, and its speakers deplored \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and endorsed the president\u2019s transgender ban for the military.\u201cI\u2019m just blessed to be here, so blessed,\u201d Denise Bradshaw of Omaha said as she adjusted her lawn chair and fiddled with the Trump pins on her chest. \u201cOur country is at a precipice, and I want to be able to say I didn\u2019t sit back and watch our nation circle the drain. We want MOAR!\u201dThe event\u2019s title was a play on \u201cMother of All Bombs\u201d \u2014 a name for the gigantic munition that the military recently dropped on terrorists in Afghanistan \u2014 but its organizers sought to avoid violence by forbidding Confederate flags.Counterprotesters, led by a tuba player, headed into the downtown area from the north, joined by supporters of young undocumented immigrants and activists who had marched from Charlottesville, Va. The group\u2019s event, organized on Facebook and titled \u201cWhite Supremacists Out of Washington!\u201d, had deemed the Mother of All Rallies as \u201cthe first gathering of the far right\u201d since the racially charged Charlottesville violence last month.From all angles, the groups converged on the Mall, the backyard of the leader of the free world (who, at the time, was at his resort in New Jersey). At the center of the storm was one unlucky wedding planner, pacing at the steps of the D.C. War Memorial, her clipboard tucked under her arm as she raised the volume of the classical music on a portable sound system. Wedding guests mingled, periodically looking over their shoulders as the bride wove through the protesting crowds.The elegant occasion had been booked with the National Park Service long before the rallies \u2014 back when it seemed it would be an ordinary Saturday in the capital.A photo caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified two people at the Juggalo event.

She had a question that the on-site staff couldn\u2019t answer, and they suggested she call the media contact, Mr. Koch.So she did. She caught him on the way to a baseball practice in Central Park, and after the two established that he had no information on the matter about which she had called, they turned to chatting.\u201cYou could safely say it was pretty flirty,\u201d he said.\u201cI thought he sounded cute, which is something I\u2019ve never thought before in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just has this great voice.

{"Headline": "After More Than 20 Years, Newark to Regain Control of Its Schools", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than 20 years, local administrators have had little leverage over the finances or operations of the state\u2019s largest school district. Choices about curriculum and programs were made mostly by a state-appointed superintendent, often an outsider. The city could not override personnel decisions.But the decision to give authority back to the city is in many ways a recognition that state control is an idea whose time has passed. Around the country, 28 other states enacted similar policies, fueled by a desire to hold districts more accountable. Many of the districts taken over were in heavily minority low-income cities. At present, around 60 districts are under some form of state management, said Kenneth Wong, chairman of the department of education at Brown University.In 2015, Governor Christie tapped Christopher D. Cerf, a hard-charging former state education commissioner and yet another disciple of Mr. Klein\u2019s, as the next superintendent. In an interview at City Hall, Mr. Baraka said that he had expected the latest outsider to be \u201cvery rigid\u201d and \u201ccarry the governor\u2019s water.\u201dIn the interview Mr. Baraka credited Mr. Cerf for being open-minded. \u201cSometimes you go to a church to infiltrate, and become a deacon,\u201d he said.And Mr. Cerf, in news conference on the first day of school, praised Mr. Baraka as \u201ca truly great educator, in my judgment, a truly great man.\u201dYet chronic absenteeism \u2014 defined as students missing more than 18 school days a year \u2014 remains \u201cfar too high\u201d at 22 percent. And while school suspensions and reports of violence and vandalism have fallen over the last few years, \u201cmany students still report feeling unsafe at school,\u201d the report said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t like you flip a switch,\u201d Mr. Cerf said in an interview, noting the gradual pace of progress.Barring any unexpected snags, the district and the state will now develop a formal transition plan. Sometime next year, a public referendum will determine whether voters want an elected school board, or one appointed by the mayor. The board will then have the power to hire and fire its own superintendent; Mr. Cerf\u2019s contract ends in June.But Mr. Fulop gives little credit to the state. \u201cThose things converging have helped the school system gradually get better; it has nothing to do with the State of New Jersey\u2019s policies,\u201d Mr. Fulop said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t find anybody who points to state control and says, thankfully the state was here.\u201dMr. Baraka, among others, is hopeful that when the transition is complete, the city will have learned its lesson.\u201cLocal control means that you\u2019re in charge now \u2014 you can\u2019t cuss out people now unless you\u2019re cussing yourself out,\u201d he said. \u201cStop thinking about us versus them, because us is the them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "RT, Sputnik and Russia\u2019s New Theory of War", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "FeatureHow the Kremlin built one of the most powerful information weapons of the 21st century \u2014 and why it may be impossible to stop.Supported byBut even Steltner found the phone calls he received that morning confounding. They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. \u201cThey are demonstrating \u2014 \u2018Save our children,\u2019 \u2018No attacks from immigrants on our children\u2019 and some things like that,\u201d Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently.The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office\u2019s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin\u2019s tight-knit Russian-German community.Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three \u201cSouthern-looking men\u201d \u2014 by which she meant Arab migrants \u2014 had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her.But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened.An official in the Merkel government told me that the administration was completely perplexed, at first. Then, a few days later, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, held a news conference in Moscow. Bringing up Lisa\u2019s story, he cast doubt on the official version of events. There was no way, he argued, that Lisa left home voluntarily. Germany, he suggested, was \u201ccovering up reality in a politically correct manner for the sake of domestic politics.\u201d Two days later, RT ran a segment reporting that despite all the official denials, the case was \u201cnot so simple.\u201d The Russian Embassy called Steltner and asked to meet, he told me. The German foreign ministry informed him that this was now a diplomatic issue.The whole affair suddenly appeared a lot less mystifying. A realization took hold in the foreign ministry, the intelligence services and the Chancellery: Germany had been hit.The intelligence assessment detailed some cloak-and-dagger activities, like the murky web of Russian (if not directly government-affiliated or -financed) hackers who infiltrated voting systems and stole gigabytes\u2019 worth of email and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But most of the assessment concerned machinations that were plainly visible to anyone with a cable subscription or an internet connection: the coordinated activities of the TV and online-media properties and social-media accounts that made up, in the report\u2019s words, \u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine.\u201dThis makes RT and Sputnik harder for the West to combat than shadowy hackers. You can tighten your internet security protocols to protect against data breaches, run counterhacking operations to take out infiltrators, sanction countries with proven links to such activities. But RT and Sputnik operate on the stated terms of Western liberal democracy; they count themselves as news organizations, protected by the First Amendment and the libertarian ethos of the internet.But the ratings are almost beside the point. RT might not have amassed an audience that remotely rivals CNN\u2019s in conventional terms, but in the new, \u201cdemocratized\u201d media landscape, it doesn\u2019t need to. Over the past several years, the network has come to form the hub of a new kind of state media operation: one that travels through the same diffuse online channels, chasing the same viral hits and memes, as the rest of the Twitter-and-Facebook-age media. In the process, Russia has built the most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far, one that thrives in the feverish political climates that have descended on many Western publics.Something like the dissemination of Ford\u2019s conveyor belt, he said, was now happening in media; the sort of global news networks the West built were being replicated by Russia, to great effect. What was making \u201cthe whole story successful,\u201d he said, \u201cis a tectonic change of the global system that all of a sudden started to develop 10 years ago.\u201dThe transformation and acceleration of information technology, Peskov said, had unmoored the global economy from real value. Perception alone could move markets or crash them. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen bubbles like we\u2019ve seen in the greatest economy in the world, the United States,\u201d he said. The same free flow of information had produced \u201ca new clash of interests,\u201d and so began \u201can informational disaster \u2014 an informational war.\u201dPeskov argued that this was not an information war of Russia\u2019s choosing; it was a \u201ccounteraction.\u201d He brought up the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which led to the ousters of Russian-friendly governments in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in the mid-2000s. Russia blamed American nongovernmental organizations for fomenting the upheavals. But now, Peskov argued, all you might need to shake up the geopolitical order was a Twitter account. \u201cNow you can reach hundreds of millions in a minute,\u201d he said.By way of example, he pointed to \u201cthis girl, from show business, Kim Kardashian.\u201d Kardashian is among the most popular people in all of social media, with 55 million Twitter followers, nearly 18 million more than President Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine that one day she says, \u2018My supporters \u2014 do this,\u2019\u2009\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThis will be a signal that will be accepted by millions and millions of people. And she\u2019s got no intelligence, no interior ministry, no defense ministry, no K.G.B.\u201d This, he said, was the new reality: the global proliferation of the kinds of reach and influence that were once reserved for the great powers and, more recently, great media conglomerates. Even Peskov sounded slightly amazed considering the possibilities. \u201cThe new reality creates a perfect opportunity for mass disturbances,\u201d he said, \u201cor for initiating mass support or mass disapproval.\u201dOne way of looking at the activities of Russia\u2019s information machine is as a resumption of the propaganda fight between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that began immediately following the Second World War. In the late 1940s, the Marshall Plan, the herculean development project helmed by Secretary of State George Marshall, flooded postwar Europe with money and advisers to help rebuild cities, advance democracy and form an integrated economic zone. Joseph Stalin immediately saw it as a threat \u2014 and saw propaganda as one of his best weapons to contain it.For the counterinformation campaign, the U.S. government enlisted journalists, including the Washington Post Pulitzer winner Alfred Friendly and the Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Roscoe Drummond; Hollywood filmmakers; and the top marketers of Madison Avenue, including McCann-Erickson and Young and Rubicam. The new effort \u2014 which eventually fell under a new United States Information Agency \u2014 produced upbeat posters with slogans like \u201cWhatever the weather, we only reach welfare together,\u201d which offered a bright contrast to the Communists\u2019 anti-Marshall Plan messaging. Operating on the theory that local voices would have more credibility than American ones, it fed news to foreign reporters about how well the Marshall Plan was progressing in their countries and recruited top European directors to produce hundreds of news features and documentaries that promoted \u201cWestern values\u201d like free trade and representative democracy.America went into the propaganda war with distinct advantages. At the time, the Marshall Plan was pumping $13 billion into Europe, while the Soviets were taking $14 billion out in the form of reparations and resource seizures; America\u2019s image abroad was as squeaky clean as it would ever be. \u201cThis was the time when finally the United States came of age as an international power \u2014 when it still had its virginity, as it were,\u201d David Reynolds, a Cambridge University history professor, told me.And unlike the Soviets, the United States benefited from the existence of a vast ecosystem of nongovernment media that, even when it crossed swords with the American government, still reflected an American outlook and implicitly promoted American cultural values. The first international, 24-hour networks to come online in the 1980s, like CNN, were American, and they provided their audience \u2014 which eventually included many behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 an unsparing view of the last days of Communism: student protesters staring down tanks in Tiananmen Square, protests and strikes in Poland, East Germans exulting on the ruins of the Berlin Wall. When Mikhail Gorbachev signed his resignation, ceding power to the new presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the last official act of Soviet Communism, he invited CNN to capture the moment in his Kremlin office suite. Finding his own pen out of ink, Gorbachev turned to the CNN president at the time, Tom Johnson, who lent Gorbachev the Mont Blanc he had in his breast pocket. After making sure the pen wasn\u2019t American-made, the last Soviet leader used it to sign one of the most important documents in Russian history. \u201cYou have built your empire better than I built mine,\u201d he told Johnson.Lesin was a sharp-witted hard drinker who was concerned about Russia\u2019s image in the world. He had a vision for an international network that would familiarize Russia in the same way that CNN familiarized America. But the chaos of the later Yeltsin years, in which the ruble collapsed and Yeltsin\u2019s government foundered, made such a thing impossible.Lesin found a more receptive patron in Putin, who succeeded Yeltsin in 1999. Putin \u2014 who, as a deputy in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office half a decade earlier, once chauffeured Ted Turner around the city \u2014 was an attentive student of the power of television. At times, he could not contain his frustration with the way the foreign media covered Russia. \u201cAll they can talk about is crisis and breakdown,\u201d he complained to a nationalist youth group in 2005.That year, with the Russian economy rebounding thanks to strong oil prices, Lesin and Alexei Gromov, Putin\u2019s press strategist, secured the approval and financing to start the network, which they called Russia Today. To run the new operation, they hired a 25-year-old TV reporter named Margarita Simonyan.When she heard she got the job, \u201cI almost fainted,\u201d Simonyan told me recently. We were sitting on plush couches on an exclusive, dimly lit floor of Voronezh, a fashionable restaurant in the Khamovniki district in central Moscow. \u201cDr. No,\u201d the James Bond film about a plan to disrupt the American space program, was on a TV screen opposite us. Before us was a spread of venison, oysters and shrimp, themselves an unsubtle statement: They were imported from Russia\u2019s far east, a menu adjustment in response to the sanctions and countersanctions that had cut off Western food imports.Simonyan grew up poor in Krasnodar, a southern Russia river town, and was 11 when the Soviet Union collapsed. \u201cWe adored the fact that we are now going to be like America and taught like America and to be even patronized by America and be America\u2019s little brother,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel in any way humiliating or contradictory to the Russian pride.\u201d Her infatuation with the United States led her to apply for a slot in a new State Department \u201cfuture leaders\u201d exchange program, which placed top students from the former Soviet Union in United States high schools to \u201censure long-lasting peace and understanding between the U.S. and the countries of Eurasia.\u201dFor one academic year, she attended a public high school in Bristol, N.H. \u201cShe was fascinated with news,\u201d Patricia Albert, whose parents hosted Simonyan, and who remains close with her, told me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d as the family still calls her, would sit transfixed every night when she joined them on the couch to watch the local news, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cCBS Evening News With Dan Rather.\u201d But she also came to resent some of her American classmates for what she viewed as their sheltered na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you have dogs?\u2019 I remember that,\u201d she told me. \u201cI still have a letter I wrote to my parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they are seriously asking me whether we have dogs.\u2019 They were grown-ups \u2014 18-year-olds \u2014 in a normal high school in New Hampshire, which is supposed to be a sophisticated place.\u201dBack home in Krasnodar, her view of the United States, like many Russians\u2019, started to curdle after the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia, with which Russian had strong ethnic, cultural and political ties: \u201cOur Slavic brothers and sisters,\u201d she told me, leaning forward for emphasis. \u201cYou bombed them with no permission, with no reason,\u201d she said, \u201cand in one day you lost Russia.\u201dWhen she took the helm of Russia Today the following year, Simonyan modeled the new network on CNN and the BBC, and she hired TV consultants from Britain to help give Russia Today a modern cable-news look and feel. (The RT studios in Moscow, when I visited them this spring, were as state-of-the-art as any I\u2019d seen in the United States.) \u201cNobody in Russia had experience of that kind,\u201d Simonyan told me. \u201cTwenty-four-hour news had not been established yet.\u201d One of her employees, Andrey Kiyashko, who started at RT in his late teens, told me: \u201cCNN, BBC \u2014 we were watching it and taking notes on how to be broadcast journalists.\u201dRussia Today \u2014 incorporated as an independent company with state financing \u2014 was getting into hotels and even American cable systems. But three years into its existence, the network still had not gained much notice or had much discernible impact abroad. Simonyan says she concluded that the network\u2019s mission of solely focusing on Russia needed revising. \u201cWe had basically too much Russian news,\u201d she told me.So in 2008, Russia Today began to reposition itself. The network was reintroduced with a new name, RT, and hired McCann \u2014 the same American advertising firm that once helped the United States sell the Marshall Plan. It soon debuted a new satellite channel in the United States, RT America. Instead of celebrating Russia, Simonyan\u2019s network would turn a critical eye to the rest of the world, particularly the United States. As Peskov sees it, the idea was: \u201cWhy are you criticizing us in Chechnya and all this stuff? Look at what you are doing there in the United States with your relationship with white and black.\u201d He went on: \u201cRT said: \u2018Stop. Don\u2019t criticize us. We\u2019ll tell you about yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dWith that, he said, \u201call of the sudden, Anglo-Saxons saw that there is an army from the opposite side.\u201d RT\u2019s new slogan, dreamed up by McCann, was \u201cQuestion More.\u201dAt the time, state journalism back in Russia was enjoying a kind of renaissance under Dmitri Medvedev, who was elected president in 2008. (Russian presidents are limited to two consecutive terms; Putin endorsed Medvedev as his successor and served as his prime minister before returning to the presidency.) The main Russian international news service, RIA Novosti, hired journalists from The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse and Reuters, following the philosophy that Russia served its interests best by providing traditional warts-and-all news, with a Russian voice and perspective. \u201cThere was no talk about censorship,\u201d Nabi Abdullaev, a former Moscow Times deputy chief editor who oversaw RIA Novosti\u2019s foreign-language news service, told me. \u201cAll they wanted from me was quality professional standards in reporting; that was it.\u201d\u201cObjectivity is a myth,\u201d Kiselyov said. \u201cJust imagine a young man who puts an arm around the shoulder of a girl,\u201d he went on, \u201cand tells the girl, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time that I treat you objectively.\u2019 Is this what she\u2019s waiting for? Probably not. So in the same way, our country, Russia, needs our love. If we speak about the editorial policy, of course, I would certainly want it to be associated with love for Russia.\u201d Journalism, he said, was an instrument of the country.Military officials in America and Europe have come to refer to this idea alternatively as the \u201cGerasimov doctrine\u201d and \u201chybrid war,\u201d which they accuse Russia of engaging in now. When I asked Peskov about those charges, he shrugged. Everyone was doing it, he said. \u201cIf you call what\u2019s going on now a hybrid war, let it be hybrid war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter: It\u2019s war.\u201dShortly after the election, academic and corporate clients hired him to track the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 that is, unequivocally false content. He confined his search to social accounts that shared fake news at least 10 times during the last month of the campaign. This September, in his airy, loft-style office suite on the West Side of Manhattan, he called up the results of the study on a laptop screen. They were visualized as a black sphere on which each of the 14,000 fake-news-spreading accounts appeared as a dot, grouped and color-coded according to ideological affiliation. The sphere was alive with bursts of purple (\u201cU.S. Conservative\u201d), green (\u201cU.S. Far Left\u201d), pink (\u201cPro-Russia/WikiLeaks\u201d), orange (\u201cInternational Right\u201d) and blue (\u201cTrump Core\u201d).Within the fake-news network, Kelly explained, RT was high on the list of most-followed accounts, but it was not the highest \u2014 it ranked No. 117 out of roughly 12,000 accounts he was tracking. Its website was the 12th-most-cited by the fake-news consumers and purveyors \u2014 ahead of The New York Times and The Washington Post but behind Breitbart and Infowars.What was more interesting was who followed RT. It drew substantially from all quadrants of Kelly\u2019s fake-news universe \u2014 Trump supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters, Occupy Wall Streeters and libertarians \u2014 which made it something of a rarity. \u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t just pumping up the right wing in America,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re also pumping up left-wing stuff \u2014 they\u2019re basically trying to pump up the fringe at the expense of the middle.\u201dNearly 20 percent of the fake-news-spreading accounts, Kelly\u2019s analysis determined, were automated bot accounts, of the sort the American intelligence assessment claimed were working in tandem with RT and Sputnik. But who was operating them was unclear \u2014 and regardless, they were far outnumbered by accounts that appeared to belong to real human beings, reading and circulating content that appealed to them. In this paranoid, polarized and ill-informed subset of American news consumers, RT\u2019s audience crossed all ideological boundaries.RT flew in several members of its leadership team from Moscow for a ceremony and held a cocktail party in the lobby of the General Assembly building, with hot plates and canap\u00e9s of shrimp dumplings and meatballs and ham. Giant banners proclaimed \u201cRT: Member Broadcaster of the United Nations In-House Network.\u201dHis speech was about his mother, who grew up under Stalin.

You have to remember that Korea used to be one nation, and it was divided against Koreans\u2019 wishes into a Communist North and a pro-American South at the end of World War II. That division was vastly unpopular among all Koreans, and that was the basis of the war; the war was a war for unification.North Korea wanted the whole country under Communist rule, and South Korea wanted to hold the peninsula under its own rule. The war, of course, ended in stalemate, with the Korean Peninsula still divided, and that rivalry and tension continued for the past 50 years.\u201dCan you imagine a unified Korean Peninsula in your lifetime?

{"Headline": "Case Against Bronx Teenager Who Says He Was Framed by Police Is Dismissed", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Bronx district attorney on Wednesday asked a judge to dismiss gun and assault charges against a teenager in a case that had become a rallying point for critics of the criminal justice system, saying a crucial witness had disappeared. The teenager, Pedro Hernandez, had refused a plea deal, then sued the city, alleging that police detectives in the 42nd Precinct framed him.The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, said in a statement that her office was investigating the actions of the police and prosecutors who obtained the indictment against Mr. Hernandez; she promised to \u201cgo wherever the evidence leads.\u201dMr. Hernandez, 17, smiled as Justice Steven Barrett, who had held him in jail for a year on $250,000 bail, agreed to throw out the gun possession and assault charges against him, while a crowd of news photographers in the jury box recorded the scene. Mr. Hernandez still faces a robbery charge in an unrelated case.\u201cMy thought was just to have faith,\u201d he said outside the Bronx County Hall of Justice. \u201cI knew it was coming all along. It was just a matter of time.\u201dMr. Hernandez was accused of taking part in a September 2015 shooting outside a grocery store on 169th Street during a fight between rival street crews. A gun was fired during the confrontation. A bullet ricocheted off the sidewalk and hit a 15-year-old boy, Shaun Nardoni, in the ankle. He told investigators he did not see who shot him.During a bail hearing, a prosecutor said the state had evidence Mr. Hernandez had orchestrated the attack on Facebook and had handed a gun to the triggerman. The prosecution also alleged, without providing proof, that Mr. Hernandez had access to large amounts of cash from a check-cashing scheme, persuading Justice Barrett to set the unsually high bail.Mr. Hernandez spent 12 months in jail on Rikers Island, maintaining his innocence and refusing to take a plea bargain that would have let him avoid prison. His family hired a private investigator, Manuel Gomez, who found witnesses who said they saw another man known to them as \u201cC.J.\u201d fire a gun.Mr. Gomez, a former police officer, also unearthed evidence that two detectives from the 42nd Precinct, David Terrell and Daniel Brady, had used threats to compel at least two young men from the same neighborhood to sign false affidavits against Mr. Hernandez.On Wednesday, Ms. Clark said in a news release that prosecutors had reviewed the case. One of the original witnesses was no longer cooperating, she said, and the initial information given to the prosecutor, David A. Slott, \u201chas now proven to be inconsistent and contradictory.\u201dIn court, Julian Bond O\u2019Connor, Ms. Clark\u2019s deputy counsel went farther, telling Justice Barrett that investigators could no longer locate the original witness and thus could not prove their case.The police, however, describe Mr. Hernandez as an active member of the Hilltop Boys, a violent crew operating around East 168th Street and Boston Road in the Morrisania neighborhood. He has been arrested seven times since 2014 on felony charges, including gun possession, attempted murder and armed robbery. Most of those cases were dismissed for a lack of evidence.The unraveling of the evidence in the shooting of Mr. Nardoni has raised questions about the integrity of other cases. Ms. Clark made it clear her public integrity unit would delve into allegations that the police coerced witnesses. \u201cWe also will not tolerate misconduct by law enforcement,\u201d she said.A dozen people have filed lawsuits against Detective Terrell, an assistant field intelligence officer in the 42nd Precinct, alleging he beat them or threatened them in an effort to get them to testify to crimes they did not see.Two of them, William Stevens and Aaron Prince, have said that Detective Terrell browbeat them into signing false complaints about Mr. Hernandez. Mr. Stevens told Mr. Gomez and, later, a WNBC reporter that he also made false complaints in two dozen other cases. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond Pedro,\u201d Mr. Gomez, the private investigator, said. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dA lawyer for Detective Terrell, James A. Moschella, has said the allegations are lies, made up by people angry at being arrested. The city law department, speaking on Detective Brady\u2019s behalf, declined to comment. Mr. Slott, who has been reassigned to another bureau, has also declined to comment, a spokeswoman for the office said.Stephen P. Davis, the Police Department\u2019s chief spokesman, declined to comment on whether the Hernandez case would have ramifications for the 42nd Precinct, which has seen a surge in violent crime this year.He said that the Internal Affairs Bureau, has halted own inquiry into Detective Terrell\u2019s activities until the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office finishes its investigation. Detective Terrell has been placed on desk duty in Manhattan.Sarah Maslin Nir, Jeffery C. Mays and Al Baker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Amazon Pushes Forward With Robots, Workers Find New Roles", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLORENCE, N.J. \u2014 Nissa Scott started working at the cavernous Amazon warehouse in southern New Jersey late last year, stacking plastic bins the size of small ottomans. It was not, she says, the most stimulating activity. And lifting the bins, which often weigh 25 pounds each, was also tiring over 10-hour shifts.Now Ms. Scott, 21, watches her replacement \u2014 a giant, bright yellow mechanical arm \u2014 do the stacking.Her new job at Amazon is to babysit several robots at a time, troubleshooting them when necessary and making sure they have bins to load. On a recent afternoon, a claw at end of the arm grabbed a bin off a conveyor belt and stacked it on another bin, forming neat columns on wooden pallets surrounding the robot. It was the first time Amazon had shown the arm, the latest generation of robots in use at its warehouses, to a reporter.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most mentally challenging thing we have here,\u201d Ms. Scott said of her new job. \u201cIt\u2019s not repetitive.\u201dComplicating the equation even more, Amazon is also on the forefront of automation, finding new ways of getting robots to do the work once handled by employees. In 2014, the company began rolling out robots to its warehouses using machines originally developed by Kiva Systems, a company Amazon bought for $775 million two years earlier and renamed Amazon Robotics. Amazon now has more than 100,000 robots in action around the world, and it has plans to add many more to the mix.The robots make warehouse work less tedious and physically taxing, while also enabling the kinds of efficiency gains that let a customer order dental floss after breakfast and receive it before dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that Amazon would not be able to operate at the costs they have and the costs they provide customers without this automation,\u201d said Martin Ford, a futurist and author of \u201cRise of the Robots,\u201d a book about automation. \u201cMaybe we wouldn\u2019t be getting two-day shipping.\u201dThe dynamics between people and machines play out on a daily basis on the floor of Amazon warehouses in places like Florence, N.J., and Kent, Wash. In Kent, the robots vaguely resemble giant beetles and scurry around with vertical shelves loaded with merchandise weighing up to 3,000 pounds on their backs. Hundreds of them move autonomously inside a large caged area, tailgating each other but not colliding.On one edge of the cage, a group of human workers \u2014 the \u201cstowers\u201d \u2014 stuff products onto the shelves, replenishing their inventory. The robots whisk those shelves away and when a customer order arrives for products stored on their backs, they queue up at stations on another edge of the cage like cars waiting to go through a toll both.There, human \u201cpickers\u201d follow instructions on computer screens, grabbing items off the shelves and putting them in plastic bins, which then disappear on conveyor belts destined for \u201cpackers,\u201d people who put the products in cardboard boxes bound for customers.Dave Clark, the top executive in charge of operations at Amazon, said the company wanted the machines to perform the most monotonous tasks, leaving people to do jobs that engage them mentally.\"It\u2019s a new item each time,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cYou\u2019re finding something, you\u2019re inspecting things, you\u2019re engaging your mind in a way that I think is important.\"The robots also cut down on the walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less tired. The robots also allow Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic, because they no longer need aisle space for humans. The greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers.The Amazon warehouse in Florence shows the latest example of the kinds of jobs machines can do better than people. Eight mechanical arms are in operation at the facility, a warehouse where large quantities of merchandise are broken down into smaller units and distributed to Amazon fulfillment centers across the country.Amazon began installing them late last year, not long after it opened the warehouse in Florence. The robot arm is configured to pick up only bins of a standard size, not objects of other dimensions. In a demonstration of future possibilities, Amazon showed a virtual reality simulation used to prototype new robot concepts, including an arm with a forklift attachment that moved pallets.When Amazon installed the robots, some people who had stacked bins before, like Ms. Scott, took courses at the company to become robot operators. Many others moved to receiving stations, where they manually sort big boxes of merchandise into bins. No people were laid off when the robots were installed, and Amazon found new roles for the displaced workers, Mr. Clark said.\u201cThe people didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said.The question going forward is: What happens when the future generations of robots arrive?Mr. Ford, the author, believes it is just a matter of time before the employment picture in Amazon\u2019s warehouses changes.\u201cMy assumption is this technology will eventually displace a lot of people in those warehouses,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cI would not say that overnight huge numbers of jobs disappear. Maybe the first indication is they don\u2019t get rid of those people but the pace of job creation slows down.\u201dAmazon\u2019s Mr. Clark said history showed that automation increases productivity and, in some cases, demand from consumers, which ultimately creates more jobs. He said warehouse workers would continue to work in technologically rich environments.\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that automation destroys net job growth,\u201d he said.In the case of the Florence facility, it opened up the new opportunity for Ms. Scott.At one point, one of the arms knocked over a tote, sending a dozen or so cone-shaped plastic coffee filters skidding across the ground. Ms. Scott hit a button that froze the arm so she could safely pick up the mess.Then the arms started working again.\u201cThe robot will work the same all day long,\u201d said Edward Cohoon, who supervises Ms. Scott and other Amazon workers as they tend to individual robots. \u201cTheir stomachs don\u2019t grumble.\u201dEarlier versions of the captions for the pictures of a robotic arm in Florence, N.J., and human \u201cpickers\u201d were reversed.Follow Nick Wingfield on Twitter @nickwingfield.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Israeli Chef Looks to the Landscape", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMATTAT, Israel \u2014 The winding path to the chef Erez Komarovsky\u2019s home, overlooking a village here in the Upper Galilee in Israel, is lined with a wild mix of pomegranate and olive trees, fennel and chickpea plants. It is fragrant with lemon, quince or apple blossoms, depending on the season.There, in a stone house about a quarter-mile from the Lebanese border, Mr. Komarovsky, 55, tinkers with his latest culinary creations: a whole-eggplant dish roasted in his pizza oven, or a free-form babka with quince plucked from his garden. This summer, it was a festive torte of tiny fresh grape leaves encasing lamb and rice, topped with a pomegranate-fennel relish; the dish is just as good with Swiss chard in the fall.Until the early 1990s, Israeli chefs were still looking to Europe for inspiration for their restaurants. Mr. Komarovsky was instrumental in changing that, incorporating techniques he learned abroad into local recipes at his Lehem Erez bakery-cafe in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv. In doing so, he influenced the next generation of chefs \u2014 like Meir Adoni, who opened Nur restaurant in New York this year \u2014 to look with pride to their own ethnic culinary backgrounds.\u201cErez is the prophet of new Israeli cuisine,\u201d said Janna Gur, the editor of Al Hashulchan, a popular food magazine in Israel. \u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t know him. But he is so connected to the seasons, to the produce, to the local gastronomy. This is what Israeli food is all about.\u201dThese days, Mr. Komarovsky is concentrating on the cooking of the Upper Galilee, incorporating Lebanese, Druse (a religious and ethnic group in the region) and hyperlocal ingredients into his recipes.Mr. Komarovsky, whose parents are of Ukrainian and Polish heritage, has always loved the food and people of his native Israel. He grew up in Tel Aviv, accompanying his grandmother on her weekly outings to the Carmel market, and hanging around his Egyptian neighbor\u2019s kitchen \u2014 an experience that led him to develop a taste for ingredients like okra, eggplant and cardamom.He also spent summers as a child at his father\u2019s orchard in the Negev in southern Israel. At the almond harvest, he watched Druse farm workers and their families making mansaf, a baked dish of lamb, yogurt and rice or bulgur, using lamb they raised.\u201cFrom them, I studied how to eat with my hands,\u201d Mr. Komarovsky said.After military service, he traveled abroad. In Paris, he studied to be a chef at the Cordon Bleu; in Berkeley, Calif., he made sourdough and other artisanal breads at the Metropolis Baking Company and Acme Bread; in Gifu, Japan, he studied kaiseki cuisine.In 1994, yearning for his homeland, he returned to Tel Aviv, and opened Lehem Erez in 1996. One bakery grew into 30, and, in 2010, he sold his business and moved to Mattat with his partner, Michael Gluzman, a professor of literature at Tel Aviv University.\u201cLehem Erez became too big, too complicated for me,\u201d Mr. Komarovsky said. \u201cI needed to get in touch with my desires again.\u201dNow, he is gathering wild foods alongside his Druse, Arab and Jewish neighbors, and he is immersed in the land, working in and cooking from his vast garden. He\u2019s planning a Rosh Hashana harvest meal with this flavorful, colorful and seasonal lamb and rice torte, so traditional in the fall, to be followed by a cake with figs picked from his own trees.Mr. Komarovsky may have left his thriving bakery business, but he remains extremely busy. He cooks for groups from abroad in his kitchen, and travels to Tel Aviv to cater huge Israeli weddings. He also consults and writes cookbooks that share his philosophy about cooking from the land.\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to develop an Israeli cuisine,\u201d he said as he picked some fresh chickpeas. \u201cI came back to Israel to develop a local cuisine.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

The cleat-clad crew then took to the ice \u2014 their steps sounding similar to tap dancers on a wooden stage \u2014 and with a wand hose in hand they crisscrossed the surface, from Seventh to Eighth Avenue and back again, spraying a thin layer of water around the rink.After a few days of spraying \u2014 and listening to a good amount of Marc Anthony to keep things interesting \u2014 the team had crossed the ice hundreds of times, traveling nearly 15 miles, to create a one-inch-thick sheet of ice.Not quite.\u201cThink of it as a big refrigerator,\u201d Mr. Durkin said. He and the ice crew will lay large \u201cinsulation boards\u201d across the ice, lock them into place and leave them there to keep the ice, well, icy, during Knicks games and Paul McCartney gigs in the coming weeks.Once hockey season starts, a group of night owls working the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift at the Garden will be responsible for transforming the arena from a basketball court or rock concert stage back into home ice of the Rangers, all in a matter of only eight hours.Sounds tough. But during hockey season, \u201cthat day-to-day is easy,\u201d Mr. Durkin said. \u201cDefinitely easier than making the ice; this is the biggest thing that we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The ride-hailing company, which not long ago was valued at nearly $70 billion, has pushed aggressively into one market after another.In London, watchdogs are now pushing back, and the Silicon Valley invader is finally seeking permission to continue operating, rather than asking for after-the-fact forgiveness for breaking rules.Aside from valuing the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of the service, some Uber users fear that Transport for London\u2019s decision suggests that London isn\u2019t as open for business as it likes to appear, especially with the so-called Brexit looming. Yet officials elsewhere have shown themselves even less accommodating. Uber executives were arrested in France, for example.

But the young company has a record of doing whatever suits it best and only answering questions later. Transport for London is right to take doubts about customers\u2019 safety and security seriously, and to consider questions about software that could hamper effective regulation.As Uber tries to turn its dramatic market-share success into something profitable, the company needs more of that kind of approach.

{"Headline": "How to Jump-Start Your Career", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "Advertisement\n            \nAdam Bryant has conducted hundreds of interviews with C.E.O.s about leadership for the Corner Office series he created. He is also the editorial director of live journalism at the Times.\n          I've been working as an administrative assistant for about three years now, and I would like to change my role to marketing or event coordination. How would I ask my company if there is a way to do that within the company?There are probably official channels through your company\u2019s H.R. department that you should explore, but you should also start doing some reporting through unofficial channels to learn about how the various departments operate. Is there a colleague you could reach out to for a coffee to learn more about how those units work and whether there are any openings (or ones coming up)?  If you want to start looking for this type of job outside your company, don\u2019t box yourself in and apply only for jobs that already match your experience. Everybody has to get experience at some point. You just need to convince somebody to bet on you, and you\u2019ll do that best by showing authentic and passionate interest in what they do, with a real focus on what you can do for them, rather than what they can do for you.My husband is in a job that he dreads. His confidence has taken a hit, too. What are the best things he can do to network and job search when self-esteem, energy and will are at a low?My sympathies. Doing work you dread is hard on your soul, and how you feel starts coloring everything else in your life. You can feel trapped and demotivated. Job-hunting reminds me of that expression about running: The first step is the hardest. Your husband just needs to go for a low-stakes, easy win: like a lunch meeting or two with people he already knows, with a focus on new avenues rather than dead ends. He needs a spark, a glimmer of possibility, and that will come through human connections, and will improve his view on the world. Once you start, it gets easier and the momentum builds.My contract with a company in the textile industry is three years long, but I would like to jump into the food and beverage industry after this. What's your suggestion? I have three years as a sales and accounting coordinator. What would be the best way to enter a new industry without any related experience?All that requires knowing people in that industry. You can read articles (and you should), but there is no substitute for friends, allies and acquaintances who are in the business. They can tell you where the opportunities are, and how to position yourself so there is a logical narrative for your background and why it would make sense in their industry.I'm in consulting but it doesn't feel like I'm learning actual skills. I want to eventually go to business school and work in business development and strategy. What should I be doing to set myself on this path?What's the best way to market myself and my 'transferable skills' when trying to leave a niche field within the nonprofit, cultural world?Is there a specific kind of job you want to move into? If so, you need to take a blank sheet of paper (I know, I know. I\u2019m old school, but some work is best done away from a screen.) and start breaking down the underlying skills and work in your current job, and how those can be applied in the new job. It\u2019s like you\u2019re building an argument, but you have to be able to back up the argument with specifics. \u201cThis is what I did, this was the result.\u201d A lot of people prefer to be around Tiggers.How do you know it's time to move on to a next job? Do you make a parallel move to re-energize?If you\u2019ve done your current job well, contributed to the team and learned a lot from it, and you\u2019re feeling like you want to shed your skin and do something new, then it\u2019s time to start looking. Last piece of advice on this: It\u2019s always better to run to something (an exciting new opportunity) rather than just doing anything to escape a job you don\u2019t like.I have been a stay-at-home mother out of the \"workforce\" since 1994. During this time I have been the most underpaid employee, with the greatest benefits. I morphed from a woman running a $17-million cosmetics business into a mother who multitasks 24/7. I've run benefits, championed fundraisers and built an impressive resume, albeit not for a major corporation. Most importantly, I know what my passion is. How would you dive back in?Seems like the easiest transition would be to build on all the work you\u2019ve done with fundraisers and benefits. Those are marketable skills, and a lot of jobs require those talents. It sounds like you\u2019re the kind of person who can make things happen and move the needle in whatever you do! I think you could make a compelling case to an employer. Plus, not everyone has run a $17 million business before.How do you find a balance between a job that inspires, and one that pays the bills?No judgments either way! But you have to know yourself.Is there a different line of work you really want to move into? Any career transition requires some sacrifices and extra work. It\u2019s part of a larger conversation we all have to have with ourselves from time to time: What do I really want, and why? Those are big questions, but always worth wrestling with.I've always wanted to go back to graduate school but my current job is going well. How will I know it's the right time to go back to school?I would pause before going to graduate school at this point, based on what you\u2019ve shared. If your current job is going well, and you\u2019re learning and growing and feel like there is runway in front of you, do you need to give that up?I've been at my job for almost three years. I enjoy the work I do and find that my work is meaningful. But I can't help but wonder where all this is leading to. How do I figure out a broader vision for my life and work toward it?I think a lot of people hit a similar point in their careers, sometimes more than once. The only answer is deep, serious and extended reflection, maybe with a blank sheet of paper or two (no screens!). You can\u2019t realize your goal if it\u2019s not defined. It sounds so simple but it\u2019s true. So the most important piece of advice I can give folks who are coming out of school, even people who\u2019ve already begun their career, is to know what it is they ultimately want to accomplish. And if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but start thinking about what it is, because once you know it, the moment you know it, you begin manifesting it. You manifest it in explicit ways by virtue of knowing and then pursuing it, and you manifest it in implicit ways \u2014 just in the way you talk, in the way you think and the things that you say to others and the people you attract to yourself.And if you don\u2019t know the answer to the broader question, my advice is to optimize for two things: passion and skill, not one at the exclusion of the other. You have to optimize for both.I am an introvert and I feel like I am skipped over for management positions. What can an introvert do to make opportunities?My boss, who is a charismatic, bright and experienced professional, is running his department ragged. Everyone on his team is exhausted because he says yes to every request. What exacerbates the situation: All the meetings we have do not leave much time for \u201creal work.\u201d How do I tell him to slow down?Right now, it sounds like everything is equally urgent, and maybe all the meetings are kind of providing cover for the fact that there is not a clear plan for delivering the results people need. Maybe you can even take a light-hearted approach: \u201cCan we have a meeting about our meetings?\u201d As long as you focus all your feedback on how to help him win better, rather than what he\u2019s doing wrong, he should be more open to the feedback.I have started a new position as a V.P. with a company I consulted with for a few years. I have five people on my team. I have always been a collaborative, successful colleague but am failing as a leader. What can I do to be a better leader, build consensus and inspire them to believe in the work and what we're trying to accomplish?Feels like it\u2019s time for an offsite, whether it\u2019s a literal or metaphorical one. Tell the team you feel it\u2019s time for a reboot, and ideally get people out of the office for a distraction-free and honest discussion. Ask them to come prepared to share some ideas so that you don\u2019t have to worry about awkward silences when you start asking for opinions. Some suggested questions to start the discussion: What are three things that are working well, and three things that are not? What\u2019s slowing our momentum? How can you, as their leader, help them more? What three things are frustrating them the most, and what are their suggestions for fixing them?I work at a fairly large company. What's the best way to meet people outside of my team or department and expand my network?The best tip: Can you find people in your company, maybe through a LinkedIn search, who went to the same school as you? Or grew up in, or were born in, the same city? Or maybe you both worked at the same company early on in your career, long before moving to your current employer?I'm in my mid-20s and have worked primarily at the same small company since I started my career. I love my job and don't want to move, however, how am I supposed to know if my yearly salary, increases and raises are on par with other companies in my field and across the industry?You can probably learn a lot from a deep internet search about salaries for comparable jobs at other companies. But there is also the simple reality that if people don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to leave, sometimes you will feel taken for granted. And that might be reflected in your paycheck. That might not be right. And it may not be fair. But it\u2019s also how much of the world works. Since finishing my master's degree, I have jumped around from job to job, staying at each job for at most one year. How do I find my ideal job and jump start my career without job hopping?The job hopping would be seem to be a symptom of the fact that you haven\u2019t found your ideal job. I\u2019m not sure what that job is, but I would caution against using that phrase, even as you think to yourself about the jobs you\u2019ve done and the job you want. Are you setting too high a bar? The grass-is-always-greener phenomenon is very real, and it\u2019s easy to think everything will be better elsewhere. And maybe it will be. (Again, I don\u2019t know your circumstances.)I graduated in June 2016 with a Bachelor in Business Administration, and I have been working on digital marketing and Google Adwords. Now I want to go back to recruitment (where I did my first internship) but it seems hard to get my CV noticed by recruiters, because of lack of experience. What do I do?I have just graduated college with an engineering degree. What is the best way for me to get started on a great career path?I am 20 years old and currently finishing my undergraduate degree. What are the best ways to stand out to employers among other graduates just coming out of college?I've heard conflicting advice whether to reveal my current salary when asked. How should I answer such question when asked during an interview?Sandy, the reason you\u2019ve heard conflicting advice is that, well, there is always a danger in a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach. If you\u2019re making good money in your current job and want to set the bar at a decent minimum for any discussions, I think it makes sense to go first and say, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m making now.\u201d Implicit in that is that you expect a premium above what you\u2019re making to switch jobs.If you think you\u2019d be coming in at the low end, it can be smart to ask them what they typically pay for someone in that role. From that point on, the negotiation will depend on the leverage of each side. It\u2019s also up to you how hard you want to negotiate. As long as you can build a clear and factual case for why you deserve X, that\u2019s a fine conversation to have. Any work you can do ahead of time to get a sense of what the company pays is also useful for such discussions. The final point is about your temperament. I\u2019ve seen some people negotiate so hard that it adds a real sour note to the start of a working relationship.I go to a lot of interviews, the interviewers like my resume, but I'm not called to work, what am I doing wrong?Employers want to know that you really want to work at their company, rather than just land a job.This may sound obvious but you\u2019d be shocked at how few people do this basic work ahead of time. Hope that helps.Tell me how a resume with gaps between jobs can still get noticed and interviewed?I'm a freelancer and got a full-time job that was great on paper but I quit after three months. I did a lot of great work in that time but left for health reasons. Should I keep it on my resume?I would throw it back to you with a question: How much do you need it on your resume? If it\u2019s important to include it to show you have that experience, and it\u2019s worth including even if you have to go into the explanation of why you left, then sure. But if it\u2019s just another example of the kind of work you\u2019ve done in other jobs, then maybe it\u2019s not worth it? I can\u2019t really answer this for you, but those are some considerations as you\u2019re thinking through this.I left a previous job. Now that boss is giving me bad references. How do I handle that without sinking down to his level?If it\u2019s inevitable that any prospective employer is going to call your previous boss, then you need to bring it up at the right moment and tell people up front what they\u2019re going to hear when they call that previous boss. Just be matter of fact about it, and make your case. \u201cThis is why we had problems working together. This is what I tried to do to fix it. Here\u2019s my take on why it didn\u2019t work. And if you call these other references, you\u2019ll discover that he\u2019s an outlier among all the opinions about me.\u201d I struggle with interviews. What are some tips to make sure my interviews go well?One of the most important questions to prepare for is when the interviewer asks you: \u201cWhat questions do have for me?\u201d This is your chance to shine. Do your homework on the company and its culture, and ask really incisive questions. And learn as much as you can about the person who\u2019s going to be interviewing you. Between LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, you can quickly get a sense of someone\u2019s background and interests. That will help you connect with them at a human level. What is the best approach for a qualified, but older, experienced worker to stand out amongst the coveted more recent grads when interviewing for a job?I was treated poorly in my last job even though my work was exceptional, so I resigned. Now organizations I'm interviewing with focus why I left my previous job. I've always read that you should never say anything negative about your former employer, so I haven't. Yet I've now been passed over for two jobs that I should easily have gotten. Any advice?Be wary of any advice that includes the words \u201cnever\u201d or \u201calways.\u201d If you feel it\u2019s an ongoing issue in your job search, you should probably start addressing it head on in your interviews (at the right moment, of course). It\u2019s all about positioning and attitude. If you can tell a simple and credible story about what happened, and talk about what you learned from the experience and how you can apply those insights in future roles, then you should be fine. Many interviewers (dare I say \u201cmost?\u201d) appreciate somebody who is honest and not trying to present a gleaming, polished facade. Just own the problem and minimize the finger-pointing, talk about what you learned from it and what you\u2019d do differently given a do-over, and people should respond well. Part of being trustworthy is showing vulnerability.Before changing careers, experts say, ask yourself some basic questions. For example, are your current skills obsolete, or will they soon be back in demand?Leaving a dispiriting career to pursue a passion carries risks as well as opportunities for rewards.New evidence shows that a mix of skills, especially technology skills, counts more than simply long experience in one specialty.May 19Sept. 26October 4Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Giants Face New Political Resistance in Washington", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.\u201cThere is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.\u201cWe are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\u201d said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview. \u201cThe growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\u201dPerhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\u201d Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement.Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook\u2019s discussions with the lawmakers were private.\u201cWe strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.\u201cSilicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \u201cBut selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\u201dOther issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.Even Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Anthem Protests, N.F.L. Plots a Careful Path Forward", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs they do so, they are weighing the players\u2019 desire to rebuff criticism from President Trump and to kneel or lock arms during the national anthem to raise awareness of social injustice, while accommodating fans who would prefer football to just be about football.The issue has pushed the N.F.L. into an unusual dilemma of balancing respect for the wishes of its players, who often are critical of the owners on issues of health and labor agreements, while taking into account some signs of a backlash among many fans.It is clear from interviews with N.F.L. officials and more than a dozen teams that owners and team executives would prefer that the protests end, both for personal reasons and because it risks inflaming the president, who has been a friend and ally of many of the owners, and alienating fans and sponsors. But they are also wary of appearing heavy handed and upsetting the image of unity that the league sought to project last weekend.What has emerged in meetings across the league this week \u2014 from locker rooms to N.F.L. headquarters \u2014 is a strategy of not pushing back at an unpredictable president. Instead, the players, with input from team officials, are seeking to shape a message that shows their desire to stand together while still addressing the original intent of the protests: raising awareness of police brutality against African Americans and racism in general.\u201cThe players have a right to speak their minds, but on the other hand, it can make it difficult because there isn\u2019t anyone in America who doesn\u2019t want to honor America,\u201d Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons, said in an interview. \u201cYou talk to other owners and the commissioner, they feel the same way, they support the players.\u201dBut in a league with 32 teams, 2,000 players and a wide range of political views in the locker room and owners\u2019 suites, finding consensus has been difficult as myriad conversations have taken place throughout the league.The league is also monitoring fan reaction, especially on social media, where videos have surfaced showing people burning N.F.L. jerseys. Nearly every team has been fielding hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of calls from fans, most of them opposed to the protests. Some have even turned in their season tickets.\u201cWe understand there is anger out there,\u201d Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, said. \u201cWe understand some of it is based on political agendas, but some of our fans\u2019 anger is based on their own principles. We get that and we understand that.\u201dIn some ways, the N.F.L. can afford to wait and see what happens. With tens of millions of viewers each week watching games on networks that have long-term, multibillion dollar rights deals with the N.F.L., sponsors are hesitant to cut ties over a single issue, even one this volatile. On average, about 70 percent of a team\u2019s revenue comes from these television and sponsorship deals, which ensures that every team turns a profit.Though Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys owner, spoke to the president, league executives said they have not reached out to the White House. For days, Lockhart, the league spokesman, has not responded directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, though on Thursday he did call the president\u2019s statement that the owners were afraid of their players \u201cinaccurate.\u201d One league adviser compared the N.F.L.\u2019s approach to the strategy of letting a boxer punch himself out.\u201cWhen he thinks he\u2019s winning, he doubles down and doubles down, and there are very few entities that have the skill, desire and thick skin to take it,\u201d the advisor, who was not authorized to speak for the league, said of the president. \u201cSo it\u2019s a war of attrition.\u201dThe league and its owners are also afraid that fighting the president will distract their players, who are already spending hours discussing how or whether to protest, from preparing for games or working out.\u201cWhile we feel like we\u2019re a political sideshow, we still have to win football games,\u201d one team adviser said.Then there are the Seattle Seahawks, in their own category. More than any other team, they have been at the vanguard of social activism, with three of their best players \u2014 Doug Baldwin, Michael Bennett and Richard Sherman \u2014 using their platforms to condemn racial injustice and police brutality.After vigorous and emotional debate last Saturday, the Seahawks resolved to stay in their locker room while the anthem was played before their game the next day at Tennessee. Not wanting to be left on the field alone, the Titans also stayed inside.\u201cI was just driving and I saw protesters, and for me, it was like, it could be dangerous to walk in front of people because you never know what people are thinking,\u201d Bennett said Thursday. \u201cFor me, you just have to believe that people are good.\u201dIf the intent last week was to make a statement \u2014 to show that they would not be bullied by President Trump, as Sherman said \u2014 then the Seahawks this week are grappling with how to proceed Sunday, when they play the Indianapolis Colts at CenturyLink Field in Seattle. Baldwin said they have had brief conversations this week in the locker room but have yet to discuss the matter as a team. Their coach, Pete Carroll, said he was confident in his players\u2019 ability to compartmentalize, but there is still plenty of time before kickoff to continue debating.\u201cThere\u2019s still more to unpack,\u201d Baldwin said in an interview at Seahawks headquarters. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s easier for us because we\u2019ve had practice at unpacking those things and maybe the conversations would go more smoothly. It\u2019s to be seen.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the time of the pregame in which a group of Bears players kneeled in the end zone. It was before the national anthem, not during the national anthem.Ben Shpigel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Now, 20 years later, Mike Wallace has finished Volume II. And he\u2019s still not done.Supported byIn 1998, an unlikely tome by two academics became the most popular narrative of New York. The 4.7-pound, 1,424-page doorstop that focused on the city\u2019s first three centuries won the Pulitzer Prize and was instantly hailed as a definitive history.Now, nearly two decades later, the second installment has arrived, a 4.6-pound sequel written this time without a collaborator. Producing both books (plus teaching and other projects) might have left another 75-year-old historian sapped and hoping for more laurels on which to rest. Instead, Mike Wallace is poised to complete Volumes III and IV.The endpapers of his \u201cGreater Gotham,\u201d which is being published Oct. 2, epitomize the conflicts that transformed New York City during the first two decades of the 20th Century.Inside the front cover of Mike Wallace\u2019s magisterial sequel to the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cGotham\u201d is a signature pink-and-mustard Sanborn Insurance Co. map of Lower Manhattan with Wall Street at its core. Inside the back cover is another building-by-building survey, this one of the Lower East Side, then the densest place on the planet.Sandwiched between the Sanborn maps are 1,196 pages that bristle with a gripping narrative of the competing agendas that defined the two neighborhoods and reverberated from the 19th century to the 20th. \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d traces the historic conflicts amplified by two developments.First, the mania to curb destructive competition through consolidation, both in corporate America through trusts and monopolies and in government. While Europe was Balkanizing, the city fathers were amalgamating what become the five boroughs into Greater New York. Second, the specter of the First World War was emerging. Debates over immigration and Americanization magnified the perpetual predicament of a wealthy elite symbolized by Wall Street: how to mitigate class conflict to maintain order over a more and more diverse population now sprawling on the newly opened subways.Exploring the roots and ramification of both trends, \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d elaborates on the message that Professor Wallace, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and Edwin G. Burrows of Brooklyn College, an expert on the colonial period, conveyed in \u201cGotham\u201d: That current events, indeed, occur as part of a current, an ongoing momentum, and that you cannot understand New York today without appreciating the city\u2019s history from a global perspective.Professor Wallace was born in Queens to a bandleader father, spent his early childhood in San Francisco and then returned to New York City and Nassau County as a teenager.As a graduate student at Columbia, his exposure to the 1968 strikes against the university\u2019s administration and the war in Vietnam transformed him into a radical historian, determined to look beyond the conventional Anglo male version of events.Even as a radical student of history, a half-century later, at 75, he is rather old-fashioned in some ways. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 proudly proclaims \u201cNo Twitter, No Facebook, No Webpage.\u201d (He does use email.)\u201cGotham,\u201d which embraced nearly three centuries of history, was published in 1998 on the centennial of the city\u2019s consolidation, after 20 years of work.Since then, Professor Wallace consulted on Ric Burns\u2019s \u201cNew York: A Documentary Film\u201d and established the Gotham Center for New York City History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.Now, 20 years after the first volume, \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d encompasses the booms and busts from 1898 until the end of World War I.Nestled in the front parlor of the cozy townhouse in which he lives with his wife, the novelist Carmen Boullosa, on the border of Park Slope, Brooklyn, Professor Wallace ruminated the other day about \u201cGreater Gotham.\u201dYou said that \u201cGotham\u201d and \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d originated back in the mid-1970s. What was their genesis?In the 1960s, the official mainstream narrative had a pretty benign view of America\u2019s presence in the world. We were in the middle of a historiographical revolution, which was happening in tandem with social movements in the streets by blacks and other groups who wanted to be included in the historical narrative. We were not simply inserting blacks, but repeopling the national perspective. Once you have blacks in the picture, you have racism in the picture. Then, you have women \u2014 oops, we left out half the population.My generation began collectively rewriting the official narrative, but our impact on popular understanding was limited. There was no accessible narrative, one that pulled together all the new research into one coherent overview.How did that get you to \u201cGotham\u201d?Working with Ted Burroughs on a history of American capitalism, we had written hundreds of pages, but had barely gotten out of the 17th century. That\u2019s when we decided to make it more manageable and tell the story through New York City.How did you divide the volumes chronologically?\u201cGotham\u201d ended in 1898 if for no other reason than because we had surpassed the limits of bindery technology. Ted delivered his part, and I just kept going garrulously. \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d was going to go to 1945, to get through the war and reflect the kind of rhythm that repeats itself, boom bust, boom bust, and the busts are often ended by war. This one covers the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1890s to the end of World War I instead.Was that because those two decades were so transformative?We entered that war a massive industrial power, but second ranked in terms of finance and trade and as a debtor nation to Europe. Then they started killing each other, and there was this roar of demand for guns and this whole panoply of modern industrial war, and they ran out of money. They sold off their 60 years of holdings in American companies, and then they began borrowing. Britain ends the war still having the empire and the navy, but the United States ends as a creditor country. And New York is poised to become the capital of the capitalist world.You wrote \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d without a collaborator. What was the biggest difference about writing so big a book solo?For one thing there was no one to call at 2 in the morning to say I figured something out.What\u2019s striking about both books is that the same themes recur.There are things that are built into the historical structure. It still happens, and it\u2019s almost unnervingly repetitious. You can predict that every 20 years the economy will fall apart: the minks come out of the closet, and then comes collapse, unemployment, homelessness, in some instances political movements demanding federal intervention to support people who are down on their luck. But even in that rhythm, in that oscillation of the economy, things change. In the 1830s, people who were out of work were lazy. By the 1890s depression, it was patently clear that people were being pitched into joblessness through no fault of their own.Why did the five boroughs merge into Greater New York?One of the fundamental structural transformations that takes place in this period was the emphasis on consolidation and hatred of competition. For all the big bankers and corporate executives\u2019 putative love of free markets, real capitalists of that era thought competition is lunatic. They have to cut wages, which leads to unionism, which has to be repressed, which leads to socialism. This is an argument that is posed not just as economic, but as morally superior. If you impose order, you\u2019ll eliminate disorder. It\u2019s an advance in civilization. The big bankers and corporate executives consider themselves progressives. And they were instrumental in applying the consolidationalist ethos above all to the city.Has there been any change in the ambivalence with which the rest of the country viewed New York? There\u2019s tremendous hostility then because it\u2019s considered to be not really American, it\u2019s full of the wrong kind of people, who are resisting moral imperatives. On the other hand is this glittering attractiveness. I argue that by the end of this period, New York has really become, love it or not, the unofficial capital of the country with street names fulfilling national enterprises: Wall Street is finance, Madison Avenue is advertising, Broadway is theater, the Bowery is poverty.Isn\u2019t another theme, though, about an elite seeking to establish control over an increasingly diverse population?The Anglo-Protestant community in New York, which encompasses the upper echelons of the economic order, was definitely in favor of the British side of the war. And they had to confront the fact that the vast majority of New Yorkers were either Germans who were not disposed to war against Germany, or Irish not disposed to do anything positive for Britain, or Jews not disposed to support a Czarist regime busily massacring their colleagues, or a black population, which was divided.There\u2019s something special about New York; it becomes a cosmopolitan place. The ethnic enclaves in the city are a spectacular development. But they ran up against the grain of the Americanizers, who are saying that you have to pour everyone into the same mold, which is really an Anglo mold and pretending it\u2019s American. And cultural conservatives open up a new front, which is biological, eugenics: not only were we here first, but that we\u2019re a superior breed.By the end of this period something big has happened: Harlem has become a stronghold. The notion of whites invading Harlem and attempting to burn down churches, which they did in the old days, is preposterous and never more so than after the war.Is your book a radical history?Usually, when you\u2019re thinking radical, you\u2019re thinking history from the bottom up. It\u2019s usually seen as a counterbalance to the relentless focus on power and whiteness. But I did my theory work decades ago. From here on in, it\u2019s letting the theory inform, not guide, not dictate. It\u2019s a sensitivity to questions. And one of the questions is, class isn\u2019t the structure, class is something that happens. I don\u2019t think you can do history and call it history and call it radical if you only look at radicals, the downtrodden trodding up.You need the interaction, you need to understand the appeal of a system, not just that people are bamboozled into behavior that doesn\u2019t work for them, the same way that New York is appealing and appalling to the rest of country, between black and white, haves and have-nots.Novelists do this better because academics tend to dig tunnels in particular directions, but real life doesn\u2019t work like that. Real life happens all at once.Did anything you learned change your mind?That\u2019s a toughie. No, I don\u2019t think so. I had written a 200-page outline down to the 1980s, and that process helped clarify for me the historical forces which have been repetitively operative. There were endless specific instances where things turned out to be more complicated, but to the degree that I\u2019ve been able to allow for complexity, I try to incorporate that into the story and convey it as a narrative. I\u2019m sure this is a matter of provincial New Yorkism, but it\u2019s hard to think of a place on the planet that has evolved into such a complex social organism, with the constellation of cultures, the tremendous disparity of wealth, Wall Street\u2019s efforts to finance what it can\u2019t officially control, and \u2014 this is an issue not to moralize but to understand \u2014 well, it seemed like New York deserved to have its story told in a way that honored its complexity.Does your research make you more or less optimistic about the city\u2019s future?It\u2019s very tricky for a historian. You can get a swelled head and think you know so much about the past, you know about the present, that you can predict the future. If your reference is slavery, it\u2019s hard not to see improvement. If you insert yourself back in 1909 and the debates of the day, you\u2019d be appalled by the cultural assumptions and the arrogance of the people at the top. The disparities are enormous. I tend to think there has been a grindingly slow improvement on a variety of scores, but I also believe that history can go backward.\u201cGreater Gotham\u201d took 20 years and covers two decades. Does that mean, at that rate, the next volume won\u2019t be published until 2042?When \u201cGotham\u201d came out it, a considerable amount of work had been done on the next period. In fact, there\u2019s a fair amount of stuff that\u2019s already been written down to 1945. A lot of what will now be Volume III is done. While it looks like we went into micro-detail and went at a molasses pace, that is a little misleading.Will there be a Volume IV?This depends on sufficient longevity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Floating Tar, Dead Fish: Oil Spill Threatens Greek Beaches", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Greek authorities scrambled on Thursday to clean up fuel leaked by an oil tanker that sank near Athens, putting popular beaches off limits to swimmers and raising fears of environmental damage.The Agia Zoni II, a 45-year-old oil tanker, sank early Sunday morning near the island of Salamis, about seven miles from the country\u2019s main port, Piraeus. It was carrying more than 2,500 metric tons of fuel oil and marine gas oil.Though the leak was initially thought to be contained to the area of the shipwreck, it soon expanded to the coastline area known as the Athens Riviera.Evaggelia Simou, a resident of Salamina, on the island, denounced the authorities for not tackling the oil spill more quickly and fully.\u201cWe drove by the Selinia beach on Sunday night, and were alarmed because of the suffocating smell of oil,\u201d Ms. Simou said in a Facebook chat.When she and her husband went to the beach, they were shocked to see that a thick coat of oil had blackened the water. \u201cHuge pieces of floating tar were burdening the waves, dead fish floated on the surface,\u201d Ms. Simou said. They were surprised to see no cleanup workers, she said.Ms. Simou returned to the beach on Monday morning, along with her son, and was stunned to see no sign of an active cleanup, more than 24 hours after the shipwreck.Thick, black masses of oil had reached the beaches around Glyfada, a high-end seaside community south of Athens, by Wednesday afternoon.\u201cThe vessel sank on Sunday. How is it possible that the leak reached Glyfada from Salamina?\u201d Mr. Papanikolaou asked in a phone interview. \u201cAnd how is it possible that we only heard about it on Wednesday?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tragic that it happened now, after all four beaches have gotten so beautiful,\u201d Tima Vlasto, 51, an American who has lived in Glyfada for six years, said in a phone interview. \u201cSeeing this makes you want to leave. If I can\u2019t swim here, what\u2019s the point of living in Glyfada?\u201dMr. Papanikolaou said that emotions were running high in his community. \u201cWe\u2019re angry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a shame that all this hard work can be destroyed in a split second.\u201dSome ecologists have called the oil spill an environmental disaster, with immediate and potential long-term effects.One photo circulating on the internet showed a kingfisher drenched in black oil. The bird tried to feed itself by fishing in the polluted waters, but quickly died because of the oil, according to Konstantina Ntemiri, an officer of the Hellenic Ornithological Society.The full extent of the pollution and its effects are not yet clear; areas like uninhabited rocky islets are also thought to be affected.After touring the affected areas in a Coast Guard vessel, Mr. Kouroumplis said that there had been \u201csignificant improvement\u201d and that \u201cin just a few days this affair will have been forgotten.\u201dThat view is not shared by Themis Labridis, 33, a filmmaker whose family home is in Palaio Faliro, between Piraeus and Glyfada.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t sleep because of the smell,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe sea is like a dirty lagoon, a swamp of oil.\u201dOn Thursday, he went with a friend to nearby Alimos beach, where they met another volunteer and used buckets to remove big pieces of black tar from the water.They also gathered blackened stones from the shore. No authorities were around to stop \u2014 or help \u2014 them. \u201cWho is going to clean the beaches of each and every polluted stone?\u201d Mr. Labridis asked.The cause of the shipwreck remains unclear.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Moves to End DACA and Calls on Congress to Act", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday ordered an end to the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, calling it an \u201camnesty-first approach\u201d and urging Congress to pass a replacement before he begins phasing out its protections in six months.As early as March, officials said, some of the 800,000 young adults brought to the United States illegally as children who qualify for the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, will become eligible for deportation. The five-year-old policy allows them to remain without fear of immediate removal from the country and gives them the right to work legally.Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who announced the change at the Justice Department, both used the aggrieved language of anti-immigrant activists, arguing that those in the country illegally are lawbreakers who hurt native-born Americans by usurping their jobs and pushing down wages.Mr. Trump said in a statement that he was driven by a concern for \u201cthe millions of Americans victimized by this unfair system.\u201d Mr. Sessions said the program had \u201cdenied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs.\u201dFormer President Barack Obama, who had warned that any threat to the program would prompt him to speak out, called his successor\u2019s decision \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cself-defeating\u201d and \u201ccruel.\u201dBoth he and Mr. Trump said the onus was now on lawmakers to protect the young immigrants as part of a broader overhaul of the immigration system that would also toughen enforcement.Mr. Trump also warned lawmakers that if they do not legislate a program similar to the one Mr. Obama created through executive authority, he will \u201crevisit this issue!\u201d \u2014 a statement sure to inject more uncertainty into the ultimate fate of the young, undocumented immigrants who have been benefiting from the program since 2012.Conservatives praised Mr. Trump\u2019s move, though some expressed frustration that he had taken so long to rescind the program and that the gradual phaseout could mean that some immigrants retained protection from deportation until October 2019.The White House portrayed the decision as a matter of legal necessity, given that nine Republican state attorneys general had threatened to sue to halt the program immediately if Mr. Trump did not act.Months of internal White House debate preceded the move, as did the president\u2019s public display of his own conflicted feelings. He once referred to DACA recipients as \u201cincredible kids.\u201dThe president\u2019s wavering was reflected in a day of conflicting messages from him and his team. Hours after his statement was released, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had \u201cgreat love\u201d for the beneficiaries of the program he had just ended.\u201cI have a love for these people, and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,\u201d he said. But he notably did not endorse bipartisan legislation to codify the program\u2019s protections, leaving it unclear whether he would back such a solution.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were negotiating late into Monday evening with one another about precisely how the plan to wind down the program would be executed. Until Tuesday morning, some aides believed the president had settled on a plan that would be more generous, giving more of the program\u2019s recipients the option to renew their protections.In addition to the public statement from Mr. Sessions and a White House question-and-answer session, the president was ready on Tuesday with the lengthy written statement, and officials at the Justice and Homeland Security Departments provided detailed briefings and distributed information to reporters in advance.Mr. Trump sought to portray his move as a compassionate effort to head off the expected legal challenge that White House officials said would have forced an immediate and highly disruptive end to the program. But he also denounced the policy, saying it helped spark a \u201cmassive surge\u201d of immigrants from Central America, some of whom went on to become members of violent gangs like MS-13. Some immigration critics contend that programs like DACA, started under Mr. Obama, encouraged Central Americans to enter the United States, hoping to stay permanently. Tens of thousands of migrants surged across America\u2019s southern border in the summer of 2014, many of them children fleeing dangerous gangs.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, indicated that Mr. Trump would support legislation to \u201cfix\u201d the DACA program, as long as Congress passed it as part of a broader immigration overhaul to strengthen the border, protect American jobs and enhance enforcement.\u201cThe president wants to see responsible immigration reform, and he wants that to be part of it,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to a permanent solution for the young immigrants. \u201cSomething needs to be done. It\u2019s Congress\u2019s job to do that. And we want to be part of that process.\u201dLater on Tuesday, Marc Short, Mr. Trump\u2019s top legislative official, told reporters on Capitol Hill that the White House would release principles for such a plan in the coming days, input that at least one key member of Congress indicated would be crucial.\u201cIt is important that the White House clearly outline what kind of legislation the president is willing to sign,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said in a statement. \u201cWe have no time to waste on ideas that do not have the votes to pass or that the president won\u2019t sign.\u201dThe announcement was an effort by Mr. Trump to honor the law-and-order message of his campaign, which included a repeated pledge to end Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration policy, while seeking to avoid the emotionally charged and politically perilous consequences of targeting a sympathetic group of immigrants.The blame-averse president told a confidante over the past few days that he realized that he had gotten himself into a politically untenable position. As late as one hour before the decision was to be announced, administration officials privately expressed concern that Mr. Trump might not fully grasp the details of the steps he was about to take, and when he discovered their full impact, would change his mind, according to a person familiar with their thinking who was not authorized to comment on it and spoke on condition of anonymity.But ultimately, the president followed through on his campaign pledge at the urging of Mr. Sessions and other hard-line members inside his White House, including Stephen Miller, his top domestic policy adviser.The announcement started the clock on revoking legal status from those protected under the program.Officials said DACA recipients whose legal status expires on or before March 5 would be able to renew their two-year period of legal status as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the announcement means that if Congress fails to act, immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children could face deportation as early as March 6 to countries where many left at such young ages that they have no memory of them.Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security recommending an end to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era executive action that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.Immigration officials said they did not intend to actively target the young immigrants as priorities for deportation, though without the program\u2019s protection, they would be considered subject to removal from the United States and would no longer be able to work legally.Officials said some of the young immigrants could be prevented from returning to the United States if they traveled abroad.Immigration advocates took little comfort from the administration\u2019s assurances, describing the president\u2019s decision as deeply disturbing and vowing to shift their demands for protections to Capitol Hill.Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201cnothing short of hypocrisy, cruelty and cowardice.\u201d Maria Praeli, a recipient of protection under the program, criticized Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump for talking \u201cabout us as if we don\u2019t matter and as if this isn\u2019t our home.\u201dThe Mexican foreign ministry issued a statement saying the \u201cMexican government deeply regrets\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.As recently as July, Mr. Trump expressed skepticism about the prospect of a broad legislative deal.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut our country and political forces are not ready yet.\u201dAs for DACA, he said: \u201cThere are two sides of a story.

How is it, precisely, that right becomes less right and wrong less wrong simply by the passage of time and the weariness of repetition?How is it that morality wavers and weakens, accommodates and acquiesces?It seems to me the oddest of asks: Surrender what you know to be a principled position because \u201cmoving on\u201d and \u201cmoderation\u201d are the instruments that polite society uses to browbeat the radical insisting on righteous restoration.I see no value or honor in this retreat.I don\u2019t even think my crusade is a personal one, although it must be said that every day that I wake and recall that a bigoted, sexist, intolerant, transphobic scoundrel is president, my stomach turns and my skin crawls.But there is something far larger than personal feeling at stake here: We are now talking about an administration that is attempting to dramatically reshape the demographics of the eligible electorate, in particular striking at groups who overwhelmingly vote for Democratic candidates and overwhelmingly voted against Trump.We are talking about the basic concept of whether our government, and by extension our country, advances unity or division, love or hate.We are talking about an assault on our democracy by a hostile foreign power, the contours and scope of that assault coming into greater clarity every passing day.How can any of us, if we are true patriots, be expected to simply calm down and suck it up when the Russians are bragging that the \u201cpresident\u201d of this country isn\u2019t ours but theirs?How can we be expected to sit idly by while the fabric of this country is unwoven by maleficent hands, whatever their size?No!I don\u2019t care if I one day become the last man standing and the last one yelling. I shall remain until the end \u2014 mine or Trump\u2019s.But I know well, and am comforted by the fact, that I am not alone. Millions of Americans see this travesty for what it is and share my disgust and indignation.Good people of good conscience are seeking to do what Trump only gave lip service to, and in his way bastardized. We, patriots, will not stop resisting this destruction. It is we who will Make America Great Again by trying to limit the damage Trump can do to us until he feels the reckoning of the damage he has done to himself.Advertisement"}

Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter based in Seattle, discussed the tech he is using.You cover Amazon and Microsoft. Do you use their technology?The one technology constant in my career as a journalist seems to be Microsoft Word. I take notes for all of my stories in it on a MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve tried Google Docs and OneNote, but can\u2019t stick with them for reasons I can\u2019t explain. I have a feeling I might be cremated with a copy of Microsoft Word.What do or don\u2019t you like about their tech products that you use?I find some of the things you can do on the Echo pretty silly and much easier on a smartphone app. I\u2019ll give you an example. A while back I was installing a sprinkler system in my garden that was connected to a wireless control unit. I found out I could use the control unit with Alexa to turn on the sprinklers with my voice.What are your favorite websites, apps or other tech tools for keeping on top of technology news?I get so much of my news diet, technology or otherwise, through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. I have configured my phone to send me a text message every time Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, tweets because he\u2019ll occasionally make news that way.What tech gadgets or apps are you or your family currently obsessed with and why?I am a contrarian on the Apple Watch, which I believe has been unfairly maligned by tech pundits. I love mine, and I get pretty frustrated by a lot of Apple products. I\u2019m a runner and cyclist and track all of my workouts with it. I use Siri on the watch to respond to text messages.Apple somehow managed to create a wearable device versatile enough that you can wear it on a run and with a suit. That\u2019s impressive.Are there technologies that you\u2019re not crazy about?I\u2019ve never cared for reading books on screens, even though I almost exclusively read newspapers and magazines on my phone and computer.I don\u2019t play video games. My son does. I\u2019m embarrassed to say he spent a decent chunk of the summer wasting bad guys in Call of Duty. He also read a big stack of books and is a sweet, sensitive kid, which is how he got away with it.What\u2019s your advice about how much or how little kids should be on their devices and on games? This is such a difficult issue. Most of my daughter\u2019s homework is on a computer so policing her screen time is really about limiting certain applications or websites. The other day I gave her a hard time when I heard her listening to YouTube. It was for her Spanish class.Overall, I try to encourage personal responsibility rather than hassle my kids all the time about their devices. It has worked so far.Advertisement"}

I am always happy when I am reminded of them.There it is: the immortal, the inimitable French shrug, expression of the wisdom of a people who has seen it all and refuses to be rattled by hyperbole, seduced by blandishment or surprised by folly.The purest expression of this shrug lies in the word \u201cbof.\u201d It conveys the contemptuous French dismissal of, say, a politician\u2019s affair, and is the best retort I know to the hyperventilating, nasty outrage that has become the lingua franca of the social media age.\u201cBof, c\u2019est normal\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s normal, people more often reveal their weaknesses than discover the better angels of their nature. Trump \u2014 he of the small hands \u2014 dreams of a gigantic mushroom cloud. Normal, get used to it.It could well be that Vialard will be proved right: big hat, no cattle. \u201cIl ne fera rien.\u201d He will do nothing. Bof.The young French leader suggested that Trump gets himself in \u201cdeadlock\u201d with his various threats. \u201cOn these different issues,\u201d Macron mused, \u201cwhat\u2019s his alternative? He doesn\u2019t have any. On climate, even on Iran, there is no alternative. So we have to rebuild some multilateralism where the president finds his place.\u201dThat will be tough. But Macron\u2019s right about Trump\u2019s self-imposed \u201cdeadlock.\u201d The American president has not yet built his wall. He has not yet made his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord effective. He has not yet torn up the Iran nuclear accord.The Macron conversation reminded me of French good sense. America likes to indulge the sentimental. It is constantly \u201cpreening in the mirror,\u201d so as to avoid \u201clooking in the mirror and remembering where the bodies are buried,\u201d as Paul Beatty puts it in his roller-coaster of a novel, \u201cThe Sellout.\u201dFrance has little time for illusions. It has been disabused of them over time. As Saul Bellow observes in his novel \u201cRavelstein\u201d: \u201cThe French were genuinely educated \u2014 or had been so once. They had taken a bad beating in this century. However, they had a real feeling for beautiful objects still, for leisure, for reading and conversation; they didn\u2019t despise creaturely needs \u2014 the human basics.\u201dSome 40 years ago I was living in Paris and working for a cool start-up magazine called Paris Metro. I wrote a piece that started with my encounter in the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont with Marie-Claire, age 6, whose plastic ball had landed on my head. We got to talking; she told me how she played with her older brother, and I asked if he was nice to her.\u201cNo, Monsieur,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe bullies me all the time. He pushed me over, and calls me a sissy. He pulls my hair, and he breaks my toys. He never lets me win any games. He says that one day he\u2019ll throw me into the pond, head first.\u201dWhat do you think of that?\u201cBof,\u201d Marie-Claire said. \u201cC\u2019est normal.\u201dTrump, of course, is not a normal president. He called Kim a \u201cmadman\u201d; he should know. So I am happy that the European leader with whom Trump seems to have the strongest rapport is Macron, who can bring his country\u2019s wisdom on \u201cthe human basics\u201d to bear on Trump\u2019s wild leanings. French antennae for the normal are also useful in detection of the abnormal.Once upon a time I took a cab from Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle Airport and got stuck in traffic. It was a gorgeous morning, clear sky, spring in the air. I remarked on the beauty of the day to the driver. He turned to me and said:\u201cBof, \u00e7a ne va pas durer, Monsieur,\u201d \u2013 yeah, it won\u2019t last, Sir. Nor will Trump. Il ne fera rien.Gail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "9 Back-to-School Tips for Parents and Students", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetween the social-media-fueled pressure, college admissions madness and bullying culture, schools today can be a minefield. We collected some education-themed Op-Eds to help guide families as they settle into the new year.Is your child feeling left out? Angry at you? Embarrassed to speak up during class? Don\u2019t ignore these feelings. Unless emotions are properly dealt with, children won\u2019t be able to reach their full academic potential.For students who seem to have less and less patience for long reading assignments, perhaps it\u2019s time to bring back poetry memorization. Capitalize on their ear for the phony free verse of Twitter and texting and give them better words to make sense of themselves and their world.Parents often wonder about the effect on kids when celebrities or leaders treat people badly or fail to stand up to bigotry and prejudice. Though there\u2019s no way to measure the precise impact, we know that they absorb shared ideas about what behavior is permitted and what is intolerable. If we can\u2019t count on our national leaders to counteract bigotry, then we have to redouble our efforts to do so ourselves. Words are a start and deeds must follow, in small moments of kindness and larger acts of standing for justice. As information spread and birth control became increasingly available, unwanted pregnancies dropped and rates of S.T.D.s plummeted. In this case, knowledge really is power. This is true of death, too. We need to learn how to make a place for death in our lives, and we also need to learn how to plan for it.When students witness their classmates being shown the door for trivial offenses, they worry that they may be next. Studies show they grow anxious and do worse on some high-stakes tests. So, what\u2019s to be done? Enter empathy. Sharing what teachers and students have in common, such as a passion for music, a wry sense of humor or even similar values, allows teachers and students to connect and communicate better. Establishing this common ground might seem minor, but it may keep a great many students out of trouble and doing better academically. Freshman year of college is a year away, but the admissions process can get stressful and you might already be swimming in numbers: SAT scores; the percentage of applicants admitted; how much money graduates tend to make .... And before you know it, you\u2019ll be hearing back from schools. When the time comes, try to remember that no acceptance or rejection from a university should be seen as the conclusive measure of a young person\u2019s worth, or a harbinger of the accomplishments or disappointments to come. A lot of college students want to change the world, but too many think that living a meaningful life requires doing something extraordinary. \u201cThanks to social media, purpose and meaning have become conflated with glamour: Extraordinary lives look like the norm on the internet.\u201d Don\u2019t focus on someone else\u2019s Instagram account when you can focus on creating real-life experiences that matter to you.

Protests", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReaders reactAcross the country N.F.L. players knelt or linked arms during the national anthem in a widespread demonstration against President Trump, who criticized athletes on Twitter and in a speech last weekend.Here is a selection of the thousands of comments we received, which have been edited for length and clarity.\u201cI teach high school. Much to my students\u2019 amazement, I have always explained that there could be no greater honor for the men and women who have given their lives for this country than not to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem. I explain that they died precisely so that we would have that choice, not so that we may become automatons who stand and sit on cue.\u201d As a three-tour combat vet of Iraq, I stand with these players to protest if they desire to do so. For those who oppose these N.F.L. players, I respect your right to do so. I served to protect all Americans not just the ones I agreed with.What a player does off the field, court or ice is their business and they can say whatever they want like any other American regardless of how unpatriotic that might be.However, when you are at any job, from a sanitation worker to a stockbroker to a football player, you do not have free speech. Professional athletes are entertainers. That is how they command millions of dollars a year. There is nothing entertaining about getting lectured by an ungrateful, unpatriotic and ignorant athlete.My father, uncles, and many friends and relatives served in World War II on a segregated base in Tuskegee, Ala. where they had to fear for their lives while off the base. A native of the Midwest, my dad had to be taught the rules of the segregated South \u2014 sit on back of the bus, don\u2019t look whites in the eye, don\u2019t talk to white women.Donald Trump and his supporters don\u2019t own patriotism. While defending the flag, my dad had to drink out of separate water fountains under that same flag.The flag and the national anthem are sacred symbols of our sovereignty. Offering disrespect to these symbols is inappropriate and not an effective method of offering political dissent.Police brutality against non-whites is deplorable and needs to be discussed in Congress, Senate, townhalls, public forums, etc., but not at the solemn singing or playing of the national anthem.Because one is rich, famous, and popular, does not give him the right to disrespect a symbol which stands for nationhood in innumerable ways. I consider this method too blunt an instrument and too crude to be effective.I am a Vietnam era veteran and a proud patriot, and I would never display disrespect for our flag; however, this is not North Korea. It is not written in our constitution that one must stand during the national anthem, nor am I aware of any law requiring it. More despicable behavior by the nation\u2019s so-called leader.The right solution is to get the flag and the national anthem out of professional sports arenas altogether.As a Vietnam veteran that fought and gave blood for my country, as my father did in World War II and my two grandfathers did in World War I, I don\u2019t like the kneeling done during the national anthem but my family fought and some died for their constitutional and God-given right to express their disapproval on or off the field.I was in combat in Vietnam when black athletes at the \u201968 Olympics made a gesture with raised fists regarding the black power movement and I felt the same then as I do now. My father was very angry about it but I felt they too had a right to express themselves, it was a generational difference we had.This is a winning issue for Trump.The N.F.L. is hemorrhaging fans, in large part because of the players are turning the league into a social justice platform. Of course, the players and teams have a right to do this. But fans also have the right to tune out, which they are doing.Players are also increasingly perceived as overpaid prima donnas, while team owners are viewed as greedy municipal extortionists.I am an 8-year veteran of the United States Navy and served in the first Gulf War. I should also state, since I think it pertains to the topic, that I\u2019m a white male. Patriotism was my main driver to serve my country.I am completely baffled on how kneeling for the national anthem is disrespectful to those who served in the military or first responders or how the two are even remotely connected. I served for what this country stood for and to protect not only the country but the Constitution of the United States.I served. Peaceful protest and the right to speak, kneel, hold hands, or stand in a public setting is one of the values I swore to protect. I\u2019m also proud of both the Steelers in the locker room and the one Steeler \u2014 West Point graduate, Ranger \u2014 who came out to stand at the team\u2019s tunnel entrance. Peaceful protest starts conversation and change when it happens in a public setting. I am proud of all those athletes and owners. I\u2019m a Republican for 40 years and am ashamed of DJT, our non-leader.Trump is 100% right on this. Overpaid and indulged athletes are hypocritical, taking the man\u2019s money and then pretending they\u2019re part of the oppressed classes. Grandstanding at stadiums during the anthem. \u201cDeciding\u201d if they\u2019re still interested in visiting the White House.Oh, puh-leeze.Advertisement"}

It was expected to pass offshore of the Dominican Republic\u2019s northeastern coast early Thursday, before moving near the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday night and Friday.Maria had weakened to Category 2 after taking \u201cquite a hit\u201d from the high mountains of Puerto Rico, where at least one death had been reported. Officials expected the strong winds and storm surge flooding in Puerto Rico to subside by early Thursday, and they canceled its hurricane warning. Heavy rain, however, was expected to continue.In the meantime, the countries already battered by Maria were scrambling on Wednesday to recover. And weather officials said \u201ccatastrophic\u201d flash flooding was still occurring on Puerto Rico as of 8 p.m. Wednesday.Electricity was knocked out across all of the island, a spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico State Agency for Emergency and Disaster Management said, and officials said it could take months to fully restore power.The authorities warned weary residents not to let down their guard, because flash flooding and mudslides could prove more deadly than the initial winds from the storm.The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew effective Wednesday until Saturday. Thousands of people there were scrambling to hundreds of shelters, some of which Mr. Rossell\u00f3 acknowledged might not be storm-worthy.

It had crossed the United States Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm, then weakened. Its winds were blowing about 110 miles per hour on Wednesday evening.\u2022 Forecasters say Puerto Rico will see about two feet of rain by Friday. Storm surges are expected to raise water levels by as much as six feet in the Dominican Republic.\u2022 Governor Rossell\u00f3 told CNN late Wednesday that officials knew of only one fatality in Puerto Rico, but noted that they still could not communicate with the southeastern part of the island, which was hit earliest and hardest by the storm. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a lot of information,\u201d he said.\u2022 President Trump late Wednesday designated the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area to make federal funds available to people on St. Croix who were affected by the storm.\u2022 Hartley Henry, an adviser to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that there had been seven confirmed deaths from Hurricane Maria on that island. Two people were also killed on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, officials said.\u2022 Officials at Ross University Medical School on Dominica said they planned to evacuate students and others by boat to St. Lucia.\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said in an interview with El Nuevo Dia, the largest daily newspaper in Puerto Rico. \u201cWe know there are severe damages along different rivers and reservoirs, and water has overflowed from riverbanks, causing flooding,\u201d he added.The island had not seen a Category 4 storm since 1932.Carlos Anselmi, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Puerto Rico, said there had been \u201crecord-breaking\u201d amounts of rain, with as much as 35 inches expected in some places. \u201cThere have been reports \u2014 multiple reports \u2014 of coastal flooding along the south, north and east of Puerto Rico,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect this to continue throughout Puerto Rico.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t leave your house, that\u2019s the message,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody in Puerto Rico should be on the street.\u201dLocal radio stations were reporting widespread devastation in coastal areas, but Ricardo Castrodad, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman in Puerto Rico, said officials had not yet been able to make assessments.\u201cI\u2019m hunkered down weathering the storm in Guaynabo,\u201d he said on Wednesday, adding that the winds were still blowing, \u201cso we still can\u2019t get out.\u201dAs the storm moved in, Jerika Llano, 27, took refuge with three family members in her concrete home in Bayam\u00f3n, a town near the island\u2019s capital. She said the wind was \u201cblowing hard and screaming.\u201d\u201cAlmost all the trees have fallen, and I can see aluminum roofs flying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doors and gates vibrate because of the power of the gusts.\u201dAs locals peeked out from their shelters to survey the damage on Wednesday evening, some were incredulous.Utility poles had snapped like twigs, blocking what seemed like all the roads that weren\u2019t flooded; metal gates that once enclosed affluent neighborhoods were crumpled beyond recognition; gas station pumps were tipped over like domino tiles. Entire houses had disappeared.\u201cThis looks like a different country,\u201d said Marimar de la Cruz, an educational consultant, as she viewed the destruction in Hato Rey, a San Juan neighborhood.President Trump said on Wednesday that he had \u201cnever seen\u201d winds like the ones generated by Hurricane Maria as it made landfall in Puerto Rico.\u201cWe have a big one going right now \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen winds like this \u2014 in Puerto Rico,\u201d he said as he entered a meeting in New York with King Abdullah II of Jordan. \u201cYou take a look at what\u2019s happening there, and it\u2019s just one after another.\u201dThe king extended his \u201ccondolences\u201d to residents in the path of the three storms that have hit the United States over the last several weeks, adding, \u201cFor us sitting on the outside, looking at how the Americans came together at a difficult time, is really an example to everybody else.\u201dOn CNN, Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that the agency was well positioned to help on Puerto Rico and on the United States Virgin Islands.Mr. Long confirmed that both areas had fragile power systems. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very frustrating event to get the power back on,\u201d he said.The core of the storm passed south of the Virgin Islands, with the outer eyewall lashing St. Croix.\u201cThere was howling in every part of this house,\u201d said Ernice Gilbert, a journalist who lives on the east side of the island. \u201cIn my area, the winds were ferocious.Communications were largely out across the United States Virgin Islands on Wednesday, and its government was assessing the damage, said Garry Green, the emergency operations supervisor at the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency.The United States Virgin Islands Department of Tourism said it was encouraging travelers to postpone trips there.The government of the British Virgin Islands extended a curfew until at least Thursday morning as workers cleared roads and assessed the damage from Maria.

The house, a two-story at the end of the cul-de-sac, had not been spared by the recent storm, which submerged three-quarters of this coastal industrial city.The homeowner, Derrick Ford Freeman, has just not had time to worry about his own affairs. He is the mayor of Port Arthur.Normally the job of mayor is part-time, requiring only one white button-down shirt bearing his name and the city logo. Lately, his mother has been washing that shirt every morning. Mr. Freeman has spent his days racing around the city, lobbying a visiting senator for federal aid one moment, sitting next to a woman sobbing onto his shoulder the next. He has focused on practical matters like restoring trash pickup, reopening schools and finding homes for displaced families.The mayor knows what residents have endured from Hurricane Harvey because he has gone through it himself. But he has set aside his troubles to look after his city\u2019s much larger ones.Like many of the people he has comforted, Mr. Freeman is not sure where his family will live when they return to Port Arthur.

But the mayor had stayed put.In Port Arthur, like many places along the Texas coast, time can be measured in storms: the surges of water during Hurricane Ike (2008), or the \u201cblue roofs,\u201d the government-provided tarpaulins that covered damaged homes, after Hurricane Rita (2005). But there was already a sense that this time, it had been battered by something much worse.Nearly a week after the flooding began, parts of the city remained inaccessible. The city\u2019s newspaper, The Port Arthur News, had waist-high water in its office, and its editor, whose home and car were flooded, was commuting from a hotel room provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that was 60 miles away in Lake Charles, La.In a church parking lot where a group from Louisiana was handing out meals, one man hugged the mayor with pained look on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing those somber hugs,\u201d Mr. Freeman told him. \u201cWe\u2019re coming back, baby!\u201dThe storm struck a city of 55,000 that already had its share of struggles. Port Arthur, like much of the region, has an economy driven by the oil industry, and it has the largest refinery in the United States within its city limits. Even so, unemployment and poverty have been stubborn problems, and the city\u2019s busiest streets are checkered with empty lots and rundown buildings.Port Arthur was once bustling, with a robust white middle class and the distinction, in 1973, of being an All-American City, a title awarded for civic innovation. But over time, the white population gravitated toward the cookie-cutter subdivisions that sprouted nearby, taking with them businesses that had been in downtown Port Arthur.The void was filled, in large measure, by a wealth of diversity: The City Council is mostly black. A Vietnamese-American community flourished after the war. In one corner of the city, there was a Dominican barber shop, a Mexican meat market and a garden outside Queen of Vietnam Catholic Church with a statue of the Virgin Mary rising above nearby houses.Before the storm, Mr. Freeman had ambitious aspirations: diversifying the economy and changing the minds of people who viewed the city as a place to avoid. As he confronts an enormous recovery, he hopes it will spark an infusion of opportunity rather than dashing hopes for change.But the mayor\u2019s concerns now are more immediate. More than 100 schoolteachers and another 100 city employees, he said, did not have homes ready for them to return to. If the city were to spring back, they would need places to stay.As a resident, he understood how difficult it could be to move forward. After all, he had made almost no progress in repairing his waterlogged home. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have a lot of work,\u201d he admitted at one point to the police officer assigned to ride around with him. \u201cIt keeps my mind off of it.\u201dAfter a visit to a school whose gym had been transformed into a Red Cross shelter, the mayor hopped back in his car, one hand holding the steering wheel, the other a hamburger. Another dignitary, this time a United States senator, had come from out of town.\u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Freeman said, laughing, \u201clet\u2019s see what my man Ted Cruz has to say.\u201dAs he drove down streets that, days ago, he had traversed by boat, Mr. Freeman, 41, explained how deeply his roots ran in Port Arthur. He was raised here. The middle school he had just left used to be a high school, which he graduated from in 1994. He has family ties to the rapper Bun B, whose group UGK, short for Underground Kingz, started in Port Arthur.He had a winding path to politics. He performed in a Christian rap group called T.F.O., or The Forgiven Ones. He was a disc jockey for the local hip-hop and R&B station, making $11 an hour during a prime evening shift. (His name on air: D-Free.) Then, he left for a decade, living around Los Angeles, hoping to make a career in the entertainment industry.He returned when he and his wife were expecting their first child. He served on the City Council before he was elected mayor last year. His day job is in real estate, but through politics, he hoped he could make an impression on his city.\u201cTo get a blessing, I always say, you\u2019ve got to be a blessing,\u201d he said.There have been victories since the storm: the mayor announced schools would open earlier than planned. And there have been hurdles: Some residents expressed worries that the city had not done enough to prepare, and others complained about barges the mayor had hoped would house hundreds of displaced people.After a week of dealing with the recovery, Mr. Freeman\u2019s exhaustion was starting to show: He could not stop yawning.The day had a packed schedule like the others before it: A briefing at Police Headquarters and meetings at City Hall. He drove to a mall to take a photograph with the retired baseball player Curt Schilling, who had traveled here to volunteer. Then he was off to the county airport to meet Elaine C. Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security.He was mindful that Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida, might mean that the window of attention on Texas could be closing. He wanted to secure help before that happened. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything we can to regain or keep confidence in Port Arthur,\u201d he said, \u201cso they\u2019ll rebuild with us.\u201dHe followed Ms. Duke\u2019s motorcade back to Thomas Jefferson, the school with the gymnasium filled with cots. Some residents slept on a warm afternoon, covers pulled up to their face. Restless boys chased one another. One asked an aide following Ms. Duke in a pinstriped suit if he were the president.One woman gave the mayor a hug. It was his mother, Deborah, who has been among the regular volunteers. \u201cThey can say he\u2019s young,\u201d she said of her son, \u201cbut he\u2019s got a lot of heart and a lot of wisdom.\u201dAnother familiar person, a volunteer for his campaign, asked for $5.The mayor pulled a wad of bills from his pocket and handed him one.He climbed back into a sport utility vehicle, bound for another meeting at City Hall. He had a few stops left, but he would make it home before sunset. There, he would go upstairs and squeeze into his children\u2019s bunk bed to sleep.\u201cClose the door,\u201d he said, \u201cand the smell doesn\u2019t hit you too bad.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s $1.3 Billion Fine in Europe Requires Review, Court Says", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The highest court in the European Union ruled on Wednesday that Intel\u2019s $1.3 billion antitrust fine get a second look, a decision that could ease some of the legal pressure that American tech giants face in the region.The order, which will send the Intel case back to a lower court for review, is a blow to a sweeping regulatory crackdown in Europe that has ensnared American household names like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. It could also embolden these technology companies, which have long complained that officials in Europe target them unfairly, to challenge the rulings and investigations against them.The case, and its outcome, plays to the legal headaches for Silicon Valley in Europe. The European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has made technology companies a central focus, with investigations into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The companies all deny any wrongdoing.The commission said that such rebates, offered to manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC, were anticompetitive. That argument raised questions about whether some common practices in the digital world, such as the bundling of products or services, could violate antitrust rules.It did not strike down the original ruling, but experts said the decision to send the case back to a lower court was a good sign for businesses looking to offer rebates to customers in exchange for exclusivity deals.\u201cThis decision is the right one for business, consumers, and E.U. antitrust law and policy,\u201d said Dave Anderson, an antitrust partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. \u201cExclusivity rebates are no longer considered in the E.U. as inherently anticompetitive.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line for Intel,\u201d Mr. Anderson added, \u201cis that Intel lives to fight another day.\u201dThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up 2 percent, to $35.72, in midday trading in New York.\u201cWe welcome today\u2019s landmark ruling,\u201d Steven R. Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said. \u201cWhile this case concerns events that happened more than a decade ago, we have always believed that our actions were lawful and did not harm competition. We look forward to the next step in this process.\u201dStill, some critics, particularly in the United States, say Europe\u2019s antitrust officials have too much power to levy fines and to force companies to change business practices without prior court orders.The ruling on Wednesday will give businesses more confidence that they could win a case on appeal if they come under investigation, said Veronica Roberts, a London-based partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, a law firm.\u201cThis gives them more confidence that a defense that they put forward could be reviewed,\u201d she said.The European Commission gave a cautious response when asked what the latest ruling would mean for other technology companies under investigation in Europe, and whether it would give those firms confidence to pursue legal challenges rather than to reach financial settlements.\u201cI cannot comment how companies will proceed or assess the judgment,\u201d Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news conference. \u201cWe ourselves still have to look carefully into the details of the judgment.\u201dThe chip-making industry, including Intel, has changed markedly since the case was brought.Intel was being investigated for its actions from 2002 to 2007. At one point, the company controlled 70 percent of the market for microchips, according to the European Commission. Known for its \u201cIntel Inside\u201d advertising slogan, the company dominated the market for personal computers.But since then, Intel has seen demand for PCs deteriorate, as consumers have shifted to buying increasingly powerful smartphones and tablets, a sector in which chip makers like Qualcomm, ARM and Samsung are major suppliers.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Amie Tsang from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Ad-Targeting Problem, Captured in a Literal Shade of Gray", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a sense of the dilemma confronting Facebook over its ad-targeting system, consider the following word: confederate.As of Wednesday, any prospective advertiser who typed that word into Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting engine would be prompted to distribute their ad to a potential audience of more than four million users who had indicated an interest in the Confederate States of America, according to a test by The New York Times.There are plenty of Civil War buffs, of course, as well as students and scholars who have taken an academic interest in the Confederacy. Yet Facebook must also be mindful in today\u2019s charged political atmosphere that some might use its targeting system to reach those who support the Confederacy as part of a white nationalist worldview.\u201cWhat we\u2019re actually talking about is all of the social issues one can think of \u2014 any social issue, social debate, social strife \u2014 being reproduced in this arena,\u201d said Sarah T. Roberts, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies content moderation on digital platforms.\u201cThese issues are taken wholly unresolved and put into a commercial context where they\u2019re amplified and disseminated at instantaneous speed, forever,\u201d she added. \u201cI have great empathy around the difficulty.\u201dTargeting involving contentious subjects can be done legitimately, said Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads products, such as companies advertising historical books, documentaries and television shows. He acknowledged situations in which certain targeting categories could be used \u201cin malicious ways\u201d but said, \u201cThis type of behavior is against our policies and has no place on our platform.\u201d\u201cWe are taking a hard look at our ads policies and enforcement, and are looking at ways we can do better,\u201d Mr. Goldman said.How do people end up in the potential audience for Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting categories in the first place? Facebook creates an ad category corresponding to a subject through a mix of human discretion and automated processes that it declined to describe.Facebook users then effectively sort themselves into the targeting category by liking and visiting certain pages on the social network and through other activities they engage in on the service. Facebook has said that liking a page is one signal among many that helps it place users into the categories that advertisers can target.So if Facebook creates, say, a red wine category, people increase their likelihood of being included in it by engaging with Facebook pages dedicated to the topic.Once an ad category exists on Facebook, advertisers can push their messages to those users. Those who may be targeted in an ad campaign around the Confederate States may be Civil War buffs who visited or liked a page about the Confederacy set up by a seller of history books.\u201cAt the end of the day, these gray areas are dictated by the advertiser,\u201d said Chris Bolte, a longtime ad-technology official at companies like Yahoo and Walmart. Mr. Bolte said advertisers had every right to target the audiences most likely to be interested in their products and services, unless those audiences were \u201cobvious hate groups.\u201dBut Ms. Roberts at U.C.L.A. argued that simply by allowing Confederate States of America and similar pages to exist and then using this content to help advertisers target people with those interests, Facebook was blessing the views expressed there as legitimate.\u201cWe can draw a line from content that proliferates on the platform to what is extracted and monetized, made into revenue flow from advertising,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is up to Facebook to make the decision here whether to impede that process. Whatever they decide, it is no longer possible for that to fly under the radar.\u201dOther Facebook ad-targeting categories that fall into the gray area of being legitimate in principle but potentially problematic or open to misuse include Wehrmacht, which refers to the Nazi-era German military, and Benito Mussolini, the Fascist Italian leader during World War II, according to a test of Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting system by The Times.While scrolling through the Wehrmacht page, Robert Citino, the senior historian at the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, said, \u201cIt does implicitly accept the German propaganda view of the Wehrmacht: handsome warriors drinking beer, with their planes on a hastily constructed airfield.\u201dHe said people who esteem the Wehrmacht can only do so while \u201cignoring the fact that they were massacring supposedly inferior racial groups in the Eastern campaign,\u201d though he defended their right to pursue an interest in the Wehrmacht\u2019s tactics and equipment.\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly cut and dried,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir responsibility is the same as any other media company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You can prepare for her arrival by keeping an eye on buds, which develop over one to four weeks until they swell up and turn away from the direction they once faced.The bloom will arrive sometime between sunset and midnight. Over one to three hours, the petals unfold, and a thick perfume resembling magnolia or gardenia permeates the air.If you take your eyes off the Queen of the Night, she will slip away with the moon.When Mr. Randall returned the next morning, the vibrant blossom had vanished.

{"Headline": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201dPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201dFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201dAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201dWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.Labor exists on a similar continuum.The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201dLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201dIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.In reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company\u2019s workers from forming one.There is little chance for building connections at Apple. \u201cEveryone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don\u2019t see each other outside of work,\u201d said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.Ms. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.\u201cOne thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people,\u201d said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. \u201cIt was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company.\u201dBut in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized.Neil Irwin reported from Rochester and Cupertino, Calif.Advertisement"}

They formed the band that same year.Their music teacher, Cep Ersa Eka Susila Satia, sensed their potential and offered to manage them, saying that he \u201csaw three rebellious students and I channeled it\u201d into music.Initially, the girls said their parents forbade them from performing. But they ignored the order, playing in secret, and they soon developed a local following through live shows. Videos of their performances posted to Facebook quickly went viral, expanding their fan base.However, that exposure on social media also opened them up to death threats, which the girls said were made by Muslim hard-liners.\u201cThey said that if we produce an album, they would burn it, and some people threatened to decapitate us,\u201d Ms. Eusi said.Beyond the death threats, they also dealt with a more prosaic form of disapproval: \u201cOur school principal is a conservative Muslim, and he says music is \u2018haram,\u2019\u201d or forbidden under Islam, Ms. Eusi added.The country has also been hit by multiple terrorist attacks during the past 15 years by homegrown cells that have pledged allegiance to either Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.While initially rattled, the girls said they were no longer afraid of the threats. Nor were they worried about their parents, who relented, the girls said, after Voice of Baceprot began appearing on national television and earning bigger paychecks performing for larger audiences. They play about five shows a month.The band, which has four original songs that mix English and the Indonesian language, is recording its first album. During live shows, they also cover songs by musical influences like System of a Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Slipknot and Rage Against the Machine.Jay Subyakto, the event\u2019s creative director, said he booked Voice of Baceprot to give them a national stage to prove a point to their detractors.\u201cIt\u2019s like saying art is un-Islamic,\u201d he said. \u201cI, and I think many other Indonesians, want to see lesser-known bands who are young, have a good ideology and have amazing lyrics in their songs.\u201dDespite conservative norms, the country has a vibrant music scene, including one of the largest punk rock movements in Asia, according to music industry analysts.Heavy metal is also widely popular among younger Indonesians, and internationally famous acts like Metallica, Megadeth and the Scorpions have played large concerts here over the decades.Indonesia\u2019s metal-loving president, Joko Widodo, was supposed to attend the event last month, but canceled at the last minute.Rudolf Dethu, an Indonesian music columnist and band manager, said that he compared Voice of Baceprot\u2019s music with the defiant sounds of riot grrrl, an underground feminist punk movement that arose in Washington State in the 1990s.\u201cIn a way, this is great public relations for Indonesia, that Indonesia isn\u2019t as radical and \u2018scary\u2019 as lots of people outside of Indonesia think,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, those three teenagers are smart and have progressive minds.\u201dFor their part, the girls say they are still trying to win over some students and teachers at their school who disapprove of their band.\u201cAchievement at school should not always be studying, but it can be music,\u201d Ms. Firdda said. \u201cBut some say music will give us nothing.

{"Headline": "The Only Way to Defend Against Russia\u2019s Information War", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWASHINGTON \u2014 Since the American presidential election, RT and Sputnik, Russia\u2019s state-funded foreign media networks, have dominated the discussion about the United States\u2019 response to Russian disinformation. This month, the American government debated whether those outlets should be categorized as foreign agents; a recent article in The New York Times Magazine labeled RT \u201cthe most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far.\u201dMany Americans seem increasingly to embrace the belief that snuffing out these networks and otherwise responding directly to Russian fakes will win the information war. It won\u2019t. To win this fight, Americans need to think seriously about why RT, Sputnik and \u201cfake news\u201d resonate with so many people in the first place.RT and Sputnik are bellwethers for the progressing American policy response to disinformation. On Sept. 14, Molly McKew, a writer and consultant who describes herself as an \u201cinformation warfare expert,\u201d testified before Congress that these \u201cmedia outlets\u201d and others \u201cdeep within the shadow space\u201d have infected America. In response, Ms. McKew would have us \u201cdevelop a rapid response capability for irregular information warfare\u201d to \u201csecure our information space.\u201d She also recommended more regulation for social media.What no one seems to care to discuss is the people who are targets of Russian disinformation, why its narratives find fertile ground among them and what can be done to change that.Readers compare this coverage with their dwindling bank balances and crumbling infrastructure and feel disconnected and disenfranchised, and latch onto something \u2014 anything \u2014 that speaks to them. That might be President Trump\u2019s tweets. Or dubious \u201cnews\u201d from an extreme right- or left-wing site might ring true. Or they might turn to Russian disinformation, which exploits this trust gap.All is not lost. Disinformation can be defeated without the establishment of a shiny new initiative cased in the language of Cold War 2.0. Instead of \u201crapid information operations,\u201d the United States should work to systematically rebuild analytical skills across the American population and invest in the media to ensure that it is driven by truth, not clicks.The fight starts in people\u2019s minds, and the molding of them. In K-12 curriculums, states should encourage a widespread refocusing on critical reading and analysis skills for the digital age. Introductory seminars at universities should include a crash course in sourcing and emotional manipulation in the media. Similar courses could be created as professional development for adults, beginning with state employees. Large corporations could be offered government incentives to participate, too.Finally, under no circumstances should the United States attempt to restrict freedom of the media. The United States might label RT or Sputnik a foreign agent, but it should never ban them. It also need not reinvent the wheel by creating an American version of RT. These would be grave mistakes that would erode America\u2019s position as a beacon of free speech. They would contribute to the crisis of trust that makes Russian disinformation successful in the first place.Russia has very deftly exploited America\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 but these are weaknesses of our own making. Until policy makers start putting people at the heart of their fight against disinformation, they will continue to be easy targets for Russian lies.Nina Jankowicz is a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center\u2019s Kennan Institute.Advertisement"}

On Tuesday morning, she had yet to speak directly to her parents or her 98-year-old grandmother, who were still on the island. She sent dozens of messages to strangers, searching for a way to make contact.Eventually, she messaged someone she had found through a Facebook group who had a relative near where her family was in Trujillo Alto, southeast of San Juan. The relative was able to film a video of Ms. Virella\u2019s mother, who is 65, though it took an additional 12 hours to upload the clip. Finally, on Saturday, the singer learned that her family was safe.\u201cI\u2019m one of the super extremely lucky ones,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not the norm. There are people who have lost absolutely everything. Their families are in shelters and they don\u2019t know which shelters they\u2019re in.\u201dMany others tried to distribute information, even as they did not know what had happened to their own families. Carmen Rosich, 36, who lives in Fairfax, Va., was in relatively close communication with her in-laws on the island, but she was at her wit\u2019s end trying to find out what had happened to her parents.\u201cI was thankful that my in-laws were doing well, but I did not know anything about my family,\u201d she said.Even before she was able to reach her parents, she said that she was on Facebook, trying to spread information about what was happening.WIPR, a radio station, has said that it would help mainlanders find their relatives, but many have reported having trouble reaching the station. Several attempts to call on Tuesday resulted in busy signals.\u201cAfter 24 hours of not being able to reach my mom and no one from her part of the island reporting, I thought, \u2018Might as well give this a shot,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview on Tuesday.He began reaching out on Facebook to other operators, looking for someone who could send a message. But, unbeknown to him, Mr. Ruiz was doing the same thing on the island.On Friday evening, Mr. Pintado was getting out of a train when he received a call from a Puerto Rican phone number he did not recognize. After some confusion, he determined that the man on the phone had been contacted by Mr. Ruiz.\u201cAs I\u2019m on the phone with him, he goes on the radio and calls for Felix,\u201d Mr. Pintado recalled. \u201cAnd I hear him. He couldn\u2019t hear me but I heard him through the phone. The only words that I heard that mattered were, \u2018We\u2019re all O.K.\u2019\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Pintado was able to speak to his mother directly. He said she had developed bronchitis but was in high spirits, and was relieved to learn that the rest of her family was safe.Nuria Net, 35, who lives in Miami, also talked to her father, who lives in Guaynabo, on Tuesday for the first time since Hurricane Maria. She was forced to evacuate her home in Miami Beach because of Hurricane Irma, fleeing to Orlando, where her family still lost power because of the storm.\u201cI just feel like for the last three weeks, I\u2019ve been distraught,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "I Went to the Flood Expecting Misery. I Found Humanity.", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 As I sat in my office complaining about the rain we were having here more than a week ago, I stumbled across a Facebook page run by the Rockport Volunteer Fire Department and the words hit me like a bus. \u201cFellow First Responders who are willing to go in and help we need certified, capable able-bodied people to come help,\u201d it read. As my wife read the post over my shoulder, she put her hand on me and said, \u201cBe safe down there sweetheart.\u201d She knew I was going.I quickly assembled my gear and within a couple of hours I was driving south on I-35, headed for Rockport. I remember feeling unusually calm as I made my way south and tried to imagine what I would face once I arrived. NPR was airing segments from Corpus Christi, and eye witnesses were describing the scene in near-apocalyptic terms. There was a certain amount of focus placed on reports of price gouging and looting. I began to mentally prepare for the worst.As I made my way into the city of Rockport, the devastation was profound. Power poles were leaning at 45-degree angles for miles or snapped cleanly in half, R.V. trailers and large boats littered the landscape \u2014 nearly all of them completely destroyed. Structures were literally ripped in half or obliterated by the 150 miles per hour winds and thousands of once-mighty oaks now blocked roads, driveways and doors. Rockport had sustained a life-threatening blow.Within five minutes of checking in with Gillian Tate, public information officer for the Rockport volunteer fire department, I was assigned to a crew, and the work began. I was paired with Jon Lewis, another first responder from San Antonio who served several years as a firefighter before suffering a career-ending injury. Jon had read the same Facebook post and was there to help.At least six of the Rockport firefighters had lost their homes. With their families safe in other towns, they now lived at the main station and would have to wait to deal with their loss \u2014 now was the time to take care of their community. As we sectioned off the city and started going door-to-door searching for people who may have been trapped in their homes, many of us felt overwhelmed by the destruction. Jon had made contact with a middle-aged couple who were caring for their infirm mother. The house was relatively intact, but with no electricity. Jon had brought a generator from San Antonio, and within minutes this family had enough power to run the necessary medical equipment, a fan and the refrigerator. Jon would visit them several more times over the coming week to refuel the generator and bring fresh water and food. By the time I left Rockport, this family was still relatively comfortable.Beginning about Sunday people began showing up to the main fire station bringing bottled water and food for the hundred or more first responders now housed in the facility. Everyone who came to deliver these goods asked, \u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d We requested a couple of chain saws to help clear trees from vital roadways. The next day we had 14 brand new saws, complete with extra chains, fuel and oil, and three days after that we had upward of 30.The donations continued. Socks, gloves, toiletries, bug spray, sunblock, shovels, rakes, crowbars, batteries, hand sanitizer and other essential items poured into the fire station. The seeds of humanity were sprouting in the water-saturated devastation. People from around the state were showing up in cars, vans and pickup trucks filled with donations. It became a logistics challenge as the main station was already out of space, and by the sixth day after Harvey had made landfall the department was able to clear out their west station, converting it into a makeshift warehouse. Volunteers helped manage the operation, which freed up firefighters to concentrate on their primary mission.There were also specialized response crews from Mexico who paid their own way to assist in the effort. One crew in particular, led by Mauricio Pantoja, brought a crew of five, ranging in age from 19 to 55. They had a cadaver dog, Titon, able to detect human remains in up to 15 feet of water. Mauricio spoke a moderate amount of English and translated conversations between his crew and ours during the evening after the curfew went into effect. \u201cJim, you and I are brothers,\u201d he said to me. \u201cWe are here helping our brothers, we are the same. Borders keep brothers from brothers no matter where, what country. It is no good. We are all brothers.\u201d For perhaps the first time I became very disappointed in myself for not knowing enough Spanish to have a conversation with my brothers. I have added learning Spanish to my to-do list.While there were a few isolated incidents of looting and price gouging, the prevailing theme in Rockport was one of neighbor helping neighbor and stranger helping stranger. I saw at least three families who brought pop-up shelters and Texas-size barbecue grills and were simply cooking food in whatever parking lot they could find. They had spray-painted signs made from large pieces of debris that read \u201cFREE Food and Drinks \u2014 All Welcome.\u201d These were people with no ties to the community; they just wanted to help in whatever way they could. Some organized themselves into groups like \u201cHarvey\u2019s Helpers\u201d who set up a Facebook page and live-streamed up-to-the-minute requests for necessary items. Church groups provided food, clothing, diapers, portable air-conditioners and spiritual comfort to those who desperately needed the healing power of fellowship. Looters? Too few to even acknowledge, and those that were foolish enough to try and prey on the victims of Harvey were chased off or arrested.I file this report from an interesting perspective. As a first responder, I was on the front line and had access to places others did not. I had direct contact with both victims and relief volunteers, and in many instances, was able to connect them to one another. My perspective is also unique in that I had little, if any, exposure to outside news \u2014 save for Gillian, who kept the world abreast of what was happening and what was needed via the department\u2019s Facebook page. Before I arrived in Rockport, the situation sounded bad. Once I engaged in the recovery effort, however, I found that humanity was alive and well.I am home now, but I would like readers to understand that Rockport, just like many other communities along the Gulf Coast, will need continued support for months, if not years, as they rebuild. I\u2019d ask that anyone who reads this to donate to the American Red Cross. The Rockport Volunteer Fire Department Facebook page has a link to a GoFundMe page set up to help the firefighters (all of whom are unpaid volunteers) and their families. It is the least we can do for the selfless and humble people who have kept the spirit of their community burning bright.James G.

The commonality is universal coverage, but wealthy nations have taken varying approaches to it, some relying heavily on the government (as with single-payer); some relying more on private insurers; others in between.Experts don\u2019t agree on which is best; a lot depends on perspective. But we thought it would be fun to stage a small tournament.We selected eight countries, representing a range of health care systems, and established a bracket by randomly assigning seeds.But enough talk. Let\u2019s play.Both have single-payer systems, but vary in the government\u2019s role and in what is covered.U.S. analogues are Medicare (more like Canada) and the Veterans Health Administration (more like Britain).Canada and Britain are pretty similar in terms of spending \u2014 both spend just over 10 percent of G.D.P. on health care. They also have reasonably similar results on quality, although neither ranks near the top in the usual international comparisons. In terms of access, though, Britain excels, with shorter wait times and fewer access barriers due to cost.Our pick: Britain, 4-1What\u2019s your pick?BritainCanadaSingapore\u2019s system costs far less than America's (4.9 percent of G.D.P. versus 17.2 percent). Singapore doesn\u2019t release the same data as most other advanced nations, although it\u2019s widely thought that it provides pretty good care for a small amount of spending. Others counter that access and quality vary, with wide disparities between those at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.Our pick: United States, 4-1What\u2019s your pick?United StatesSingaporeThe government pays for at least 85 percent of outpatient services, and for 75 percent of the medical fee schedule for private patients who use public hospitals. Patients must pay out of pocket for whatever isn\u2019t covered. Most doctors are self-employed, work in groups and are paid fee-for-service. More than half of hospitals are public.Everyone in France must buy health insurance, sold by a small number of nonprofit funds, which are largely financed through taxes. Public insurance covers between 70 percent and 80 percent of costs. Voluntary health insurance can cover the rest, leaving out-of-pocket payments relatively low. About 95 percent of the population has voluntary coverage, through jobs or with the help of means-tested vouchers. The Ministry of Health sets funds and budgets; it also regulates the number of hospital beds, what equipment is purchased and how many medical students are trained. The ministry sets prices for procedures and drugs.The French health system is relatively expensive at 11.8 percent of G.D.P., while Australia\u2019s is at 9 percent.

The U.S. system, praised as dynamic and innovative, is even more expensive, falls short of universal coverage and can be bewilderingly complex. Which do our experts prefer?Our pick: France, 3-2What\u2019s your pick?FranceUnited States France's system is impressively comprehensive and in some respects simpler. Switzerland relies on a competitive yet much-regulated system of private insurers.

It\u2019s an example of how close the voting was. Not one vote was unanimous among the judges, and all the semifinal and final votes were 3-2. Clearly, there is room for disagreement about the relative merits of health systems, and different experts would surely reach different conclusions.Some judges took a global view, giving the edge to countries, like the United States, that promoted innovation that benefited the rest of the world. In other cases, how health systems treated the poorest of society was paramount.To nobody\u2019s surprise, the United States could do better at balancing health care costs with access, quality and outcomes. But there are many ways to reach that goal, and there will always be trade-offs. Learning about them from other systems and debating them honestly would probably do us a lot of good.We hope that readers will consider this to be merely the beginning of a discussion, not the end. We welcome your questions or comments. In fact, we look forward to writing articles in which we answer those questions and ask other experts with different views to weigh in.

{"Headline": "In Berlin, an Iconic Theater Gets a New Leader. Cue the Protests.", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Berlin\u2019s hulking, disused Tempelhof Airport has a long, winding history. Built by the Nazis, it was the site of the Berlin airlift and, more recently, of emergency housing for some of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who arrived in Germany in recent years. On Sunday afternoon, Berliners crowded on the tarmac outside the former terminal for a more festive occasion: a 10-hour dance event called \u201cFous de Danse\u201d organized by the city\u2019s Volksb\u00fchne theater.The event wasn\u2019t without tension, though. The performances marked the start of Chris Dercon\u2019s tenure as the director of the Volksb\u00fchne, one of the most influential theaters in the German-speaking world. The decision to appoint Mr. Dercon, the former director of Tate Modern in London, to run the institution has spurred an angry debate, one that has often conflated the issues surrounding his appointment with the larger challenges confronting Berlin, like gentrification, globalization and immigration.It has not always been a dignified debate. Along with the usual petition-signing, there have been ugly protests \u2014 some might call them a hazing \u2014 that even an avant-garde theater may find over the top.The Volksb\u00fchne, founded in 1890 as a theater for the working class and headquartered in an imposing building in the city\u2019s Mitte neighborhood, owes much of its recent international reputation to Frank Castorf, an icon of German theater who had led the Volksb\u00fchne for 25 years. During his tenure as director, Mr. Castorf established the theater as a home for ambitious, experimental productions \u2014 which could run for seven hours \u2014 often blending a punk-rock sensibility with high-minded ideas about politics and history.In early 2015, Berlin officials decided that Mr. Castorf would only be offered a shortened contract, effectively forcing him out. The appointment of Mr. Dercon, who had relatively little theater experience, was greeted with outrage.\u201cDercon definitely doesn\u2019t know anything about theater,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Kuttner, a director and performer who has been involved with the Volksb\u00fchne for 20 years.The reaction grew more intense after Mr. Dercon suggested that he would refocus the theater as an interdisciplinary space hosting international productions, which many saw as undermining the theater\u2019s ensemble tradition. In the summer of 2016, about 200 people affiliated with the Volksb\u00fchne signed an open letter warning of \u201cthe destruction of originality and obstinacy, which has gained the Volksb\u00fchne an international reputation and worldwide recognition.\u201d Another open letter in support of Mr. Dercon appeared a few weeks later, signed by many prominent figures in the art world.Since then, the ongoing conflict has become favorite fodder for Berlin newspapers. Mr. Dercon and his team\u2019s access to the Volksb\u00fchne building was restricted. At Mr. Castorf\u2019s request, the \u201crobber wheel,\u201d a statue that stood on the lawn in front of the theater and which had become an icon of Berlin as well as of the Volksb\u00fchne, was removed. (Mr. Castorf did not respond to a request for comment.) An online petition arguing that officials should reopen the debate about the future of the Volksb\u00fchne has gathered over 40,000 signatures since July. Over two weeks this summer, feces were left anonymously in front of Mr. Dercon\u2019s office.\u201cThat was the limit,\u201d said Mr. Dercon of the feces incident. The 59-year-old was sitting on a structure built by the Burkina Faso-born architect Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 inside Tempelhof\u2019s hangar space. \u201cIt is about more than me or the theater. There is the rage and the anger in this country, in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are angry about change \u2014 they are angry about what is going to change, how it is going to change.\u201dAs Mr. Dercon pointed out, the Volksb\u00fchne has become a symbol for the city\u2019s ongoing debate about its future amid rapid gentrification. After decades of gritty poverty, Berlin\u2019s economy has become one of the fastest-growing in Germany. In many parts of the city, apartment prices have soared, and the city is facing a widespread housing shortage.\u201cThe Volksb\u00fchne is a symbol of the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall,\u201d said Amelie Deuflhard, the director of Kampnagel, a performing arts venue in Hamburg, who has been closely following the debate. \u201cThere were all of these spaces that were empty, they cost almost nothing. You could open a gallery anywhere. All that has gone.\u201d Mr. Castorf\u2019s Volksb\u00fchne, she pointed out, embodied the period\u2019s scrappy aesthetic and often grappled with the ideological questions raised by the collapse of Communism.Others see the change as a threat to the German theatrical tradition in which subsidized local theaters produce new work with a core staff, while others view it as an attempt to make the theater more palatable to tourists. According to the office for statistics for the states of Berlin and Brandenburg, the number of annual visitors to Berlin has almost doubled in the past decade, to nearly 13 million. \u201cA Castorf play that lasts seven hours is a challenge and imposition, it is not the kind of thing that will entertain Czech bus tourists,\u201d said Mr. Kuttner.Supporters of Mr. Dercon have accused his opponents of conservatism and xenophobia. Unlike the Berlin-born Mr. Castorf, Mr. Dercon is Belgian and has spent much of his life in New York and London. On the Volksb\u00fchne\u2019s Facebook page, one commenter compared opponents of Mr. Dercon to the \u201cangry citizens\u201d who take part in anti-immigrant rallies in the eastern German city of Dresden.Mr. Dercon says he consciously put together a program that includes international artists, with works by the Syrian playwright Mohammad al-Attar and the British-German artist Tino Sehgal, as well as a project involving the Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, as a way of marking the city\u2019s increasingly global culture. \u201cIf there is a city where the most and the best international artists are living, it\u2019s Berlin,\u201d he said.The event on Sunday was billed as an \u201cinvitation to a city, to perform itself,\u201d and included performances by the famed choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, who performed a looping solo as the sun set over the building. At one point, the audience formed a \u201cgiant soul train\u201d; more than a hundred people, including many children, enthusiastically shimmied their way across the tarmac to blaring funk music.The next big step will take place on Sept. 30, when Mr. Dercon\u2019s Volksb\u00fchne will present its first play, \u201cIphigenia,\u201d by Mr. Attar in the hangar at Tempelhof. For a long time it was unclear if the theater would be allowed to use the space given the needs for refugee housing. Mr. Dercon pointed to a row of abandoned signs for the residents. \u201cI feel almost like a refugee,\u201d he said. \u201cI got my permit to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says Decision on \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Program Will Come Soon", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would announce a decision by Tuesday on whether he will end the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, declaring, \u201cWe love the Dreamers\u201d even as his White House grappled with how to wind down their legal status.Mr. Trump has agonized publicly over the fate of immigrants who were brought to the United States without authorization as children, and who are now protected from deportation and allowed to work under the five-year-old program created by his predecessor.In recent days, White House officials have recommended that the president end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which currently shields about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who would be subject to potential deportation to countries that many of them have not seen since birth.Several administration officials said that Mr. Trump is likely to phase out the program, but his advisers have engaged in a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate over precisely how to do so. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decision was final, also cautioned that the president was conflicted about the issue and could suddenly change his mind.Asked on Friday whether DACA recipients, often called Dreamers, should be worried, Mr. Trump did not respond directly, but he did express his sympathy.\u201cWe love the Dreamers \u2014 we love everybody,\u201d the president said in the Oval Office, surrounded by faith leaders after signing a proclamation of a day of prayer for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. \u201cWe think the Dreamers are terrific.\u201dLater, he told reporters he had \u201cgreat feeling for DACA,\u201d while declining to answer repeated questions about whether he believes the program is legal.But in recent days, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, have privately made it clear to Mr. Trump that they could not defend the program in court, and a group of state attorneys general led by Ken Paxton in Texas have threatened to mount a legal challenge if the president did not act to end it by Tuesday.Complicating the calculus for Mr. Trump has been the storm pummeling Texas, the state with the second-highest concentration of DACA recipients, after California. John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, has argued privately that the president can take his time on the decision, given that Mr. Paxton is unlikely to follow through on his threat in the short term, with parts of his state under water, two officials said.And it is not lost on the president that ending the program now \u2014 with many Dreamers directly impacted by Harvey \u2014 would appear particularly hardhearted.Asked Friday whether the Dreamers impacted by the storm in Texas and Louisiana were weighing on the president as he contemplated the fate of the program, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cThe decision itself is weighing on him, certainly.\u201dThat much was evident on Friday, as Mr. Trump sent mixed messages about when the final call would come.In a midday appearance in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump first told reporters the decision was at hand, scheduled for later Friday or over the weekend. About an hour later, during another set of off-the-cuff Oval Office remarks, he said the final word would come over the weekend, or Monday at the latest. Only two hours after that, Ms. Sanders pushed the timeline still further, saying the announcement would come on Tuesday.As the White House struggled to get its rollout in place, pressure was building from a diverse coalition of supporters, including immigration advocacy groups, business executives and some elected Republican officials, for Mr. Trump to keep the program.\u201cI actually don\u2019t think he should do that,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said of ending DACA as he spoke to a radio station in his home state of Wisconsin. \u201cI believe that this is something Congress has to fix.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican, issued a statement saying, \u201cI\u2019ve urged the president not to rescind DACA.\u201d He called for a permanent legislative solution to address recipients\u2019 legal status.Republican Governor Rick Scott of Florida also weighed in late Friday, issuing a statement in which he said, \u201cI do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents.\u201cThese kids must be allowed to pursue the American dream,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cand Congress must act on this immediately.\u201d\u201cDreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,\u201d wrote the executives, who included Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard and Mary Barra of General Motors, a former member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory council. \u201cThey are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.\u201dYet even their zeal seemed to be waning as Mr. Trump continued to push off a decision on what should be done. On Friday, one of the attorneys general, Herbert H. Slatery III of Tennessee, said in a letter to Senator Bob Corker, another Republican of Tennessee, that he no longer supported moving forward with a legal challenge to DACA. \u201cThere is a human element,\u201d to the issue \u201cthat is not lost on me and should not be ignored,\u201d Mr. Slatery wrote.He also called for action by Congress to normalize the Dreamers\u2019 status, through legislation co-sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.Pro-immigration activists argued it would be particularly callous for Mr. Trump to end the program as Texas is struggling to recover from Harvey.\u201cIf DACA were to be repealed, they\u2019re going to be going after many young immigrants and families that have been affected by Harvey, that have been trying to keep their lives together,\u201d said Efr\u00e9n C. Olivares, the racial and economic justice director at the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cConsidering a repeal of DACA would be just shocking for anyone who claims to care about Texas and its communities.\u201dOscar Hernandez, a DACA recipient who is an organizer at United We Dream Houston, joined a conference call on Friday arranged by supporters of the program from the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston where he was helping families displaced by the storm, vowing, \u201cWe\u2019re here to stay.\u201dIn the community of young, undocumented immigrants, that sentiment was broadly felt.\u201cI thought I was very distant from the days of life without DACA,\u201d said Marcela Zhou, a 26-year-old third-year medical student at the University of California at Los Angeles, who was born in Mexico. \u201cIt is scary to go back to that uncertainty.\u201dMiriam Jordan contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vacation Rentals Turn Into Shelters in Harvey\u2019s Wake", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the property, a couple of hours away from flood-soaked Lafayette, La., is now available at a steep discount: it\u2019s marked down 100 percent.The bulk of the free listings \u2014 about 1,000 \u2014 are on Airbnb. And in a sign that the site, which started out as a freewheeling peer-to-peer exchange, has grown up, the city of Houston is relying on it to find emergency medical workers a free place to stay as well.Airbnb\u2019s listings are not a spontaneous effort. The vacation rental and hospitality company first created a disaster relief plan to allow people renting properties to offer free lodging for evacuees after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This time around, hosts in Houston, Galveston, Corpus Christi, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Lake Charles, and Lafayette can offer free stays to hurricane evacuees through the site through Sept. 25. Because the site does not manage the properties it lists, it can only ask its hosts to offer free lodging.\u201cWe have since helped in 75 disasters internationally including Hurricane Matthew and wildfires in California,\u201d said Kellie Bentz, the head of global disaster response and relief for Airbnb. \u201cBut Harvey is the most significant.\u201dThe hurricane marks an interesting turn of events for Airbnb. It has gone from being a site that several cities, including Austin, have sought to prevent or limit from operating in their municipalities to one that is working with public officials in Houston. It is also currently responding to flooding in Mumbai, where intense rains and flooding killed at least five people in a single day last week.If the site successfully positions itself and its hosts as philanthropic partners to aid in disasters, it will eventually face questions about which emergencies qualify for the $0 lodging rate and what doesn\u2019t.Harvey is unquestionably a disaster of epic proportions. The demand is no less acute even though the floodwaters have ebbed. In many cases, receding waters have only revealed the scale of the devastation. Some evacuees returned home to find that they lacked safe drinking water or basic necessities. And some who rode out the storm have since left because it is no longer safe to remain.Gabbie Vasquez was one of them. After the storm made landfall, she left her home in Angleton, Tex., along with her boyfriend and 6-year-old son because she worried that she would lose power. They stayed in a hotel for two days and planned to return home but the roads had flooded.So they met up with other family members at a McDonald\u2019s in Waco and tried to come up with a game plan. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking to ourselves, \u2018What are we going to do now? Where are we going to go?\u2019\u201dWhile the kids were playing, they started looking online. A Facebook post led her to Airbnb, where she saw a listing that said: \u201cMi casa es su casa\u201d or \u201cMy home is your home.\u201dShe clicked and found her way to the home of Edith Flores, an Austin resident and first-grade teacher who is a single mother to three children. Ms. Flores usually charges $80 to $100 to stay in her guesthouse, and $50 for the garage loft. But in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, she is listing her accommodations for free.\u201cI personally don\u2019t have the financial funds to donate as much as I\u2019d like to,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is one thing I can do.\u201dSeveral other hosts said they had also found quick takers. Heather Ayrer, a stay-at-home mom who lives in a three-story townhouse in the Midtown neighborhood, has been a host for two years and generally charges $78 a night for a bedroom and bathroom space with a private entrance. When she offered her home to Harvey evacuees for $0, the response was overwhelming.\u201cI was immediately flooded with 15 requests from people who needed help,\u201d she said. \u201cMy entire September is booked solid with different people involved in Harvey, including an electrician who is coming into town to help with power restoration in the city.\u201dHomeAway, the Austin-based marketplace that focuses on vacation rentals, has a smaller number of listings than Airbnb, roughly 100. It has created a number of services for those affected by the hurricane, including a specialized page for temporary housing and a dedicated line for reservations. It draws upon its inventory from HomeAway as well as the other sites it operates: VRBO and Vacationrentals.com. During this time, service fees will be waived from any rentals for evacuees or emergency medical workers.Shivani Vora and Christina Caron contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Russian agents also used Facebook and Twitter trolls, less successfully, to try to upend the French election.Finally on Thursday, speaking on Facebook Live, Zuckerberg said he would give Congress more than 3,000 ads linked to Russia. As one Facebooker posted: \u201cWhy did it take EIGHT MONTHS to get here?\u201dRobert Mueller\u2019s team, as well as House and Senate investigators, are hotly pursuing the trail of Russian fake news.

His pleas for safeguards and regulations have been mocked as \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201cpretty irresponsible\u201d by Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg, whose project last year was building a Jarvis-style A.I. butler for his home, likes to paint himself as an optimist and Musk as a doomsday prophet. But Sandberg\u2019s comment shows that Musk is right: The digerati at Facebook and Google are either being na\u00efve or cynical and greedy in thinking that it\u2019s enough just to have a vague code of conduct that says \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d as Google does.In July, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX told a meeting of governors that they should adopt A.I. legislation before robots start \u201cgoing down the street killing people.\u201d In August, he tweeted that A.I. going rogue represents \u201cvastly more risk than North Korea.\u201d And in September, he tweeted out a Gizmodo story headlined \u201cHackers Have Already Started to Weaponize Artificial Intelligence,\u201d reporting that researchers proved that A.I. hackers were better than humans at getting Twitter users to click on malicious links.(Musk also tweeted that it was a cautionary tale when Microsoft\u2019s chatbot, Tay, had to be swiftly shut down when Twitter users taught her how to reply with racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic slurs, talking approvingly about Hitler.)Vladimir Putin has denied digital meddling in the U.S. elections. But he understands the possibilities and threat of A.I. In a recent address, the Russian president told schoolchildren, \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d Musk agreed on Twitter that competition for A.I. superiority would be the \u201cmost likely cause of WW3.\u201dOn Thursday, touring the Moscow tech firm Yandex, Putin asked the company\u2019s chief how long it would be before superintelligent robots \u201ceat us.\u201dZuckerberg scoffs at such apocalyptic talk. His project this year was visiting all 50 states, a trip designed by former Obama strategist David Plouffe, which sparked speculation that he might be the next billionaire to seek the Oval Office.Yep. Very scary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Long-Tolerant Spa Town Feels the Chill of Slovak Populism", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPiestany JournalPIESTANY, Slovakia \u2014 Why so many wealthy Arabs have chosen Piestany, a pleasant but faded little spa town, as a vacation destination is something of a mystery.Some say it started in the 1960s, when aspiring pilots from the Middle East came for flight training at the nearby airport. Others point to a Slovak soccer coach who went to Qatar decades ago and inspired visitors.Whatever the case, every summer, they come by the thousands.The town\u2019s spas stretch along a narrow island opposite the city center, presided over by the Hotel Thermia Palace, the grandest of the venues and once host to European royalty and Indian maharajahs. Now it is more likely to attract a Kuwaiti princess, as the town\u2019s central pedestrian strip has turned into an unlikely panorama of Muslim women in traditional dress and men smoking hookahs outside kebab shops.It was never a problem. Until now.The populist wave that has swept Central Europe \u2014 fueled by a backlash to the refugee crisis \u2014 is affecting even this pampered cocoon of transnationalism that depends utterly on well-heeled visitors from abroad. The hint of menace has unnerved and surprised regular visitors.One of them, Hassan al Mekhyal, has been bringing his Kuwaiti family for years to Piestany, where the summer nights feel deliciously cool compared with the furnace back home.It was only this year, as his wife was stocking up at the local Tesco superstore, that a furious young man began harassing her, calling her names, telling her to go back home.Others have noticed the change, too.There had never been an ugly incident involving his Muslim customers, said Ilknur Perda, 65, as he gently sliced off juicy shards of shwarma at his shop, Istanbul Doner-Kebab, on the town\u2019s main strip.But then one day last year, a local 22-year-old walked up and began berating the Muslims at the outdoor cafe tables.\u201cHe was being very hateful,\u201d said Mr. Perda, who moved to Slovakia from Turkey when he was 34. \u201cHe got into a fight with one of the customers. Later that night, the guy came back and smashed all my windows.\u201dThe incident was striking enough to make the national news in Slovakia. \u201cThe next morning, all my Slovak and Czech customers called me,\u201d he said. A march was organized to support him. One local man planted a \u201ctree of tolerance\u201d just outside the kebab shop.But it was a sign, local officials said, that the atmosphere was shifting.\u201cPeople are feeling more and more emboldened,\u201d said Eva Bereczova, the city\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cThey are unashamed to say things in public they would have been ashamed to say before. And it is probably going to get worse.\u201dSlovakia regularly ranks near the bottom in European Union polling of discriminatory attitudes toward foreigners and other ethnic groups.\u201cThey come to City Council meetings in their green shirts sometimes,\u201d Ms. Bereczova said, referring to the party\u2019s official garb. \u201cThen they wanted to hold a meeting at our local cultural center, but we put a stop to that.\u201dShe is frequently surprised by the hidden support for the right wing.\u201cI went to the swimming pool with a friend and we met some other people,\u201d Ms. Bereczova said. \u201cOnly after awhile, when politics came up, did I realize I was the only one who had not voted for Kotleba. They insulted me for being na\u00efve.\u201dMohamad Safwan Hasna, chairman of the Islamic Foundation of Slovakia, said many Slovak politicians were eagerly fanning the anti-Muslim flames.\u201cThe only thing they want is to win the election,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people are getting bolder. They got a signal from the politicians that it\u2019s O.K.\u201dNow there is a virtual campaign against Muslims. \u201cThe photos began showing up on Facebook in August,\u201d he said.\u201cAt first, even I thought it was a real photo,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, why is this woman praying in a parking lot? But then I realized, of course, it is a fake.\u201dSlovakia, a country of five million, has about 5,000 Muslim citizens, and not a single mosque. Piestany is one of the few places their presence is felt, but a vast majority are visitors.More than half of the 619,262 overnight stays last year in Piestany were by visitors from other countries, tourism officials said.Piestany Spa, which operates the town\u2019s health facilities, broke down by nationality the guests who stayed at its resorts last year.Of the 42,756 overnight stays, nearly 12,500 involved residents of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon or the United Arab Emirates. There were 1,674 more visitors from \u201cother Asian countries,\u201d which spa officials said were nearly all other parts of the Muslim world. Another large group, accounting for 6,858 nights, came from Israel.\u201cThere is not a problem with people from Israel and people from Arabic countries being side by side,\u201d said Monika Koborova, the guest relations manager for the Hotel Thermia Palace. \u201cThey come to get healthy, not to make trouble.\u201dOn cool summer evenings, Muslim visitors frequent the town\u2019s sidewalk cafes.\u201cWe had friends visiting, and we took them to the city center in the evening and even we were surprised,\u201d Ms. Bereczova said. \u201cWe were the only local residents there.\u201dMr. Perda, who runs the Istanbul Doner-Kebab, said the rise in anti-Muslim attitudes had caused some of his former customers to spend their summers elsewhere.But whether this new anti-Muslim wind will be strong enough to break decades of attachment between Piestany\u2019s healing mud and the summer-baked Persian Gulf remains to be seen.Mr. al Mekhyal, clicking through a series of photos on his cellphone of some of the 300 camels he owns in Kuwait, along with a Ferrari, said his family would probably continue to make Piestany part of their regular European idyll. The green hills and vaporous forests still call to them.His 22-year-old daughter, Noura, a civil engineer, was not so sure.\u201cIt\u2019s a little too quiet for me,\u201d she said.Miroslava Germanova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still Processing: Lessons in Loss and Power from Venus Williams and Rihanna", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStill ProcessingLast week, we witnessed two extraordinary events: Venus Williams\u2019s playing some of the best tennis in the last decade of her career (she lost in the semifinals at the U.S. Open, but with style), and the rollout of Rihanna\u2019s new line of cosmetics, Fenty Beauty, which was splashier than the release of the new iPhone X. We learned something unexpected from each. Venus showed us what it means to lose and yet somehow remain undefeated, and the Rhianna event gave us insight into the economy of social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d who are radically changing \u2014 and possibly democratizing \u2014 the beauty and fashion industries.From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your iPhone or iPad:On your Android phone or tablet:This unedited transcription from the podcast may contain errors. Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it.JW: I\u2019m Jenna Wortham.WM: I\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology.WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture relates to humans.JW: This is Still Processing. Welcome back to our show, our pop-culture confession booth.WM: Hi.JW: So, Mr. Morris, what is on your mind this week?WM: Walter Becker died about two weeks ago. He was half of Steely Dan, a group that I thought was two old black dudes my whole life \u2014 or not my whole life, sorry, my entire adolescence. My father had to have a very comical but what for him was an annoyingly, unnecessarily difficult conversation with me.JW: This was pre-Google.WM: They weren\u2019t an MTV act either, but my dad had Steely Dan records. So, I\u2019m still listening to women and the albums they\u2019ve made, and so I was sort of torn about whether to interrupt what I was pleasurably doing to listen to some Steely Dan, and I did that. I listened to \u201cAja,\u201d which was one of their bigger albums. And one of the most famous songs from that record and one of their most famous songs if you\u2019re a hip-hop fan is, of course, \u201cPeg,\u201d which we should play a little bit of right now. We\u2019ll just play, we\u2019ll just go right into the chorus.PEG, STEELY DANWM: I didn\u2019t understand race as a kid. Nobody, no kid understands race. I just thought all the keyboards on this record sounded black. They kind of sang pretty well. Anyway, Walter Becker, you were a music genius. Rest in peace, my friend.JW: Okay, and ... what else you got?WM: I\u2019m really proud of our co-worker and pal, Nikole Hannah-Jones. I wish that somebody would find a way to put her out of business and give her something else to write about, but racism and education seems to persist, nonetheless. So, she had this story about the resegregation of this county in Alabama. It\u2019s really just devastating, mostly because just reading it, you understand just how much states can have been trying through racism to not integrate the schools, and to keep black people and Latinos from having an equal and fair education.JW: Right. It\u2019s exposing something that most people probably thought fundamentally we moved away from, just equal access to education. It\u2019s tragic.WM: More bad news is on my brain, because how can it not be? The weather ... the hurricane.JW: It\u2019s so distressing.WM: Destroying islands in the Caribbean, wrecking havoc on the South. ...JW: I know. I was like, name a city in the South. Name a coastal state.WM: It\u2019s just really terrible, and I feel \u2014 my heart goes out to everyone who has known someone who has lost a life, who has lost a home, who can\u2019t find people. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s really sad. We\u2019re thinking about you, everybody. Like we said last week, it\u2019s still true this week. Anyway. What\u2019s going on with you? You have any happy news?JW: Oh, yeah. I have a really good piece of news. Want to hear it?WM: Yes, please.JW: So, I finally got prescription sunglasses. I don\u2019t know why it took me so long. I have been waiting my whole life for this miracle. You know I love the sun.WM: I know.JW: You know I love the beach. And normally, what happens is I don\u2019t have my proper eyes on, I just have like a pair of Forever 21 glasses on. And, you know, people get miffed because they\u2019re waving at me, I can\u2019t even see the motion of their hands. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. There have been so many times I\u2019ve been out in the park and I don\u2019t realize someone\u2019s trying to talk to me until they\u2019re right up on top of me, and then I\u2019m like, Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s really a problem. It\u2019s a problem. So, I finally invested. I got a cool pair of shades. I wore them all weekend. I was so happy to not bump into things. I could recognize people on the street when I saw them. Quality of life is now at 100, so. You\u2019ve been telling me to watch this television show called \u201cClaws\u201d for many moons now. I finally binge-watched all of it the last couple of days and ... I loved it. It\u2019s like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d meets \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d meets \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d It\u2019s about a bunch of women \u2014 I mean, they make that joke themselves about something else on the show \u2014 but it\u2019s about a bunch of women who work in a nail salon in South Florida, and they get caught up in some petty crime. Niecy Nash is in it, she\u2019s incredible. Dee Norris, who was actually on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d is like a bisexual crime lord. The only thing that\u2019s weird about the show is that there\u2019s a character on the show named Virginia, who is Vietnamese, and her ethnicity is a running punch line. She\u2019s played by Karrueche Tran, who is a makeup artist and kind of became an insta-celebrity after that for different reasons. I don\u2019t like those jokes, and I don\u2019t know. ... We need to talk about it at some point.WM: This is like, what? Our fourth week of talking about Asian racism, or racism against Asians. There\u2019s always a fight over what the last acceptable form of racism is, and in this race to the bottom \u2014 I mean \u201cacceptable\u201d meaning what shows can get away with without huge protests. For whatever reason, there\u2019s a lot of racism against Asian people that is just in our culture that we don\u2019t really examine. Often because, I think, it comes from nonwhite people and is therefore less \u2014 what? Contested?JW: Right. But the show, overall, if you can get past that, is excellent. Maybe they\u2019ll do better for Season 2, because it was renewed. O.K. A little birdie told me about Rihanna\u2019s beauty launch last week.WM: Tweet, tweet, tweet, right here!JW: I\u2019m not too proud to admit that the invitation didn\u2019t come directly to me, but it came through one Mr. Wesley Robert Morris. Thank you very much for making my birthday dreams true early. We saw, we experienced, we smelled even Rihanna, because she was that close to me that I could tell you precisely from head to toe what she smells like. Cotton candy and hormones. She was everything. Everything. Capital E, capital T. So, I\u2019m not someone who gets very starstruck. I mean, partially because I\u2019m a journalist, but also, I\u2019m just not a hype beast. Like, I don\u2019t like to be the one who can\u2019t keep their [expletive] together when, you know what I mean? Like, some celebrity swans through the room. I don\u2019t like that anyway, and I did keep my composure at this event, but I was shocked to learn that even I was not immune to the privilege and the access and the exclusivity of being at that event. I tweeted it, I Instagrammed it, I storied it, I told everybody in my life about it. And watching myself transform into that monster instantaneously was a little distressing.WM: You weren\u2019t quite monstrous.JW: Um ... but I did transform into a gremlin, and I, you know, I\u2019m still thinking about that. Still thinking about that, what happened. How the water got on my fur.WM: Fenty Beauty is not the only thing we did last week.JW: Very true. Very, very true.WM: We didn\u2019t go to the U.S. Open together, but we were there the same night, and we watched some tennis not together. But together, because you kept texting me about how stressed out you were. Venus Williams played that night, she beat Petra Kvitov\u00e1, and we were talking about how much this woman means to both of us, and to many, many other people, and she just had the best year of her professional tennis life in almost a decade. It\u2019d be great to talk about what you learned and what you have learned watching her play \u2014 and lose. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today.JW: Yes.WM: These two women.JW: Venus and Rihanna.WM: Rihanna\u2019s win, her Fenty Beauty win. Her win over like, a whole aspect of consumer culture. And Venus\u2019s many, many wins, and her ultimate loss and what we take away from that, what the experience of watching her win and lose is like, especially at this point in her career.JW: Alright, stay tuned. Last week, we arrived \u2014 I arrived by car, you arrived by foot. I had to go in separate from you, because I was like, I cannot be late to this event. Anyway, so we arrive at a warehouse \u2014\u2014WM: You were so steamed.JW: Honey. I was like, if you make me miss Robin Fenty because you decide to walk from your house to Brooklyn Navy Yard, uh-uh. I knew, I was just like, We will not be friends anymore, so let me just go ahead. But basically, we arrive at this warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it\u2019s the middle of Fashion Week, which means empty lots, empty warehouses, random parks or whatever get transformed into runway shows of different kinds. And it\u2019s all very exciting, it\u2019s all very fun. You never know who is going to show up. People come dressed up. It\u2019s very fun. We arrive, Rihanna\u2019s launching her new beauty line called Fenty Beauty. Everybody\u2019s excited because it\u2019s supposed to have like, the most number of complexion, like, different foundations and products for the largest number of complexions on the market. Whatever. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. But people were very excited for this event. People get excited for anything Rihanna does in general, so.WM: Well, she\u2019s one of the few people, one of the few pop stars to manage to somewhat instantly have a successful fashion imprint.JW: Well, she feels like she has a vision.WM: Right.JW: What\u2019s remarkable about the space is not how it has been transformed, which is, like, into a spaceship, more or less, for this product launch, but it\u2019s that everyone in the room is done up head to toe, but they\u2019re also starring in their own \u201cLive From Fenty Beauty\u201d show that\u2019s ongoing. So, you have all these people with selfie sticks, they\u2019re doing a long-armed selfie hold. People are shooting each other, they\u2019re shooting the napkins that say Fenty Beauty \u2014 which I took a stack of, which I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit, because I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know what came over me! I couldn\u2019t help myself.WM: You were ... you had no shame.JW: Listen.WM: It was so adorable.JW: I was freaking out. But anyway, the point is, I have not seen ... I know how the beauty world works. I know that there are beauty bloggers. I know that people cover beauty events. I know that people write up product launches. They review them, and I get it. Makeup Instagram is like a whole world unto itself. But I did not realize the degree to which the launch of a makeup line by someone like Rihanna really also rests on the amplification of \u2014 dozens, hundreds? How many people were there? Of those people, you know, Snapchatting and Instragramming and uploading to Facebook and tweeting about this event, also. But it makes total sense. I mean, everything that I buy pretty much is couched within the context of social media. If I see a cute pair of pants on Instagram, I\u2019m probably going to ask that person where they got them. I don\u2019t go to stores to shop. I don\u2019t like stores.WM: This is why brick-and-mortar retail is in the toilet, by the way.JW: It is, though. But it is. But I mean, pretty much all the things I\u2019m interested in buying or wearing or doing \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m copycatting looks, but it\u2019ll be like, a particular shade of a blue. And I\u2019m like, Oh, I like that color blue on that skin tone. I should maybe think about wearing baby blue, too. I get all my fashion pretty much through social media, on people that I know of or trust.WM: So, you now have these video mannequins basically who you can also kind of call your friend.JW: I mean, at the thing itself, so we\u2019re looking at all these video screens, a woman comes out, makes a speech, then Rihanna comes out, makes a speech, and then Rihanna proceeds to swan around the whole event.WM: The minute she was done speaking and the screens had gone up, everybody flipped their phone around and began to say, you know, things like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go try on this base.\u201dJW: Highlighter, I\u2019ve got to try the primer. I\u2019ve got to try the gloss. And at the stations themselves where you could go try on these products and they had the vanity setups, but they actually had cell phone stands in them. So you could put your phone in the stand \u2014WM: Shut up.JW: Did you not see this?WM: I did not notice that.JW: Oh, yeah. They had directly next to the vanity \u2014 I was turning into a Tasmanian devil \u2014 but they had the little stands so you could put your phone in the thing, press with one finger to record and do your makeup, and talk into the camera. It was unbelievable. But I was doing some research last night, and there was a business and fashion article that said according to a recent report from Google, 64 percent of women shop this way today. Via influencers! Like, people who talk about the clothing, accessories that they want and wear them online in their social media. So, you have this entire climate. It\u2019s Fashion Week. You have this entire climate where people who are popular online, who have built these kinds of followings online all the sudden are getting priority seating at fashion shows. All of the sudden, they\u2019re getting priority access to new items of clothing or makeup products, like Fenty Beauty. And I have to say too, you know, I did watch all the outtakes and footage from Rihanna\u2019s Puma fashion show via social media. I wasn\u2019t interested in what Vogue thought of her show. No, I wanted to see what my friends, who were sitting front row at the show, had to say. What looks they zoomed in on. I\u2019m way more interested in what they think versus what an anonymous person at Vogue thinks.WM: I wonder if this is partially a technological-innovation milestone, right? Where you have the ability now to whip out your phone, create content that is qualitative, evaluative of a particular product. Or whether it\u2019s the result \u2014 whether the development is the result of the way fashion media and the fashion industry has tended to fetishize and dollarize and romanticize and favor particular looks, to exclude lots and lots of body types and people from its pages, from its worldview.JW: And this is the upside of social media, right, like it allows anyone to become an entrepreneur, in theory. It allows anyone to build a following. And this is something I spend a ton of time writing about and a ton of time thinking about, because I love new economies that aren\u2019t beholden to the old gatekeepers. I love new types of jobs that exist. I think it\u2019s ... phenomenal that if you are a young person \u2014 or not even that young, but you\u2019re just someone who has an aesthetic for how you want to present yourself online, and you can get thousands, millions of people to follow you, and then in turn, you get paid just because you\u2019re such a dynamic presence, people want to follow you and they want to find out what you\u2019re into ... that\u2019s amazing. I mean, it sounds exhausting, but it\u2019s also amazing, because it\u2019s the same \u2014 it\u2019s a way around these same barriers of access and barriers of entry that you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s why there hasn\u2019t been beauty products that complement my skin tone, or shaving products that work with your skin type.WM: But what do the Anna Wintours take from this disruption? Do they see Rihanna and roll their eyes, or do they see Rihanna and try to get on board? Not just with her celebrity but now, her power as a businesswoman.JW: Yeah, well, I think the Vogues of the world still love the Rihannas of the world, but I think the Vogues of the world\u2014\u2014WM: But do they love the women Rihanna love?JW: I mean, if you\u2019re talking about in terms of coverage, I think we have started to see mainstream fashion sites and beauty sites start to be more inclusive to women of color, because they have to. They know they have to, if not only because of maybe the advertising dollars or digital traffic or ad revenue, IDK, because it\u2019s not a good look to be like, We only speak to white women. You\u2019re just going to get called out on social media. So, I think that\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s been a shift towards more inclusiveness. But I also think the traditional sites across the board are feeling frustrated by the lack of exclusivity that they have. I mean, Rihanna\u2019s always going to do a Vogue cover. But you know, if you\u2019re some really hot collection designer, you might give your pieces to a really young, hot Instagrammer instead, and not an editor at a fashion site. You might bring that person, because you\u2019re like, Well, they\u2019re actually reaching more of the people that I want to reach, and people that are going to be more inclined to buy my products, the people that are directly tapped into them.WM: But I have to ask this, this all sounds great in some ways, but what\u2019s the human downside to this?JW: Yo, like everything else about the internet, human cost can be real expensive. I mean, I think anecdotally speaking, some of the influencers I\u2019ve talked to, this rules their entire lives, and I think also, they ... they work all the time, because they always have to make content. And if you think about how quickly we scroll through our social media feeds, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not a commercial that takes weeks to produce and then you watch it for 30 seconds. This is something that takes hours to produce and then you look at it and digest it and move on in a second. I mean, the beast is always hungry, and it\u2019s always asking for more. And you know, there was a woman at the Rihanna show we spoke with who was like, It\u2019s really difficult, especially during Fashion Week because, I\u2019ve got two children, and they\u2019re part of this, too. But also, I never get to spend time with them, and I don\u2019t want them to remember that Mommy always had her phone in front of her face, because you\u2019re always checking to see what\u2019s going on or what are the new offers.WM: But at the same time, the same person, like her child was part of her thing.JW: She made her child part of thing too, which is, I mean, I don\u2019t know. I follow her now, and I\u2019m kind of into it. But I think the cost is high, and I think when you yourself become the thing that people are consuming, I think it\u2019s hard to anticipate how draining that is. And also what it does to your sense of self and your sense of privacy. I mean, people do make money, though. You can get paid like \u2014 I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as tens of thousands of dollars for a single post depending on who you are.WM: It\u2019s like a Gary Shteyngart novel. It is. It\u2019s \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story.\u201dJW: But here\u2019s my question for you. Like, I feel my brain being rewired.WM: It\u2019s a world in which everything is quantified by your interaction with it and people\u2019s approval of X, Y, or Z interaction.JW: Right. You\u2019re only as valuable as the content you create.WM: So all your behavior is motivated by technology.JW: The feedback loop.WM: He is a visionary, Gary Shteyngart. And it\u2019s funny, because that book, you just sort of felt like that\u2019s the future. And it was so strange to be at \u2014\u2014JW: Literally that narration of it.WM: Yeah, yeah.JW: But the difference between that book and reality, I would say, is that in the book, the protagonist has the wherewithal to be like, This is not normal. And no one else \u2014\u2014WM: But he\u2019s the only person who knows.JW: He\u2019s the only person in that world who knows. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true of this age that we\u2019re in. I think there\u2019s very much a tacit awareness and understanding of the economy that you\u2019re participating in. And what you\u2019re getting out of it, what you\u2019re extracting out of it. And this is the thing that I think people like about Rihanna a lot is that she\u2019s also very aware of her role in all of this too. Like she\u2019s not going to be Justin Bieber who is like, Please, please don\u2019t. Rihanna just won\u2019t show up. She won\u2019t show up in public if she doesn\u2019t want you to take her picture. but I think when she\u2019s there in that role, she really understands like, I\u2019m not a person. I\u2019m an avatar. I don\u2019t know. We could be more skeptical. I should be more skeptical about it. For me, it\u2019s mostly exciting until proven otherwise.WM: I think we have been plenty skeptical. I mean, my other question is like, what happens if all this stuff falls apart, you know? Like, you know about me and my great internet apocalypse. And I don\u2019t even know what that looks like, but I\u2019m always thinking about what happens when the equivalent of a Hurricane Irma or a Hurricane Harvey comes to the internet. And like who survives, who lives, who dies, and what models are viable enough to survive that? I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a fair analogy, but I do wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t quite get the built on a house of cards feeling about quite this, but there\u2019s a lot that goes on in the way that we consume and create culture now that does feel to me, from a business model standpoint, to have a house of cards dimension to it.JW: Yeah. There\u2019s a degree of ephemerality and frailty that we\u2019re not looking at because we\u2019re too busy utilizing it. We\u2019re too busy maximizing it right now. I think that\u2019s real.WM: And the difference between now and before is there\u2019s so much more money to be made from that ephemeral relationship between a consumer or an allegedly critical consumer or a reviewer consumer and the corporate making the products themselves too. There\u2019s just, everything is bigger now.JW: Big social! One of our favorite phrases.WM: Big social!JW: Coming for ya.WM: It\u2019s back.JW: Well, we\u2019ll keep thinking about this, because it\u2019s clearly not going away, and I found it all to be tremendously exciting. I was mostly curious to observe myself get caught up in it, and what that said about me, and also what that says about how social media is ... you know those ants that get infected by spores in the rainforest and then climb up the trees? They go as far as they can and while they\u2019re climbing, the fungus is like, eating their brain, it\u2019s like telling them to go higher and higher, and they get to top, and they explode full of the spores that drift down to the bottom of the rainforest and infect everything else? And then those ants climb back up? You\u2019ve never heard about this?WM: No!JW: Oh, it\u2019s like a cool thing. You should google it. Like zombie ants and mushrooms should bring it up. But I was literally like that ant.WM: You were a zombie ant.JW: I got infected. The virus, you know, I touched infected blood supply, I guess.WM: Well, I guess we should talk about my zombie ant experience now. I have one, and her name is Venus Williams.JW: It sounds so grim. This is so exciting.WM: Well, it is until you think about what you\u2019re really doing. I\u2019m really climbing up a tree waiting to explode.JW: Well, on that cheerful note ... we\u2019ll take a break. We\u2019ll be right back.WM: We\u2019ll be right back.JW: I want to talk to you about the U.S. Open because I like tennis, but you love tennis. You told me that you think Venus Williams is your Billie Jean King. Yeah. The most important \u2014\u2014WM: Yeah. She\u2019s very important, and she\u2019s just about as important as Billie Jean King.JW: And I just want to talk to you about watching her at this point in her career, and you know, she lost the Open, eventually, ultimately, to Sloane. And in the press conference after, I was really moved by what she said when they were like, What\u2019s going to happen next with your career?VW: What do you mean?Reporter: What do you see in your near future?VW: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll continue to play tennis. It\u2019s nothing complicated.JW: She\u2019s amazing.WM: You know, the thing that has been very stressful \u2014 I should say first of all, that in addition to Venus Williams\u2019s being an incredibly important tennis player socially and politically, she fought to get equal prize money for the women at these major tournaments \u2014\u2014JW: Snaps to her.WM: And has been very quietly \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even, outspoken? To know Venus Williams is to know that a word like \u201coutspoken\u201d is not the right word. She has been judicious in her attempt to keep equality between the genders at these tournaments and to make sure that as much attention is paid to the women as to the men. We should say the crucial thing about why we\u2019re talking about her additionally is she\u2019s 37 years old.JW: Which was explained to me is ancient for tennis years. I don\u2019t know how this sport works.WM: She\u2019s the Mummy in tennis. I mean, there\u2019s only been one woman who has played, I mean, I mean, her sister now is close behind her. Serena is almost, I think she\u2019s 35 still. And she\u2019s going to come back to tennis next year after having had this baby a couple weeks ago.JW: And dominate. Completely dominate post \u2014WM: We\u2019ll see. But the exciting thing about Venus Williams now is she has this disease called Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome, which seemed like it was going to derail her career. She might never play again. And she decided to keep playing, and it\u2019s an autoimmune disease that has the power to sap your energy. And so it seemed very much like she would never play again, and if she was going to play, she would just be playing because that\u2019s what she\u2019s always done. And she wouldn\u2019t amount to much in these tournaments, and she would be there just rolling the dice. And for several years, that seemed to be the case. She was losing in the first round, in the second round, in the third round. Wasn\u2019t going very far. And this went on for a long time, and at some point, I think these sports writers were just like, Venus, girl, when are you going to give it up? You\u2019re not winning anything. And then about three years ago, something started to change, and she stopped expiring halfway through a match. You know, the disease, I think she just got control over it. She changed her diet, and she\u2019s figured out how to play great tennis with this disease. And then all of the sudden, she has, she had a really good 2016. She doesn\u2019t play enough tournaments to be at the top of the game just because of the way they factor the points. But basically, she plays enough tennis and if she wins a lot, she\u2019ll be well inside the Top 10. And 2017, she gets to the final of the Australian Open and loses to her sister. Loses somewhat inexplicably in the fourth round of the French Open. She gets to the final of Wimbledon, loses to, to ... Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. And she almost gets to the final of the U.S. Open. For any other player, this an amazing year. For Venus Williams, who is 37 years old and battling this autoimmune disease, it\u2019s extraordinary. And so, you said to me the words that I never want to hear when talking about Venus Williams, which is, I want to talk about the things I\u2019ve learned in watching her lose. And like, I don\u2019t want to talk about her losing at all because it just depresses me. My mood just went south. Yours is up, mine is down. What do you got? What have you learned?JW: The night I saw Venus play at the Open against \u2014\u2014WM: Ugh, the Czech Republic\u2019s Petra Kvitov\u00e1, who \u2014 she and Venus have played some great matches together.JW: I\u2019m going to gesture to you a lot because I don\u2019t know any of the tennis terminology. But you know, she played the first set and she did very well. The second set comes around, Venus is clearly fatigued. You\u2019ve mentioned she has this autoimmune disease, I looked up some of the symptoms. Causes joint pain, it goes extreme feelings of being tired. Um, she was lagging. She was run down. I got so stressed out. She was the lead server or whatever and wasn\u2019t able to get the points?WM: They traded breaks a couple times in that third set.JW: The point was, she wasn\u2019t making contact with the ball as much as she should have been considering her advantage on the court. So, I took the opportunity to relieve myself of that encounter, and I just went out to get my commemorative cup because I was like, I cannot take this tension. I was extraordinarily stressed out. But you know, I was watching from the TVs while I was getting my commemorative cup and then I came back, and you know, she seemed so deliberate. And I watched Kvitov\u00e1 work really hard to beat Venus Williams, and Venus looked unbothered. She looked unflapped, you know.WM: But she always, and she always looks that way. You have no idea whether she\u2019s up or down in a match based on her body language and facial expression.JW: But there was something about the way she came back on the third set. She had a lot more confidence. She had a lot more ... pep in her step, and she just looked like she knew she was going to win. So just, so basically like, as a black woman in America, I am very attuned to how other black women in America move in spaces where they are and have been the only one for the majority of their lives and their careers. I love watching how Venus chooses to operate. I love watching how she tries to be in press conferences, which she doesn\u2019t really take the bait. She answers what she wants to say. You know, she says what she wants to say, she doesn\u2019t respond to the things they try to get out of her about other people. I love watching how Serena moves \u2014 she has so little cares. You know, the cares, I would use another word, but it\u2019ll get bleeped, so I won\u2019t, but she has so few cares about what other people think about her. They\u2019re on back order. We don\u2019t know when the store is going to be back in supply. Serena just lives for herself, and they both take two very different approaches to being these public figures, and I take notes from both of them. And I think what I learned from Venus was that, you know, she was very willing to bide her time. She was very willing to make concessions so that she could ultimately come to victory. I mean, she couldn\u2019t get there in the end, but conservation of energy, conservation of resources. Strategic losing is never, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve ever thought about doing in my life, but watching her do it, I was like, yo, she really knows some things.WM: So you think that \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re not saying she tanked that second set, but \u2014JW: No, I think she was making a decision about what her body could do and what it would mean for the third portion of that.WM: This is fascinating. I never considered this.JW: I mean, I\u2019m speculating. I\u2019m not a mind reader. I don\u2019t have any insight into Venus Williams\u2019s game plan.WM: She has lost a lot of second sets, and I\u2019m not saying \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re not arguing that she\u2019s throwing the second set, because ultimately, she wins a lot of those three set matches. But there is something interesting about like, when she \u2014 we used to call it, like a lot of tennis people call it when a player does this going on a walk. You just go on a walk for part of the match, and the match takes a little longer than you need it to. All great players do it, lesser players do it and lose and never become great because they\u2019re always on a walk. But you know, she is a walker. She can just disappear for a little while during a match. But since she got diagnosed with this disease, I have found that it\u2019s really crucial, and I think she knows it\u2019s crucial, but what was exciting to me is she played a lot of three set matches in this tournament, and \u2014JW: Are they always three sets? I\u2019m sorry, go on.WM: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s the best of three. So, you know, obviously you want to get two sets so you can get off the court. But she played a lot of three sets. It didn\u2019t seem like what happened against Sloane Stephens in that semifinal was the result of being tired. It was the result of Sloane Stephens playing the four best games of tennis she\u2019s ever played in her life.JW: Yeah. She came with a mission.WM: With anybody else, Venus Williams would have won that match. When it was five all, she would have broken, served for the match, she\u2019d be in the final against Madison Keys. I have never seen a player do that to Venus Williams \u2014 get every ball Venus hit, no matter where Venus hit it, in like the most remote back of the court, in the corners, Sloane was there with an amazing shot. It wasn\u2019t just getting a racket on the ball. She was making shots on the dead run, and I\u2019ve never seen anybody play, maybe Serena\u2019s the only other person I\u2019ve seen play Venus quite that way. What happened to Venus in that match was, it wasn\u2019t physical fatigue, it was mental. Like, where on this court can I put this ball so this woman can\u2019t get it? And there was no place she could put it. And I think her will just...Sloane broke her will, like as much as she broke her serve.JW: Fascinating.WM: It was a fascinating match. But I\u2019m curious for you what the difference is between a Venus and a Serena and \u2014 I mean, obviously they\u2019re very different people, but there\u2019s something about the way Venus chooses to kind of be introverted versus Serena\u2019s...obvious extroversion. I mean, Venus isn\u2019t a hermit or anything. She\u2019s more mysterious to me than a lot of other women tennis players, a lot of tennis players in general. It\u2019s like she\u2019s holding onto something and she\u2019s not going to give it to us because it\u2019s hers. And I really respect that.JW: I respect that too. I learn a lot by watching how she moves. I mean, I think I\u2019m more aligned with Serena\u2019s style of approach in terms of how she wants to be in the world, which is you know, she doesn\u2019t want to have to adhere to someone else\u2019s ideas of how she should behave. And I mean, I\u2019ve seen Serena play a few times live, and when people boo her, oh my gosh. Like, I cry. It feels so personal. It feels so personal, because it feels like what they don\u2019t like about her is her unwillingness to be small. And Serena is never going to be small, and Venus isn\u2019t either, I should say \u2014WM: But it\u2019s just a different thing. It\u2019s a different energy.JW: Yeah, she\u2019s just a lot more inward. But at the same time, this is a woman who played, I think, in an outfit that she designed that looked fabulous. She was wearing enormous gold hoops that didn\u2019t slow her down. She did a little twirl at the end when she won. I mean, the look on her face when she won, oh my God. I mean, it\u2019s hard not to feel uplifted by that. It\u2019s hard not to watch her, the extreme physicality of the struggle to win and the struggle of Venus to just be on that court, and you know it means so much to her to arrive on that court every time they do it. I\u2019m not trying to say that I can relate to what they do in life, but on a much different scale, I can. I know what it feels like to arrive in a room where people aren\u2019t really rooting for you or you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re rooting for you, and there\u2019s no one else that looks like you at that table. And if you are arrogant or cocky or you know, you\u2019re not in your place the way people think you should be in your place, you get down voted. I mean, I am intimate with those feelings. So, I love them and I adore them and I love watching them because of what they represent to me. And I think, it was just really um, I just feel like I got a free business seminar from Venus. Like I want to Venmo her five bucks \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she needs it, but you know what I mean. I feel like I just got a free course, like a free business lesson.WM: What I learned watching her play in this tournament was that there\u2019s no limit to how long she can do it. As long as she\u2019s getting to finals and losing only to like her sister and to players who are inspired in a slightly different way than she is, I think the thing, the amazing thing about her is she is redefining what \u201cold\u201d is.JW: Yes!WM: She\u2019s old, she\u2019s not old in real life. She\u2019s trying to prove that she\u2019s not even old in her sport. Like, there are so many players in tennis right now who are doing well over the age of 30, including Roger Federer. So, I think that she sits down and spends the next couple of months thinking about how she can have an even better 2018 than she had in 2017.JW: I love it. Me too.WM: I mean, I think she thinks she...she was crushed by losing to Sloane Stephens because she could have won the whole tournament. And she was two points away from getting to the final.JW: She\u2019s not done.WM: I feel bad for Serena, because I think when Serena comes back...JW: 2018! It\u2019s going to be a good year.WM: Venus is going to want to beat everybody.JW: Oh my God. Well, we need these lighthouses. These are dark times, so you know, if these are the things, these are the ports that get me through the storm, like I\u2019m here for it, so.WM: Well, what was interesting to me about this particular U.S. Open is that the four semifinalists were American, and three of those four women were black.JW: I didn\u2019t realize that.WM: Yeah. Madison Keys, Sloane Stephens, and Venus Williams, all black women. And I think that Venus and Serena faced a lot of skepticism when they started playing because nobody...I mean, Althea Gibson is pretty much, Althea Gibson, Gloria McNeil, Zina Garrison. There weren\u2019t a lot of black women playing this sport, and nobody had ever played it the way these two would. And Venus and Serena...they changed the sport, and a lot of people wanted to hold onto the old ways of thinking about how tennis was played.JW: And the types of people that played tennis.WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was one of those people. I mean, she was their chief rival for a long time, and she played a tactical game. And what Venus and Serena did was put an emphasis on power before tactics. And it sort of got into this, what for me was a really racist mentality in terms of how they talk about Venus and Serena. They were physical. They were tough. They were...they were dominating.JW: They talked a lot about their body shape and their body size.WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was always smart.JW: These very coded words that signify threatening.WM: She knows how to construct a point and Venus just hits the ball like a crazy person. That\u2019s how people used to talk about them, anyway.JW: Well, they still do though, because Maria Sharapova put out a new memoir called Unstoppable \u2014WM: Wait. Excuse me. First of all, Unstoppable, Maria Sharapova?JW: She\u2019s been stopped.WM: Uh, what\u2019s your, what\u2019s your win/loss record with Serena Williams? Can I find that for you? Because uh, Unstoppable? You have been stopped.JW: She writes in the book, you know, Serena\u2019s physical presence is much stronger and bigger than you realize watching on TV. She has thick arms and thick legs and is so intimidating and strong. This is via a Buzzfeed article. But yeah. So she\u2019s still talking about her like she\u2019s a...you know, not human, like a super human human. It\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s crazy.WM: Come on. Really? I mean, it\u2019s bad enough being a woman athlete who doesn\u2019t look like what you think an athlete should look like, or looking too much like \u2014JW: Just a woman in the spotlight, people feel like they can...WM: But to have a Maria Sharapova say this about...I mean, look. She and Serena have their issues with each other, but that\u2019s disappointing. And unsurprising at the same time. That\u2019s why she beat you 16 times in a row. Anyway, go on.JW: From your perspective, looking at where both the Williams sisters are at in their careers, I am really curious to hear what you think tennis would look like without either of the Williams sisters and if they\u2019ve dominated it for so long...as long as I can remember being conscious and aware and thinking about tennis as a sport, it\u2019s only been since they\u2019ve been involved.WM: Well, somebody would have figured a way to play this way, maybe. Somebody would have figured out that serving hard and fast and unreturnably is really important. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like Martina Navratilova had a weak serve. She had the hardest \u2014 Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati had like enormous serves. But there was something about, for instance, Serena\u2019s ability to disguise her toss. You never know where she\u2019s going to hit it. I mean, they just changed a lot of the way tennis should be played by women, and now there\u2019s another conversation happening in their wake about how bad serving is in the women\u2019s game and how it could just be better than it is. And it should be a priority. But sexism \u2014 once again, women get taught how to return, not how to serve. Whereas men get taught to serve and not return. Men, I mean, historically have been pretty great returners, but women are, the reason so many serves get broken in women\u2019s tennis is not just because the serve is weak, but they\u2019re really great returners by and large, statistically. I definitely know that if the Williams sisters don\u2019t show up, you know, your Martina Hingises and Lindsay Davenports are going to a lot more finals and winning more than three and five majors, five and three majors a piece.JW: See you at the Open next year, Wes. I\u2019ll see you. Maybe we can actually go together.WM: Maybe. That\u2019s our show, everybody.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "Youth in San Diego: Skateboards, Beach Hangs and Chicano Culture", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe lookSan Diego is credited as one of the birthplaces of skateboarding. The sport took hold there in the 1950s, serving as an alternative to surfing when there were no waves. Today, locals see the skateboard as \u201ca logistical form of transportation but also a style accessory,\u201d the photographer John Francis Peters, who has been living there on and off for five years, said.Growing up, Mr. Peters would spend summers in San Diego, and Mone\u2019t Panza, pictured above in Lincoln Park, reminded him of the people he observed and admired then. \u201cEvery single skater, whether it was a girl or guy, had a completely different style,\u201d he said.Mr. Peters saw Paulina Aguilar hanging out with friends in Chicano Park, a space covered in murals inspired by Mexican and Chicano heritage. \u201cI want to express myself without any judgment,\u201d Ms. Aguilar said of her personal style. \u201cI know people are going to judge, regardless. So I\u2019d rather dress however I want to dress.\u201d\u201cMy mom grew up in the \u201980s generation, so I fell in love with that style,\u201d said Victor Anderson in downtown San Diego. \u201cI pretty much like to dress as casual as I can but still look like I\u2019m a famous person.\u201d Ashley Carter said that being comfortable and honoring her Islamic faith are her top considerations when it comes to dress. \u201cI really like a lot of colors,\u201d she said. \u201cI do wear outfits that are kind of loud sometimes, but I don\u2019t try to match patterns or anything like that.\u201d Mr. Peters noticed her in the city\u2019s Clairemont community. \u201cSo I will put on a hijab with kittens on it, and jeans and a random shirt,\u201d she said.\u201cI think California has influenced my style because of the weather,\u201d said Bruna Stalliviere at a skate park in Ocean Beach. \u201cThe summer influences me to do a lot of things outside.\u201dMaharlika Bowlin, who wears a mix of new clothes and vintage, wants to stand out. \u201cI want to be the person that people look to for a new trend,\u201d she said, photographed in the Golden Hill neighborhood. \u201cI like to mix it up a bit. Not all my clothes are items you can find in stores like Forever 21, Dear Alice or stores like that.\u201dTeal Grenney, left, and her mother, Yaisa Grenney, in the Barrio Logan neighborhood.Lacey Bates grew up in the sleepy Lakeside area of San Diego, but she often went downtown to see people experimenting with their looks. \u201cBeing from a place where there\u2019s not many people that dress like me, it makes me want to be different,\u201d she said, photographed at Ocean Beach. Her fascination with eccentric style led her, in part, to a career in special effects makeup. \u201cI\u2019m really into horror, and I guess that could be a part of it, my dark side.\u201dMr. Peters saw Lorenzo Donnell hanging out with this family in Skyline, a hilly neighborhood in southeastern San Diego. Mr. Donnell\u2019s mother encouraged him to show the photographer his flip.Chloe Kunkel at Sunset Cliffs Natural Park, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\u201cNone of my friends looked like me,\u201d said Aileen Nham, photographed in the Golden Hill neighborhood. \u201cPart of it was being in the Vietnamese culture, where I couldn\u2019t look like this.

{"Headline": "The Resegregation of Jefferson County", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "The Education IssueWhat one Alabama town\u2019s attempt to secede from its school district tells us about the fragile progress of racial integration in America.Supported byTo outsiders, these names are meaningless, but local residents knew exactly what was being said. In Jefferson County, like in any other racially mixed metropolitan area in the country, the names of towns and neighborhoods can serve as code, a way of referencing race without being explicit. Homewood, Hoover, Vestavia Hills and Trussville and their schools were heavily white. Center Point, Pleasant Grove and the others listed next to the girl all had large black populations \u2014 some had shifted from majority white to majority black.In Alabama, any town of more than 5,000 residents can vote to form its own school system, and over the years, members of Focus watched covetously as the neighboring white communities did just that. Gardendale, too, had considered secession for two decades but was deterred when feasibility studies showed that the town of nearly 14,000 could not support an independent school system, partly because the tax base could not generate enough revenue to replace its old and sagging high school. Gardendale lobbied Jefferson County to build a new multimillion-dollar high school, which opened in 2010, within the town\u2019s limits. In this community of modest homes and nondescript strip malls, Gardendale High, with its Grecian pillars and soaring, windowed foyer, spoke to the community\u2019s grander aspirations.The implication was clear. Center Point, which did not secede, has undergone a significant demographic shift as white residents fled to the districts that did. In 1970, only 30 black people lived among Center Point\u2019s nearly 16,000 residents and 12 black children went to Center Point Elementary. Today, the town is 63 percent black and its schools are 90 percent black.The town of Gardendale is 88 percent white, but its schools are now 25 percent black, in part because students bused in from North Smithfield, a working-class black community a few miles away, are zoned to schools located in Gardendale. Gardendale\u2019s secession would not eliminate black students from their schools, but by ensuring only students who lived in Gardendale could attend in the new district, it would significantly decrease their numbers.After lobbying by Focus, in 2013, Gardendale\u2019s all-white City Council voted to create a separate school system. A few months later in November, a measure to implement a property tax to fund the new school system passed with 58 percent of the vote. The City Council then appointed an all-white school board and hired its own superintendent.But there was just one thing: Jefferson County is one of a few hundred school systems in the country still bound by decades-old school desegregation court orders that came in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. Gardendale could not leave the district without the approval of the federal court in Birmingham. That court had been friendly to towns trying to secede, and the new school board apparently considered the desegregation order so inconsequential that it did not inform its new superintendent that it existed. So in February 2015, the Gardendale school board sent its lawyer to the federal court for what Gardendale secession supporters assumed would be a pro forma request to separate from the county schools. They were wrong.In light of the ruling, the Legal Defense Fund decided to challenge Lynne\u2019s order. They hired a recent law-school graduate named U.W. Clemon to help represent them. For Clemon, the case was deeply personal. He was a young black man born just a few miles west of Birmingham to a family of Mississippi sharecroppers who had migrated over so his father could trade the grueling work of picking cotton for the grueling work of feeding bricks into the kiln for United States Steel. The state of Mississippi didn\u2019t provide education for black children, and so his illiterate father never attended school; his mother\u2019s schooling at a black church ended after third grade. Clemon himself started his education at the Dolemite Colored School, a wood-frame structure with no indoor plumbing that was inferior in every way to the gleaming, modern school the white students in town attended. And though Clemon was only 11 in 1954 when the Supreme Court found segregated schools for black children unconstitutional, he never attended school with a white child.Despite graduating from all-black Miles College as the class valedictorian in 1965, the year the Stout lawsuit was filed, Clemon could not go to the state\u2019s only law school at the University of Alabama. That\u2019s because the university refused, still, to admit black students. To comply with a Supreme Court decision that forced states to provide equal access to graduate and professional schools for black residents, Alabama paid for students like Clemon to attend school out of state. He went to Columbia University in New York, a school far more prestigious and expensive than the University of Alabama. For the state, it was a calculated move. From the time when Alabama and other Southern states barred enslaved people from learning to read, there was an understanding that education led to resistance. In paying for its brightest black students to seek further education outside the state, Alabama bet that once those students lived away from Southern apartheid, they would never return. This calculation, however, did not account for people like Clemon, who graduated from law school and then immediately returned to Alabama to work to secure for thousands of Jefferson County\u2019s black children the constitutional rights that he had been denied.In the fall of 1968, Clemon stood in the courtroom of Judge Lynne, a segregationist known for issuing the dissent in the ruling to integrate Montgomery\u2019s buses following the boycott. Wearing a cheap dark suit he purchased at an army surplus store, Clemon stood before Lynne, a good old boy from Decatur, and argued that the judge\u2019s freedom-of-choice school-desegregation order no longer passed constitutional muster and he needed to alter it to force actual integration in the Jefferson County school district.Or, in Alabama, they could leave. In reaction to the Brown ruling, Alabama passed its school-secession law, and in 1959 Mountain Brook, an all-white, wealthy Birmingham suburb, withdrew from the Jefferson County school district. But the feared mandated desegregation did not occur, and so the other white towns stayed put until Clemon and the Legal Defense Fund secured the rezoning of the county\u2019s schools by court order in 1969. Pleasant Grove, a white, working-class town immediately moved to set up its own school district. The mostly-white towns of Homewood, Midfield and Vestavia Hills followed suit. Their strategy was simple: There could be no forced integration if there were no black children in the school system to integrate with.After decades of violent and brutal resistance, white Southerners largely acquiesced to the desegregation of other public places, of parks, restaurants, city buses and libraries. Contact in those spaces tended to be superficial, and if white people did not want to be around black people, they could simply avoid them. Schools were different. Nearly every American child, then and now, attended a public school. Schools were intimate. For hours each day, students sat next to one another, learned with one another, influenced one another. And also, most frightening, fell in love with one another. In the spring of 1954, as the Supreme Court was deliberating over the Brown case, President Dwight Eisenhower invited Chief Justice Earl Warren to dinner, where he attempted to explain that white Southerners \u201care not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negro.\u201d But even more than that, Americans saw schools as the primary drivers of opportunity and success, and white Americans had no desire to share access to the best schools and educational resources for which they\u2019d always held the monopoly.So instead of a quick hearing, Gardendale found itself taking part in what would be a five-day trial. On a crisp Alabama day in December 2016, the black witnesses filed into Birmingham\u2019s Hugo L. Black federal courthouse, named for the former Klansman who became a surprisingly liberal Supreme Court justice, and took seats on the benches behind the plaintiff\u2019s table. They sought, still, the fulfillment of the constitutional rights secured for black children of the county more than 60 years ago. On the defense\u2019s side, the secession supporters filed into their seats. Almost entirely white, they felt, as Gardendale\u2019s lawyers argued in their court filings, that \u201cthings have changed\u201d and that federal courts \u201cwere tired of school-desegregation litigation\u201d and so \u201ccourts must open their eyes to the conditions of the present.\u201d The desegregation order, they believed, had outlived its usefulness and was a relic from another time with no place in a modern world where black and white had the same rights before the law.The center aisle of the courtroom served as a physical divider between those in favor of the secession and those who were against it but also a metaphor for a much more impenetrable divide: On one side sat those who sought to be free of a past they do not want to remember; on the other sat those bound to a past they can never forget.If any one of them needed a reminder of how far this country had traveled toward living up to its creed, and how far it had still to go, they could look just a few feet ahead to the plaintiff\u2019s table. There U.W. Clemon sat, once again, to argue in the continuation of the very first school-desegregation case he worked on.It had been almost five decades since Clemon first stood in front of Lynne. His hair has thinned and turned white; his stride, slower. He has traded the army-surplus suits for finer Brooks Brothers threads. In a city once so hostile to black civil rights that it earned the nickname Bombingham, two streets now bear his name. When Clemon first entered the courtroom as a young lawyer, all the judges were white, but in 2008 he retired as the first black federal judge in the history of the state \u2014 turning in his resignation precisely two hours after the inauguration of the nation\u2019s first black president.It\u2019s something we Americans like to call coming full circle. But a circle returns to its beginning, and so, as is almost always the case when it comes to race in America, the victories would not be complete, nor would they be permanent. Nowhere is this more true than when it comes to schools.Clemon, who watched with growing despair as the integration efforts in the Jefferson County school district stalled and then eroded through the years, believed that Gardendale\u2019s attempt to break off mattered not just for Jefferson County but for the nation, where schools are resegregating at an alarming pace. Nationally, black children are more segregated today than they were a half century ago, in part because mostly-white well-off communities are separating themselves from diverse and poorer school systems.Gardendale\u2019s lawyers opened the trial, arguing first that Gardendale was not bound by the desegregation order at all because Jefferson County\u2019s schools had not been segregated for decades and so the order no longer mattered. But if the court did decide Gardendale was bound by the order, they said, its separation plan, which would allow them to take over the two elementary schools, the middle school and the high school located in Gardendale, would not hurt Jefferson County\u2019s desegregation efforts and so should be allowed.\u201cThere will be no credible evidence in this trial of racial animus motivating the Gardendale Board of Education,\u201d Aaron McLeod, a Gardendale lawyer, told the court. \u201cWhat the evidence instead will show is that the citizens of Gardendale cared so much about the education of their children that they raised their own taxes to enable their city to operate the schools their kids attend, and that is all that Gardendale is asking the court for today, to be allowed to operate its own school system for the sake of their children\u2019s education.\u201dGardendale called to the stand organizers of the effort. Chris Lucas, who works in banking and now sits on the Gardendale school board, moved to Gardendale after he had his first child because he could not afford the wealthier Birmingham suburbs that had already formed their own school systems. He said when he compared Jefferson County\u2019s schools with Mountain Brook and some of the state\u2019s other high-achieving school systems, the schools his children would go to just weren\u2019t up to par. Lucas said he had always figured he and his wife would move when their children became school-age. But then, he started having conversations with Salters, his friend, and others about how they did not want to leave and maybe they should do what those other communities had done.\u201cAt the end of the day, we want to provide a better education for the children so that they are prepared to go through life,\u201d he said from the witness stand. \u201cThere is no intention to harm any child,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe have a community that decided to pull itself up and provide a better education for its children. I\u2019m just flabbergasted that somebody would say, \u2018How dare you.\u2019 It blows my mind, frankly.\u201d (Lucas, Salters and other secession activists, along with all the Gardendale school-board members, the superintendent and all the City Council members, declined to be interviewed for this article.)Those who wanted to break off had some legitimate complaints about their schools \u2014 in some cases, children attended classes in trailers because of overcrowding, roofs sometimes leaked, textbooks could be in short supply and technology was too often outdated and broken. But the organizers also acknowledged in court testimony that they were satisfied with their children\u2019s teachers and that they had never complained to the district about conditions and were, in fact, pretty happy with how their children were performing. In court transcripts of the trial, it is clear that several years after the secession effort began, Lucas and others struggled to come up with specific ways that forming their own school system would improve education for their community. \u201cLocal control is also, I think, very important,\u201d Lucas said, echoing what other witnesses had said. \u201cAnd I also think that it\u2019s a known fact, whether you look in Jefferson County or whether you look across the state of Alabama or you look across the nation, that the better-performing public-school systems are city-based systems and they\u2019re smaller.\u201dBut there is no evidence that smaller school districts are better. In fact, they often have fewer resources because, as EdBuild\u2019s study shows, breakaway systems rack up significantly higher administrative costs, up to 60 percent more per pupil than larger systems. In addition, if Gardendale activists were focused only on the quality of the education, they would be concerned that Gardendale students who now have access to one of the best schools in the nation, an International Baccalaureate school in a nearby town, would have to pay out-of-district tuition to attend the school, if Gardendale broke off.Clemon pointed out that Lucas\u2019s statement simply did not match the facts. He asked Lucas if he knew that there were plenty of small city districts that performed poorly. \u201cWould that change your opinion?\u201d Clemon asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas responded. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t.\u201dHe and his wife had to battle against discrimination their entire lives, and they watched as many of the gains they fought for have eroded. They knew that behind Birmingham\u2019s new skyscrapers and fancy restaurants that served polenta instead of grits, the Old South still lurked. Racism had gone underground but not away. Reeves marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on Bloody Sunday in 1965 to achieve voting rights, only to watch decades later as the Supreme Court used a case from his home state to strike down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which the march had helped secure. As school systems across the South and the nation have resegregated, the Reeveses understood that the federal court order from 1971 was the only reason their own children, and now their grandchild, were able to attend integrated schools.Rickey Reeves anxiously waited for Clemon and the other lawyers representing the plaintiffs to make their case. Their argument was simple. Clemon had helped establish a precedent that secessions were not permissible if they undermined court-ordered desegregation. Judges had looked the other way and allowed other towns to leave. But if Gardendale seceded, it would take with it a substantial number of the white students left in the Jefferson County school district, and most likely more, if it annexed additional white communities as others had done. The fewer white children who remained in the system, the harder desegregation would become. The lawyers presented expert witnesses who explained how, if Gardendale left, too, Jefferson County would become even more black and how students who had once been assigned to Gardendale\u2019s integrated schools would, as a result of the separation, be rezoned to heavily segregated ones.The Legal Defense Fund also argued that it was racism, not the desire for local control, that was behind the secession effort. They pointed to a Facebook page that Focus activists had created. The very first post stated that forming their own school system would give Gardendale \u201cbetter control over the geographic composition of the student body.\u201d In another post, an organizer noted that the Jefferson County school district was busing children into \u201cour schools ... from as far away as Center Point\u201d and that \u201ca look around at our community sporting events, our churches are great snapshots of our community. A look into our schools, and you\u2019ll see something totally different.\u201d In another post, an organizer wrote that \u201cnonresident students are increasing at a [sic] alarming rate in our schools. Those students do not contribute financially. They consume the resources of our schools, our teachers and our resident students, then go home.\u201dSecession supporters had argued that their tax dollars should go to educate their own children instead of children who lived outside their community, that their shared responsibility stretched no further than the arbitrary borders of their town, even though for the vast history of the state, black taxpayers paid for white schools that their own children could not attend. The activists did not acknowledge that the public schools in Gardendale do not belong to Gardendale. They are paid for by the tax dollars of the entire county, including the parents of black children bused in. Moreover, students from neighboring Mount Olive also attended Gardendale schools, but Gardendale residents voiced no concerns about these students leaching resources or looking different from the community that showed up at Gardendale\u2019s sporting and church events. Instead, the conversations among Gardendale activists revolved around whether the town should annex Mount Olive so that its children would remain in the system. Mount Olive is 98 percent white.The lawyers for the black children of Jefferson County laid out a chronology that showed that when Gardendale secession advocates started working on secession, they assumed that breaking off would allow them to exclude from their schools all black children from outside Gardendale, including the children in North Smithfield. But after Gardendale\u2019s lawyers first announced their plan to the court in February 2015, the advocates discovered that Judge Pointer\u2019s 1971 desegregation order required all splinter districts to maintain a certain percentage of black students and that there were not enough black children in Gardendale\u2019s city limits to comply. The new district would have to include North Smithfield after all. The plaintiffs\u2019s lawyers presented emails and Facebook posts written by Gardendale residents saying they would never have supported secession if they knew that their new school district, paid for by taxing themselves, would still include the students who did not live in Gardendale.When it was Reeves\u2019s turn to testify, he walked from the gallery to the witness stand, raised his right hand, spelled his name for the court reporter, then looked at Clemon. The two men were of the same generation and had seen many of the same things. Law school had been Clemon\u2019s escape from segregation. Reeves chose the armed services.In a Black Belt accent clipped by the precision of the military, he talked about serving in the Air Force in Vietnam and then joining the National Guard, where he retired as a senior master sergeant after 24 years. He\u2019d worked as a telephone technician and in his free time tried to build up the North Smithfield community that some Gardendale residents had disparaged \u2014 joining its civic league, helping it get a charter and a fire district.Reeves spent his whole life serving his country and his community, and now, like Clemon, he found himself in his twilight years, doing it again. This fight was not for his family. \u201cMy duty, as I see it,\u201d he told the court, \u201cis to represent the blacks in Jefferson County.\u201d The secession, he believed, would be an injustice in a legacy of injustices.\u201cI was raised up in a segregated system, and I knew what could happen,\u201d Reeves told me in July, as we sat in his R.V. outside the second home he was renovating in his hometown Gadsden. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the same education they got, and I didn\u2019t want to see that happen again. I didn\u2019t want these children, any of our children, going through what we went through.\u201dReeves said he watched as other white communities left the Jefferson County school district, and now the secession had come to his doorstep with Gardendale\u2019s effort to exclude his community\u2019s children from its schools. \u201cI understand you are just trying to make your community better, but why hurt me to make yours better?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could just see it all reverting back. We have to draw a line in the sand and stop it. Somehow.\u201dDuring the second day of the trial Stephen Rowe, one of Gardendale\u2019s lawyers, called Sharon Porterfield Miller to the stand. \u201cIt\u2019s Dr. Miller, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rowe asked the petite, well-dressed woman in her 60s. The gallery peered on with interest. Miller has a doctorate in educational leadership, lives in Gardendale and supported Gardendale\u2019s effort to break away because she thought that smaller systems were generally better and may improve test scores. But most important for the defense, she is black.Court transcripts show Rowe expertly led her through her testimony. She moved to Gardendale 16 years ago because it was a quiet and older community. \u201cHave you and your husband enjoyed being residents of Gardendale?\u201d the lawyer asked.\u201cYes, we do.\u201dThen it was Clemon\u2019s turn to cross-examine Miller. Standing, he looked at her and gave her a warm smile. Clemon knew the witness \u2014 each Sunday they sat near each other during services at Sixth Avenue Baptist Church in Birmingham. His questions highlighted her experience with desegregation as one of the three black students allowed into a white high school in Aliceville, Ala. He pulled her through her biography, relaxing her: She\u2019d been a teacher and a principal in Jefferson County, earned her Ph.D. and serves as a chairwoman of the education department at his alma mater, Miles College.Then, casually, he turned to the fact that she had applied to sit on the Gardendale school board but had not been selected.\u201cDo you think you are qualified to be a member of the Gardendale Board of Education?\u201d he asked her.\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u201cHighly qualified?\u201d he asked.\u201cThe answer to your question is yes.\u201dWhat Clemon and everyone in the courtroom knew very well was that the all-white City Council had appointed an all-white school board. Miller told me later that when Gardendale announced the new board, she was dismayed to learn that only one of its members had any experience in K-12 education \u2014 a teacher who had worked directly under Miller during her tenure as a principal.Clemon asked Miller if she\u2019d felt disappointed when she was not chosen.\u201cYes, I was,\u201d she answered. \u201cI was.\u201d\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think it had anything to do with your race?\u201d Clemon asked.\u201dWell, I can\u2019t say that.\u201d she replied. \u201cYour question was, \u2018Was I disappointed.\u2019 Yes, I was really disappointed.\u201dClemon rephrased his question: \u201cLet me put it another way. Do you know of any reason which would justify your not being chosen other than your race?\u201dOne of Gardendale\u2019s lawyers objected. But instead of ruling on the objection, Judge Haikala restated the question directly to the witness.\u201cDo I feel race was part of the consideration?\u201d Miller asked.\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the judge responded.\u201cYes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI do.\u201dClemon sat back down. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201dGardendale then called the newly appointed superintendent, Patrick Martin, to testify. Gardendale had hired him away from a small, nearly all-white school system in rural Illinois. Under questioning from a Department of Justice lawyer, Martin said that he had not read the school desegregation order until a few months earlier, and he later acknowledged that he declined to meet with concerned black parents from North Smithfield. Eventually, Martin admitted a fact that surprised many in the courtroom: In nearly two decades as an educator, Martin had never hired a single black person for any position, nor worked with a single black teacher.It was late in a day that had felt very long, and everyone wanted to go home. Clemon and Lin-Luse recall Haikala\u2019s calling for a break. When Haikala returned to the bench, she turned to Martin, the superintendent, and asked a simple question:\u201cHave you read the Brown v. Board of Education decision from 1954?\u201dAt Haikala\u2019s words, Clemon looked up sharply.\u201cI\u2019ve read about the decision, yes, your honor,\u201d Martin answered.\u201cHave you read it?\u201d the judge asked.Martin said he hadn\u2019t read the entire ruling. Haikala handed him a copy. \u201cWhat have you read about it?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a test. I\u2019m curious to know what your understanding is.\u201dIf Gardendale won, Martin would oversee a school system located in the very cradle of the Confederacy, one that is still under a school-desegregation order. Martin fumbled a bit, struggling to describe what is considered by many the most important Supreme Court ruling of the 20th century, the ruling at the center of why they were all gathered in the courtroom that day. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a very good job of showing I was a history teacher, am I, your honor?\u201d Martin said. \u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cI told you it is not meant to be a test,\u201d Haikala replied. She then proceeded to go through the ruling. She voiced concern about the black students that Gardendale residents had talked so openly of excluding, emphasizing how the justices in Brown struck down segregation in large part because it stigmatized and demeaned black children.Then she read out loud part of the Brown opinion that focused on how segregation made black children feel inferior: \u201cSegregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children,\u201d she read. \u201cThe impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law. For the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn.\u201dWithout warning, tears started to stream down Clemon\u2019s face. \u201cIt was one of the most emotional moments of my life,\u201d he told me months later from the dining-room table of his Birmingham home. \u201cShe wanted to impress upon the superintendent the serious ramifications of Brown. I had never in my lifetime seen a judge read Brown in court, and I am more than threescore and 10.\u201d He added, \u201cI never expect to see it again.\u201dStill, Clemon and the other lawyers representing the black children of Jefferson County felt the trial went exceptionally well. After it was over, Clemon went home, culled from the transcript the passage where Haikala read the Brown decision to the superintendent and emailed it to colleagues all over the country, with a note: Can you believe this?In painstaking detail, Haikala laid out the 62-year history of school-desegregation case law and then each and every important fact of the current case. Within the first five paragraphs, she dismissed Gardendale\u2019s assertion that these court orders were inconsequential after all these years and also laid out the linchpin of her ruling. \u201cThe Court\u2019s desegregation order is designed to remedy the injury that institutionalized racial segregation causes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Brown is simple and unaffected by the passage of time: When black public-school students are treated as if they are inferior to white students, and that treatment is institutionalized by state or municipal action, the resulting stigma unconstitutionally assails the integrity of black students. That racial stigma is intolerable under the 14th Amendment.\u201d She added, \u201cThat was true in 1954, and it is true today.\u201dHaikala pointed out how the organizers of the Gardendale secession movement gave \u201cevasive responses\u201d about why they wanted to form their own system but that they wanted \u201cgeneral improvements of education.\u201d None had ever contacted the Jefferson County school district about their complaints, and she noted that one organizer said that his own children were doing well. The school-board president, she wrote, acknowledged that he was not even involved in his children\u2019s schools.She wrote about the testimony of one North Smithfield parent who said it felt bad that Gardendale wanted to exclude children from her community, until they found out that they had to include them, if they wanted to secede, and that she feared North Smithfield children would be scrutinized and treated like outsiders in the new system. Then Haikala wrote that if Gardendale splintered off, it would hurt the desegregation of the larger district, just as other secessions had. That alone, because of the precedent Clemon helped set in the Stout case decades earlier, was enough to put an end to the secession effort.Then on Page 138 of her opinion, Haikala went further than anyone expected. The Gardendale school board had argued that the dispute over the secession \u201cis not about segregation. ... Nor is this dispute about racism.\u201d With one sentence, she eviscerated that assertion: \u201cThe Court finds that race was a motivating factor in Gardendale\u2019s decision to separate from the Jefferson County public school system.\u201dShe went on: \u201cMore specifically, a desire to control the racial demographics of the four public schools in the City of Gardendale and the racial demographics of the city itself motivated the grass-roots effort to separate and eliminate from the Gardendale school zone black students whom Jefferson County transports to Gardendale schools under the terms of the desegregation order.\u201dClemon paused over those words. These days, he knew, you have about as a good a chance of winning the lottery as getting a federal judge to make a new finding of intentional discrimination in school cases. \u201cI was deeply impressed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe compelling evidence of racism was there, but she could have just stuck with the other issue.\u201dBut then, on Page 181 of the 190-page order, Clemon read these words: \u201cGiven these findings, the Court would be within its discretion if it were simply to deny Gardendale\u2019s motion to separate. Were it not for a number of practical considerations, the Court would do just that.\u201dHe sped through the remaining pages. Haikala had, despite her finding of intentional discrimination, decided to give Gardendale ownership over the county\u2019s two elementary schools located in Gardendale for the coming school year. In order to do so, she required the appointment of a black school-board member and for Gardendale to work with the plaintiffs and the Justice Department to come up with a desegregation plan to govern the new district. Gardendale would also either have to relinquish the high school that Jefferson County residents had paid for and that served students from several other communities or repay the county $33 million for the school. After doing that and then operating the two schools \u201cin good faith\u201d for three years, Haikala said she would reconsider their motion for a full separation.When Reeves read the ruling, he felt shock and then confusion. How could the judge find that Gardendale\u2019s residents had been motivated by racism and still allow them to create a separate school system? \u201cI felt all along she was going to rule against them, and then in the end, she said we\u2019re going to give them a chance,\u201d he told me, slightly shaking his head. \u201cI think she was trying to please everyone. I was let down.\u201dLast, and most critical, she wrote that the Jefferson County school district could very well make enough progress toward desegregation in the next few years to be released from its court order because the Supreme Court has determined that school districts have to prove to a court only that they have integrated \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d Once that was the case, Haikala worried, then Gardendale would be free to break off without the oversight of the court.Haikala was surely aware of this when she wrote: \u201cHistory teaches that communities, left to their own devices, resegregate fairly quickly. ... In doing the complicated work of dissolving a desegregation order, a court must ensure that the dying embers of de jure segregation aren\u2019t once again fanned into flames.\u201dHaikala understood that if she allowed Gardendale to create its own district, she could place the town under its own separate desegregation order and monitor the school system for a longer period of time.When the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Brown, which laid the foundation for the destruction of legal segregation not just in schools but in every other aspect of American life, it considered segregation a vestige of slavery. There is this beautiful phrasing taken up by the court in a 1968 school-desegregation opinion that says all these vestiges of slavery had to be eliminated \u201croot and branch.\u201d The history of school desegregation has shown that getting rid of the branches is the easier part. You can chop a tree down to the stump, but if the roots run deep enough, it will grow again. Clemon knows this better than most. The legal barriers fell and for a fleeting moment, during the prime of his life, the nation seemed poised to right its wrongs. His own children never knew the degradation of segregation. But too many of the grandchildren of Brown have known nothing but.What the Gardendale case demonstrates with unusual clarity is that changes in the law have not changed the hearts of many white Americans. As the historian Bagley wrote, when it comes to school segregation, \u201cthere would be no moral awakening.\u201d\u201cI never envisioned that I would be fighting in 2017 essentially the same battle that I thought I won in 1971,\u201d Clemon, who can recite the Stout case number from memory, told me. \u201cBut the battle is just not over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Russian Meddling, Mark Zuckerberg Follows a Familiar Playbook", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI knew the big Mark Zuckerberg speech was coming. It always does.Mr. Zuckerberg, in particular, has come to see his own role in guiding Facebook\u2019s community, and the trust the community places in him, as crucial to the fate of the corporation. So when the heat from American lawmakers regarding ads placed by Russian trolls on Facebook began to rise, Mr. Zuckerberg had no option to ignore it; he had to say something.But these messages aren\u2019t just show. Inside Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s exhortations carry the weight of God. That\u2019s why the detailed plan he offered to address election meddling is a very big deal.Like all tech leaders, Mr. Zuckerberg is often hailed as a visionary, but his primary talent is as a reactor. His true skill is not in seeing ahead, but in looking back and fixing where Facebook has failed. And what\u2019s noteworthy is that when he marshals Facebook\u2019s considerable resources to address a problem, Mr. Zuckerberg has a track record of making things right.I am not asking you to blindly accept that Facebook will be able to completely address the role it plays in modern propaganda wars. On Russian meddling specifically, it took Facebook more than 10 months after the election to reveal that Russian trolls had bought ads through Facebook, and then it further dragged its feet on deciding to make those ads available to Congress.\u201cPersonally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way \u2014 I think is a pretty crazy idea,\u201d he said at a tech conference days after last year\u2019s presidential election. Since then, he has slowly \u2014 too slowly \u2014 come around to the idea that social media may not be the force for good in the world that he and other optimists always promised.But it is worth noting that this sort of thing has happened before. Throughout Facebook\u2019s history, on questions of privacy and advertising and business strategy, he has repeatedly fallen behind, then issued blog posts begging for another chance to put things right.Next, he will offer a specific plan for the future, often soliciting feedback from users. And he tends to end on a ringing plea for another chance, as he did this week: \u201cIt is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation states attempting to subvert elections,\u201d he said in his address on Thursday. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion.\u201dThis promise reminded me of a very different but equally daunting problem that Facebook faced five years ago. It had just floated its stock on the public markets, and things were not looking good. For the first time in its blessed rise, experts were questioning the social network\u2019s future.Then, finally, after much prodding by investors, Mr. Zuckerberg came around. He tore up the company\u2019s old mobile strategy and brought in new leadership to manage a new one. Getting Facebook\u2019s mobile apps working perfectly became the company\u2019s top priority \u2014 not just for a handful of teams, but for everyone who worked at Facebook, from Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg on down.It was a do-or-die moment \u2014 and Facebook did. At first slowly and then quicker than anyone might have guessed, more people began to use Facebook on their phones \u2014 which drove more advertisers to place ads on Facebook\u2019s mobile apps. Soon, Facebook\u2019s mobile growth eclipsed that of every other social app, and it became indomitable. Today, of the more than two billion people who use Facebook every month, most use it on their phones \u2014 and nearly 90 percent of Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue comes from mobile devices.The latest series of scandals engulfing Facebook has not affected its business, which under Ms. Sandberg\u2019s leadership remains brisk. But they present no less of an existential problem.Facebook\u2019s main asset is us, its users; how we users and lawmakers perceive Facebook\u2019s effect on our lives \u2014 and on our democracies and national security \u2014 is a crucial factor in its future. In addition to possible regulatory oversight of its advertising engine, there\u2019s a more straightforward worry that we will all become wary of the company\u2019s might \u2014 and will think twice about letting it get ever deeper into our lives, as it is wont to do.A friend and mentor who knows Mr. Zuckerberg well told me recently that his greatest skill is his ability to learn from his mistakes. He was late to appreciate how the world\u2019s most-used social service might be used for ill. Now that he finally seems to understand the problem, there may be hope that he can do something about it.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201dThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The workampers\u2019 RVs look like \u201cmobile apothecaries,\u201d Bruder writes. Amazon\u2019s warehouses feature wall-mounted dispensers of free painkillers.

Not to mention that in the light of the death of Philando Castile, among others, and the beating of Sureshbhai Patel, the open road seems romantic only to some.

(\u201cPerhaps the problem was racism?\u201d) It\u2019s all over in a page and a half.

{"Headline": "Who Will Save These Dying Italian Towns?", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "Near-empty villages try to hold on to an endangered way of life \u2014 and some of the country\u2019s most important artisanal traditions.Supported byTHE FIRST THING that must be said about the ancient town of Civita di Bagnoregio, just two hours away from Rome and Florence, is that it is beautiful. From a distance, it looks literally otherworldly: The town sits so high atop a perilously steep pinnacle of eroding volcanic rock that it seems as if it\u2019s perched upon clouds rather than tethered to the earth. Its very sediment is strafed with 2,500 years of architectural history: Etruscan caves, ancient remains, medieval dwellings and Renaissance villas.Originally a center along ancient trade routes, Civita di Bagnoregio was prosperous from Roman times through the late Middle Ages. But after a devastating earthquake in 1695, most residents fled for lower ground, and so began the city\u2019s long decline. By the end of World War II, nearly all of its inhabitants had left in search of work in cities or abroad. For the last half century, its population has hovered around 10 or so full-time residents.Because the erosion of the hill is so severe (houses have been tumbling off its sides since the 1700s), Civita di Bagnoregio will eventually be reclaimed by the landscape. Residents and visitors alike must park at the base and ascend a steep footbridge to enter through a huge Gothic archway. Past the backless facade of a Renaissance house, with several of its windows open to the sky like a stage set, lies a small, dusty piazza with a church, a fine seventh-century medieval tower, a small bar and not much else. There is no pharmacy or school, no hospital, none of the necessities that somehow serve to make a place a place. There are only a couple of inns, and a few restaurants. Civita is real without being actual, if that makes any sense.FOR ALL THE ANCIENT Italian hill towns and villages that delight the traveler \u2014 the San Gimignanos, Montepulcianos and Fiesoles \u2014 there are scores of others (many equally or more beautiful) where few venture and in which very few reside today. According to a 2016 Italian environmental association report, there are nearly 2,500 rural Italian villages that are perilously depopulated, some semi-abandoned and others virtual ghost towns. A primary narrative of Italy in the 20th century has been what followed the collision of poverty, urbanization, mass emigration and natural disaster, a confluence of events that has devastated many towns that had otherwise managed to thrive, or at least get by, for centuries. These towns, most of which are in the historically impoverished south, had already lost tens of millions of inhabitants in the great waves of migration from the late 19th century to the mid 1970s; in the last 25 years, they lost another 15 percent. Now, houses and schools sit empty and fields fallow; shops are unattended.These rural places were once intricately tied to the countryside around them, their inhabitants working as farmers and merchants, craftsmen and shepherds. But when these towns die, it\u2019s not just the population that suffers: so too do the unique traditions and skills associated with each place, as well as the landscape that supported them. This phenomenon is, of course, not unique to Italy: Small towns across the developed world, including in the United States, are left behind as technologies and economies change, rendering the industries and the know-how that once sustained them obsolete, forcing their populations to relocate to urban centers. What is particular to Italy, however, is the exquisite architectural character of its hill towns, as well as the quality of the handiwork and traditions that were born, cultivated and perfected here. These towns and their craftsmanship are what we think of when we think of Italy \u2014 as fundamental to the country\u2019s identity as its important cities and grand artistic legacies. It isn\u2019t far-fetched to say that what\u2019s at risk of being lost with their obsolescence is nothing less than Italy\u2019s rural soul.But though these towns may represent the essence of Italian history and the country\u2019s artisanal tradition, the government has done little to help preserve them, aside from declaring 2017 \u2018\u2018The Year of the Villages\u2019\u2019 in hopes of boosting tourism. It has therefore fallen to locals \u2014 citizens and mayors \u2014 to try to change their fates, often through inventive, sometimes ingenious, methods that mingle humor with a deep sorrow and desperation. One picturesque medieval hamlet in Tuscany, Pratariccia, sold itself on eBay for $3.1 million several years ago. Another, Calsazio, tried to follow, offering itself for only $333,000, listing the item\u2019s condition as \u2018\u2018used.\u2019\u2019 In Calabria, the mayor of Sellia (population 530) signed a decree banning death and illness in his town, and recently opened an adventure park with a giant zip line he thought would lure visitors. Most recently, the mayor of Bormida in Liguria floated a provisional offer on his Facebook page: $2,100 to anyone who moved there in order to keep it populated. (There was so much interest that he had to delete the post.)And then there are towns like Civita di Bagnoregio. Like so many of the others, it has been preserved by the very forces that doomed it: poverty and abandonment. Unlike the others, however, Civita was saved by having been \u2018\u2018discovered\u2019\u2019 by fashionable Romans (including Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele) and expats over the last 20 or so years, who have made summer houses or weekend places of its exceptionally fine, deserted buildings, drawn by the romance of Civita\u2019s remarkable situation \u2014 and its proximity to Rome. The restoration of the entire town is eerily pristine; there\u2019s nary a yellowing leaf on the potted geraniums and colorful hydrangeas that grace the exterior of every perfectly renovated house.These days, Civita has become a tourist destination for day trippers, who arrive by the busload and pay a small fee to enter. Sometimes up to 5,000 people a day wander the town, which at its seasonal height sleeps only about 100. The effect of all these people \u2014 selfie sticks moving through the air like antennae \u2014 gives the place the unfortunate air of a Disney set: a hyper-clean, historically accurate medieval town as realized on a Universal Studios back lot. There is nothing to mar the scene \u2014 no pizzerias or Starbucks or even cars. And just as one starts to wonder what kind of town is one in which there are no children or families, no banks or offices, dusk starts to fall, and the tourists and the white heat of the day retreat. Things go quiet, the light glows pink and the \u2018\u2018locals,\u2019\u2019 many from Rome and the U.S., start to appear \u2014 there are drinks on terraces and quiet dinners in the side streets, conversations in private gardens among neighbors and friends who know one another, and who all love and care for this enchanted, imperiled piece of history.BUT THE FARTHER ONE gets from major cities like Florence or Rome, the more difficult it is to attract weekend tourists. Deep in Sicily, off a terrible road whose signs resignedly warn of potholes, lies the isolated town of Sutera, built around the base of a steep mountain. In 2013, at the behest of its mayor, the town opened its doors \u2014 and its empty houses \u2014 to survivors of the catastrophic Lampedusa shipwreck, which killed more than 360 refugees. Sutera\u2019s population had dwindled from 5,000 in 1970 to just 1,500, and the mayor recognized the humanitarian and economic opportunity the migrants could provide for his moribund town. To help the refugees, most of whom are from sub-Saharan Africa, integrate into the community, they are paired with local families, and required to take Italian lessons, given to them by the town\u2019s citizens. (The European Union provides funding for food, clothing and housing, which can spur the creation of jobs for both migrants and locals.) Initially, there was some resistance, but that has disappeared with the energy these newcomers have brought to the area. Today, one can find young Nigerians taking their morning espresso alongside the old men, and local children kicking soccer balls in the street with their new playmates. And each summer the town hosts a daylong festival featuring the traditional food, music and dance of the immigrants.One of the first towns to invite migrants into its walls was Riace, in Calabria, whose mayor, Domenico Lucano, was named one of Fortune\u2019s \u2018\u2018World\u2019s 50 Greatest Leaders\u2019\u2019 last year. By 1998, when it took in a group of Kurdish refugees, Riace\u2019s population had fallen to around 800 from 2,500 after World War II. Today, its population is 1,500, with migrants from over 20 countries. Some of these are apprenticing artisans, learning old skills like embroidery, glass mosaic and pottery that were themselves dying out, and so helping keep Italian culture alive. Lucano told the BBC, \u2018\u2018The multiculturalism, the variety of skills and personal stories which people have brought to Riace, have revolutionized what was becoming a ghost town.\u2019\u2019 Other towns have taken Riace\u2019s lead, too: an act of humanity that has become an act of self-preservation as well.UNLIKE URBAN CENTERS, hill towns were built to be connected to the countryside, which provided each its particular raison d\u2019\u00eatre, from its subsistence to its commerce. Even physically, the towns appear like natural outcroppings, terraced along the sides of hills, as if sprouting from the earth beneath them.In the region of Abruzzo, surrounded by the high peaks of the Apennines, the stunning fortified medieval hilltop village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio sits atop a ridge overlooking a dramatic and lush plateau. Once a bustling center of agriculture and wool production, it began to shrink when the Italian wool industry went into decline, crippled by competition from abroad. By the 1990s, the town had only about 100 full-time residents. Santo Stefano is just two hours from Rome and is surrounded by countryside that resembles the Austrian hills of \u2018\u2018The Sound of Music\u2019\u2019: expansive fields of wildflowers backed by majestic snowcapped mountains. It is a sublime place for hiking or bicycling in summer and skiing or snowshoeing in winter. And yet, Abruzzo, long considered poor and backward, has never been particularly beloved by Italians, and consequently, not much considered or well known.The ancient hill town came as a shock, a revelation really, to Daniele Kihlgren, the renegade scion of an Italian concrete fortune, when he came upon it while on a motorcycle ride in the late 1990s. Although semi-abandoned, its medieval character and architecture were completely intact \u2014 unruined, ironically, by concrete, the material Kihlgren is the first to acknowledge has disgraced so much of Italy. How, he wondered, might places of such distinct and exquisite beauty be revitalized without wrecking their historic identity? And how might their local traditions, from food to domestic handicrafts, be organically preserved? \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t compete with China in mass production, and we can\u2019t compete in technology,\u2019\u2019 Kihlgren says, \u2018\u2018but we have what no one else in the world has,\u2019\u2019 which is the beauty of these villages and the cultural history of its people, the stuff he calls Italy\u2019s minor patrimony. \u2018\u2018And if we don\u2019t ruin it, it can be what saves southern Italy.\u2019\u2019It is also what has helped revive it. Thanks largely to Sextantio, there are now new jobs, thousands of tourists annually, nearly two dozen new bed-and-breakfasts and several restaurants, galleries and shops. But Kihlgren has sunk his fortune into this project \u2014 as well as into other villages that he has bought, either outright or partially, with the intention of resurrecting them using the same model. While his is primarily a cultural project, he is keenly aware that unless it can make money and be replicated, it is just a folly in his grand quest to resuscitate southern Italy. And indeed, there have been many difficulties and setbacks \u2014 from his own high standards to the devastating earthquake that rocked the region in 2009. This past July marked the first month since the project\u2019s inception in which he made a profit.Still, Kihlgren remains optimistic \u2014 and how can anyone who loves Italy not root for his success? \u2018\u2018If I, someone with no business skills at all, can make this work,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018then there is hope \u2014 hope that the values contained in these small historical places can be the engine to revitalize them.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Omega, a New Factory for Orders from China", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAugust frustrates Raynald Aeschlimann, president and chief executive at Omega.When he welcomed a guest to his office for a tour of the company\u2019s new production building here early last month, the 47-year-old chief executive was clearly unhappy. Production was running at just 60 percent of capacity, largely because Omega suppliers still shut down for almost the entire month, a summer holiday tradition in Europe.\u201cI want to run a full 52 weeks,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the adjacent building where, the tour later showed, rows of assembly desks were only about half occupied.Like most Swiss watch brands, Omega and its parent company, Swatch Group, have had a rough few years. Omega experienced a sharp drop in sales in 2015, which it linked to China\u2019s economic slowdown and the government\u2019s continuing crackdown on corruption and high-priced gifts.Mr. Aeschlimann called June a \u201cstrong month\u201d for Omega, noting double-digit sales growth in China, its star market.\u201cThis year is very positive for some brands in China, and we are one of them,\u201d Mr. Aeschlimann said. He added that half of Omega\u2019s business now comes from Asia, where the Constellation watch is Omega\u2019s market leader, especially prized by middle-class Chinese buyers. \u201cLooking at the future,\u201d he added, \u201cwe expect results to be better than ever next year.\u201dThe five-story production building, which the company calls Building O, was planned to support expansion. The 172,225-square-foot structure, designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, combines watchmaking facilities previously housed in three buildings. And it\u2019s big enough, Omega executives hope, for 30 to 50 more years of growth.With the official opening scheduled for November \u2014 two years later than originally planned because of architectural revisions \u2014 workmen in August were paving the parking lot, and the vacant reception area on the ground floor was awaiting finishing and furniture.Building O is not the only Swatch construction project on the outskirts of this Swiss watchmaking city. Adjacent is a new Swatch-Omega museum, now a skeleton of steel girders covered in plastic tarps and scaffolding, and just beyond is the construction site of a new Swatch headquarters. Both are scheduled to open in 2018.At the center of Building O is a giant glass-enclosed atrium three floors deep, an inventory area called \u201cthe heart,\u201d with 30,000 stacked boxes of watch parts that are retrieved as needed by a roving automated arm.During the methodical assembly process, each watch is handled by as many as 20 technicians before receiving a final stamp of approval. For 20 percent of Omega timepieces, that approval is the Master Chronometer certificate provided by the Federal Institute of Metrology, or Metas, an independent Swiss government laboratory that operates on-site. Its workers test watches for water resistance, accurate timekeeping and magnetic resistance; by 2020, Omega said, most of its watches will be certified by Metas.\u201cFive years ago, we saw trend of our sales and said, \u2018Now is the time\u2019 \u201d to begin certification, Mr. Aeschlimann said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of where we are.\u201dThe executive\u2019s elegant suit and easy conversation reflect his cosmopolitan background. He shifted quickly from French \u2014 what he called \u201cthe language of the watch industry\u201d \u2014 into a mix of English and German. \u201cI am the Swiss-French link,\u201d he said, noting a quarter of his staff members speak Swiss German as a first language.On this particular day, he was wearing one of the 34 models of the upgraded Seamaster Aqua Terra line introduced in March. At 41 millimeters, the watch is a mix of stainless steel and gold, with a silvery dial, a black rubber strap and the company\u2019s Co-Axial Master Chronometer Caliber 8900.And what has been the biggest surprise of Mr. Aeschlimann\u2019s 15-month tenure?He said it was the overwhelming response to \u201cSpeedy Tuesday,\u201d a limited edition of Omega\u2019s iconic Speedmaster.In 2012, Robert-Jan Broer, founder and editor of the online magazine Fratello Watches, posted a picture of his Speedmaster on Facebook with the words \u201cSpeedy Tuesday\u201d \u2014 and a weekly craze was born that eventually moved to Instagram and has elicited about 70,000 photographs from fans. Last fall, Mr. Broer and Mr. Aeschlimann began working on the idea of a limited-edition version of the watch to mark the event\u2019s fifth anniversary.\u201cIt shows how quickly a decision taken can bring success,\u201d Mr. Aeschlimann said, adding that there are no plans to replicate the project but that Omega is exploring more online sales options.Mr. Aeschlimann also has been mining some of the brand\u2019s hallmark connections.In May, Omega announced that its partnership with the International Olympic Committee would extend through 2032, the centenary of its sponsorship of the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. (It won\u2019t give a sneak preview of the watches planned for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, but the Seamaster Planet Ocean 600M, a limited edition released in February, has not sold out.)As for Omega\u2019s sales targets, Mr. Aeschlimann said he wanted to bolster the brand\u2019s profile among women.The house\u2019s \u201cHer Time\u201d exhibition, a mix of women\u2019s timepieces and advertising campaigns that has been shown from Milan to Shanghai, will be opening in Paris in late September, during fashion week. He said Omega had high hopes that women would embrace the Speedmaster 38 millimeter \u2014 its Cappuccino model is featured prominently in the current advertising campaigns and boutique windows.Despite his executive position, Mr. Aeschlimann still spends 30 percent of his time traveling \u2014 and he is adamant that Omega stores around the world will remain the company\u2019s backbone. \u201cWe could close every boutique and only sell on the internet with e-commerce, but we haven\u2019t even thought of it,\u201d he said, stressing that the store experience is essential to the company\u2019s long-term success in sales.A case in point: The boutique on Zurich\u2019s famed Bahnhofstrasse is among the brand\u2019s busiest and most successful shops. This summer, it included a flashy Speedmaster Moonwatch exhibition, an event marking the 60th anniversary of the first Speedmaster model as well as its historic 1969 turn as the first watch worn on the moon. As visitors examined the mannequin in an astronaut\u2019s suit at the door and a variety of watches on display, the service staff on the boutique\u2019s main floor not only repaired watches but also told stories to prospective buyers \u2014 about Omega on the moon, in the Bond films, at the Olympics.\u201cPeople who pay a lot for our watches are passionate about stories,\u201d Mr. Aeschlimann said. \u201cTo have an experience, go to our stores.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Fashion sure is. Themes and motifs pillaged from the Wild West \u2014 or our fantasy of it \u2014 played out all over the fall 2017 runways, most notably at Raf Simons\u2019s debut collection for Calvin Klein, which featured bygone staples in unexpected color combinations.But unlike many designer trends, this one is available in fine form at a variety of prices. Case in point: Wrangler, a company that can rightfully lay claim to the look, has teamed up with the seminal 1970s designer Peter Max on a collection that\u2019s as psychedelic as it is cowboy appropriate, and won\u2019t eat up your entire shopping budget. Explore that, and other key pieces, below.Wrangler\u2019s under-the-radar collaboration is chock-full of Western-inspired pieces updated for 2017. They\u2019re probably not fit for the saddle but perfect for exploring the arguably wilder frontiers of Manhattan\u2019s city streets. Embroidered details deliver the message without being overpowering. In a dark wash, boot-cut jeans, cropped and frayed, are the perfect base. The subtle Calvin Klein take on cowboy boots is a good way for those of us who fear appearing as if Halloween has come early to indulge in the trend. Levi\u2019s classic trucker jacket has always had rugged appeal. In tawny suede, with a sherpa collar, it\u2019s ready for the range. In silk, a western shirt is dressy enough for dinner or the office. Pair with jeans for the chuck wagon, smart black slacks for work. In understated cream, with minimal embellishment, Rocco P.\u2019s boots are just the right amount of cowboy. If you\u2019re bold enough to go all in on the trend, a fringe jacket with embroidered detail is the ticket. What\u2019s the speediest way to add some rancher flair to jeans and a T-shirt?

{"Headline": "Is Germany Still a Haven for Israelis? After Election, Some Wonder", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Some freaked out.Others, glancing around the globe \u2014 to other European nations, to the United States, and even back home to Israel \u2014 comforted themselves with the fact that the far right remains far from taking control in Germany.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a game-changer,\u201d said Guy Weinberger, 47, a Tel Aviv native who co-founded a marketing company in Berlin. \u201cTrump won. Here, they have only 12 percent.\u201dSunday\u2019s national elections in Germany prompted a fresh round of questions about populist election gains across the West. But for many Israelis, thousands of whom have flocked to Berlin in recent years for its socially liberal politics, thriving arts scene and economy, both the campaign and the result were especially problematic.Were the very things that have made Germany seem so safe to so many Israelis \u2014 the national preoccupation with contrition, aversion to raw nationalism, and determination never to repeat the sins of the past \u2014 now in danger of being shunted aside by a new generation unburdened by collective guilt and determined to assert its national identity?Was Israel\u2019s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was \u201cconcerned about the rise of anti-Semitism\u201d on both the political right and left, and noted that \u201cthere are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.\u201d He called on Ms. Merkel\u2019s new government to \u201cact to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.\u201dAmong the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was \u201ca bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.\u201dYet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the \u201c20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,\u201d whether for \u201ccheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese\u201d or to live under \u201cthe wonderful German democracy\u201d out of a \u201cdistorted\u201d leftism. Both groups, he said, were \u201cemotional cripples.\u201d\u201cThese Israelis,\u201d Mr. Eldad wrote, \u201care not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.\u201dOn the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election \u201cmakes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthe situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.\u201dEven after Sunday\u2019s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. \u201cThe norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we\u2019re a much bigger minority, and there\u2019s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.\u201dEldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday\u2019s vote were \u201csuffering from blindness.\u201d But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD \u201cbecause they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.\u201dIndeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: \u201cThere are strong feelings of fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I\u2019m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.\u201dShai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing \u201cbecause they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.\u201dHe sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a \u201creflex of phobia for Muslims,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.\u201d\u201cAs long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.\u201dHe said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country\u2019s politics.\u201cI\u2019m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it\u2019s important to do those things.\u201dYounger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.\u201cUndoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?\u201dBut some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor na\u00efve.Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.\u201cI think it\u2019s just part of the world moving toward dark times,\u201d she said of the rightward drift. \u201cBut I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.\u201dIrit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But she was positive that she had selected the right photo.\u201cAt a certain point in the interaction, I had to let go of this desire to make this person like me and remind myself that my allegiance was with Glamour and with what I thought was the right cover,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I just went for it and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry but this is the cover we\u2019re going to run.\u2019\u201d Ms. Leive said the actress took it in stride and that she never again offered anyone cover approval.Figuring out how to leverage the internet wasn\u2019t easy, either. \u201cI had what I thought was the most brilliant idea,\u201d she said of a notion that occurred to her around 2010. Glamour could use its famous \u201cDos and Don\u2019ts\u201d rubric to encourage readers to submit photographs of people wearing the good or the ugly. Visitors to the website would be encouraged to weigh in.There was a huge influx of traffic, Ms. Leive said, but not just that. \u201cI actually opened Pandora\u2019s box for a troll convention to take place on Glamour.com,\u201d she said. She and her staff decided to hit delete.She also learned that not every story she thought was splashy would actually make a splash. For the July 2015 issue, Kim Kardashian West appeared on the cover of Glamour, addressing publicly her feelings about the gender transition of her family member Caitlyn Jenner. Ms. Leive and her staff planned a full press rollout.\u201cLiterally an hour before we were putting it out, Vanity Fair\u2019s Caitlyn Jenner cover comes out,\u201d Ms. Leive said. \u201cSo my scoop didn\u2019t look that great, and all of a sudden I was getting angry letters from people wanting to know why I was referring to Caitlyn Jenner as Bruce in the magazine.\u201d She laughed, sounding amused and still a little exasperated.She also made Hillary Clinton the first presidential candidate to be endorsed by Glamour. Ms. Leive says Anna Wintour, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s artistic director and Ms. Leive\u2019s boss, deserves much of the credit for that. When Ms. Leive broached the idea with her, she said that Ms. Wintour said, \u201cIf you think this is what is right for your audience and for women, then you should do it.\u201dAll this is why Ms. Leive bristles at the suggestion that her decision to leave magazines, amid something that is approaching a brain drain of longtime magazine honchos, signals that glossies are losing their sheen.Not that she\u2019s complaining about being in the company of Ms. Myers, Ms. Gibbs and Mr. Carter. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty nice outgoing class to be in, I\u2019ll take it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can all hang out in the corner booth somewhere.\u201dOnly if a former editor in chief can still snag the corner booth, she is reminded.\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t get a corner booth anymore, good point!\u201d she said, and cracked up. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to meet on my back deck, fending off the dog.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Residents were struggling to communicate after phone lines and power were knocked out across the island, said Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit.Calling 911 is still the recommended way to reach qualified emergency workers. But traditional dispatchers are well aware that new technologies are changing the landscape of disaster response.\u201cPeople were in the very early stages of using Facebook messages and tweets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe messages were monitored by the New York City Fire Department\u2019s social media person. I believe she was an intern.\u201dIt was an early sign of the ways social media could complicate traditional emergency response protocols.\u201cSocial media is becoming a tool for the younger generation to reach out to express their need for help, and in some 911 centers they are aware of social media and will try to monitor it as best they can,\u201d said Brian Fontes, NENA\u2019s chief executive.But he added that of the thousands of 911 call centers across the United States, fewer than a quarter are even equipped to receive text messages.NENA is working on a plan called Next Generation 911, which would overhaul the system to make it more modern. But Mr. Fontes said it had been a struggle to attract the federal funding for the project, which is already underway but is expected to cost billions of dollars.As the disasters in Texas, the Caribbean and Florida unfolded, the number of new Zello users exploded. The app had about a million new registrations every day, some 20 times its normal rate, said Bill Moore, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThey were highly effective,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt really makes you proud to be a human because you just saw such good work.\u201dMr. Carver of NENA said that 911 was adjusting to new technologies.

Whether his start-up approach is effective is unclear.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has made a half-dozen or so investments in recent months with a specific aim: to counteract the influence of President Trump.The venture-style investments include starting a new group, Win the Future, whose self-described goal is to make the Democratic Party relevant again. He also invested $1 million in Cortico, a start-up that encourages online discourse between people with opposing political views. And he invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into Vote.org, which has a goal of getting all eligible Americans to vote; Higher Ground Labs, a start-up for progressive politicians; and the Center on Rural Innovation, which is working for economic improvements in rural areas.\u201cMy approach to political investing is the Silicon Valley approach,\u201d Mr. Hoffman, 50, said in an interview. \u201cFind and back powerful entrepreneurs.\u201dBut how effective a Silicon Valley approach to political change can be is a question \u2014 and Mr. Hoffman has experienced stumbling blocks before.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman pumped almost $30 million in new financing into Change.org and installed new board members, to try again.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about where we can get to,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a bumpy road.\u201dDebra Cleaver, a former Change.org employee who now runs Vote.org, said it was important to pursue innovative ways for achieving change. But, she added, politically driven investments can be more successful when they are \u201ctreated with the same level of accountability\u201d as traditional venture capital investments.\u201cI would describe Reid as left of center, with a very strong sense of empathy for those who are less fortunate,\u201d Mr. Thiel wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a character trait than an ideological position.\u201dIn 2000, he joined Mr. Thiel as an executive at PayPal, a stint that made Mr. Hoffman a millionaire. He founded LinkedIn, the career-oriented social network, in 2003, spurred by trying to connect people and the openness of online communities.By then, he had become involved in policy. During President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, Mr. Hoffman nurtured ties with the White House and Democratic politicians like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.\u201cReid was among the top leaders in Silicon Valley to whom we looked for good counsel\u201d on issues like immigration, said Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Last year, Mr. Hoffman joined the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, a group helping to modernize the military. Mr. Hoffman offered ideas about the impact that artificial intelligence would have on combat, and suggested ways to improve the military\u2019s personnel retention, according to a person who works with the board but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Mr. Hoffman decided the tech industry had to confront the challenges created by social networks, including their potential to undermine democracy. He said the industry would at some point need to regulate itself with a standards body like the Motion Picture Association of America.Mr. Trump also embodied a specific cause of anxiety for Mr. Hoffman.\u201cWe\u2019re in turbulent times, when concerns about the future tend to lead us to try and enshrine the past,\u201d he said. He began hosting discussions to generate policies for creating economic opportunity and how the government can serve broader swathes of people.Mr. Hoffman has since used his cash and connections to shape the organizations and start-ups that support the issues where he wants to exert the most influence. He has also tried to convince the tech industry to take responsibility for how its products are built and used.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman convened a small group of tech leaders to dine with Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, at the Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, Calif. The group discussed the prospect of governments trying to regulate tech companies and, in particular, the unemployment problems being created by automation and artificial intelligence.\u201cAt the end of the day, most people don\u2019t want a handout,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven a chance, they\u2019ll work hard.\u201dMr. Altman said he agreed with Mr. Hoffman\u2019s concerns and that he appreciated \u201chis willingness to debate issues.\u201dMr. Hoffman has also given money to organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Union of Concerned Scientists, which are explicitly resisting Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. He increased his venture-style investments in new civic and political start-ups, as well as continuing to fund some he had previously invested in, like Change.org and political fund-raising start-up Crowdpac.Win the Future has already drawn criticism for floating the possibility of billboards with crowdsourced ideas to shape the Democratic agenda. Mr. Pincus said most things in the start-up ecosystem took time to evolve and that early criticism of the new group was helpful.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s colleagues said his start-up method to politics was the right one. \u201cIt\u2019s a different approach, so naturally there will be skeptics,\u201d said John Lilly, one of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s partners at Greylock. \u201cBut entrepreneurship has been the driver of the economy. It will work.\u201dMr. Hoffman said he would judge his investments in civic-change start-ups by their ability to affect society, not by any financial return.\u201cOne of the things that I get most frustrated with is this kind of American business psychology, this view that I\u2019m only responsible to my customers and employees and shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be part of the political process. We can\u2019t just invent the future without some kind of connectivity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it needed photos, too.Now a salesman in Brazil has stepped forward to say that his own family photos were stolen to concoct the profile of \u201cMelvin Redick,\u201d one of many American impostors involved in the spread of Russian propaganda on Facebook and Twitter.The supposed Mr. Redick was an early promoter last year of a website, DCLeaks.com, that American officials believe was created by Russian military intelligence. But The Times could find no American who fit the details he provided on Facebook.There was no such person in Harrisburg, Pa., where Mr. Redick said he lived. The high school and college he listed had never heard of him. And when The Times asked Facebook about him \u2014 as well as other profiles that appeared to be the work of Russians \u2014 the company concluded that they were impostors and removed them from the social network.The Times article noted that one of the Redick photos showed him sitting in a bar in Brazil. In another, a bedroom seemed to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. G1, the online news operation of Globo, Brazil\u2019s biggest media conglomerate, noticed the puzzle and crowdsourced it, asking readers for help.A reader spotted the photos and recognized her son-in-law, Charles David Costacurta, 36, of the city Jundia\u00ed in southeastern Brazil. Mr. Costacurta was suspicious at first, said Carlos Dias, a G1 reporter, but eventually agreed to meet at a television station.\u201cI was scared, and I asked my girlfriend to take a look because I do not understand much about social networks and the internet,\u201d Mr. Costacurta said.Before publishing the photos, The Times tried to find their source using Google\u2019s image search function, but nothing turned up. This suggested that they might belong to a Brazilian Facebook user because Facebook blocks image searches of its profiles. The company declined to say whether it had searched internally and found the photos before Mr. Costacurta came forward.For Mr. Costacurta, his cameo role in Russia\u2019s information war appeared to be a harsh lesson in the fragile nature of privacy in an age of social media.\u201cWe\u2019re totally vulnerable,\u201d he told G1. \u201cYou wonder how much security you have, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Flying Cowboy Rides to Rescue Cattle Stranded in Harvey\u2019s Floods", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "The devastating rain put thousands of animals at risk of drowning, but a cowpoke in a helicopter is helping drive them to higher ground.Supported byBAY CITY, Tex. \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m gonna mash \u2019em out.\u201dRyan Ashcraft spotted some cattle loitering in standing water under a clump of trees and came out of a long, sweeping curve in his small helicopter to drop toward a clearing so narrow it seemed the blades might give the treetops a haircut \u2014 and potentially send Mr. Ashcraft and his passenger on a one-way trip to the afterlife.Mr. Ashcraft, 22, dipped toward the cattle and then pulled up sharply and hovered; the maneuver made the blades produce a sharp POP-POP-POP-POP-POP. The animals hate the noise, which puts many of them on the run.Across southeast Texas, cows go from $1,250 to $1,500 each on average, so a thousand head can bring well over a million dollars at market.Cattle raising is a fundamental part of Texas history: before there were roughnecks, there were cowpokes; before the oil boom, there was the vast King Ranch. \u201cIf people lose all of their cattle they\u2019d go broke and have to sell their land,\u201d Mr. Ashcraft said.Mr. Ashcraft said he felt compelled to jump in. \u201cOur town turned into a lake,\u201d he said.The son of a prominent local rancher, he offered help to neighbors in Brazoria County whose cattle were caught in the rising water. Requests poured in. \u201cIt\u2019s just phone call after phone call,\u201d Mr. Ashcraft said on Friday. \u201cPeople are calling me crying,\u201d he said, \u201csaying their cattle are going to drown.\u201d He has been flying from dawn to dusk, working sometimes for pay, sometimes not.So far, he has helped people in Brazoria, Fort Bend and Colorado Counties.Where cattle are marooned, he flies in with John Fitzgerald, a friend and Mr. Ashcraft\u2019s \u201cswimmer.\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald jumps from the helicopter into the water to cut an opening in the fences to set the cattle free, grabs the skids and climbs back in.\u201cHe\u2019s a strong little booger,\u201d Mr. Ashcraft observed.Mr. Ashcraft then drives the cattle uphill.It is hazardous work. One day Mr. Fitzgerald emerged from the water with his face bloody and swollen from an encounter with a mass of floating fire ants. On another flight, Mr. Ashcraft faced off with a pair of alligators, whom he managed to frighten off.By his own accounting, Mr. Ashcraft saved thousands of cattle and dozens of people across seven counties last week. But freed animals can become stuck on hills without access to grass or fresh drinking water. Getting supplies to the stranded cattle involves dropping food by helicopter or on horseback \u2014 or simply waiting until the water recedes.Even after the water is gone, there will be other problems. Cut fences let cattle intermingle. Some are branded, but many only have numbered ear tags which identify the animals among their herd but not their owners.The confusion is a temptation to rustlers. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had a report from Aransas County of a few people there trying to pick up loose livestock,\u201d said Larry Grey, director of law enforcement for the cattle raisers association. He has dispatched some of the group\u2019s rangers to catch the thieves. \u201cSadly, you see that after every major disaster,\u201d he said.Back in the air, Mr. Ashcraft continued his beneficial harassment of the animals, buzzing them and then jinking left or right to rise out for a new approach.For the most stubborn old bulls, Mr. Ashcraft had a pistol loaded with cartridges of rat-shot: small pellets that can kill a rat or snake, but only sting a thick-skinned animal like a cow. All the while, the three pilots coordinated their movements over the radio, making sure that they stayed out of one another\u2019s way.\u201cWe push \u2018em into the open, then we get \u2018em in a ball,\u201d he said.The scattered cattle \u2014 a motley assemblage of breeds, including creamy Charolais, hump-shouldered Brahman and Simmental \u2014 coalesced into a driven herd, lumbering old bulls and skittering calves, lining up along a rutted dirt road and heading toward what is usually a narrow creek, but which was now more than 150 feet across.Then things went awry. The front of the herd turned north to walk along the creek \u2014 a direction that would take them back to the inundated banks of the Colorado. So Mr. Ashcraft and his other pilots buzzed the cattle until they pivoted east and started swimming across the creek. But the line of cattle, fighting the current, missed a nice break in the trees and couldn\u2019t seem to orient itself toward the desired shore; they started swimming in a swirling circle, which could lead to a panic and drownings.More buzzing. More mashing. The circle broke up, and the pilots urged the cattle toward a break in the trees. Some cows straggled through, while the rest turned back to the original bank.\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t work so well,\u201d Mr. Ashcraft grumbled over the radio channel. The men conferred, and decided to leave the cattle to \u201crest up a little bit.\u201d The sun was setting, and they can\u2019t do this work at night.It was time to go home and get some rest. Mr. Ashcraft\u2019s phone had filled up with new requests for assistance. At sunrise, he would be in the air again.Advertisement"}

The police said the gunman, who shot himself, was in custody.About 50 people were in the church at the time of the shooting, which was reported at 11:15 a.m. local time as services were ending, the police said. Robert Engle, an usher at the church, the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ, was pistol-whipped when he confronted the gunman.Mr. Engle, 22, then ran to his car, got his gun and returned to ensure \u201cthe gunman didn\u2019t make any more movements until police arrived,\u201d Don Aaron, a police spokesman, said at a news conference.

He was wearing a neoprene mask similar to what a skier would wear, Mr. Aaron said. Because of the mask, churchgoers did not immediately recognize him even though he had previously attended services there, the police said.He was carrying two pistols, but it was not clear if he fired both, officials said.

{"Headline": "Arrests in London Tube Bombing Stun a Suburban Town", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUNBURY-ON-THAMES, England \u2014 One was an 18-year-old Iraqi orphan who was known to neighbors of his elderly foster parents as a troublemaker. The other was a 21-year-old from Syria who fled the civil war there and made his way via Egypt to London, where he found work at a fried-chicken shop.On Monday, the first glimmers of information began to surface about the two young men who are suspects in the crude bombing of an Underground subway train on Friday morning, in what the authorities have called a terrorist attack.The explosion injured at least 30 people, and although no one was killed, the episode briefly caused Britain to raise its terrorism threat to the highest possible level. The Islamic State said that a \u201cdetachment\u201d of its fighters had carried out the attack, but the authorities in Britain have declined to confirm that or provide details of the suspects or what motivated them.The two young men, who were arrested separately on Saturday, are being held under a law that allows the police to detain suspects without charge beyond the usual four-day limit.The arrests came as a shock here in Sunbury-on-Thames, a middle-class suburb in Surrey, just west of Greater London, where the two men had stayed with foster parents, Ronald and Penelope Jones.On Saturday, the police cordoned off the Joneses\u2019 home in Sunbury-on-Thames and briefly evacuated the area around the house, warning neighbors that explosive materials might be in the house and its garden.The police did not allow journalists near the Joneses\u2019 house on Monday, and the couple were said to be staying with relatives.\u201cThey have an extremely good reputation, and there\u2019s no suggestion that they were involved in this at all,\u201d Ian Harvey, the leader of the Spelthorne Council, which represents the part of Surrey that includes Sunbury-on-Thames, said in a phone interview.Nicola Rider, 43, a neighbor who lives in the area that was cordoned off, called the Joneses \u201ccomplete angels \u2014 the kindest and warmest people you will ever meet.\u201dShe added: \u201cThey have six kids of their own, but they have taken in and helped hundreds of abandoned children over the years.\u201dAnother neighbor, Rick Worth, 46, said the Joneses \u201cweren\u2019t the kinds of people that would complain about their children or the teenagers they looked after.\u201dThe 18-year-old was arrested around 7:50 a.m. on Saturday in the departures area of the port of Dover, apparently while trying to flee Britain.Both neighbors said he had built a reputation for getting into fights.\u201cThe police brought him to the house a few weeks ago after he got into an altercation, but I don\u2019t think they thought anything of it,\u201d Ms. Rider said. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s 18. We all get into trouble at that age.\u201dShe added: \u201cI know that they got more strict on him after that incident. I don\u2019t think they let him out as much.\u201dMr. Worth said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t really see the boy out and about much. We mainly just saw him coming in and out of the house. He was quiet and kept to himself. You know, head down, never smiled.\u201dThe 21-year-old was arrested at 11:50 p.m. on Saturday outside Aladdin\u2019s, a fried-chicken shop where he worked, in the outer London borough of Hounslow.His identity was confirmed by his brother \u2014 who is named Aladdin but has no connection to the restaurant \u2014 as Yahyah Farroukh. In an interview via the messaging app WhatsApp from his home in the Netherlands, Aladdin said that their family had run a bakery in Damascus, Syria, and that he had been detained and tortured by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.Aladdin said that Yahyah had fled to Egypt in the summer of 2013, and then made his way first to Italy and then to Britain.\u201cIt is not possible after three years of study and work that Yahyah would bomb himself or get involved in such acts,\u201d Aladdin said. \u201cHe was even looking for a girl to marry.\u201dYahyah Farroukh appears to have had two Facebook profiles, one of which seems to be aimed toward his family. One of his profile pictures shows him at a Lidl supermarket, and the bomb used in the attack appeared to have been placed into a white bucket, wrapped inside a Lidl bag.The Facebook pages offer no suggestions of extremism. Yahyah regularly posted the flag of the Free Syrian Army, a moderate, secular group of fighters opposed to the Assad government. At one point, he posted a video of the singer Ahmed al-Kaseem, an anti-government singer. He was also a fan of the singer-songwriters Ellie Goulding and Justin Bieber, and the rapper and actor Wiz Khalifa.His social media profiles said he worked at two event-planning companies. On Instagram, he posted an image of a slogan declaring, in English, \u201cFor a better life, you need to have weed, vodka and drugs,\u201d and underneath, in Arabic, \u201cFor a better life, you need to be honest, generous and well-mannered. Those who know English should shut up.\u201d (It appears to be a joke.)His father died in Egypt in June after undergoing surgery for a blocked artery.Several of the posts contained mildly erotic or romantic references. Others mentioned innocuous religious verses. The pictures show a young man trying to be stylish \u2014 wearing sunglasses, a trilby hat and suit jackets. One picture appears to show him in a club. His Facebook check-ins suggest that he was interested in exploring Britain; he had traveled to Cornwall and Devon, in southwestern England.West Thames College, a school in the Isleworth section of Hounslow, said that Yahyah studied English there from December 2013 to June 2015.In an interview via Facebook Messenger, Mo Ashour, who attended West Thames College at the same time as Mr. Farroukh, remembered him as \u201ca good man who doesn\u2019t like any problems.\u201dAnd Mr. Farroukh\u2019s cousin Ahmed, who works at an Arab-food company in London, described him as \u201ca respectable and quiet man\u201d who was happy living in Britain and dreamed of becoming an engineer.Ahmed said he and his cousins \u201cbecame refugees because of Assad.\u201d And the brother, Aladdin, said his wife had lost relatives to the Islamic State.As the authorities continued their investigation \u2014 searching the chicken restaurant as well as a housing complex in Stanwell, another London suburb, interviewing 120 witnesses and reviewing more than 180 videos and pictures relating to the attack \u2014 residents in Sunbury-on-Thames expressed shock.\u201cThis is a very British area, it\u2019s not often you see people from other ethnicities, so I\u2019m sure the boys the Joneses took in had a hard time fitting in,\u201d Tom Randall, who was drinking at the Running Horse Pub, said on Monday. He surmised: \u201cThey probably got bored because there\u2019s a lot of elderly people here and there\u2019s not much to do, apart from drinking at the pub and gambling.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu reported from Sunbury-on-Thames and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.

{"Headline": "Imagining Murder at a Cold War Command Post With Harlan Coben", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace NotesLIVINGSTON, N.J. \u2014 The road up the hill was narrow, the pavement old and a little cracked, the feeling was vaguely sinister \u2014 and the tall man in the T-shirt knew it. \u201cYou can almost sense the secretive nature already,\u201d he said as the sport-utility vehicle edged along. \u201cHow does this not spark your imagination?\u201dThis was before the S.U.V. stopped, before the man climbed out and before he headed off into the woods, through a break in a rusty fence.The base was supposed to protect New York against a Soviet attack.It was not the only one. The Army built Nike bases from the Rockaways to the Hamptons in the 1950s. Here in New Jersey, 12 bases stood ready. Other bases had nuclear missiles. The one here was the command-and-control center for a missile installation a few miles away, on what had been a farm in East Hanover.Mr. Coben grew up here in Livingston, like Myron Bolitar, the law-school-educated sports agent in some of his novels, and lives in Ridgewood, a town farther north. Thirty thrillers have established him as something of a balladeer for North Jersey, but the landscape in his novels is \u201cmy own sort of mishmash\u201d of suburban places, he said \u2014 diners and parks, condominium complexes and basketball courts. But his readers recognize the landmarks, or they think they do.\u201cPeople from Ridgewood say it\u2019s definitely Ridgewood,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople from Livingston say it\u2019s definitely Livingston. People from West Orange and Chatham and Westfield \u2014 they\u2019re all in there.\u201d And, on Page 300 of \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go,\u201d a \u201cdumpy no-tell\u201d in East Orange.Mr. Coben remembers a Livingston that was changing from \u201cfarmland to classic American split-levels, which is what I grew up in.\u201d And, as he wrote in \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go,\u201d he grew up with two legends: that a \u201cnotorious Mafia leader lived in a baronial mansion\u201d and that a Nike missile base was right next door.\u201cI found that both were true,\u201d he said on the way to the former Nike base.As for the mansion, a Life magazine piece identified the architecture as \u201cTransylvania traditional.\u201d Rumor had it that an incinerator out back was \u201cwhere they burned the bodies,\u201d Mr. Coben said.\u201cThink how strange that is,\u201d he said. \u201cA military base next to a leading mobster\u2019s house. No wonder this town is inspiring.\u201dWhat he finds on the fringes of the former base is also unsettling. In the woods are concrete towers with rusted underpinnings, apparently platforms for the long-ago radar installations.\u201cYou could see the shooting in the book right here,\u201d he said.So much for spoiler alerts. Yes, there is a shooting in the book \u2014 more than one, in fact. But the shooting Mr. Coben is referring to is definitely fiction, according to Donald E. Bender, an amateur expert on Nike bases who also grew up here.\u201cOh, gosh,\u201d Mr. Bender said when asked if anyone had ever been killed on the grounds of the Nike base. \u201cLivingston\u2019s not a particularly violent town.\u201dLike Mr. Coben, he remembered seeing, from a distance, a white radome at the base. It sat atop the hill like a giant golf ball. Like Mr. Coben, he did not know much about the base when he was growing up. He did not start digging for information about Nike bases until about 20 years ago, after he discovered documents about a base in Franklin Lakes, about 30 miles away. Mr. Coben thanked him in the acknowledgments of \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go,\u201d but Mr. Bender said they had known each other only \u201cthrough, like, distant contact.\u201d\u201cI went to school with his brother Larry,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Harlan only distantly via Facebook and email.\u201dIn its 19 years, the Nike base was operated by Army units and, later, the New Jersey National Guard. It closed in 1974, after the Nike system was decommissioned nationwide. Essex County soon bought the 42-acre site for $1.Mr. Coben was a couple of years away from high school then. \u201cI went there a couple of times and saw the fences,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got older, it was ruins. In my mind, it was always about what could\u2019ve gone on there.\u201dOne said a missile had flown through her house, according to Mr. Coben. This would suggest that he is not the only person from Livingston with an imagination.The county imagined the former base as a complex of artists\u2019 studios. Outside what was once the enlisted men\u2019s barracks, Mr. Coben encountered Sue Sachs, who works in metal, making jewelry and serving spoons.\u201cWe once invited a former commander here,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe said it was the hardest job he ever had. The code words changed every day.\u201dShe also remembered that the commander had said \u201che had a great relationship with the Boiardos.\u201d\u201cHe said Boiardo gave him cigars,\u201d she explained.A couple of buildings away, Leonard DiNardo showed Mr. Coben his glassblowing studio. \u201cThis was the launch room\u201d when the base was in operation, he said, standing in a room with finished pieces.\u201cThey had these big trailers they pulled right up to the building as adjuncts to their electronics capability,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had so much electronic gear they couldn\u2019t fit it all in.\u201d \u201cWhen you drove up the hill, you were greeted by an M.P. with a .45.\u201dMr. Coben was animated. \u201cIt\u2019s like visiting ruins,\u201d he said, mentioning ancient Romans, ancient Egyptians and Aztecs. \u201cThis is our Cold War ruin right here. Feels like history.\u201dA moment later, he said, \u201cMy whole life, I wanted to write about this,\u201d Mr. Coben said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it took me so long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maye Musk, 69, Is Now a CoverGirl", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe news came after recent announcements that CoverGirl would add Issa Rae and Ayesha Curry to its roster.Though Ms. Musk has over 50 years of accomplishments racked up, the last few have been particularly impressive from a modeling perspective. She has appeared on the covers of New York magazine and Elle Canada; starred in campaigns for Target, Virgin America and Clinique; and been photographed for Vogue Italia, Vogue Korea and Vanity Fair.Below, she discusses her modeling trajectory, her decision to stop dyeing her hair, nutrition and eating disorders in the industry, and her family.I just love that CoverGirl wants to do diversity. They haven\u2019t had a model this old in their campaigns. I\u2019m turning 70 in April of next year. I think that women will be really inspired to see that even at 69 you can get a beauty campaign.Aging has been good for me. You develop confidence, you\u2019re able to handle the knocks a little easier. I model for my age. I\u2019m not trying to hide it and say I\u2019m 50. I\u2019m so proud that I\u2019m going be 70.I don\u2019t dye my hair. It\u2019s so fabulous. I had brown hair for so long. I was always getting my roots done. Sometimes I did it myself because I couldn\u2019t afford to go to a hair salon. When I turned 60, I decided to see what color I am underneath. I started dyeing my hair a very light blond and then I let it grow out. I cut it very short.And what happened? Suddenly I have all these editorials and bookings, and everybody is loving it.When did you first start modeling?At 15. I was a science nerd. I have two science degrees. I enjoyed the sciences, nutrition, so I always modeled part time, thinking it would end. And it hasn\u2019t, of course. \u201cJust getting started\u201d is my hashtag. I had three kids in three years, so that slowed me down somewhat. I was 28 and the oldest model in the city.What advice would you give to young models today?Be nice to everybody. Keep your brain active. Read a lot.Did you ever involve your kids in your modeling work?When I didn\u2019t have a nanny, the shows weren\u2019t long, so they would have their books and sit in the front row. I tried to get them to model, but they found it boring. They didn\u2019t have iPads back then. When you\u2019re on set you stand a lot and you wait, wait, wait. Tosca was doing runway with me and she was about 11, and they did her hair in a style she hated and she refused to step on the runway. And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the end of your modeling career.\u201d And that was fine with me, too.What do you love about makeup? For me, it makes a huge difference because my face is pretty plain, and I\u2019m very fair with very few eyebrows and very short eyelashes. Makeup transforms me. I feel like I\u2019m in disguise when I walk my dog without makeup on.I was 12 or 13 when I started experimenting. At 15, I was modeling. I had to do my own hair and makeup. I also made my own clothes because I grew up in South Africa, where fashion was six months behind because of the seasons.We wore a lot of makeup. It took us an hour to get ready. The eyelashes on top, the black eyeliner in the crease of the eye that you can see in photos from the \u201860s, the beehive hairstyle.The modeling industry has a lot of issues with eating disorders and underweight workers. What\u2019s your perspective on that as someone who studies nutrition? There are models who are naturally skinny, but the thing is that many of them are emaciated. You can tell because they have hirsutism. There\u2019ll be some hair on their face. It\u2019s to protect their body and keep it warm because they\u2019re too skinny. They also don\u2019t have good energy. I\u2019m surprised how many of them can do so many shows.Modeling agencies would send me their models. If they were a swimsuit model, they would have to lose 10 pounds to do runway. I would say, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect. You don\u2019t need to lose weight.\u201d They would say, \u201cBut I have to lose 10 pounds to do couturier work.\u201d I would say, \u201cYou have to eat perfectly. You have to keep your energy, and you can\u2019t look gaunt or tired. You can\u2019t share pizza with your friends, you can\u2019t have alcohol, you can\u2019t have dessert.\u201d That\u2019s hard for young girls.You walked in two shows at New York Fashion Week. What was that like?Concept Korea wanted me to open and close the show with two new young designers, completely different looks and makeup. I opened the show, all the young models came after me, I changed in a minute, and three makeup artists worked on my face to change the makeup look for the finale for the second designer.About a year ago I walked for Malan Breton, who found me on Facebook. I\u2019ve walked for Bloomingdale\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Eileen Fisher. Not fashion week. They weren\u2019t looking for women around 70.I hope it\u2019s a larger change happening. People are living longer and enjoying their lives more and know they don\u2019t have to disappear at 65 when they retire. I will never retire. My mom never retired. I\u2019ll work until no one wants me anymore, and then I\u2019ll find something else and I\u2019ll still be a dietitian doing nutrition research, which I love.I haven\u2019t gotten the 3 yet. I\u2019m at around 300,000. Even though I have good connections, I can\u2019t jump the line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Readers React: Redemption, Then Rejection From Harvard", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany Times readers debated Harvard University\u2019s decision to rescind its acceptance of Michelle Jones, who was recently released from prison, as a Ph.D. student.Ms. Jones had served 20 years for the murder of her 4-year-old son, and had initially been accepted to Harvard based on her scholarship behind bars. However, top leadership at Harvard revoked the offer after some faculty members questioned whether her application had minimized her crime \u201cto the point of misrepresentation.\u201dComments have been edited for length and clarity.\u201cBut frankly, we knew that anyone could just punch her crime into Google, and Fox News would probably say that P.C. liberal Harvard gave 200 grand of funding to a child murderer, who also happened to be a minority. I mean, c\u2019mon.\u201dSo they opposed her because of possible bad press from Fox? I would consider any attack from Fox a compliment. I mean, c\u2019mon.The comment by a Harvard professor that the admissions committee was \u201cworried/concerned\u201d about her adjustment in an elite institution is so incredibly patronizing and exclusionary that it shocks me that it was actually said on record. The applicant survived prison and found a new path \u2014 let her decide what is right for her.I have no qualms at all with Harvard\u2019s decision. I do, however, take exception to the comments that castigate Harvard for its decision and suggest that this woman is entitled to be admitted there. She is entitled to no such thing in my opinion. Abusing and killing a young child is not washed away by 20 years in prison; it is, and rightly should be, a burden carried for life. If I have two equally qualified candidates, I\u2019m choosing the one that has demonstrated the higher moral code.I think the question that Ms. Jones hasn\u2019t answered is exactly how she murdered and buried her child. Until she faces that, I find it very hard to see how she can be redeemed. The criminal justice system will never be perfect, and the length of \u201ctime served,\u201d whether too much or too little, has nothing to do with fundamental humanity. Whatever the circumstances that led to murdering her 4-year-old child (and it certainly seems she was a victim of terrible circumstances), they should not be papered over. She murdered her son. Getting past that requires full disclosure.Upon reading this article, I was upset that Harvard would reject Michelle. Then, I looked up her appeal and read it thoroughly \u2014 it turned my stomach. The fact that she attempted to have her conviction appealed, using what I think is twisted reasoning, speaks volumes about her sense of responsibility for her brutal treatment of her son and his resultant death. While none of us can truly read the heart of another, I have doubts about how sincere this brilliant woman\u2019s remorse is.An extraordinary woman and scholar, deeply deserving of this chance \u2014 if only she would acknowledge the stunning gravity and cruelty of her youthful offense. Without that acknowledgment, a disturbing piece is missing. One wonders whether her own heartbreaking history of abuse, and the simple need for physical and psychic survival, has blunted her insight or capacity for remorse and empathy. I wish her well.Skimmed her paper (co-authored with Lori Record) \u2014 it is extremely solid work. Normally (even as a product of the Ivy League) I take great glee in making fun of all things loopy-whack-a-doodle PC that are epidemic in the Ivies right now. Colleges now truly deserve every bit of ridicule they get for the utter collapse of common sense. This is not one of those cases. Harvard should not have rescinded admission in this case.I think it\u2019s Harvard\u2019s loss.Strong women like this strike fear in the hearts of others who can\u2019t imagine coping with so much in 45 years of life. Many will never comprehend dealing with something so horrendous, grieving personally every day, and yet still being productive.What does society expect from prisoners? What does society expect them to do when they are no longer prisoners? She was punished for her crime. She served her time and is now entitled to live her life in society. Don\u2019t we all want to see criminals rehabilitated? Instead of accomplishing nothing and sucking up our tax dollars doing nothing for their entire sentence and then winding up back in prison. How many ex-convicts have accomplished what she has?So many prisoners languish inside prison for a set term and then are dumped on the street with $40 and a bus ticket. Ms. Jones is exceptional and should be held as an example of what can be achieved. Society should at the very least honor the commitment that once a sentence is served, society is obligated to make every effort to support prisoners with opportunities for work, education, and mental health services.Are we willing and able to forgive? Do we see merit in forgiveness? How much is too much to be forgiven for? In this case, we are talking about an individual who committed a horrendous crime who has been punished according to the rule of law; there are many examples in which we could ask these questions of institutions, nations, etc. Forgiveness is a term often reserved for religion but perhaps we need to bring it into the public sphere.

The meeting\u2019s sponsor, an anti-immigrant page called \u201cSecured Borders,\u201d was one of hundreds of fake Facebook accounts created by a Russian company with Kremlin ties to spread vitriolic messages on divisive issues.Facebook acknowledged last week that it had closed the accounts after linking them to advertisements costing $100,000 that were purchased in Russia\u2019s influence campaign during and after the 2016 election. But the company declined to release or describe in detail the pages and profiles it had linked to Russia.Shawn Barigar, the mayor of Twin Falls, said that the City Council Chambers, where the supposed meeting was called on a Saturday, were closed that day and that officials did not recall any gathering. But he said that after two years of \u201crobust debate\u201d over the city\u2019s refugee resettlement program, which dates to the 1980s, it was \u201ckind of surreal\u201d to discover that Russia had joined in.\u201cI kind of thought, \u2018Well, that\u2019s an interesting twist,\u2019\u201d Mr. Barigar said. He said the program \u201crepresents our core values as a community \u2014 welcoming others and learning from one another.\u201d He said immigrants had not caused disproportionate problems there.Facebook officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they had found a small number of additional events announced by the Russia-created pages and were looking for more. They declined to give examples.The new revelations stepped up pressure on Facebook to make public more of what it knows about the Russian propaganda operations.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he wanted Facebook and Twitter to testify in public session about the Russian use of their sites.Mr. Warner called Facebook\u2019s closed briefing for his committee and its House counterpart last week \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more evidence of additional ads and how they are used to manipulate individuals,\u201d he said.Calling social media \u201cthe wild, wild West,\u201d Mr. Warner said that getting a handle on the 2016 experience with Russian intrusions was critical because \u201cthe amount of advertising and use of these social media platforms in elections is only going to go exponentially up.\u201d He said Twitter representatives would brief the committee soon.The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has long been concerned that the United States might be inspiring pro-democracy movements inside Russia and on its periphery, including in Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltic republics.\u201cThis is more about destabilizing democracy and pitting us against each other to limit the influence of the United States on the world stage,\u201d he said.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent, now with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who has studied the Russian influence campaign, said that beyond damaging the American image, Mr. Putin had reasons to court particular subgroups.\u201cIf he\u2019s successful, it gives him an indigenous U.S. audience in support of his policies,\u201d Mr. Watts said. \u201cIt also gives him leverage in talking to President Trump: \u2018Why don\u2019t you stop interfering in Ukraine, and we\u2019ll leave your domestic audience alone.\u2019\u201dThe potential influence of the Russia-linked Facebook ads depends in part on how they were targeted. While $100,000 is tiny compared with Facebook\u2019s billions in quarterly advertising revenue, digital advertising experts said that even a little money could go a long way with Facebook advertising.\u201cIn a world of microtargeting, where you can home in on individuals down to the zip code, $100,000 can go a lot further than one would realize,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, an advertising research trade organization.A group like Secured Borders may test hundreds of Facebook posts to see what content resonates with people, closely monitoring the number of likes, shares and clicks a post receives. If a post happens to take off, the group can pay to promote the post, effectively placing it in front of millions of people.The issue is a thorny one for Facebook, whose business is almost entirely based on advertising. Executives at the social giant are deeply concerned about the federal government\u2019s recent inquiries into how the company\u2019s advertising works. Its advertising is not subject to the same regulations put on political print, radio and television ads.The Russian campaign\u2019s use of Facebook has distressed some employees, according to internal communications. In an excerpt from a company discussion board that was shared with The New York Times, Facebook employees pressed their bosses to be more open.\u201cWhy are we only writing about this now?\u201d one employee wrote, noting that last week\u2019s Facebook disclosure came after months of news reports about the Russian influence campaign. Other workers asked for examples of the ads in question and for details on what the company described as the \u201cgeographic targeting\u201d of some ads \u2014 specifically, whether they targeted swing states.Mr. Stamos, the company\u2019s security chief, declined to disclose more information. \u201cThere are complicated legal issues about what we can share with various interested parties,\u201d he wrote on the discussion board. \u201cI can\u2019t go into more details than that at the moment.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Considered Vulnerable, Mobile Homes Are Battered but Largely Intact", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKEY LARGO, Fla. \u2014 When Lorraine Tucker came back after Hurricane Irma to check on her two-bedroom mobile home, she expected the worst.She and her daughter had ridden out the storm at their homes in Miami, and the two had made the 70-mile drive together. They were aware of reports that the Florida Keys had been among the hardest hit parts of the state.When they inspected her home, which Ms. Tucker had bought nine months ago, they found that the aluminum carport had been blown away, as had a small strip of the metal roof. But that was it.\u201cInside it was perfect, no damage, no water,\u201d said her daughter, Jennifer Lappen.Florida has almost 850,000 mobile homes, more than any other state, and they were considered especially vulnerable during Hurricane Irma\u2019s rampage. But, surprisingly, most of them made it through battered, but largely intact.Although emergency officials said it was too early to say with certainty how many homes were damaged beyond repair, interviews with homeowners in the Keys and along the southwest coast, and tours of some mobile home parks, suggested that catastrophic damage was limited.Irma\u2019s rapid loss of strength is one reason. When it lashed the Keys on Sunday, the hurricane was rated a Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of at least 130 miles an hour. By the time the storm reached Naples on the southwest coast, it had been downgraded to a Category 2, with winds about 25 miles an hour weaker.But toughened construction and installation regulations for mobile homes also played a role.The improved standards, which require sturdier framework and more and better anchors, were put in place after Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed tens of thousands of homes in South Florida in 1992.\u201cMobile homes that were built after Hurricane Andrew are a different animal than those built earlier,\u201d said Michael Peltier, a spokesman for Citizens Property Insurance, based in Jacksonville.In Old Bridge Village, a park with more than 500 units in North Fort Myers, Irma affected almost all the homes. But in most cases the damage was minimal.Carports, which have open sides and can act like sails in high winds, appeared to suffer the most, with some partially collapsed and others completely blown off and twisted into heaps of mangled aluminum. Some screened porches, or lanais, which can also be lifted up by the wind, were damaged as well.Awnings were sheared off some homes, and here and there strips of siding or roof shingles were missing.Only a handful of homes appeared to have significant roof damage, but those that did had been damaged by water as well. Residents of the park who entered a home where about half the roof had been peeled back reported that the interior was badly flooded, probably beyond salvaging.Stephen Braun, the chief operating officer of Home Town America, a Chicago company that operates mobile home communities in Florida, said he drove through five of them on the Gulf Coast this week. Of the 2,800 homes, he said, it looked like perhaps 40 had been destroyed or heavily damaged.Ms. Tucker estimated that about 10 percent of the homes in her community on Key Largo, Silver Shores, suffered significant damage. She said she thought that most of the homes had fared well because they had numerous anchor cables, including some that go up and over the roof.Those over-roof anchors were added to mobile home regulations after Hurricane Andrew. At the time, most homes were only secured by connecting the frame to rods buried in the ground.Not all older homes have been upgraded. Generally, homeowners said, the additional anchors have to be installed in order to obtain insurance. But many people do not buy insurance, as premiums are relatively high and coverage is usually below the home\u2019s full cost. The average cost of a new two-bedroom, mobile home with 980-square feet is $37,100. But mobile homes can cost from $5,000 to $500,000.Most mobile homes \u2014 the industry refers to them as manufactured homes, because they are assembled in a factory and shipped to a home site \u2014 are of wood-frame construction. Newer models have sturdier frames. Exterior siding is typically aluminum on older models, vinyl on newer ones. Screened porches, carports and awnings are of similar materials.Damage from the hurricane varied from street to street, and in many cases from house to house. In one East Naples neighborhood, one home\u2019s carport had been destroyed. But two doors down the only apparent damage was a small piece of siding that had been bent by the wind.In the Keys, with travel limited, some people were still unsure if their homes had survived.Shawn Burnstad was waiting in Key Largo to be allowed to drive further down Route 1 to Little Torch Key, just 30 miles from the end of the road at Key West.He owns a three-bedroom mobile home there. Built three decades ago \u2014 before Andrew \u2014 it is anchored to thick coral. For Irma, he\u2019d covered the windows with plywood.Friends had sent him post-storm aerial photos of the area that they found on Facebook. A home in front of his appeared to have been demolished, but the homes on either side seemed untouched. Some other homes nearby had what appeared to be light damage to their roofs.The photos appeared to show about a third of Mr. Burnstad\u2019s roof ripped open, with the wooden rafters showing. Mr. Burnstad worried that he might find heavy water damage inside.\u201cYou don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil you actually get to the house.\u201dJoseph B.

{"Headline": "Kit Reed, Author of Darkly Humorous Fiction, Dies at 85", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKit Reed, a prolific novelist and short-story writer who was celebrated for her science fiction but also hopscotched to the fantasy, Southern Gothic, paranormal and mystery genres, died on Sept. 24 in Los Angeles. She was 85.Her family said the cause was a glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain tumor.Ms. Reed looked at the world through darkly humorous, satirical and dystopian lenses; happy endings were no more likely in her fiction than they are in life.She told stories about beauty pageants, illicit adoptions, eating disorders, a violent high school built like a maximum-security prison, the sudden vanishing of an island\u2019s population, a monkey who writes best sellers using a story-writing app, and a woman who becomes obsessed with a fantasy island that she discovers online.In one, \u201cGrand Opening,\u201d Ms. Reed looked to a future when the sultan of Brunei has bought Yankee Stadium to turn it into a megamall. At its opening ceremony \u2014 featuring re-enactments of past triumphs of the Yankees, who have gone bust \u2014 the novelist Salman Rushdie, now 90, is to throw out the first pitch. But he is being stalked by Ahmed, a nonagenarian assassin unaware that the fatwa against Mr. Rushdie had been called off long ago.\u201cThey are, after all, in this together,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHunter and hunted. Instrument and destiny, for every great pursuit demands the cooperation of both parties. For every Jean Valjean there is a Javert and if either died the other would be desolate. Imagine Ahmed and Rushdie, the perfection of pursuit and flight. Neither exists without the other.\u201dMs. Reed saw herself as a writer of speculative fiction who trafficked not in aliens or flying saucers but in quirky, fantastic and tough-minded leaps from the realities of contemporary culture. In one novel, \u201cThinner Than Thou\u201d (2004), she satirizes a modern preoccupation with body image; in \u201cThe Night Children\u201d (2008), runaway children live in a shopping mall and come out only at night.Rather than feel bound to science fiction, Ms. Reed saw herself as part of a group of imaginative writers that included Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury and George Orwell.\u201cFor me,\u201d she told The Hartford Courant in 2011, \u201cit\u2019s a great big literary ballpark.\u201dIn Ms. Reed\u2019s first published story, \u201cThe Wait\u201d (1958) \u2014 which evokes Shirley Jackson as well as Stephen King \u2014 a mother falls ill in a small Southern town, leaving her teenage daughter, Miriam, to become part of a bizarre ritual involving 18-year-old virgins.\u201cWhen they came to the field,\u201d Ms. Reed wrote, \u201cMiriam first thought the women were still busy at a late harvest, but she saw that the maidens, scores of them, were just sitting on little boxes at intervals in the seemingly endless field.\u201d When the frightened Miriam asked why she was there, a woman tells her little more than \u201cRemember, the man must be a stranger.\u201dOne of her more famous stories, \u201cThe Attack of the Giant Baby\u201d (1976), follows the misadventures of Leonard Freibourg, a 14-month-old who accidentally swallows a culture in his father\u2019s laboratory, turning him into a giant who terrorizes New York City. Similarities between her tale and the plot of the 1992 Disney film \u201cHoney, I Blew Up the Kid,\u201d the sequel to \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the Kids,\u201d led Ms. Reed to sue the Walt Disney Company. In a settlement, she received a \u201cspecial recognition\u201d credit.Kit Reed was born Lillian Hyde Craig in San Diego on June 7, 1932, and was known as Kitten from a young age. Her father, John R. Craig, was the commanding officer of the Grampus, a submarine that is believed to have been sunk by the Japanese in early 1943. Her mother, the former Lillian Hyde, was a schoolteacher. Before she could read, young Kit\u2019s father read her L. Frank Baum\u2019s Oz books.For five years Ms. Reed was a reporter, first for The St. Petersburg Times in Florida and then for The New Haven Register, where she won awards for a series of articles about juvenile courts in Connecticut. Reporter characters would later turn up occasionally in her fiction, like the one in the novel \u201cSon of Destruction\u201d (2013) who investigates three cases of spontaneous human combustion in his mother\u2019s hometown.Writing for the online Weird Fiction Review in 2013, Adam Mills praised Ms. Reed\u2019s mind-set. He described her \u201cweirdness of perspective, a knack for finding the strangest, most faithful way for inhabiting a character\u2019s head and plumbing the depths for the things that are both surprising and compelling, things we wouldn\u2019t think to look for without Reed pointing them out.\u201dMs. Reed, who was a professor and resident writer at Wesleyan University in Connecticut for decades and wrote a few thrillers under the pseudonym Kit Craig, had an unconventional, no-holds-barred personality. On Facebook, Mack Reed wrote of his mother: \u201cShe loved like a child, worked like a stevedore, cursed like a sailor and sampled the world with Twainian zest.\u201dAnd Jen Gunnels, her editor at Tor Books, said in an interview that Ms. Reed had a \u201clusciously warped mind.\u201d One day, she said, Ms. Reed described to her a new story she had written about a woman\u2019s nightmarish relationship with parrots.\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018You\u2019re really sick,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Gunnels said. \u201cBut that was part of her charm.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Half of all schools in the country with students in kindergarten through 12th grade, where the money announced on Tuesday is to go, offer computer science education. In rural areas, the percentage is even smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the public and private sectors work together to ensure all American students have the opportunity to learn computer science and take part in the fastest growing sector of our economy,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that announced the new donations, said in a statement.The money will be disbursed over a five-year period, with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce contributing $50 million each. Lockheed Martin said it would donate $25 million and Accenture, General Motors and Pluralsight, an online education company, said they would give $10 million apiece.Some companies will also donate software and other technology as part of the initiative. Salesforce.org, Salesforce\u2019s philanthropy arm, said it would give 10 software subscriptions to every school in the country.Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, began organizing the effort about two months ago. She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills. And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York,\u201d Ms. Trump said in an interview, \u201cbut the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.\u201dMs. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education. In a news release, the Education Department said it had a \u201cgoal of devoting\u201d that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education. On Monday, Ms. Trump called 20 state governors and dozens of school superintendents to encourage them to submit grant applications.Advertisement"}

The curator found out when a friend of his sent him a text message.\u201cI was completely taken by surprise,\u201d said the curator, Gaudencio Fidelis, in a telephone interview. \u201cIt is not normal for an institution to give into pressure like this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never happened in Brazil, not even during the dictatorship,\u201d he added, referring to the brutal military dictatorship that ended in 1985. \u201cIt sets a bad precedent.\u201dIn Brazil, private and public banks and other companies are some of the biggest investors in culture, many of them financing museums, artists and films.The cancellation reverberated across the country, feeding into the broad political feud that exploded during the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, pitting her supporters against the man who replaced her, Michel Temer.The country\u2019s top artists were already wary of Mr. Temer\u2019s close ties to the evangelical lobby in Brazil\u2019s Congress, and one of his early actions \u2014 to appoint an all-male, all-white cabinet, and to eliminate the Culture Ministry \u2014 did not help, even though the ministry was quickly reinstated.Also, Mr. Temer has continued to actively court religious conservatives in Congress to help push through his economic initiatives and protect him from a corruption investigation.Many artists have rallied to Ms. Rousseff. During her impeachment trial when she was accused of breaking budgetary laws, many musicians and artists who had resisted the dictatorship took a stand against Mr. Temer for what they said was an \u201cinstitutional coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201dAt the Cannes Film Festival last year, the cast of the Brazilian film \u201cAquarius,\u201d including Sonia Braga, held up placards on the red carpet denouncing the \u201cillegitimate government\u201d and urging people to \u201csave Brazilian democracy!\u201dA couple of months later, the new government\u2019s Oscar committee rejected \u201cAquarius\u201d as Brazil\u2019s candidate for best foreign-language film \u2013 prompting accusations of political retaliation.Santander\u2019s explanation for the cancellation of the show fueled the controversy.\u201cWe heard the protests and we understand that some of the works at the Queermuseu disrespected symbols, beliefs and people, which is not in line with our vision of the world,\u201d the bank said in a statement.The Free Brazil Movement \u2014 one of the same groups that organized huge demonstrations demanding Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment \u2014 declared victory. \u201cSantander used public money to finance an exhibition with pedophilia and bestiality,\u201d the group said on Facebook. \u201cBrazilian society organized to reject that. That is a boycott that worked.\u201dThe regional district attorney for children\u2019s issues, Julio Almeida, seemed to support the exhibition. \u201cWe saw the art and there isn\u2019t any pedophilia,\u201d he told journalists in P\u00f4rto Alegre. \u201cThere are some images that could be characterized as sexually explicit. But from a criminal viewpoint, there is nothing.\u201dThe exhibition, which opened on Aug. 15, included more than 263 works of art from 85 artists, including Candido Portinari, Alfredo Volpi and Lygia Clark.The paintings of children tagged \u201ctransvestite\u201d by the artist Bia Leite set off some of the strongest reactions. \u201cWe, L.G.B.T., were once children,\u201d she responded in an interview with the UOL news site. \u201cI am totally opposed to pedophilia and the psychological abuse of children. The goal of this work is just the opposite.\u201dThe curator said the exhibition was the first in Brazil to embrace the \u201cqueer perspective.\u201dIt might still find a new home in the city of Belo Horizonte, where the secretary of culture is a former minister from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government. He has received a proposal to put it in a municipal museum.\u201cI\u2019m smiling on the idea,\u201d said the secretary, Juca Ferreira, in a telephone interview. \u201cIf we allow the censorship of art, it will be a huge step backward.

As warehouses blew up, gigantic, apocalyptic fireballs rose high above the site.The airspace around the site was closed, and train traffic was diverted. By Wednesday afternoon, two people had been injured. It was not clear how long the depot might burn.Ukraine, which is locked in a conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country, has been the site of several similar episodes this year, though the fire on Wednesday was the first to occur far from the conflict zone.Ukraine\u2019s domestic intelligence agency classified the incident as sabotage. A presidential adviser, Yuriy Biriukov, wrote on Facebook that a drone could have been used to touch off the explosions, adding that, \u201cWe are at war.\u201dMr. Biriukov wrote that the fires had so far broken out only at army depots where ammunition was kept in open areas; areas where ammunition was stored in bunkers or hangars, and thus inaccessible to drones, had not been affected.In March, the authorities evacuated about 20,000 people beyond the range of burning artillery shells after a depot near Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, caught fire. The fire burned for several days and eventually ignited about half of the stored ammunition at the site.When people returned to the evacuation zone, they found pieces of a missile near a gas station and schools with broken windows. The Ukrainian authorities attributed the fire to a drone having dropped an incendiary device.A second, smaller depot went up in flames this month in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, not far from the front line of the conflict with Russian separatists. That fire was classified as arson, but it was unclear whether it was set off using a drone.Advertisement"}

There were no life jackets, but it was a short trip and the rescuers promised to come right back for him.He never saw them \u2014 or his mother \u2014 again.Any catastrophic weather event has its measurable aspects: inches of rain, speed of wind, cubic yards of debris. Others are incalculable: waterlogged photos, frayed communities, the invisible moorings of permanence and safety swept away.But perhaps the worst things are the unknowable, forever lost in the confusion, mysteries like what happened to Ms. Ellis, who was rescued not once, but twice, and who nonetheless became a casualty of the storm.At the time her son believed she was being ferried to higher ground, she was found floating face down in the floodwater. In what became one of the day\u2019s elegiac moments, Ms. Ellis was resuscitated by a group of civilian boaters from Louisiana, part of an informal organization known as the Cajun Navy. That moment was hailed on national television and social media as an example of heroism and the bond between two hurricane-pummeled Gulf Coast states.But with a huge, chaotic rescue effort underway, much of it handled by private citizens who took matters into their own hands, few people paid attention to Ms. Ellis\u2019s next 10 hours.The peak of desperation for northeast Houston residents inundated by Hurricane Harvey came on Monday, Aug. 28. Greens Bayou had swelled to a record 43.4 feet where it crossed Tidwell Road, dislodging cars and ripping apartment walls down to their studs.In the middle-class, predominantly black neighborhood where Ms. Ellis lived in a one-story brick house, people woke in the wee hours to find the water seeping in. Hundreds \u2014 if not thousands \u2014 of people escaped in watercraft of every description. The water turned thick and oily, boiling with angry clusters of fire ants.Sometime around 7 a.m., three men in a boat motored up the driveway of Ms. Ellis\u2019s house on Drifting Winds Drive.Ms. Ellis was an energetic woman \u2014 a committed Jehovah\u2019s Witness who made boudin sausage from scratch, played video games on a Sega Genesis, drove a gargantuan pickup truck with a grille the size of a portcullis and enjoyed the occasional nip of Windsor Canadian.But she had recently had surgery, followed by a stroke, family members said.So Mr. Ellis didn\u2019t stop to ask exactly who the men in the boat were \u2014 he just helped his mother aboard. She still wore the hospital bracelet from her recent treatment. Unbeknown to him, the boat had barely reached the corner stop sign when his mother somehow fell into the floodwater.\u201cThey were trying to make a right, but the boat tipped over,\u201d said a neighbor, Desmond Clark, who was peering through the rain from his window on Parkway Forest Drive. He added, \u201cI didn\u2019t see nobody go get her.\u201dMr. Clark said the person in the water floated one direction, accompanied by the garbage bags, while the others propped the boat against a truck to drain it, then climbed back in and headed the opposite way.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking to myself, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s drowning,\u2019 because she didn\u2019t look like she was drowning,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cShe looked like she was swimming.\u201dSoon three boaters from St. Tammany Parish, La., members of the Cajun Navy, saw something floating in the water. At first, they thought it was a trash bag. Then they realized it was a body.Two of them, identified in news reports as Ricky Berrigan and Donnie Davenport, jumped out while a third, Joshua Lincoln, stayed with the boat, Mr. Lincoln said.The woman had lost one of her dentures, and the other was blocking her airway, according to Mr. Lincoln. She appeared to be dead.\u201cI don\u2019t know what made them do it,\u201d he said, but they started performing chest compressions. \u201cAfter that she started breathing slowly.\u201dUnable to lift her into the boat, the men recruited two neighbors to help. \u201cShe was alive,\u201d said one, Brando Flanagan. \u201cShe was nodding. I just told her, \u2018You\u2019re going to be all right, mami. You\u2019re going to be all right.\u2019\u201d He cringed, remembering. \u201cI looked in her eye. I told her she was going to be O.K.\u201dAt the time, hospitals were virtually impossible to reach. The boaters took Ms. Ellis to the nearest dry corner, where people were sheltering at a day care center and a gas station. \u201cI was concerned that she wouldn\u2019t set up in a chair too well,\u201d Mr. Lincoln said, \u201cso we got them to say they would be extra watchful of her.\u201dHe snapped a photo of her, still wearing the black turban-style head covering she had left home in, with a cozy brown blanket draped over her. He took a close-up of the hospital bracelet bearing her name and date of birth.More than 10 hours later, Ms. Ellis arrived at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in a body bag. She was brought in, the records said, by the Coast Guard \u2014 or maybe, a hospital spokesman said later, the Fire Department. The hospital bracelet was missing. Wilma Ellis was a Jane Doe.That night, China Davis was at the hospital where she worked when the phone rang. \u201cSomebody called me and told me that my sister was floating in the water,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018China, your sister is on CNN.\u2019\u201dMs. Davis was confused \u2014 her nephew, Carl, had told her that Ms. Ellis had been taken to a nearby school. He was still waiting to be rescued himself.But there was the voice of Mr. Lincoln on television, describing how he had found Ms. Ellis in an \u201cextremely heavy current.\u201dThe newscasters hung on Mr. Lincoln\u2019s words. \u201cYou were just moved to act?\u201d they asked. \u201cHow is she doing now?\u201dAs is common in natural disasters, accurate information was scarce. On Tuesday, Mr. Lincoln told MSNBC, \u201cShe is now with her family, they say, and doing just fine.\u201d He had gotten an address, he said, so he could return her dentures.But Ms. Ellis\u2019s family did not know where she was.It was not until Thursday that Ms. Davis received a call from the morgue.Ms. Ellis, who spent her childhood picking cotton in rural north Louisiana and later worked at a hospital in Houston, was a matriarchal figure in an extended clan \u2014 she had seven siblings, six children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They called her Mama, or Jean.To find her, they had been sifting anxiously through the meager clues, left like shreds of storm debris snagged on a chain-link fence. But now that they knew she was dead, those clues refused to add up. How, if she had nearly drowned, had the turban remained on her head? In the photograph taken by Mr. Lincoln, didn\u2019t she look dry?More important, where had she been left, and with whom? Had there been foul play? Or had someone, some of them wondered, simply failed to care enough about a lone, old black woman?The red tape did not help. Her son, Carl Ellis, went to get her medical records, but came away empty-handed because he had no death certificate. The autopsy report would not be available for weeks. Ms. Ellis had been identified using fingerprints, the medical examiner\u2019s office said.But there was an official cause of death: drowning. That raised more questions \u2014 if she had been revived, how had she drowned? Had she been fished from the water only to be swallowed up again? Could she have gone through something destructive enough to wrest the hospital bracelet from her wrist?\u201cMy mom wouldn\u2019t have wandered off,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. He wondered if she had been left to fend for herself. \u201cIf I saw an elderly man or an elderly woman, I wouldn\u2019t do that. I would stay with them, make sure they\u2019re all right.\u201dBut medical experts said drowning could be listed as the cause of death even if Ms. Ellis initially survived. The autopsy could have found fluid lurking in her lungs, or the near drowning could have led to fatal complications because of weakened organs, unbalanced blood chemistry or a swollen airway. With immediate medical attention, she might have survived. If emergency medical workers had tried to treat her at any point, they may well have cut off the hospital bracelet to get it out of the way.Ms. Ellis may have been watched over, but nobody seems to remember. A man who worked at the gas station where Ms. Ellis was first dropped off said he could not recall seeing her during the storm. Less than two miles away, close to an emergency staging ground, was another gas station, where hundreds of evacuees were taken.Employees there did not remember Ms. Ellis, either. But one, Karim Musani, took a second look at the photo Mr. Lincoln had taken. \u201cI can remember this brown thing,\u201d he said, indicating the plush blanket. \u201cI picked it up. When I picked it up, it was so heavy.\u201dMore than a week after his mother\u2019s death, Mr. Ellis pulled his mother\u2019s truck into the driveway of her ruined home; his own car had flooded. Wearing a pair of denim overalls, he prepared for the job of mucking out and sorting through.The day before, he had avoided a gathering of 13 family members on the driveway, and still seemed lost in self-reproach over what had happened. Asked what he had thought when he had heard of his mother\u2019s rescue on the news, he demurred. \u201cWhen my mom left here,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought that was her rescue.\u201dBut at the memorial service, he encountered a family still under strain from the unanswered \u2014 perhaps never to be answered \u2014 questions about Ms. Ellis\u2019s final hours.Ms. Campbell, Ms. Ellis\u2019s sister, said she had tried to help. \u201cI tried to get them one by one and sit down and explain something to them: time and unforeseen occurrences befalls us all,\u201d she said, paraphrasing Scripture. \u201cThere\u2019s only two people who know what really happened \u2014 Jean, and Jehovah.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Please Offer Me a Seat,\u2019 the Buttons Say. Subway Riders Aren\u2019t Listening.", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe friendly woman who noticed Mary Alice Dadras\u2019s rounded belly on the No. 2 train in Manhattan recently had lots of questions. When was the baby due? Oh, twins? Were they boys or girls?The one question she didn\u2019t ask, as Ms. Dadras stood before her: Would you like my seat?Nobody who uses the New York City subway with any regularity would ever expect the ride to be a paragon of politesse. But for Ms. Dadras, whose twins (boys, for those wondering) are due in November, the non-offer was especially disappointing, given the blue and yellow button she had pinned to her bag in hopes of securing a seat. \u201cBABY ON BOARD!\u201d it declared in bold letters. And, underneath, a reminder: \u201cCourtesy counts.\u201dButton-wearers, or at least many of them, have an answer for them: It\u2019s not.Ms. Dadras got her button in June, before her growing stomach became obvious. She thought the button would help passengers skirt the awkward speculation of whether she was, in fact, pregnant, she said. She wore it to alert the riding public that, yes, she was, and that she would like a seat.\u201cI stopped about two weeks ago,\u201d said Ms. Dadras, who commutes from Queens to Lower Manhattan to her job as a director at the Trust for Public Land, a conservation group. \u201cI thought my belly was doing the talking for me now. I hadn\u2019t really received any seats, so I figured I would just move on.\u201dHeidi Kristoffer, who lives in Manhattan and works as a yoga instructor, said she stopped wearing her button after realizing that it elicited more eye rolls than offers of seats.\u201cI think the people that would move, would move regardless,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cAnd the people that are just not having it are not having it.\u201dJamie Tzioumis, 35, a chef and yoga instructor from Brooklyn, still wears her button, but she also aggressively makes sure commuters are aware of her situation \u2014 she will stick her belly in their faces, she said.She has also learned the power of strategic button placement.\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll put it on my breasts,\u201d said Ms. Tzioumis, whose first child is due in January. \u201cThey\u2019re getting bigger, so they\u2019ll grab some attention.\u201dWhile pregnant riders can at least hope that their bodies might be enough to prompt a polite response, many disabled riders, another population targeted by the button campaign, say that is not always the case for them.Shannon Barnsley was thrilled when she first heard about the button campaign on a Facebook group for New Yorkers with invisible disabilities, which include chronic illnesses and other conditions that may not be physically apparent, but still make it difficult for people to stand in a shaky, crowded subway car.\u201cI feel kind of awkward using it,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of the problem with invisible disabilities is people aren\u2019t aware of them, so the button not really making anyone aware of it doesn\u2019t really help.\u201dMs. Barnsley said part of the issue might be that she has not seen any public service announcements explaining the purpose of the buttons. She compared the campaign to a similar one on the subway in London, which she has seen on social media and that the transit authority has cited as inspiration. In London, Ms. Barnsley said, the transit agency clearly included invisible disabilities in its campaign. The buttons, which have the same wording as the ones in New York, come with cards that say, \u201cRemember, not all disabilities and conditions are visible.\u201d\u201cI want people to know that I didn\u2019t just make a pin to demand a seat,\u201d she said, adding that she has taken to wearing her pin next to a medic alert tag on her bag.Kathy Liu, who has the same condition as Ms. Barnsley, said she once boarded a crowded subway after being released from a hospital. Not only was she wearing her button, she said, but she was also wearing a heart monitor. No one offered her a seat, so she sat on the floor.\u201cI really feel like it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Ms. Liu, 24, said with a laugh. \u201cNot because of the button. It\u2019s because New York is a mean place.\u201d\u201cIn the New York City subway, sometimes it\u2019s a competition just to get into the train,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe question of a seat comes in as a secondary goal.\u201dAnd regardless of whether New Yorkers are a particularly unfriendly demographic \u2014 which Mr. Moss acknowledged was a possibility, noting that \u201cthis is not a sentimental city\u201d \u2014 there are practical problems, too, he said. The button\u2019s intended targets might be seated with their eyes several feet below where a standing passenger has it displayed; those eyes are probably also fixed on a book or, more likely, a screen.\u201cPeople do not use the subway for eye contact,\u201d Mr. Moss said.He added: \u201cThe people at the M.T.A. know how to run trains. I think they may not understand the behavior of the riders.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Tzioumis seems to have figured out a way to navigate that behavior. She has taken to outright asking for a seat.\u201cI stopped being really timid about it \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I try not to say thank you more than once, because I don\u2019t feel like it should be something that should be super-celebrated because they happened to give me their seat.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From a Pizza Oven in the Bronx, Albanian Specialties", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosThe layers keep rising, spooned into the round pan not in full moons but in alternating rays like the sun\u2019s, gossamer dough then melted cheese, with bouts in the oven in between. It takes hours. The top looks like parchment snatched from a fire, patched bronze at the edges and scorched at the heart.In Albania, the savory cake, called fli or flija, is traditionally baked outdoors, not over heat but under it, the pan sealed by a domed lid that\u2019s warmed over open flames and heaped with embers. At Tradita, which opened in February in the Norwood section of the Bronx, it is made in a great wood-fired pizza oven that looms in a corner, a concession to modernity.For years, this cramped storefront at the northern end of the D train was a straightforward Neapolitan pizzeria. Little trace of that past remains: The oven is shiny and new, imported from Italy, and the artfully distressed walls are covered with black-and-white photographs from 19th-century Albania, the most striking one showing a mustachioed man in a white felt hat and quilted cummerbund, rifle rigid on his shoulder.On trips home to Kosovo, he started collecting antiques destined for Tradita\u2019s dining room: a swordlike tool for churning butter, a trumpet curled in on itself, battered pots that dangle from lattice screens across the ceiling. He enlisted Fisnik Shala, a native of Kosovo\u2019s capital, Pristina, as chef; Demir Hamza, who ran a restaurant in Pristina for more than three decades, as manager; and his son, Kastriot, now 21, to fill in as needed. (He has proved to have a gift for pizza.)Tradita is not quite the sit-down restaurant the elder Mr. Kukaj envisioned \u2014 that is still to come, opening next month in a larger space on Arthur Avenue to the south. Here there are just a handful of tables, all built for two, and when I visited, the only other customers were picking up pizzas to go.I felt sorry that they didn\u2019t have a chance to try qofte Sharri, ground veal shaped into a crepe and folded around a briny cheese from the Albanian highlands. This is grilled until the juices hiss and the cheese is magma. The salt is profound, almost too much, and then your sense of \u201ctoo much\u201d shifts and it is exactly what you want.The Albanian section of the menu is brief and distinctly carnal, including smaller but still rugged qofte the size of pincushions, fat tubes of veal sausage (qebapa) and skinny links of beef (suxhuk) with a tickle of paprika. There is bread to absorb the salt: chewy, fluffy rounds smoky from the oven, and leqenik, cornbread rich as poundcake, with vivid strokes of spinach and a crown of maze, a cottagelike cheese.Mantia can be eaten in two bites, flaky phyllo giving way to ground veal, still steaming. Burek is almost a meal in itself, the phyllo crackly and capitulating. The most luxurious ones can barely contain interiors of goat cheese and maze, cloudy and oozing at once. They\u2019re presented on wooden cutting boards, raw-edged or scarred from a knife and all the more beautiful for the use.The pizza, too, is worthy, cracker-thin at the center with a slight thickening at the crust. Again, meat is all: The Tradita pizza is strewn with scarlet tabs of beef prosciutto, smoked in-house for two weeks until it takes on a mineral tang, and nubs of beef sausage buried among dark olive rings.At the top of the menu appear the words \u201cCka ka qellu,\u201d pronounced SHA ka chell-OO. (This is also the name of the restaurant soon to open on Arthur Avenue, which will be wholly devoted to Albanian food.)\u201cI\u2019ve never found a perfect translation,\u201d Mr. Kukaj said. \u201c\u2018Whatever you have\u2019 \u2014 if we invite you, even if we have nothing, we will give you whatever is left.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase born of poverty, he explained, and a testament to a spirit of kinship in hard times.\u201cEven if we have nothing, we will have love,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd salt.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Writing Lines for Obama, Mixing Comedy and Hope", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.What becomes of hope? After the cheers die down and the confetti is swept up, what happens to the initial rush of excitement that a candidate can inspire?In David Litt\u2019s memoir, \u201cThanks, Obama: My Hopey, Changey White House Years,\u201d this question is framed as a kind of love story: a political romantic comedy. Call it, perhaps, \u201cWhen Speechwriter Met Speech.\u201d Litt winningly details his ascent from campaign volunteer, flushed with the passion of early infatuation, to world-weary member of Barack Obama\u2019s senior speechwriting staff. While it has all the trappings of a coming-of-age tale set inside the Beltway, Litt\u2019s aims are grander. The speechwriter is not just a speechwriter; the speech is never just a speech. \u201cEvery speech is a speech about America,\u201d Litt writes. \u201cEvery audience is the entire United States.\u201dIn \u201cThanks, Obama\u201d Litt takes stock of the Obama administration\u2019s legacy as someone who dedicated a portion of his life to it and, more important, as someone who believed in it. While he frames himself as a simple romantic comedy hero \u2014 wide-eyed, a bit hapless, prone to slapstick \u2014 he wrestles with larger ideas of optimism in the face of cynicism.If this conflict has an antagonist, it is the specter of misplaced hope, personified by the imagined voice of Sarah Palin that exists in Litt\u2019s head. In a storytelling flourish that is too cute by half, Litt outsources the central question to a fictionalized Palin (\u201cHow\u2019s that whole hopey, changey thing workin\u2019 out for ya?\u201d), whom he likens to \u201ca fairy godmother who hates me.\u201dBut \u201cThanks, Obama\u201d is not about Sarah Palin. Perhaps surprisingly, it is also not about Barack Obama. The Obama presidency figures heavily as Litt tracks his own journey. But the man himself only makes guest appearances. Litt explains the structure of the administration, and Obama\u2019s absence from the action of the book, by comparing the White House to the Death Star from \u201cStar Wars\u201d: \u201cJust because Darth Vader is the public face of the organization doesn\u2019t mean every storm trooper gets one-on-one time.\u201dAs one might expect from the lead speechwriter for four White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinners, Litt is a funny and skillful storyteller. His humor is safe more than edgy, but what he lacks in zingers he makes up for in brilliantly observed descriptions. Take, for example, his explanation of the difference between the offices in the White House with the offices in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. One has \u201crooms best described as \u2018robber baron-chic\u2019\u201d; the other called to mind \u201cthe world\u2019s most Type A sweatshop.\u201dWhen, however, Litt\u2019s journey dovetails with the more historical, headline-grabbing elements, the memoir soars. Many events, like the death of Osama bin Laden, occurred outside of Litt\u2019s purview in the White House, and so he is unable to offer much additional insight. But after Obama\u2019s re-election, Litt\u2019s position is elevated and the book\u2019s narrative engine receives a major boost. A chapter titled \u201cBucket,\u201d about a dramatic change in Obama\u2019s approach to messaging that coincides with Litt\u2019s promotion, is particularly excellent. It crackles with insights into political processes, colored by human reactions and the comedic foibles one has come to expect.\u201cThanks, Obama\u201d is similarly alchemical, wringing comedy, pathos and a nation\u2019s hope out of one man\u2019s stumble through the halls of power. While the first half of the book is enjoyable, the second half is masterly, rising to a crescendo that is as rousing as, well, a particularly inspiring campaign speech.R.

{"Headline": "Desperation Mounts in Caribbean Islands: \u2018All the Food Is Gone\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey started with the grocery stores, scavenging what they needed for sustenance: water, crackers, fruit.But by nightfall on Thursday, what had been a search for food took a more menacing turn, as groups of people, some of them armed, swooped in and took whatever of value was left: electronics, appliances and vehicles.\u201cAll the food is gone now,\u201d Jacques Charbonnier, a 63-year-old resident of St. Martin, said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cPeople are fighting in the streets for what is left.\u201dResidents of St. Martin, and elsewhere in the region, spoke about a general disintegration of law and order as survivors struggled in the face of severe food and water shortages, and the absence of electricity and phone service.As reports of increasing desperation continued to emerge from the region over the weekend, governments in Britain, France and the Netherlands, which oversee territories in the region, stepped up their response. They defended themselves against criticism that their reaction had been too slow, and insufficient. Both the French and Dutch governments said they were sending in extra troops to restore order, along with the aid that was being airlifted into the region.After an emergency meeting with his government on Sunday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said he would travel on Tuesday to St. Martin, an overseas French territory. Mr. Macron also announced late on Saturday that he would double France\u2019s troop deployment to the region, to 2,200 from 1,100; officials say the increase is in part a response to the mayhem on St. Martin.The Dutch territorial side of the island has also experienced widespread security problems at shops. The issue was reported to have subsided by Sunday, though not completely.\u201cThere was some looting in the first few days, but the Dutch marines and police are on the street to prevent it,\u201d Paul De Windt, publisher of The Daily Herald, a newspaper on the Dutch side, said on Sunday. \u201cSome people steal luxury things and booze, but a lot of people are stealing water and biscuits.\u201dMore than 265 Dutch military personnel have been deployed to the island, and an additional 250 are expected to be sent to the region in the next few days to help maintain order and assist with relief efforts, the Dutch government said. In addition, 90 police officers have been flown in from Cura\u00e7ao, another Dutch territory.The storm delivered a direct hit on the region starting Wednesday, destroying airports and ports, knocking out power and potable water systems, and leaving many tens of thousands of residents and tourists isolated and increasingly desperate, unable to go anywhere.The crisis worsened on Saturday as Hurricane Jose rumbled through the region. Though the islands hit by Irma avoided a direct blow from the second hurricane, its arrival forced the suspension of relief and rescue operations, prolonging the agony for many.On Sunday, officials announced that two more bodies had been discovered on the Dutch side of St. Martin, increasing the death toll in the Caribbean attributable to Hurricane Irma to at least 27. So far, about a dozen deaths on both sides of the island have been attributed to the storm, according to The Associated Press. People here, however, insist that the death toll is much higher.While there is no way to verify such claims, they illustrate the fear and the rumors swirling through an island as people are cut off from the rest of the world, with roads blocked and most areas without cellular service. News, for the most part, is being relayed by word of mouth, leading to outsize claims. One rumor making the rounds on Sunday was that hundreds of people had died, some at the hands of escapees from a local prison.The French government denied the rumors about the alleged prison break on Sunday. But some residents spoke of witnessing violence, with people fighting over food at grocery stores, and people armed with guns and other weapons.Residents reported that armed men had entered the Hotel Flamboyant in Marigot, the capital of the French side, and robbed tourists by knocking on the doors to their rooms, flashing guns and demanding valuables.The French National Gendarmerie, whose troops are in St. Martin and St. Barth\u00e9lemy, another French overseas territory ravaged by the hurricane, announced on Twitter on Sunday that it had made 23 arrests. In a statement, the French Interior Ministry said: \u201cExtraordinary resources have been sent to the Antilles. The government is totally mobilized.\u201dAmerican officials said Sunday that they had helped evacuate about 1,200 American citizens from St. Martin, many on C-130s, which flew evacuees to Puerto Rico.On Sunday, Cuba was also reckoning with the damage from Hurricane Irma, which roared along the island nation\u2019s northern coast on Saturday.Although there have been no reported fatalities or casualties, Havana awoke Sunday morning to substantial damage. The capital\u2019s inhabitants, who spent the night in darkness after authorities cut power as a precaution, found fallen trees, mangled lampposts, and smashed water tanks. Floodwaters reached more than 600 yards into the city.But damage in the capital was light compared with elsewhere on the island. In the coastal city of Matanzas, 60 miles east, one-story houses were completely underwater, and damage to Cayo Romano and Cayo Coco, popular tourist islands, was severe. A video posted on Facebook showed hotel roofs caved in, and mounds of concrete and coils of steel in lobbies. The northern keys are home to more than 50 all-inclusive hotels, which provide essential hard currency for Cuba.The Cuban government immediately began relief efforts, deploying security forces in large numbers to the hardest-hit areas, along with convoys of trucks carrying food and heavy equipment to help remove debris.\u201cCuba is very organized,\u201d said Orlando Eorlsando, 53, as he replaced his front door with bloated plywood in Havana. \u201cThe priority of the government is to keep people safe and preserve life.\u201dWhile the Cuban response seemed to be a well-oiled machine, elsewhere in the Caribbean the government reaction has been halting, critics say.In France the criticism of the government\u2019s response to the storm came first from Mr. Macron\u2019s opponents, who were eager to use the hurricane to find fault with his administration.A more measured critique came from a former minister of France\u2019s overseas territories, Victorin Lurel, who said that the situation needed more \u201cresources, more logistical planning, more transport and a hospital boat.\u201d\u201cPeople could have been evacuated ahead of time,\u201d he said in an interview Sunday on the news channel Europe1. The government response on the Dutch side, he insisted, was better than on the French side.In Marigot, a French Gendarmerie helicopter hovered over the city on Sunday afternoon, flying low and scanning the storm-blistered streets. Boats in the marina had been upturned, half submerged or tossed onto the beach by the storm.Families with relatives on the island organized convoys of boats from as far away as Guadeloupe, bringing water, canned goods, fuel and the chance to escape. But even that has become dangerous. Several boats turned back from St. Martin\u2019s main port, fearful of the crowds gathered seeking aid.As one boat pulled into the Marigot harbor on Sunday, a family raced to the docks to offload goods \u2014 and load several children on board. Goodbyes were said quickly, and the new passengers who climbed aboard heaved a sigh of relief as the boat pulled off.Maeva Canappele, 20, wept as the boat began to distance itself from the island of St. Martin, destined for Guadeloupe, a six-hour ride on choppy seas. She was grateful.\u201cIt was getting bad on the island,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone broke into our home and tried to rob us, but my parents managed to scare them away.\u201dIn a statement on Sunday, the French interior ministry said that after emergency needs are dealt with, reconstruction will begin. Among its priorities, the statement said, it intends to distribute one million liters of drinking water, secure private property; and get the telecommunications systems running again.On Tuesday, a French navy ship equipped with a hospital and carrying helicopters, troops and reconstruction material will depart from France.In Britain, lawmakers from both the governing Conservative party, as well as the Labour opposition, have accused the government of failing to take adequate precautions to protect the residents of three British territories lying in the path of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Jose.About 75,000 people, most of them British nationals, live on the Caribbean territories of Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands \u2014 each of which suffered substantial damage from Hurricane Irma.In preparation for the hurricane season, the British government had sent a naval supply ship to the region in July. Following the storm, the ship brought 40 relief specialists to Anguilla, who helped to restore power at the island\u2019s main hospital and carry out repairs at its airport, according to the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.Since Friday, Britain has also sent two transport planes carrying almost 20 tons of emergency supplies to its Caribbean territories, as well as 250 marines and two extra military helicopters. Britain\u2019s largest warship will arrive in the Caribbean in around 10 days, carrying eight more helicopters.Azam Ahmed reported from Marigot, St. Martin, and Kirk Semple from Mexico City.

{"Headline": "Facebook to Turn Over Russian-Linked Ads to Congress", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Under growing pressure from Congress and the public to reveal more about the spread of covert Russian propaganda on Facebook, the company said on Thursday that it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to congressional committees investigating the Kremlin\u2019s influence operation during the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cI care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,\u201d Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said during an appearance on Facebook Live, the company\u2019s video service. He added that he did not want anyone \u201cto use our tools to undermine democracy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what we stand for,\u201d he said.The disclosure of the ads also raised the possibility of future regulation of political advertising on social media platforms. This week, congressional Democrats asked the Federal Election Commission to advise on ways to prevent illicit foreign influence on American elections via social media, including possible new laws or regulations.Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, denied on Friday that Russia had been involved in any way. The Kremlin, he said, does not even know how to put advertisements on Facebook, adding, \u201cWe have never done it, and the Russian side has never been involved in this.\u201dIn his seven-minute talk from Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg suggested there may be additional fake accounts linked to Russia or other foreign countries. \u201cWe are looking into foreign actors, including additional Russian groups and other former Soviet states,\u201d he said.Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, noted that Thursday was his first day back from parental leave after the birth of a daughter. But despite that folksy touch, he had the look of an improbably young leader addressing his people at a moment of crisis.\u201cWe are in a new world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation-states attempting to subvert elections. But if that\u2019s what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion.\u201dDespite Russia\u2019s stealth attack, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that Facebook remained a force for good in democracy, promoting billions of online discussions, linking voters to candidates and helping two million Americans register to vote. He said that positive role was \u201c100 or 1,000 times bigger\u201d than the illicit activity.Twitter, which has kept a low profile since Facebook\u2019s disclosure of the Russian intrusion, has announced that it will brief the Senate Intelligence Committee next Wednesday behind closed doors.In a statement, Twitter did not address illicit Russian activity on its platform but said it \u201cdeeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies\u201d and vowed to \u201ccontinue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation.\u201dSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, praised Facebook\u2019s announcement but said he still believed regulation was needed to ensure that voters know more about who is behind ads on social media.\u201cThis is a good first step,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed it\u2019s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they\u2019ve become much more transparent.\u201d He said he believed there were additional \u201ctroll farms\u201d in both Russia and Eastern Europe, \u201cand it\u2019s really important that Facebook work with us to investigate other sources of advertising and fake accounts.\u201dMr. Warner said he believed the 3,000 ads, which the committees had not yet received, should be made public with protections for the privacy of any innocent people whose names may be in the material.Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, circulated a letter inviting colleagues to co-sponsor a bill that would require greater transparency for online political ads, according to a copy of the letter seen by The New York Times.A spokeswoman for Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, who is chairman of the intelligence panel, said he had no comment Thursday night.The Times also found Facebook accounts that appeared to have been created by ordinary Americans but were actually concocted by Russian agents. Facebook, which had said as recently as July that it had found no evidence of fraudulent Russian ad purchases, reversed itself this month and said it had removed 470 profiles and pages that it said were linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.Facebook found $100,000 of ad purchases that were linked to the fake pages \u2014 designed to look like the pages of Americans animated by particular issues \u2014 that spread inflammatory messages about immigration, guns and other topics; derided Mrs. Clinton and supported Mr. Trump. Facebook shut the accounts down in recent weeks but declined to name or describe them publicly, saying federal law prohibited it from making customer communications public.One question for Mr. Mueller is certain to be whether the Russian Facebook advertising \u2014 and any other promotions using Twitter or other services \u2014 showed evidence of the kind of sophisticated targeting that might indicate that Americans had provided assistance. Facebook has said some of the ads were targeted to particular geographic areas but has not given details.For the social media companies, the furor over Russia\u2019s interference raises a possibility that they deeply fear: government regulation, at least for the part of their business that involves political advertising. Political ads on social media have thus far escaped the rules that require, for instance, the familiar \u201cI approve this message\u201d tagline on candidates\u2019 television spots.Tech executives worry that new rules could hinder the world\u2019s largest digital advertising businesses. Because of the self-service advertising system these tech giants have created, anyone who has an account and a credit card can buy an ad. That has made for a long tail of small-ticket advertisers who add up to millions of dollars in spending.\u201cFacebook\u2019s number one priority is ad revenue,\u201d said Ian Schafer, chief experience officer of Engine USA, a digital advertising holding company. \u201cThe last thing Facebook wants to do is give the government an inch, because then they\u2019ll probably take a mile.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Yankees Surge Past Orioles to Remain in the Thick of the Playoff Hunt", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 The ruling the Yankees had been bracing for was finally handed down Monday morning \u2014 and it was a reprieve of sorts. Gary Sanchez, their starting catcher, had his four-game suspension reduced to three, and although he would have to miss the entire series here against the Baltimore Orioles, the timing could hardly have been better.Sanchez, after all, had played in Sunday night\u2019s game against the Boston Red Sox in the Bronx, so there was a strong likelihood that he would not have started Monday afternoon\u2019s game in Baltimore, anyway. That made the reduced three-game ban more like a two-game penalty.Still, without Sanchez, their hottest hitter, for the next few days, the Yankees would need to find other ways to win, and in Monday\u2019s Labor Day matinee, they did.Starlin Castro and Didi Gregorius, the reunited middle of the Yankees\u2019 infield, took care of most of the team\u2019s offensive needs, and Austin Romine caught a good game in Sanchez\u2019s absence as the Yankees beat the Orioles, 7-4.With a new crown on a front tooth, Castro collected the Yankees\u2019 first hit of the game in the fourth inning and scored on Gregorius\u2019s two-run homer that narrowed the Orioles\u2019 lead to 3-2. Then, an inning later, Castro bashed a two-run homer of his own to put the Yankees in the lead for good. Still later, Castro provided a run-scoring single.Castro finished the afternoon with three hits, two runs and three R.B.I. Since being activated from the disabled list on Aug. 25, he is 14 for 37 (.378) with four doubles, a home run and nine R.B.I.\u201cWe\u2019ve missed the veteran presence in our lineup the past month and a half,\u201d Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said. Now with Castro, in particular, they have it back.After three wins in four games against the Red Sox this past weekend, the Yankees\u2019 latest victory drew them to within two and a half games of Boston in the American League East following the Red Sox\u2019s 10-4 loss to the visiting Toronto Blue Jays on Monday.Gregorius credited Castro with getting the first hit of the game and breaking up the momentum of Orioles starter Dylan Bundy, and Castro applauded Gregorius for getting the Yankees going with his home run.But there was also a sense of overall accomplishment for the Yankees, given how emphatically they have rebounded in recent days. After they were swept in three games by the Cleveland Indians at home last week, including two defeats in a doubleheader, the Yankees have won four of five against division rivals.\u201cIt just shows how big our heart is for the game,\u201d Gregorius said. \u201cWe always go out there and battle.\u2019\u2019The Orioles have been one of the top offensive teams in the majors since the All-Star Game break and had won eight of 10 entering Monday. And they scored the first run of the game when Tim Beckham hit a leadoff home run off Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery. After two innings, it was 3-0, Baltimore.Girardi turned the ball over to Chad Green in the fifth inning, and he continued to perform with expertise, striking out four in two and one-third hitless and scoreless innings. His E.R.A. dipped to 1.97 for the season, and Romine was asked what he thought of Green\u2019s high-powered stuff.\u201cI see guys gearing up to hit fastballs and swing-and-missing,\u201d Romine said. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a reason why.\u201dRomine is awaiting word on the appeal of his own two-game suspension for his role in the same brawl with the Detroit Tigers on Aug. 24 for which Sanchez was penalized.\u201cI keep looking at my phone,\u201d Romine said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not in the next two days.\u201dBut actually the Yankees do not expect Major League Baseball to rule on Romine\u2019s suspension until after Sanchez finishes sitting out his ban, because that would leave the Yankees without their top two catchers at once.Sanchez had mixed feelings about the reduction of his suspension.\u201cIn a way I feel good about it, and then on the other hand, I don\u2019t feel good about it,\u201d Sanchez said through an interpreter before Monday\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019m unable to help my team in these important games, and I want to be able to help.\u201dSanchez has had a solid offensive season, and in his last 13 games he has been dangerous, batting .310 with five home runs and a .902 on-base plus slugging percentage.He was suspended for coming off the bench and throwing punches into a pile of players on the ground in Detroit. When asked if he regretted his actions, Sanchez said it was in the past and he could not change it. But there was a mea culpa to the fans, the Yankees and the Tigers on his Facebook page.\u201cI want to apologize for my actions during the last Detroit Tigers series,\u201d the post read. \u201cThe heat of the moment and my desire to protect my teammates led me to commit some errors during the brawl. It\u2019s an incident I regret and from which I have learned.\u201dAnd after two more games he will also be back in the lineup in what is increasingly shaping up as an intense final few weeks of the season.Advertisement"}

President Trump has vowed to bolster American manufacturing \u2014 and domestic steel production in particular.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his plan for the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. While he may decide to give Congress time to come up with a permanent resolution, immigration advocates and economists warned that the possible demise of DACA could lead to the deportation of as many as 800,000 people, many of whom are working legally in industries across the United States.\u201cWhy would you take people out of the work force, who are part of the system and paying taxes?\u201d asked Mr. Zalesne, president of Owen Steel in Columbia, S.C.Key Republicans have signaled that they want to find a way to preserve some part of the program, which President Barack Obama put in place in 2012. But finding a permanent fix has eluded Congress.Last week and over the weekend, American business leaders, including Mr. Zalesne, stepped into the political fray and urged Mr. Trump to extend DACA. More than 400 of them signed a letter to the president and congressional leaders, warning that such immigrants \u2014 brought to the United States as children and known as \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 are vital to the economy.But executives at big companies outside of the tech sector spoke up, too. The chairman and chief executive of Best Buy, Hubert Joly, wrote on the company\u2019s blog on Friday, \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of young men and women whose futures are at stake.\u201dOn DACA, the executives are taking a pragmatic approach. While many immigration advocates have focused on humanitarian issues, the executives focused on the economic toll.According the letter from the executives, 65 percent of Dreamers have bought a car and 16 percent have purchased their own home. This economic activity, they argue, would be eliminated if the Dreamers were deported.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimates that five years after a repeal of DACA, the nation\u2019s gross domestic product would be $105 billion less than it would be if the program stays in place.\u201cThe Dreamers are on track to be a highly educated group, and losing them will be a significant blow to businesses already struggling to find educated and skilled young workers,\u201d Mr. Zandi wrote in an email on Monday.Mr. Zalesne said he was not sure how many, if any, of the 295 workers at his company\u2019s facilities, which fabricate steel for projects like the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, are protected by DACA.He decided to take a stand, he said, not only because of the economic implications, but also because he could not ignore the human toll that deportation would take on people who have been working and going to school legally and have mostly known only one country \u2014 the United States.\u201cThey have been trying to do the right thing,\u201d he said.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The state paper Al Ahram said one of the men had been detained for posting approvingly on Facebook about the concert.\u201cLegal actions against him are underway,\u201d the paper reported.On Monday, one man who had been photographed with a rainbow flag at the concert wrote on Facebook, \u201cHad I raised the ISIS flag I wouldn\u2019t be facing half of what I am facing now.\u201d The man, who said he was not gay, did not respond to requests for comment. It was unclear if he was among those arrested.In an apparently separate case, a student who attended the Mashrou\u2019 Leila concert was arrested hours later after being \u201ccaught in the act,\u201d the police said. The student was charged with \u201cdebauchery\u201d and sentenced to six years imprisonment on Tuesday.The police lured the man to a location near the pyramids using a fake profile on a dating app, and arrested him.Homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt, but the authorities frequently prosecute gay men for homosexuality and women for prostitution under loosely-worded laws that prohibit immorality and \u201chabitual debauchery.\u201dThe band\u2019s following grew after the Arab Spring, as it rode a wave of youthful openness, but it has since fallen foul of conservatives in different countries. It was twice banned in Jordan after facing accusations of blasphemy and not respecting the country\u2019s traditions.Ahmed Mahran, a law lecturer who filed the criminal complaint against the flag-wavers, conceded in a phone interview that some were minors. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Mahran said. \u201cWe need to set an example.\u201dHe added, \u201cThese people must be treated with force and cruelty.\u201dMr. Sisi\u2019s government has also used the language of public morals to suppress critics. On Monday a court convicted Khaled Ali, a lawyer and opposition figure, for making an obscene finger gesture outside a Cairo courthouse last year after he and other lawyers won a case against the government.Mr. Ali, who was a candidate in the 2012 presidential election, has expressed interest in running again in 2018.

{"Headline": "Without Calling Itself a Wine Bar, Cervo\u2019s Acts Like One", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosThe tight quarters back there, the low ceiling broken by a skylight, and the glossy wood paneling made me feel as if I were eating in the dining cabin of a large but not excessively luxurious sailboat. And the man at the table next to mine couldn\u2019t seem to find his sea legs.\u201cI don\u2019t recognize anything on this wine list,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is exciting, in a way, but ...\u201dGamely, the sommelier asked what he usually liked to drink. \u201cUnoaked chardonnay and California-style sauvignon blanc,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t have any of those.\u201dWithout calling itself a wine bar, Cervo\u2019s does a good impersonation of one, pouring about 12 unfortified wines by the glass along with another dozen or so sherries, Madeiras and ports.The menu reads like a wine bar\u2019s, too. Portions are generally small and the plates are unstudied, starting with some basics like fleshy green olives in olive oil and paprika, or pan con tomate with ripe tomatoes and shavings of bottarga.The main ideas that Mr. Perkins and Aaron Crowder, who share the chef duties, seem to have drawn from the cuisine of Portugal is that people there eat a lot of seafood and tend to keep things simple. This isn\u2019t a bad place to start, though.The selection of oysters is not overwhelming, but each time I\u2019ve turned up there were new ones to swallow, Truro Pearls and Wellfleets from Cape Cod in August and, in September, Pink Moons and Savage Blondes from Prince Edward Island.From the raw bar also come things like whole white prawns marinated in white wine and garlic, or radishes shaved over anchodinas, the meaty and salty Spanish sardine fillets that are preserved like anchovies.The kitchen has a way of applying just enough chile heat to register: The pink flesh of yellowfin tuna was just starting to go opaque from lemon juice stirred with fermented Serrano chiles, while pickled banana peppers accentuated the sweetness of marinated and browned scallops, and stopped there.Cockles or small clams steamed open in vinho verde with garlic seem always to be on the menu, and they make a very delicious next step after cold seafood. There is often a strangely likable beef tartare with littlenecks and so much of the clams\u2019 steaming juices that it almost comes across as some kind of mutant chowder. Fish \u2014 porgy or Boston mackerel recently \u2014 goes right on the plancha in one piece.Chicken skewers with sweet onions and yogurt may sound, in the context of this menu, like a sop to the seafood-averse. It is, in fact, a standout. The chicken is marinated and griddled with ground fennel seed, coriander and other spices, a bit like the great Andalusian snack pintxos moru\u00f1os. The skewers are carried out on a plate with all their juices pooling around a spoonful of yogurt and petals of onions brought to the crunchy-tender threshold on the plancha.It would be easy to let my enthusiasm about Cervo\u2019s get the better of me, the way some people have gotten carried away over Hart\u2019s. The charm of both restaurants is that they come on easy, then deliver more than some places that are much more full of themselves.Overstating that charm wouldn\u2019t do Cervo\u2019s any favors. The lamb burger can be juicy one night and dry on another. (Either way, adding white anchovies for $3 more improves it, one of the few restaurant-burger upgrades I\u2019d say that about.) Raw cabbage leaves dressed with yogurt and bottarga, meanwhile, might have come from a completely different restaurant. Cervo\u2019s hasn\u2019t put down deep enough roots into Iberian food yet for the kitchen to flirt with trendier styles.So I won\u2019t make extravagant promises. I think you should just go and see what happens.An earlier version of this article misstated the days Cervo\u2019s is open.

Major milestones \u2014 like birthdays, graduations and anniversaries of the attacks (today marks 16 years) \u2014 have been extremely difficult, but even harder are \u201cthe little things,\u201d said Ms. Colaio, now 18 and a freshman studying film at Quinnipiac University. \u201cWould I have the same laugh as him or would I have the same sense of humor?

{"Headline": "Twitter, With Accounts Linked to Russia, to Face Congress Over Role in Election", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump\u2019s admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee.As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States.But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using \u201cbot\u201d accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts \u2014 arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service. Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts.Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent \u201chad a primary theme of anti-Americanism,\u201d the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa \u2014 short for anti-fascist \u2014 protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea\u2019s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump\u2019s earlier wiretapping claims.In the face of such public scrutiny, Twitter has said almost nothing about what it knows about Russia\u2019s use of its platform. But Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he would like to know exactly what the company has done to find covert Russian activity and what it has discovered so far about fake accounts \u2014 including their reach and impact.\u201cI think right now the public is aware of only a subset of a subset of Russian activity online,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in an interview. He said Facebook long denied that there had been Russian exploitation of its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6.Mr. Schiff said the tech companies have asked for assistance from American intelligence agencies in trying to find and stop illicit interference from other countries, a request he said he supports.The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Experts on Russia inside and outside the government say President Vladimir V. Putin had multiple goals in last year\u2019s campaign of hacking, leaking and stealth propaganda. He hoped to damage, if not defeat, Mrs. Clinton, whom he blamed for encouraging pro-democracy protests in Russia and neighboring states.Last week, Facebook said it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to Congress. Many of those ads, like the opposing Twitter hashtags on the N.F.L. anthem issue, targeted divisions in American society by simultaneously sending conflicting messages to different users segmented by political and racial characteristics.\u201cWhat we see over and over again is that a lot of the messaging isn\u2019t about politics, a specific politician, or political parties,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating societal division, identifying divisive issues and fanning the flames.\u201dFor its part, Twitter has not said much about what it plans to say in the Congressional briefing.\u201cTwitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies, and will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation that violate our Terms of Service,\u201d Twitter said in a statement.Twitter has also said it was working to crack down on bots that distribute tweets en masse or that attempt to manipulate the platform\u2019s trending topics.Colin Crowell, Twitter\u2019s vice president of public policy, government and philanthropy, said in a blog post in June that the company should not be an arbiter of whether a tweet is truthful or not. Because Twitter is open and real-time, he said the platform is the best antidote to misinformation, when \u201cjournalists, experts and engaged citizens Tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds.\u201dKaren North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said the company\u2019s defense has some merit.\u201cTwitter functions more like a broadcast network,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say things and everyone can hear it. When false information is stated, people can jump on false statements and challenge it.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Scott Shane from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Subway Fails, Riders Scream Into the Twitter Abyss", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cries of misery from the underground began to bubble up into the world above just as the Thursday morning rush was getting underway on the New York City subway.They started with plaintive inquiries.Confusion quickly turned to frustration.Frustration turned to anger.Anger led to resignation.But it was hardly the first. And even as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, scrambles to make urgent repairs to problems caused by years of neglect, it will surely not be the last.When asked why the L line was so snarled on Thursday, why thousands of commuters were forced to wait hours or abandon the subway altogether, Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the transit agency, would say only that there had been door problems.The crew on an L train could not verify that the doors had closed properly so the train had to be taken out of service, Mr. Ortiz said.\u201cBecause the train was not fully inside the station it took a while to discharge customers off the train,\u201d he said.Because official explanations about how small problems, like a faulty door, can lead to big headaches often fail to satisfy riders, each subway meltdown elicits a corresponding flood of tweets, Snaps, Facebook and Instagram posts meant to share commuters\u2019 misery with the world.Whether it makes people feel better to post their frustrations on social media is an open question and something of a charged topic of scholarly investigation.There is a reason the expression misery loves company is a clich\u00e9.When it comes to direct person-to-person contact, emotional contagion can lead people to experience the same emotions without being aware they are doing so.Social media \u2014 where contact is less direct \u2014 is different and psychiatrists and social scientists are still trying to understand its impact.If that is the case, the social media streams that flow from subway upheavals could create a negative impression among those who were not even directly affected. It also allows those who are affected to vent.\u201cLol no L train service at all but at least the M shuttle bus line is only two blocks long,\u201d she wrote before directing her ire at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the transportation authority.Then she posted: \u201cI hate New York.\u201d Before quickly making it clear that she was joking. \u201cI love it here.\u201dMs. Favilla, a commerce editor at BuzzFeed, said there was no doubt that, at the very least, sharing her frustration helped ease some of her distress.\u201cI absolutely feel better about a miserable commuting situation when I share it on Twitter and realize my co-workers and I are all in it together,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s simply human nature to find comfort in grieving about shared experiences with others,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I also don\u2019t feel as anxious about rolling into work late when it\u2019s clear that dozens of my co-workers are also in the same boat.\u201dAs a lifelong New Yorker, she recalled how in the age before social media \u201call you could really do was shake your fist and grumble under your breath.\u201d\u201cI live off of both the M and L trains, so it won\u2019t be as dire a situation for me personally since I have another option,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I expect many more chaotic mornings like today\u2019s commute for plenty of people.\u201dBenedict Carey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Can Beat Trump in 2020?", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "Illustration by Alex MertoIllustration by Alex MertoIllustrationby Alex MertoIllustration by Alex MertoEvery senator looks in the mirror and sees a future president. But these days, for Democrats at least, it\u2019s not just members of Capitol Hill\u2019s upper chamber who are picturing themselves sitting in the Oval Office. Congressmen, governors, mayors, even people who hold no elected office \u2014 men and women at seemingly every rung of the political ladder, including no rung at all \u2014 are suddenly eyeing the White House.Although Democrats are united in their opposition to President Trump, the fundamental party cleavage runs between populists and centrists. The Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 will be the person who either finds a way to appeal to both wings or, just as likely, divines which wings represent the greater number of primary voters. Following is a guide to some of the potential candidates \u2014 and the political bets they\u2019ll be making.A literature of alternative histories has sprung up about Democratic candidates other than Hillary Clinton who would have won in 2016. The two most popular titles in this genre? \u201cBernie Would Have Won\u201d and \u201cBiden Would Have Won.\u201d Are they viable for 2020?Would Mr. Sanders or Mr. Biden have won in 2016? We\u2019ll never know \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely either will in 2020.As a democratic socialist, Senator Sanders has no real allegiance to the Democratic Party; it often seems his populist movement would just as soon burn the party down. But there are other populists who are less antagonistic to the Democratic Party \u2014 not to mention who actually belong to it.If she runs, Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, would instantaneously be the Democrats\u2019 putative front-runner. Her anti-corporate agenda has made her a fund-raising powerhouse, and she seems to have found an ideological sweet spot between the centrist Clinton and populist Sanders factions. Additionally, thanks to the \u201cNevertheless she persisted\u201d meme, she\u2019s become a feminist heroine.But Ms. Warren, who\u2019ll be 71 in 2020, is an ambivalent politician \u2014 a longtime law professor, she didn\u2019t run for office until 2012 \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear that she has the proverbial fire in the belly for a presidential bid.And if the populist wing is looking for a Plan C, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon humbly suggests himself. He was the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders in 2016, has been spending a fair amount of time in Iowa of late, and has become the go-to guy on Capitol Hill for liberal groups like MoveOn.Being the establishment candidate in the current political climate is the kiss of death. Which is why even candidates who fit that mold will do everything they can to avoid the label \u2014 including co-sponsoring Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All.Mr. Booker, a New Jersey senator, has seemingly been running for president since he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford in the \u201990s. But some of the well-heeled backers he picked up along the way \u2014 including Big Pharma and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump \u2014 are now political poison in a Democratic primary. He may end up spending as much time distancing himself from his old supporters as cultivating new ones.\u201cClinton\u201d is almost as much of a dirty word as \u201cestablishment.\u201d But one candidate would proudly carry the banner of Clintonism.Terry McAuliffe, who\u2019ll finish his term as Virginia governor early next year, is an unapologetic friend and backer of both Clintons. He\u2019s a famously fabulous fund-raiser and he has put together a solidly (and surprisingly) progressive record in the commonwealth \u2014 tightening gun control laws and reinstituting voting rights for more than 150,000 felons. His national stature grew during the Charlottesville protests, when he provided the sort of moral leadership so sorely lacking from the White House. \u201cGovernor Macker,\u201d as he\u2019s known, was once considered a punch line, so laugh at the notion of a President Macker at your own risk.Hillary Clinton tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to run for Barack Obama\u2019s third term. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, might have better luck. He\u2019d have the unambivalent backing of much of the Obama political machine, including, it is said, Mr. Obama himself. He\u2019s one of the few Democrats out there with Mr. Obama\u2019s rhetorical skills and a life story to match \u2014 rising from a Chicago housing project to Harvard and Harvard Law. To be sure, Mr. Patrick\u2019s post-office employer, Bain Capital, would dog him. But if any Democrat is capable of rebuilding the formidable Obama coalition, it\u2019s him.Millennials are expected to surpass baby boomers as the largest generation of eligible voters in 2020. So it would only make sense for a few politicians who might still get carded to run themselves.Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts congressman, is a charismatic, intelligent Iraq war veteran who isn\u2019t afraid to call out party elders like Nancy Pelosi. He\u2019s only 38, and it\u2019s almost certainly too soon for him to have much of a chance at winning the nomination in 2020, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to put his name into the 2020 veepstakes.At 44, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio doesn\u2019t make the cut of being a millennial himself, but he\u2019s fashioned himself as a fresh face on Capitol Hill and he thinks he has an economics-focused message for members of that generation, especially those who live in working-class cities like his hometown near Youngstown.Christopher Murphy, a 44-year-old Connecticut senator, is casting his message at a different segment of millennials \u2014 those who live on Twitter, where he offers running political commentary, or listen to podcasts like \u201cPod Save America,\u201d where he\u2019s made several appearances. His and Mr. Ryan\u2019s campaign slogans write themselves: \u201cYou\u2019re Only as Old as You Feel.\u201dSome Democrats will be tempted to look beyond the Beltway for a savior. Thus the appeal of a certain type of pragmatic governor.John Hickenlooper, in his second term as Colorado governor, has built a solid economic record there while also instituting tough gun control laws and (despite his objections) overseeing the smooth introduction of legalized marijuana. He\u2019s also evinced a willingness for bipartisanship that has served him well in purple Colorado. He\u2019s an offbeat enough character that it\u2019s possible to see him catching fire.Steve Bullock is a second-term governor in deep-red Montana, and he\u2019d cast himself as someone who\u2019d help Democrats broaden their electoral map beyond the coasts. It\u2019s not a bad sales pitch. But Mr. Bullock isn\u2019t much of a salesman. One joke making the rounds about him goes that if you close your eyes while he\u2019s speaking, you hear Evan Bayh.It\u2019s a long step from the mayor\u2019s office to the White House, but with so few Democratic governors \u2014 and with the party\u2019s strength in urban areas \u2014 it seems an opportune time for a Democratic mayor to take it.Eric Garcetti, in his second term as Los Angeles mayor, is considered by many Democrats to be a top political talent. And while a run for Congress or the governor\u2019s office might be more realistic, his articulation of an urban agenda, with a focus on infrastructure and immigration, could strike a chord in a presidential race.Mitch Landrieu, who\u2019ll finish his term-limited tenure as New Orleans mayor early next year, struck a chord in May when he gave a speech explaining why the city was taking down its four Confederate monuments. In the wake of Charlottesville, his words have become even more resonant.Suffice it to say, the events of 2016 were enough to make any billionaire think a run for the White House was suddenly plausible. And even if Facebook\u2019s political troubles have made a Mark Zuckerberg candidacy a non-starter, 2020 is drawing the interest of a range of other rich people.Mark Cuban, the outspoken owner of the N.B.A.\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, is the most similar to Mr. Trump, right down to his starring role on a reality-TV show. Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, cuts a less bombastic figure, frequently denouncing partisanship.But it\u2019s hard to see any billionaire, even one as rabble-rousing as Mr. Cuban, faring well in a Democratic primary in 2020.David Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s political guru, likes to say that voters usually seek \u201cthe remedy, not the replica\u201d of the incumbent. When you consider how much political logic has been turned on its head, perhaps Democrats will nominate a Trumpian figure of their own. Enter the Rock, who inspired the formation of a political action committee to support his presidential aspirations after he announced his intention to run for the White House (albeit in a skit on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d).Advertisement"}

Cue the pumpkins.For some New Yorkers, pumpkin growing is a competitive sport.As early as April, competitors start growing their gourds, according to Mr. Wolf. \u201cYou can go from a little baby pumpkin the size of a marble at the end of June to a giant one at the end of September,\u201d he said.Pumpkins that arrive at the weigh-offs in less-than-pristine condition \u2014 say, with deep holes or big rotten spots \u2014 are usually disqualified. \u201cThere should be no physical tampering with the fruit,\u201d Mr. Wolf said.But how does one even transport a pumpkin of that size?\u201cVery carefully,\u201d said Mr. Wolf. Contenders will pack their ginormous pumpkins into oversized wooden shipping pallets (so that a forklift can hoist them up), set them on the back of a truck or trailer, and then drive them to the competition sites.Here\u2019s what else is happening:So if you\u2019re thinking of going pumpkin picking, shades, sunscreen and short sleeves are in order.Why the pomp around pumpkins?\u201cIn the colonial period, it wasn\u2019t a food that people liked to eat, but they ate it because it was prolific,\u201d Ms. Ott said. \u201cBut as soon as they could afford to eat other stuff, they did.\u201d In the early 1800s, as people moved from farms into cities, their sweet squash found a home in stores, \u201cbut the orange pumpkin \u2014 big, round, cumbersome and not as flavorful \u2014 had no place in the marketplace.\u201dAnd so the pumpkin became venerated as a nostalgic symbol and eaten as a dessert, rather than as an everyday food like the squash.If you\u2019re heading out to a patch or orchard in the coming weeks, a final tip from the pumpkin expert: The classic field pumpkins (or the jack-o\u2019-lantern pumpkins) are less tasty, \u201cbred to be ornamental, but not something that you eat,\u201d Ms. Ott said, and the \u201cbulgy, warty\u201d ones are sweeter, meatier and better for cooking.Advertisement"}

Like the indefatigable maid Rosie on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d the officious droid C-3PO in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the tortured \u201chost\u201d Dolores Abernathy in \u201cWestworld,\u201d the robotic helpmates of popular culture have been humanoid in form and function.It\u2019s time to rethink our assumptions. A robot invasion of our homes is underway, but the machines \u2014 so-called smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home and the forthcoming Apple HomePod \u2014 look nothing like what we expected. Small, squat and stationary, they resemble vases or cat food tins more than they do people.Echo and its ilk do, however, share a crucial trait with their imaginary forebears: They illuminate the times. Whatever their shape, robots tell us something important about our technologies and ourselves.Although smart speakers have been around just three years, they already have a hold on us. The devices, powered by \u201cchatbots\u201d like Siri and Alexa, are in the midst of a sales boom. Some 35 million Americans now use the diminutive, talking computers \u2014 more than twice the number of just a year ago, according to estimates by eMarketer \u2014 and analysts predict that three-quarters of United States households will own at least one of the gadgets by 2020.It\u2019s not hard to understand the attraction. Smart speakers are oracles of the countertop. They may not be able to speak for the gods, but they can deliver reports on news, traffic and weather. And they have other talents that their Delphic ancestor couldn\u2019t even dream of: They can serve as D.J. They can diagnose ailments and soothe anxieties. They can read bedtime stories.They can even bark like a watchdog to scare off burglars. And they promise to be the major-domos of home automation, adjusting lights, controlling appliances and issuing orders to specialized robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.Still, if you were looking forward to having a Rosie scurrying around your abode, feather duster in hand, an Echo feels like a letdown. It just sits there.There are good reasons that the domestic robot has taken such an uninspiring form. Some are technical. Visualizing a nimble, sure-footed android is easy, but building one is hard. As the Carnegie Mellon professor Illah Nourbakhsh explains in his book \u201cRobot Futures,\u201d it requires advances not only in artificial intelligence but also in the complex hardware systems required for movement, perception and dexterity.The human nervous system is a marvel of physical control, able to sense and respond fluidly to an ever-changing environment. Achieving such agility with silicon and steel lies well beyond the reach of today\u2019s engineers. Even the most advanced of our current automatons still get flustered by mundane tasks like loading a dishwasher or dusting knickknacks.Meanwhile, thanks to gains in networking, language processing and miniaturization, it has become simple to manufacture small, cheap computers that can understand basic questions and commands, gather and synthesize information from online databanks and control other electronics. The technology industry has enormous incentives to promote such gadgets. Now that many of the biggest tech companies operate like media businesses, trafficking in information, they\u2019re in a race to create new products to charm and track consumers.Smart speakers provide a powerful complement to smartphones in this regard. Equipped with sensitive microphones, they serve as in-home listening devices \u2014 benign-seeming bugs \u2014 that greatly extend the companies\u2019 ability to monitor people\u2019s habits. Whenever you chat with a smart speaker, you\u2019re disclosing valuable information about your routines and proclivities.Beyond the technical challenges, there\u2019s a daunting psychological barrier to constructing and selling anthropomorphic machines. No one has figured out how to bridge what computer scientists term the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d \u2014 the wide gap we sense between ourselves and imitations of ourselves. Because we\u2019re such social beings, our minds are exquisitely sensitive to the expressions, gestures and manners of others. Any whiff of artificiality triggers revulsion. Humanoid robots seem creepy to us, and the more closely they\u2019re designed to mimic us, the creepier they are. That puts roboticists in a bind: The more perfect their creations, the less likely we\u2019ll want them in our homes. Lacking human characteristics, smart speakers avoid the uncanny valley altogether.Although they may not look like the robots we envisioned, smart speakers do have antecedents in our cultural fantasy life. The robot they most recall at the moment is HAL, the chattering eyeball in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d But their current form \u2014 that of a stand-alone gadget \u2014 is not likely to be their ultimate form. They seem fated to shed their physical housing and turn into a sort of ambient digital companion. Alexa will come to resemble Samantha, the \u201cartificially intelligent operating system\u201d that beguiles the Joaquin Phoenix character in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Through a network of speakers, microphones and sensors scattered around our homes, we\u2019ll be able to converse with our solicitous A.I. assistants wherever and whenever we like.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook C.E.O., spent much of last year programming a prototype of such a virtual agent. In a video released in December, he gave a demo of the system. Walking around his Silicon Valley home, he conducted a running dialogue with his omnipresent chatbot, calling on it to supply him with a clean T-shirt and toast bread for his breakfast, play movies and music, and entertain his infant daughter. Hooked up to cameras with facial-recognition software, the digitized Jeeves also acted as a sentry for the Zuckerberg compound, screening visitors and unlocking the gate.Whether real or fictional, robots hold a mirror up to society. If Rosie and her kin embodied a 20th-century yearning for domestic order and familial bliss, smart speakers symbolize our own, more self-absorbed time.It seems apt that as we come to live more of our lives virtually, through social networks and other simulations, our robots should take the form of disembodied avatars dedicated to keeping us comfortable in our media cocoons. Even as they spy on us, the devices offer sanctuary from the unruliness of reality, with all its frictions and strains. They place us in a virtual world meticulously arranged to suit our bents and biases, a world that understands us and shapes itself to our desires. Amazon\u2019s decision to draw on classical mythology in naming its smart speaker was a masterstroke. Every Narcissus deserves an Echo.Nicholas Carr is the author of \u201cThe Shallows\u201d and \u201cUtopia Is Creepy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belgian Clubs and Foreign Money: A Modern Soccer Mix", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "Foreign investors are snapping up clubs in Belgium\u2019s second division. The question everyone from Tubize to Leuven is asking is: Why?Supported byTUBIZE, Belgium \u2014 There is something incongruous about the pregame razzmatazz at the Stade Leburton, about Michael Buffer\u2019s catchphrase \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to rumble!\u201d \u2014 crackling out of the loudspeakers, and the pulsing, earsplitting techno soundtrack that follows.Tubize\u2019s greatest claim to fame in soccer is as the hometown of Eden Hazard \u2014 the Chelsea star grew up just a few streets away \u2014 and its second is as the site of the Belgian soccer federation\u2019s training base. Its 64-year-old club, A.F.C. Tubize, ranks a distant third.There are only a thousand or so fans here today, for the opening game of the Belgian second division season, and many of them are housed in one of only two permanent grandstands. Occasionally, a train will rattle past on the tracks that run behind the field. Conversations pause for it to pass, then resume.This is what small-town, small-time soccer has always looked like, not only here but in thousands of similar places across Europe: low-key games between low-key teams in low-key leagues.But beneath the surface of this sleepy commuter town south of Brussels, and in a dozen or so other small towns and minor cities across Belgium, something has changed.Here, in Tubize, one can see the fault lines between the simple past and the complex present, between what soccer has always been and what it threatens to become. Tubize is now owned by a South Korean marketing firm. Its visitor on opening day, K.S.V. Roeselare, is backed by Chinese money. Of their six rivals in the Belgian second division, four are the playthings of foreign investors: the Thai owners of Leicester City, the Russian billionaire who has bankrolled A.S. Monaco, a German entrepreneur and a wealthy Egyptian who now backs three separate clubs in Africa and Europe.In Belgium\u2019s top division, the Jupiler League, there are clubs owned by representatives of Qatar and Malaysia, and another with close links to Pini Zahavi, one of the most powerful agents in the game. All of them are now invested, to varying degrees, in Belgian soccer.It has all left many here asking one question: Why?A couple of hours after Roeselare\u2019s match at Tubize, on the other side of Brussels, the clouds burst over the pretty university town of Leuven. The downpour lasts only a few minutes, but it is intense enough to drench almost everybody at Den Dreef, Leuven\u2019s home stadium, and it means that for the first half-hour of Leuven\u2019s game with Lierse, the ball spends much of its time coming to rest in puddles.It is hard not to feel sorry for John Ledwidge, Leicester City\u2019s groundsman, and his team. They have spent much of the summer making sure the field is in pristine condition, and now one storm has undone much of their hard work.Ledwidge\u2019s expertise is just one of the benefits provided to Leuven by its new owners, Thailand\u2019s King Power group. Also the owners of Leicester, King Power confirmed in May that it had completed a deal to take control of Leuven, and it has taken a hands-on approach, setting out not just to improve the quality of the playing field but also the squad (a flurry of new players arrived this summer) and the stadium itself (now known as the King Power at Den Dreef). The plan, initially, is to win promotion. \u201cWe will have to wait and see,\u201d said Marc van Eylen, a member of the Louvaniste fan group, but even he admits to hopes that King Power can \u201cdo the same as they did at Leicester.\u201dKing Power is merely the latest foreign investor to decide a Belgian second division team is the must-have accessory, following in the footsteps of Sportizen (South Korea, Tubize), Wadi Degla (Egypt, Lierse), Xiu Li Hawken (China, Roeselare), Monaco\u2019s owner Dmitri Rybolovlev (Russia, Cercle Brugge) and Jurgen Baatzsch (Germany, Royal Union St.-Gilloise). In the Jupiler League, there is the Aspire Academy (Qatar, KAS Eupen), Vincent Tan (Malaysia, K.V. Kortrijk) and the case of Zahavi, and a couple of Maltese companies, at Royal Excel Mouscron.It is a remarkable concentration of international investment in a league hardly noted for its glamour. There is no chance to profit from lucrative television rights deals in Belgium; there is no opportunity to accrue the sort of soft power that attracted the likes of Roman Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour to Chelsea and Manchester City of the Premier League. These clubs are a world away from the bright lights of the Champions League.What has drawn the investors here is different. They have all come with different plans and purposes, different ideas of what their team might be. But there is one common thread for why they have all come: Belgium, perhaps unknowingly, offers the perfect climate to nurture a vision of what soccer\u2019s future might look like.Take Lierse, as one example. Matthias Hendrix can still reel through the names of Lierse\u2019s team from 20 years ago: Bob Peeters and Eric van Meir and Stanley Menzo. To Hendrix, a lifelong fan, that 1997 side is special: It was the team, largely homegrown, almost entirely unheralded, that last made Lierse the champion of Belgium.By 2007, though, the club was in dire straits. The Bosman ruling that let players freely leave at the end of their contracts had broken up that team long before then, and denied Lierse the chance to collect fat fees for their transfers. A match-fixing scandal uncovered in 2006 plunged the team deeper into chaos.That year, the Egyptian businessman Maged Samy was looking for a European club to buy. He had considered Fortuna Sittard, across the border in the Netherlands, and Royal Antwerp, but Lierse\u2019s desperation made it an appetizing prospect. \u201cBelgian clubs are quite cheap,\u201d Hendrix said. \u201cLierse was in trouble. It was an easy target.\u201dThat so many smaller Belgian clubs are available for comparatively small sums is only one of the reasons that outside investors have flocked here. Pierre Fran\u00e7ois, the general director of the organization that oversees Belgium\u2019s domestic competitions, the Pro League, can offer three others off the top of his head. First, there is the \u201cgood image\u201d created by the success of the national team in recent years, and the strong reputation the country has for youth development. This is a place where larger, richer clubs from England, Germany and France habitually shop for players.Then there is the fact that there are \u201cvery few restrictions on players,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois said. Only eight players on each squad of 25 has to be homegrown, meaning teams can import huge numbers of foreigners. Even more enticingly, for players from outside the European Union, Belgium offers a fast track to European citizenship, making it an ideal port of call for African players in particular.And finally, there are the low costs. In the Netherlands, any team planning on registering a non-E.U. player must pay him at least 300,000 euros a year (over $360,000). In Belgium, it is just \u201c\u20ac80,000 or \u20ac90,000, including bonuses,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois said. There are the tax breaks, too: Fran\u00e7ois pointed out that when a club is sold, the profit is not taxed under Belgian law.All of that, though, only answers part of the question. It might explain why Belgium is so attractive, but it does not clarify the motivations of the country\u2019s new investors.\u201cIn South Korea, Tubize is the second-best-known city in Belgium,\u201d Shim Chan-koo said proudly, staring out from the media suite at the Stade Leburton. \u201cFirst is Brussels, but after that it is Tubize, and that is all thanks to the TV show.\u201dShim, through his firm Sportizen, bought Tubize three years ago; he currently serves as the club\u2019s chairman and chief executive. His aim when he arrived, he said, was to build a bridge between Europe and Asia: His club would give young Korean, Japanese and Chinese prospects a platform on which to perform in Europe. In return, Korean soccer would benefit from the methods, particularly in marketing, he found in Europe.And he hoped to advertise his plan through a television show.\u201cIn 2015, we made a show, similar to \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent,\u2019 \u201d Shim said. \u201cI collected many former players, who had played but not been able to make it as professionals, and brought them here.\u201d He appointed Hwang Jin-sung, a former South Korean international, to coach them. Sixteen episodes aired on KBS, Korea\u2019s national broadcaster.Millions tuned in to watch; two years later, Tubize\u2019s Korean Facebook page still has more than 10,000 followers. Tubize still has four South Korean players for them to track.Shim\u2019s ambition, however, is by no means standard among Belgium\u2019s influx of foreign investors. Indeed, there is no standard. Monaco\u2019s arrangement with Cercle Brugge, for example, is more straightforward: The French club wanted a place to help its young talents develop. Leuven\u2019s fans expect something similar from the King Power group, which has arranged for several Thai players to join the team\u2019s youth system. Some believe the owners\u2019 plan is the same as the one that worked at Leicester: to win promotion, then compete in Europe.Lierse, certainly, would advise Leuven fans to exercise caution. Hendrix remembers that Samy\u2019s arrival in 2007 brought similar excitement. It soon soured. Now, he said, \u201cit seems it is just an instrument to buy and sell players in order to make money.\u201dSamy had an arrangement with academies owned by Jean-Marc Guillou, a former French international turned productive producer of young players, and promised to deliver Lierse \u201c10 new Romelu Lukakus.\u201d They did not materialize.\u201cThere is no stability in the team, and the quality of some of the players to have come has been really bad,\u201d Hendrix said. Guillou\u2019s prodigies have been favored over alumni of Lierse\u2019s own, storied youth system, he said. There is now an open hostility between elements of Lierse\u2019s fan base and its owner. Some, Hendrix said, are refusing to attend games until he leaves.Perhaps the most cautionary tale, though, is at first division Mouscron. Officially, since 2015, the club has been owned by two Maltese companies: Gol Football Limited, which paid \u20ac8.5 million (over $10 million) to rescue the club from bankruptcy in 2015, and Latimer International Limited, which bought it a year later \u2014 for \u20ac10. Both companies are connected to Pini Zahavi, the Israeli agent, and his son and nephew, Gil and Adar, sit on the Mouscron board.That has triggered concerns that the club is not being run for its own benefit, but for that of Zahavi, Ramadani and their clients, a place where they can showcase players in the hope of earning a move, or a base from which they can loan them out to other clubs \u2014 each time for a fee \u2014 in a bid to circumvent FIFA rules on agents\u2019 owning the economic rights of players.\u201cEveryone knows what is going on at Mouscron,\u201d one former club employee said. Gil Zahavi, an instructor in Modern Hebrew at Oxford University, did not respond to a request for comment. Pini Zahavi could not be reached.Fran\u00e7ois acknowledged his organization had to be \u201ccareful\u201d to avoid another situation like Mouscron, which has been forced to make changes to its structure to obtain a license to compete in the Belgian league. Other league rules are being rewritten to ensure that \u201cthe ultimate beneficiary of a club is not an agent,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois said, no matter how many companies are set up to obscure ownership.Under the new rules, he said, \u201cMouscron would not receive its license.\u201dOnce again, it is in Belgium where the tectonic plates meet, where what soccer has become is in plain sight. These small towns, these small teams \u2014 places where nobody is really ready to rumble \u2014 find themselves caught in a free-for-all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Shows Mayweather-McGregor Was a Pay-Per-View Juggernaut", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe blockbuster fight between the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor last Saturday has a \u201cvery good shot\u201d at being the top-grossing fighting event of all time, the Showtime Sports executive in charge of it said Friday.The executive, Stephen Espinoza, said in an interview that the record is the May 2015 boxing match between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, which generated about $600 million in revenue worldwide.The Mayweather-McGregor fight, at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, was a pay-per-view broadcast by Showtime Sports.Espinoza said he did not yet have final numbers on the pay-per-view buys \u2014 he expects to have those sometime next week \u2014 but said that based on the tally so far, it approached the 4.6 million people who bought the Pacquiao fight and may very well have exceeded it.\u201cIf we don\u2019t establish a new record, it is going to be very, very close,\u201d he said, \u201cand that would put it head and shoulders above every event other than May-Pac.\u201dThe fight cost $89.95 to watch in standard definition and $99.95 in high definition. Espinoza said that about 80 percent of the audience chose high definition.Wide availability on digital platforms gave the fight a boost, unlike the Pacquiao event, which was not streamed. In addition to ordering the fight through cable and satellite providers, fans could also purchase the Mayweather-McGregor match via Sling, Showtime\u2019s app and U.F.C.\u2019s Fight Pass. Espinoza said that 10 to 12 percent of the total buys were through a digital service, and those were mostly \u201cincremental\u201d viewers who did not have any other options for purchase.But those digital platforms also contributed to technical problems. The broadcast was temporarily delayed to accommodate ordering malfunctions with both cable and digital providers, and at least one person has sued Showtime over the streaming quality of the fight. Showtime has said it will provide refunds to customers who could not watch the fight.\u201cThe reports that came out earlier this week on issues on the Showtime digital stream were definitely exaggerated,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cWe did receive a limited number of complaints, but nothing commensurate with the level of press coverage that it generated. Our app worked, and worked well in the face of unprecedented demand.\u201dSome of those people watched on sites purposefully set up to stream illegally, but most watched on mainstream video platforms like Periscope, Facebook and YouTube, where a number of users simply pointed their phone at their television and hit record.\u201cDuring the fight, Showtime and its partners successfully blocked and removed the highest number of unauthorized streams for any event in the company\u2019s history,\u201d Showtime said in a statement.In a typical fight, pay-per-view revenue is evenly divided; the fighters receive half, and cable and satellite operators and Showtime share the other half. Espinoza said that Showtime received a slightly more favorable split than normal for this fight, but would not go into other details.International revenue numbers are not yet available, but Espinoza said that several territories would set records.The gate record, also for the 2015 Pacquiao fight, is $72 million, and it is unclear if Mayweather-McGregor exceeded that. The T-Mobile Arena has a capacity of 20,000, but only 14,623 fans were willing to pay the $1,000-plus it cost to get into the door.Though $300 million or more will go to the fighters, it most likely will not be evenly split. Mayweather will probably take 60 or even 70 percent of the fighters\u2019 share. According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather is contractually guaranteed at least $100 million for the fight, and McGregor at least $30 million.Mayweather was also guaranteed $100 million for the Pacquiao fight, but took home $250 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is New York\u2019s Best Pizza in New Jersey?", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review9 Photos\u201cAre you going to say that the best pizza in New York is in New Jersey?\u201dRazza, which burns wood, is one of the few that excel at both dough and toppings. Even if Ed and I had learned, after our seven-minute PATH ride from the World Trade Center to Grove Street, that the kitchen had run out of cheese, tomatoes and the rest, I would have asked for a pizza dressed with nothing but olive oil. I\u2019m willing to bet it would be delicious that way, with the texture and flavor of naturally leavened bread right from the oven.I was glad it didn\u2019t come to that, though, because Razza dresses its pies with local ingredients so distinctive that every time I\u2019ve eaten there, I\u2019ve learned something about New Jersey farms.Our plan was to eat two pies and stop there. Green-edged coins of zucchini were scattered over the first, along with garlic cloves roasted to a translucent jelly, bright white ricotta and cracked pepper. In the center was a lemon wedge. There was ricotta on the other, too, and blots of house-made fig jam, and sheets of prosciutto-style Iowa ham, all covered by unwilted arugula.Like every pie I\u2019ve eaten at Razza, these two had been put together with exquisite sensitivity to the needs of the dough. The crust had no soggy or underbaked patches, and the bottom surface was crisp all the way from the puffy outer lip to the inner tip, which would jut straight out, or nearly straight, when I picked up a slice. When I tore open the outer rim, the crust crackled and the white interior steamed, soft, somewhat springy, with a slow-building, many-layered, lively flavor underlined by sea salt.I could have stopped there, my point made. But as Ed noticed belatedly, we\u2019d ordered two white pies, and he wanted to try one with tomatoes. His choice was the classic margherita. I was exceptionally curious, though, about a locavore variant called the Garden State margherita. Its sauce was made from New Jersey heirloom tomatoes and its mozzarella from the milk of Sussex County water buffaloes.While we were trying to decide, Dan Richer, the chef and owner, came to our table. Mr. Richer, who opened Razza five years ago, may or may not have recognized us, but in any case he had a solution. When he came back, he had placed one half of each margherita variant together to make a full circle. He hadn\u2019t invented this 50-50 format for us, he said; he\u2019d been experimenting with it for an idea he plans to spring on the public shortly: a pizza tasting menu.Razza\u2019s standard margherita, as I knew from previous exposure, is a model within the prescribed parameters of the form. I particularly admire the sauce, which is less acidic and bitter than many, and about as sweet as possible without tasting sugary.This, it turns out, was not a coincidence. Mr. Richer explained that each January, when he is fairly certain that the latest vintage of tomatoes has been canned, he and his staff conduct a double-blind tasting of eight or so brands from California, New Jersey and Italy. Using a seven-point \u201ctomato evaluation rubric,\u201d they assess each variety for color, viscosity, texture, skins and seeds (the fewer the better), \u201ctomato flavor,\u201d acidity and sweetness. The tomato with the highest score is usually the one he will buy, although he said that one year he blended three different brands, \u201ckind of like a Bordeaux wine.\u201dFor the Garden State pizza, he runs ripe red local tomatoes through a food mill. I do not have a seven-point rubric to describe the flavor of the sauce, but I can say that it was bright and sweet enough to remind me that ripe Jersey tomatoes are still worth hunting down. The buffalo mozzarella, meanwhile, was more buttery and flavorful than any other American mozzarella I\u2019ve tried. It had a slight tartness and melted into soft, unrubbery, creamy-yellow circles.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for that cheese for three years,\u201d Mr. Richer said, explaining that he had been tracking the water buffalo herd until it was big enough to ensure a steady mozzarella supply.Farm-consciousness informs the whole menu. New Jersey greens and fruits go into the salads, which are fresh and vivid in ways not normally seen at the corner slice joint.New Jersey wheat berries and ambient New Jersey yeasts made up the first batch of the pizza dough starter, which has been burbling along for eight years now. New Jersey pork and Hudson Valley beef go into the tender meatballs, which are roasted in the wood oven until they carry a minor char. They are great meatballs, and suggest the kind of Italian restaurant Mr. Richer might have run had he not become transfixed by the intricacies of pizza.Pennsylvania cream and milk go into Razza\u2019s only dessert, a panna cotta that is more fluffy than firm and is served under a pool of dark salted caramel. Ed and I, having eaten a pizza and a half each, shared a single panna cotta. Then he asked me again: \u201cAre you going to say that the best pizza in New York is in New Jersey?\u201dI am, Ed. I am.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Internet Kept Humming During 2 Hurricanes", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet another data center, west of Houston, was so well prepared for the storm \u2014 with backup generators, bunks and showers \u2014 that employees\u2019 displaced family members took up residence and United States marshals used it as a headquarters until the weather passed.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Noah\u2019s ark, but it was darn close,\u201d said Rob Morris, managing partner and co-founder of Skybox, the company that runs the center.For all their seeming immateriality, the internet and the cloud rely on a vast industrial infrastructure consisting of data centers linked through a sprawling network of fiber optics. The facilities are stacked with servers \u2014 boxlike computers that crunch the data for everything from hospitals, law enforcement agencies and banks to news websites, email and weather reports \u2014 that cannot be without electricity and cooling for even a fraction of a second.Though the storm disabled some cellphone towers and local connections, Jeff Eassey, a manager for Digital Realty who hunkered down in the Miami building, said the center never stopped processing and transmitting data. It lost utility power around 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 10, but supplied its own electricity with the generators.When the storm eased and he walked outside, Mr. Eassey said, he immediately saw the effect that Digital Realty and other data centers had by keeping the servers going. \u201cEveryone was talking on their phones, searching on their phones, and commerce that uses the internet to do their business was up and running,\u201d he said.A list of Digital Realty\u2019s top customers shows why those operations are so important: Clients include IBM, Facebook, CenturyLink, Oracle, Yahoo, Morgan Stanley, AT&T and JPMorgan Chase, among others.Inside the centers, the drill during a natural disaster can be overwhelming. One company, EdgeConneX, lost utility power for three days at a Miami data center, two days at a center in Jacksonville, Fla., and two days at an Atlanta location. But Rich Werner, director of operations at the company, said that backup generators turned on and service was never interrupted.\u201cData center operations, to me, is 362 days of boredom,\u201d Mr. Werner said. \u201cAnd then you get these hurricanes coming through, and it\u2019s three days of pulling your hair out.\u201dThere are no legal standards for data centers unless they house servers for clients like government agencies, which require special protections.But a professional organization, the Seattle-based Uptime Institute, rates the facilities on four tiers of resiliency for events like storms, earthquakes and run-of-the-mill power failures \u2014 possibly one reason the internet performed creditably during the hurricanes. The institute\u2019s engineers \u201cgo to the site and pull the plug,\u201d said Mark Harris, senior vice president of marketing, \u201cand to be certified, it has to keep running.\u201d\u201cSo when a hurricane or a tornado or an ice storm happens, the entire data center has been designed to withstand these external factors,\u201d he said.During Harvey and Irma, those measures seemed to work, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Dyn, a web performance company with servers at a Miami data center. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any core internet services going down,\u201d he said.One necessity is building above the 500-year floodplain, according to Gary Wojtaszek, president of CyrusOne, whose facilities include a data center in the mostly flooded Galleria area of Houston. The water stopped a few feet short of the building, which ran on backup power for several hours, Mr. Wojtaszek said. He added that \u201cpractically every single large oil and gas company in the world\u201d operates servers in its data centers \u2014 an indication of how commerce of all kind relies on the facilities.Depending on local conditions, some centers got off easier than others. In Houston facilities run by Data Foundry, automated systems worked so well that employees pooled resources and watched the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight on pay-per-view, said Edward Henigin, the company\u2019s chief technology officer. When everything is working, he said, \u201cwhat else are they going to do?\u201dEveryone in the business says that extensive preparation is critical. James M. Palmieri, Digital Realty\u2019s vice president for data center operations, said that as Irma approached the building in Miami, engineers topped off diesel generators, called Mr. Eassey down from Atlanta to direct operations and waited to see how strong the hurricane would become.\u201cThe storm got worse,\u201d Mr. Palmieri said, adding that at that point, \u201cthe real issue is, how do we make sure that our employees are protected?\u201dMr. Eassey said that about 14 people in the building \u2014 including employees, customers and security personnel \u2014 met in a sixth-floor conference room that Friday morning and realized that the worsening conditions, heavy traffic and overcrowded shelters in the area meant it was too late to leave. With reinforced concrete walls and heavy glass, the building was the safest place to be, they decided. The mood was calm.\u201cMost of these guys are seasoned Miamians,\u201d Mr. Eassey said. \u201cI was the out-of-towner. I would be exaggerating if I said anyone was nervous or panicked.\u201dThe peak of the storm passed over the weekend, and when the power went out, the center was ready with diesel generators and a 10,500-gallon diesel tank on the site.In Houston\u2019s so-called energy corridor, the Skybox campus stayed above water, Mr. Morris said. Utility power never went down. But the site was stocked with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, as well as food and water, emergency medical kits, showers, bunk rooms and flares.The site, which Mr. Morris calls a \u201cmodern-day fortress,\u201d began hosting not only employees but several of their families, whose houses were flooded. Then, Mr. Morris said, the building doubled as an emergency response center for the United States marshals. He said that roughly 50 people used or stayed on the campus at one point or another during the storm.Asked if there were anything in his operations that he would change before the next storm hit, Mr. Morris did not hesitate. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to purchase a washer and dryer to keep on site,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As a Weary Texas Seeks Solace, Governor Says Property Damage May Exceed Katrina", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 As people throughout this flooded region sought solace in places of worship on Sunday, some of them makeshift, the governor of Texas predicted that Hurricane Harvey\u2019s economic toll would exceed Hurricane Katrina as the federal government\u2019s costliest natural disaster.\u201cWhen you look at the number of homes that have been mowed down and destroyed and damaged, this is going to be a huge catastrophe that people need to come to grips with,\u201d the governor, Greg Abbott, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201dHarvey, Mr. Abbott said, had proven \u201cfar larger than Katrina, both geographically and population-wise.\u201d He said he expected the storm\u2019s ultimate cost to exceed the $120 billion that the federal government spent after Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast 12 years ago. In an interview with Fox News, he suggested that Texas could need up to $180 billion in federal aid.While the debate about Washington\u2019s spending unfolded on Sunday talk shows, Texas was reckoning with the aftermath of the storm that made its first landfall on Aug. 25, ultimately dumping more than 50 inches of rain.The authorities, who believe Harvey may be to blame for at least 50 deaths in Texas, sought the evacuation of more homes west of downtown Houston on Sunday, while to the east, close to the Louisiana border, the nearly 120,000 residents of Beaumont faced a fourth day without reliable and safe drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency said on Sunday that more than 200 public water systems in the region were either shut down or under boil-water notices.And in Crosby, Tex., the remaining six trailers of unstable chemicals at a flood-damaged plant were ignited intentionally on Sunday afternoon, a move that should end the immediate hazard there, officials said. In images posted on Twitter, smoke could be seen rising from the site.With the trailers at the plant at risk of catching fire on their own, as three had over the past few days, Arkema, the French chemical company that owns the plant, decided to ignite them \u201cthrough controlled means.\u201d In a statement on its website, Arkema said the decision was made \u201cin coordination with the unified command.\u201dThe federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said in a joint statement that, \u201crather than risk additional damage to the facility or spreading into the surrounding area, the Crosby Volunteer Fire Department and the Harris County Fire Marshal\u2019s Office will perform a controlled burn of the material.\u201dThe agencies said that they were continuing to monitor smoke and air quality in the area. For now, an evacuation zone of a mile and a half radius remains around the plant.In its statement, Arkema said there was \u201cclear visual evidence\u201d that the chemicals were becoming unstable. \u201cWe are concerned that, without ignition, we can\u2019t determine if the hazard has been fully eliminated.\u201dRachel Moreno, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Fire Marshal\u2019s Office, said the six remaining trailers would be left to burn out, a process that she said should take several hours. When trailers caught fire Thursday and Friday, the chemicals, their packaging and the trailers themselves burned completely. \u201cEverything\u2019s under control,\u201d she said.Elsewhere in the region, Texans attended worship services, both in areas where floodwaters had raged and in neighborhoods that missed devastation, after what had been one of the most trying weeks in peoples\u2019 memories.In Deweyville, Tex., about two hours northeast of Houston, the congregation of Calvary Baptist Church gathered in their new sanctuary: the shade of the A.T.M. drive-through lanes at a local bank. The church building just up the road still sat in several feet of water, and every other church in Deweyville was flooded as well.\u201cWe\u2019re going to open up with \u2018Count Your Blessings,\u2019 \u201d the Rev. John Fortenberry announced to begin the service. They sang the hymn almost cheerfully, and then held hands and bowed their heads.\u201cDear Lord, may we leave this place knowing that the church and the churches are the people, and not the building,\u201d Mr. Fortenberry prayed.Services were similarly improvised in Port Aransas, where about 30 people congregated in a field pitted with muddy holes and strewn with roof shingles, drawn by a spray-painted sign on a board that said, \u201cWorship service here 10:00 Sunday.\u201d There were no pews and no altars; workers, volunteers and local residents stood before the pastor, who had traveled from three hours away.Jon Steele, a photographer who had brought a chain saw to help remove fallen trees, said the service, haphazard as it might have seemed, was a welcome distraction from the carnage of southeast Texas. \u201cI think it was a relief, a little bit of something normal,\u201d Mr. Steele said. \u201cThat\u2019s what people need.\u201dHe added: \u201cEveryone\u2019s in such disarray, so disassociated. We\u2019re human. You need that touch.\u201dScarcely damaged churches also reworked their normal Sunday plans. In southwest Houston, the 9:30 a.m. service at the Church at Bethel\u2019s Family ended a few minutes early. There was too much work to do, the Rev. Walter August Jr. said before he dismissed his congregants to distribute supplies from the church, which held its services last Sunday by conference call and on Facebook Live.\u201cEverything we have, we need to get it out, and you\u2019re the agents to get it out,\u201d said Mr. August, who estimated that about 30 percent of his Southern Baptist church\u2019s members would apply for some kind of assistance following the storm. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have time to tell you how things got bad. When you\u2019re hurting, you just need some help.More than a week after Harvey\u2019s first landfall, the storm\u2019s fallout infringed on even the most important occasions. Between services, Mr. August retreated to his office to marry Erik Lark and Toni Lee. As he completed the paperwork after the intimate ceremony, he asked about their plans.\u201cWe\u2019re going to change clothes, and we\u2019re going to serve,\u201d the bride replied. \u201cI have an S.U.V., so I\u2019m going to come around and get some stuff.\u201dNo, Mr. August told them, go home and savor your wedding day. There would be more work on Monday.Alan Blinder reported from Houston, Annie Correal from Port Aransas, Tex., and Campbell Robertson from Deweyville, Tex.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Up in Coal Country: Alternative-Energy Jobs", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "Miners may have just the skills for scaling wind towers and putting solar panels on roofs. And that\u2019s no small thing in Wyoming and West Virginia.Supported byFrom the mountain hollows of Appalachia to the vast open plains of Wyoming, the coal industry long offered the promise of a six-figure income without a four-year college degree, transforming sleepy farm towns into thriving commercial centers.But today, as King Coal is being dethroned \u2014 by cheap natural gas, declining demand for electricity, and even green energy \u2014 what\u2019s a former miner to do?Nowhere has that question had more urgency than in Wyoming and West Virginia, two very different states whose economies lean heavily on fuel extraction. With energy prices falling or stagnant, both have lost population and had middling economic growth in recent years. In national rankings of economic vitality, you can find them near the bottom of the pile.Their fortunes have declined as coal has fallen from providing more than half of the nation\u2019s electricity in 2000 to about one-third last year. Thousands of workers have lost their jobs and moved on \u2014 leaving idled mines, abandoned homes and shuttered stores downtown.Now, though, new businesses are emerging. They are as varied as the layers of rock that surround a coal seam, but in a twist, a considerable number involve renewable energy. And past jobs in fossil fuels are proving to make for good training.Taken together, along with programs aimed at teaching computer coding or beekeeping, they show ways to ease the transition from fossil fuels to a more diverse energy mix \u2014 as well as the challenges.GILLETTE, Wyo. \u2014 John Davila, 61, worked for 20 years at Arch Coal\u2019s Black Thunder Mine in Eastern Wyoming, a battered titan from an industry whose importance to the region is easy to see \u2014 whether in the sign in the visitors\u2019 center window proclaiming, \u201cWyoming Coal: Proud to Provide America\u2019s Energy,\u201d or in the brimming train cars that rumble out of the Eagle Butte mine on the outskirts of town.But in April last year, at a regular crew meeting in the break room, he was among those whose envelope held a termination notice rather than a work assignment. \u201cThey called it a \u2018work force reduction,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Davila, whose straight, dark ponytail hangs down his back. \u201cNice way to put it, but it still means you\u2019re out of a job.\u201dSo a summertime Thursday morning found him, along with a couple of dozen other men and women, in a nondescript lecture room at a community college, learning how a different source of energy, wind, might make them proud, too.The program, which is to teach the basics of wind farm operation, maintenance and safety over two weeks in October, would cost the participants nothing but their time, organizers said. Those who wanted to test their potential would have a chance to climb a 250-foot tower that Saturday at a farm Goldwind owns in Montana. And if they completed the full program, they would have certifications that could open the door with any employer they chose.\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no catch \u2013 you don\u2019t like me, you don\u2019t like Goldwind, that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d David Halligan, the company\u2019s chief executive, told an even larger crowd in Casper the day before. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be opportunity across the country.\u201dIt is a message of hope that has been in short supply, especially after the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the region and the bankruptcies last year of three major producers. But while coal\u2019s prospects have been dying down, wind development is poised to explode in the state, which has some of the world\u2019s strongest and most consistent winds. And while coal mining jobs have fallen to historic lows nationally in recent years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that wind-energy technician will be the fastest-growing occupation, more than doubling over the next seven years.Though most of the coal jobs lost last year have since returned as companies have emerged from bankruptcy, the insecurity surrounding the industry remains. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little scary when you\u2019ve got people all around you getting laid off,\u201d Brandon Sims, 37, an Air Force veteran who works for an explosives company that serves the mines, said outside the lecture room. \u201cYou never really know when your day to get the pink slip is.\u201dHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 Coal mining was already dead in Crum, a town of less than 200 just this side of the Kentucky border, by the time Ethan Spaulding, 26, graduated from high school, he said. That dashed his hopes of becoming a roof bolter, helping stabilize the ceilings of mine tunnels. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to have a high school diploma to go to the coal industry,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can start making $150,000 a year.\u201d Or perhaps you once could.Mr. Spaulding was standing near the railroad tracks at the edge of town where trains move coal out of the region, behind a dilapidated brick building that once housed a high-end suit factory. It is becoming a hub for the family of social enterprises that Coalfield Development leads, which include rehabilitating buildings, installing solar panels, and an agriculture program that grows produce and is turning an old mine site into a solar-powered fish farm.Wanting to stay in Crum, Mr. Spaulding went through the solar program Coalfield runs with Solar Holler, which offers its participants a two-and-a-half-year apprenticeship. He is now a crew chief at the training center, overseeing the renovation of a larger classroom inside the building. Though he is optimistic that he can eventually reach his target income in the solar industry, the installation jobs for which the trainees will ultimately qualify generally pay far less \u2014 $26 an hour, on average, nationally.And yet there is keen interest. For David Ward, 40, managing installations at Solar Holler helps repay the student loans he ran up pursuing a degree in counseling \u2014 a growth industry in a state reeling from opioid addiction. An electrician, he said he was \u201cinterested in the idea of making your own power and the environmental impact.\u201dThe program is the brainchild of Brandon Dennison and Dan Conant, two West Virginians who wanted to help develop a sustainable economy in the state. Mr. Dennison, 31, started Coalfield Development in 2010; it grew out of a volunteer effort to build low-income green housing. Mr. Conant, 32, had worked on political campaigns, including Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential contest. After becoming involved in the solar industry, he concluded that rooftop solar development, with its individual, decentralized nature, could combine the door-to-door approach of political campaigning with a technology to fight climate change.He completed the first Solar Holler project \u2014 putting panels on the Presbyterian church in his hometown, Shepherdstown, on the Potomac River \u2014 and, quickly overwhelmed with demand for similar installations, realized the state didn\u2019t have a work force to handle it. So he formed a partnership with Mr. Dennison\u2019s organization to develop one. At Coalfield\u2019s facility here, participants learn how the arrays create electricity and connect to the power system, but they also get practice installing panels on a shed behind the main building. That helps them clear one of the basic industry hurdles: becoming comfortable working on a roof.SHAWMUT, Mont. \u2014 If a big worry for would-be solar installers is staying balanced while ferrying heavy glass-sheathed panels around a roof, for potential wind energy technicians it is whether they can climb more than 200 feet in broiling heat or icy cold and emerge into the gusts to fix machinery. Still, the Goldwind technicians say working so high up is one of the job\u2019s best features.\u201cYou get a view that most people will never see,\u201d as Lukas Nelson, 27, a site manager in Ohio, put it in one of the company\u2019s promotional videos. Only a few towers have elevators, and at Goldwind\u2019s power plant here, the access is by a series of 90-degree aluminum ladders and steel mesh platforms, straight to the top.It was Saturday morning after the three seminars, and Goldwind safety managers had delivered a brief lecture in a trailer that served as the farm office, warning of perils like rattlesnakes in the tall grasses outside and electrocution from throwing switches in the towers.The organizers separated the crowd of about 20 into two groups. One would take a tour of the wind farm and substation while the other climbed towers whose blades sat idle. After lunch, they would switch.In front of the trailer, Chancey Coffelt, 33, Goldwind\u2019s regional safety manager, was showing the climbing group how to put on harnesses \u2014 a network of heavy metal clips and rings attached to straps that thread over the shoulders, across the chest and around each thigh. They would latch onto a rope pulley system as they climbed each of four ladders and then hook into a bracket as they reached each platform before freeing themselves from the pulley.Mr. Davila, the 20-year mine veteran, was standing with members of the second group, chatting about Wyoming\u2019s wobbly energy economy and how wind might \u2014 and might not \u2014 steady it. \u201cA lot of coal miners don\u2019t like wind or solar, but you need them all,\u201d Mr. Davila said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a puzzle you have to solve: just think about how many things we plug in.\u201dStill, many of the men expressed concern over what the jobs would pay, saying the salaries paled in comparison to what they could earn on an oil rig, for instance.\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get a six-figure job in the oil industry,\u201d Jesse Morgan, a baby-faced 31-year-old city councilman and back-office worker at a drilling services company, had said over beers at a bar in Casper where he was asked to show ID. \u201cYou get addicted to that money.\u201dBut it could be worth taking a pay cut to get out from under the stress of constantly planning for the next layoff, and being able to return home at night rather than working 30- to 40-day stints offshore. The oil field never stops, Mr. Morgan said of his time on the rigs. \u201cIt\u2019s 24/7 \u2014 you miss birthdays, every holiday.\u201dAs with the other men, Mr. Morgan\u2019s work experience made him an attractive candidate for Goldwind. Accustomed to the industrial behemoths of fossil fuel production, he is familiar with the environment, equipment and procedures of working safely while surrounded by danger \u2014 like remembering to fasten the chin strap on a hard hat so it won\u2019t slip off and injure a colleague laboring hundreds of feet below.Chelsae Clemons, 26, a technician at a Goldwind plant in Findlay, Ohio, said the emphasis on safety and training was part of the program\u2019s value. Among the few staff members at the seminars with a bachelor\u2019s degree, she had worked in a lab at a hospital and had little relevant experience when she decided to pursue a career in renewable energy. In Gillette, she told the crowd, \u201cThey\u2019re giving certifications I had to pay for.\u201dHINTON, W.Va. \u2014 \u201cSolar\u2019s not going to be everything, and one of the big challenges for the state is how do we diversify and get lots of cool stuff going,\u201d Mr. Conant, the Solar Holler founder, was saying as he drove from a solar installation at a hilltop farmhouse toward a 1940s summer camp that the local coal company provided for the children of its employees until 1984. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been a one-industry town for a really long time, that\u2019s an issue. The last thing we would want to do is pin our hopes on doing that again, just with some other technology.\u201dDeborah Delaney, an assistant professor of entomology and wildlife ecology who oversees the apiary and bee program at the University of Delaware, said the area was well suited for a honey enterprise. It is largely forest, unsullied by the pesticides that threaten the insects in industrial farm areas, and it has plant species like black locust and sourwood whose honey can fetch a high price.\u201cThis is bee paradise,\u201d she said, sitting on the porch of the cafeteria building where a Patriot Coal banner hung askew on one wall. For now, Ms. Delaney and the program\u2019s staff are getting the colony established on a hillside in 86 hives that buzz away behind electrified wire fencing to protect them from bears. Next spring, they plan to distribute about 150 hives to 35 beekeepers either free or through a low- or no-interest loan. Come harvest time, the beekeepers would bring their honey-laden frames to the camp for extraction and processing; organizers would pay them for their yield and then sell the honey to support the program.\u201cFor some people it might be a side hustle, but for other people it could really turn into, over time, a true income that could sustain a family,\u201d said Kate Asquith, program director at Appalachian Headwaters.Economists say this kind of diversification is important, especially in a region where coal is unlikely to make a major comeback, even if Trump administration policies are able to foster a revival elsewhere. Demand is strongest for the low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin straddling Wyoming and Montana, rather than what Appalachia produces. The new-energy industries cannot replicate what coal once did, economists say. Long-term jobs at the Wyoming wind farm would number in the hundreds at best, while the solar program thus far trains only 10 workers each year.Even a coal boom wouldn\u2019t create jobs the way it used to: like the steam drill that ultimately took John Henry\u2019s place, new equipment and technologies have replaced workers in heavy industries. Production of coal, for instance, increased over all from the 1920s until 2010, while the number of jobs dropped to 110,000 from 870,000.So interest in the bees has been high here. \u201cThought it was weird at first \u2014 bugs in a box in the backyard,\u201d said Sean Phelps, 27, who left a secure job as a school janitor to work with the bee program. Exposure to his father-in-law\u2019s hives changed his perspective. Now he sees them as a way to help the area, as well as fun. \u201cThis is what I want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re out in them, it reduces a lot of stress.\u201dSHAWMUT, Mont. \u2014 It was after lunch, and Mr. Davila and Mr. Morgan were at the base of one of the wind towers, wearing heavy harnesses and waiting for the first group to finish so they could start the climb. Suddenly, Jason Willbanks, 39, who lost a job as an electrician with a coal company and now drives crews to and from their shifts on coal trains, emerged from within. Walking heavily into the blazing sunlight, he clattered onto the metal platform and stairs. Asked how he was, he shot back: \u201cSweating like a fat guy at an all-day dance.\u201dAs he pulled off the harness, dropped to his knees in a patch of shade on the grass and rolled onto his back, Mr. Davila offered him a bottle of water from a cooler. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned it,\u201d he said.Not long after, word came from the Goldwind crew: A thunderstorm was heading toward the farm, so the second group could not climb.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m all dressed up with nowhere to go,\u201d Mr. Davila said, disappointed, gesturing toward the harness. \u201c I wanted to see if I could get up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve just witnessed what it\u2019s like to be a wind-turbine technician,\u201d Mr. Coffelt, the safety manager, said, cocking an ear over one shoulder and suggesting that the group move away from the rattlesnake he had heard. \u201cImagine if you\u2019re one or two stacks up when you get that alert: right back down we come.\u201d After weighing options, the Goldwind organizers called it a day, offering repeated apologies and promises to get the men back to the site which, over the following months, they did.Mr. Morgan, who posted a beaming selfie from atop the turbine on Facebook, did not apply for the training program. But Mr. Davila did, and was accepted.He is torn over whether to enroll, he said. He is desperate for the work but hesitant to leave his wife and home in Gillette, where he has lived since he was 6, for one of the jobs immediately available outside the state.

The news was first announced on social media by Shaza Barakat, the elder Ms. Barakat\u2019s sister. The two women had been stabbed to death, the Turkish news agency Anadalou reported, quoting a police official.The Barakats came from a large family known for its long opposition to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his predecessor and father, Hafez al-Assad. The two women were both active in the Syrian refugee community in Turkey.The elder Ms. Barakat was a member of the opposition Syrian National Council, now known as the Syrian National Coalition, but she had also criticized some members of the opposition. Halla Barakat was an editor for Orient TV, which covers events in the Middle East, and had also worked for the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation.While there was no official confirmation of the circumstances of the deaths, friends and relatives said the Assad government was to blame.\u201cThey assassinated them in a foreign land,\u201d Shaza Barakat wrote on Facebook. \u201cFor 40 years her headlines occupied front pages. She sought out criminals and exposed them. And today, her name and Halla\u2019s name are on the front page.\u201dThe two women \u201cwere vocal activists in the Syrian revolution, speaking truth to power, and raising awareness about the atrocities committed by the Assad regime,\u201d another relative, Suzanne Barakat, wrote on Facebook.In a statement, the Syrian National Coalition said, \u201cThe hand of terrorism and tyranny is the prime suspect in this heinous crime of assassination.\u201dSocial media posts on pro-government sites contained hateful comments about the Barakats.But the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet published details that indicated a similarity to killings committed by the Islamic State. The women\u2019s throats had been cut, and they had received a threat on social media 10 days earlier from someone speaking in a Tunisian dialect, the newspaper reported.The elder Ms. Barakat had received threats in the days before her killing but had disregarded them, her brother, Maen Barakat, 56, said in a telephone interview.\u201cSince threats by the regime have become a common thing, she didn\u2019t pay much attention to them,\u201d Mr. Barakat said.\u201cNo items were stolen from the apartment, which suggests that the crime was committed only to kill Orouba and Halla,\u201d he added.His sister was a born activist, he said. \u201cShe dedicated her life to give voice to the voiceless, until the Syrian regime exiled her in the \u201980s,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still she continued to defend her rights and the rights of others.\u201dShe set up a media and advertising business in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and after the Syrian uprising moved to Istanbul.\u201cShe came to Turkey to be closer to her country, hoping that once the war ends she would be able to return to her homeland,\u201d Mr. Barakat said. \u201cHalla joined her mom in her fight against the Syrian regime, and became a loud voice in defending the rights of Syrians and documenting the crimes against them.\u201dHalla Barakat \u201cwas beautiful and lovely, smart and ambitious, and so kindhearted,\u201d said Jamal Mano, a Syrian journalist who worked for 10 months with her in Istanbul.A Syrian refugee in Germany, Nour Sheikh Ibrahim, wept as he remembered the kindness the elder Ms. Barkat had shown him when he defected from the Syrian Army and escaped to Turkey.\u201cShe was everything in my life, she was like my aunt,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said when reached by telephone. \u201cShe helped me a lot.\u201dJobless and penniless, he had appealed to Ms. Barakat for help and when she opened a sewing factory she offered him a job. \u201cShe used to help refugees, and the camps,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very active. She helped lot of Syrians with money, even those who didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d Later in Istanbul she gave him a place to stay.They remained in touch, talking every few days, and he said Ms. Barakat had become depressed recently. \u201cIn the past few weeks Orouba was feeling so down,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked her to leave Turkey but she said she couldn\u2019t.\u201d She lacked a valid passport, he added.\u201cI remember she used to receive a lot of threats on her phone,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said.\u201cNumbness,\u201d she said on Facebook, describing her feelings about the family\u2019s latest deaths. \u201cConfusion.

We are in a new world.\u201dAmong the list of actions Facebook took in Germany, the company said, was the installation of programs to show people news articles offering different points of view on key issues. Facebook invited German news outlets into its Berlin offices to film broadcasts on its Facebook Live video service to report on the outcome of the election. And Germans who clicked on articles about the election on Facebook were given a list that laid out the positions of major political parties running for office.Television \u2014 particularly the country\u2019s two public broadcasters \u2014 remains the most popular and trusted source of news for a majority of Germans, according to the foundation.Although some examples of fake news did emerge during the German election, they were quickly identified and debunked. Many of the leading news outlets organized fact-checking teams that examined the news and traced the sources for any material that seemed inflammatory or that had been flagged by the public.According to Alexander S\u00e4ngerlaub, who led the foundation\u2019s project for identifying fake news, stories that were discovered to be fake had largely been generated by individuals or organizations associated with the country\u2019s far-right and populist movements. But when stories were found to have been fabricated or false, it proved harder to debunk them than it had been to circulate them, he said.Mr. Zuckerberg, in his announcement last week, said Facebook would work to be more transparent about the sources of political advertisements on the network, building tools to show users where the ads they see come from.Mr. Zuckerberg may have been attempting to pre-empt Congressional overtures toward regulation; currently, digital political advertisements seen on Facebook and other sites are not regulated, a stark contrast to television, print and radio political ads.\u201cFacebook\u2019s moves in European elections present as positive and I\u2019m sure are appreciated globally,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a publishing industry trade organization. \u201cBut considering where we\u2019ve been the past 18 months with Facebook\u2019s denials and lack of transparency, everything must be considered a public relations play until we know a lot more.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy, Going It Alone, Stalls the Flow of Migrants. But at What Cost?", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 As they scrambled to curb the flow of migrants, Europe\u2019s leaders wrestled with a vexing question: How to stop the ruthless Libyan militias that control the human-trafficking trade from dispatching countless boats across the Mediterranean?Now Italy, after striking out on its own, appears to have found a solution \u2014 one that, though wildly successful for the moment, is provoking questions about its methods and the humanitarian costs.Italian ministers deny giving even a single euro to Libya\u2019s armed militias. Instead, they attribute their success to painstaking diplomacy and other inducements, like the possibility of rejoining a regularly paid, national army.\u201cWe approached the issue slowly, slowly, Italian style,\u201d Mario Giro, deputy foreign minister, said in an interview. \u201cWe spoke to everyone.\u201dMany are skeptical: Money and the threat of brute force are the usual considerations when it comes to persuading the fractious militias that hold sway across Libya. But if Italy\u2019s aggressive new approach to migration includes dealing with unsavory strongmen, it would not be the first time.That arrangement came apart when Colonel Qaddafi was ousted and killed in a bloody uprising in 2011, an event that presaged the migrant crisis that has since bedeviled Europe.\u201cEven if no money is paid,\u201d Mr. Toaldo added, \u201cthe idea that these groups are the gatekeepers to Europe gives them huge leverage.\u201dItalian officials say they had little choice but to act.For years, Rome channeled its antimigration efforts under the umbrella of the European Union, cooperating with programs to train the flimsy Libyan Coast Guard and offering aid to the African countries where many migrants come from.Italian officials say they felt abandoned by their European neighbors, especially France, which refused to take a greater share of the migrants.In April Mr. Minniti hosted feuding tribesmen in Rome, mediating a peace deal between groups that controlled the desert trafficking trails from Algeria, Chad and Niger.But the turning point for Mr. Minniti\u2019s efforts came in July, after Italy persuaded the clan-based militias that control the migrant trade along a stretch of the lawless Libyan coast, west of the capital, Tripoli, to keep their boats onshore.Just how Mr. Minniti turned human traffickers into gatekeepers is a contentious matter \u2014 he has flatly denied making cash payments \u2014 but the results have been striking.Migrant arrivals from Libya fell 50 percent in July. In August, just 2,729 landed on Italy\u2019s shores, down from over 18,000 a year earlier, according to the United Nations refugee agency.Fewer people died at sea, too \u2014 11 in August compared with 42 in the same period in 2016.But a policy that tackles human trafficking by relying on the same armed groups that have profited from the trade has obvious pitfalls.Those traps, too, have been demonstrated in the past.In early 2011, furious that Italy had sided with the rebels trying to overthrow him, Colonel Qaddafi threatened to retaliate by sending floods of migrants across the Mediterranean, recalled Franco Frattini, then Italy\u2019s foreign minister.\u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019ll make them aware of the blood in the sea,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Frattini, citing a phone call intercepted by Italian intelligence.As the Libyan uprising closed in on Colonel Qaddafi, his security forces did just that: They loaded hundreds of African migrants onto a rickety fishing vessel in Tripoli.The boat was so overloaded that it capsized in a storm before it even set out. Dozens of African migrants drowned: Their bodies were fished from the water, months later, on the day that Colonel Qaddafi was killed.This time, there is the risk that migrant boats could still set off, requiring a sweetening of whatever inducements Rome is providing.The stakes are vividly illustrated in Sabratha, a port town and major node of the human trafficking trade about 40 miles west of Tripoli.Here, the flare from an offshore gas plant guides boats packed with migrants headed to Europe, many of which are controlled by the Dabbashis, a powerful local clan that has also profited handsomely from smuggling cheap Libyan fuel.Human trafficking is not the Dabbashis\u2019 only link to Italy: Their largest militia, known as Al Ammu, has a contract to protect the nearby Mellitah Oil and Gas plant, which is operated by the Italian state-controlled energy giant Eni.Despite the chaos that has engulfed Libya since 2011, Mellitah, which pipes gas directly across the sea to Italy, is one of the few energy plants to have operated virtually uninterrupted, which experts say reveals much about Eni\u2019s deep reach inside Libya.After the boats filled with migrants suddenly stopped leaving Sabratha, the clan indicated it had done a deal.That assistance, financial or otherwise, was being channeled through the United Nations-backed unity government in Tripoli, which in turn is funded by Italy. Speaking by phone, several unity government officials said Rome had stepped up payments and supplies of equipment to militias in Sabratha, Zuwarah and other coastal smuggling hubs.\u201cWe met the Italians today, and we expect to get 200 million euros, which we will distribute according to our needs,\u201d said Tarek Shanbour, head of the coastal security department in Tripoli. That is about $240 million.Mr. Giro, the Italian deputy foreign minister, acknowledged that some former traffickers had received medicine, funds for hospitals, and other forms of assistance.But he insisted that no money changed hands and that the militias were motivated by the possibility of having a stake in political decisions, rejoining a future Libyan national army, and of benefiting from a return of Italian business.\u201cI can\u2019t speak for others, but I would rule it out,\u201d he said, when asked if Italy\u2019s secret services could be funding such groups.Most Libyans, though, see the overtures in a more cynical light.\u201cI don\u2019t think they would give up on huge amounts of cash just like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout money, these groups don\u2019t have power in their areas.\u201dOthers warn that Rome is inadvertently arming a new generation of gunmen and traffickers, and say that it might be a matter of time before those groups revise the price for cooperation, much as Colonel Qaddafi once did.\u201cWe know the greed of these groups,\u201d said Mohamed Dayri, foreign minister for one of the Libya\u2019s three rival governments, who described the Italian policy as a disaster. \u201cThey will use the money to buy more weapons,\u201d he said.Italy\u2019s success in slashing migrant arrivals on its shores has brought a sharp sigh of relief across Europe, where fury over migration has driven a populist revolt. On Tuesday, European Union interior ministers gathered in Brussels signaled their approval for Italy\u2019s tactics.The extra funding announced Tuesday was taken as a tacit recognition of what one senior European official termed \u201cunacceptable, inhumane treatment and human rights violations\u201d for migrants in Libya.Even as Italian politicians have eagerly sought to claim a piece of the recent success, already this weekend there were ominous signs their jubilation could be short-lived.According to La Stampa, a Turin-based newspaper, the Italian Coast Guard and boats operated by aid groups like Save the Children in waters near Libya have brought to Sicily more than 1,000 migrants in the last few days.And on Saturday the Libyan Coast Guard intercepted 1,074 migrants in at least eight boats that departed from beaches in and around Sabratha on Saturday, the service said on its Facebook page.So some Italian officials are cautious about declaring victory over a problem that has long vexed Europe.\u201cWhy did the flow of migrants stop?\u201d Mr. Giro said. \u201cThe real question is, \u2018Has it really stopped?\u2019\u201dDeclan Walsh reported from Cairo, and Jason Horowitz from Rome.

{"Headline": "Regulator Wants Financial Industry to Self-Report Wrongdoing", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years as a sleepy federal backwater, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission became one of Wall Street\u2019s most aggressive watchdogs during the Barack Obama administration.Now the agency \u2014 which is responsible for policing a broad swath of markets and financial machinery, from trading in commodities to digital currencies to the complex derivatives that helped torpedo the financial system in 2008 \u2014 is shifting its law enforcement strategy: It will increasingly look to banks and other financial institutions to come clean on their own about misconduct and problems in the market.The commission\u2019s director of enforcement, James McDonald, plans to unveil the new framework in a speech Monday night at New York University. It is premised on the idea that large financial institutions, given the right incentives, have the potential to be invaluable partners for law enforcement.\u201cWe start with the shared understanding that the vast majority of businesses want to comply with the law,\u201d Mr. McDonald will say Monday, according to a draft of the speech reviewed by The New York Times.\u201cBut we also know that companies with even the best intentions can make mistakes or have a few bad actors,\u201d he will say. \u201cWe also recognize that no matter how much corporate leaders may want to foster compliance within the company, when they detect misconduct their decision whether to voluntarily report it often comes down to their perception of whether they\u2019ll be treated fairly.\u201dA similar philosophy is leading to a wide rollback of federal regulations on businesses under President Trump.Under the commission\u2019s new approach, companies that come clean about misconduct, cooperate fully with the agency as it investigates and fix their internal problems potentially stand to save millions of dollars.Penalties imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission range from a few hundred thousand dollars into the hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the severity of the offense and the size of the offender. Mr. McDonald said in the draft speech and in an interview that the agency expected to reduce penalties by roughly 75 percent for those that fully cooperate. In rare instances, he said, cases would be dropped altogether.Late Friday, Mr. McDonald told The Times that he and the commission\u2019s chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo, had changed their minds and decided against setting a 75 percent target. Instead, he said, they will reduce penalties by a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount case by case.The commission already rewards companies for self-reporting misconduct and for cooperating in investigations. But industry executives and lawyers have complained for years that they feel they are being severely penalized even when they assist the government.\u201cThe C.F.T.C. is so chronically and acutely under-resourced that it\u2019s even more necessary to encourage cooperation,\u201d said Mr. Goelman, now a partner at the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder in Washington.He said in the interview that the new enforcement strategy was born out of his experience as a federal prosecutor. Providing clear and strong incentives for self-reporting by wrongdoers \u2014 whether they are bank traders or gang members \u2014 is a powerful weapon in law enforcement\u2019s arsenal, Mr. McDonald said.\u201cWe need to give the relatively low-level criminals an incentive to cooperate with us,\u201d he said.He argued that the new focus on self-reporting wasn\u2019t a softening of the commission\u2019s law enforcement strategy. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to think we\u2019re going light on companies,\u201d he said.The emphasis is shifting as the Trump administration rethinks how the government regulates the private sector. Many of the changes are intended to ease the perceived burdens on corporations and other businesses \u2014 not a surprise considering that many of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet members and senior advisers hail from Wall Street or previously ran large companies.When it comes to oversight of the financial industry, early indications point to a softening approach.In the Bill Clinton administration, the Treasury Department blocked the commission\u2019s efforts to more closely regulate complex financial instruments known as derivatives, whose popularity was exploding. A decade later, the ubiquity of derivatives intensified the financial crisis because so many financial institutions were exposed to one another through the instruments.Out of the ashes of the financial crisis, though, the commission took on a newly prominent role.The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law placed sweeping new regulatory powers in the agency\u2019s hands. And a push from the agency\u2019s chairman at the time, Gary Gensler, to go after bigger, splashier cases led the commission to a yearslong investigation into the manipulation of a widely used interest-rate benchmark known as Libor. Some of the world\u2019s largest banks spent years stiff-arming the agency before grudgingly agreeing to cooperate once it became clear that the regulator was making progress.The Libor investigation eventually turned up evidence of widespread misconduct. More than a dozen international banks admitted wrongdoing and paid billions of dollars in penalties to the commission and other regulators in the United States and overseas.Bank executives argued that the Libor case, and others that followed, were examples of regulatory overkill, and that the length of the investigations and the severity of the penalties were uncalled-for. Wall Street came to view the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a major source of frustration.Mr. Giancarlo, a free-market devotee who is respected on both sides of the political aisle, vowed to continue to make law enforcement cases a priority. But he also noted that securing headline-grabbing cases should not be a goal unto itself.Mr. McDonald echoed that sentiment.\u201cWe at the C.F.T.C. are committed to working together with the companies and individuals we regulate \u2014 transparently and in partnership \u2014 to identify and prosecute wrongdoing that has occurred, and to stop future wrongdoing before it starts,\u201d he initially planned to say in Monday\u2019s speech.But late Friday, Mr. McDonald said he had decided to delete references in his speech to that \u201cpartnership\u201d with the industry, out of concern that such language would come across as overly conciliatory.Mr. McDonald is also aiming to shorten the duration of investigations so that they will take \u201cmonths, not years.\u201d The first settlements in the Libor investigation, which got underway in 2008, took place in 2012.Representatives of the financial industry said the new tone was a welcome shift from an era when industry perceived the commission as being hellbent on extracting severe punishments.\u201cThey\u2019re not settling cases with Al Qaeda,\u201d said Stephen Obie, a former enforcement official with the agency who now represents financial institutions as a partner at the law firm Jones Day. Under Mr. Giancarlo, he added, the commission has adopted a \u201cmore deliberate approach.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google and Facebook Face Criticism for Ads Targeting Racist Sentiments", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle and Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest sellers of online advertising, faced sharp criticism on Friday for allowing advertisers to direct ads to users who searched for or expressed an interest in racist sentiments and hate speech.In response to two separate news reports exposing the issues, both companies said they would change how their systems worked.The incidents added to a growing awareness of the complicated \u2014 and powerful \u2014 automated advertising systems that have turned Facebook and Google into two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. The companies have learned how to maximize their ability to connect any size of advertiser to highly tailored groups of people who use their services every day, collecting billions of dollars in the process.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking because it\u2019s illustrating the degree of targeting that\u2019s possible,\u201d said Eli Pariser, the author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think.\u201d \u201cBut I think the critical piece of context is this is happening when we know that a foreign country used targeted Facebook ads to influence opinion around an election.\u201dHe added: \u201cBefore all of this, you could see the rise of targeted advertising, you could see the rise of social politics, but the conjunction of the two in this way feels new.\u201dReporters from ProPublica tested Facebook advertising categories to see whether they could buy ads aimed at people who expressed interest in topics like \u201cJew hater,\u201d \u201cHow to burn jews,\u201d and \u201cHistory of \u2018why jews ruin the world.\u2019\u201d The reporters paid $30 to promote ProPublica posts to the people affiliated with the anti-Semitic categories to ensure they were real options, according to the investigation, which noted that Facebook had approved the posts within 15 minutes.The company said it would remove targeting by such self-reported fields \u201cuntil we have the right processes in place to help prevent this issue.\u201d It added that \u201chate speech and discriminatory advertising have no place on our platform.\u201dGoogle said that it informed advertisers when their ads were offensive and rejected, and that not all suggested keywords were eligible for purchase.\u201cIn this instance, ads didn\u2019t run against the vast majority of these keywords, but we didn\u2019t catch all these offensive suggestions,\u201d Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google\u2019s senior vice president of ads, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, and we\u2019re not making excuses. We\u2019ve already turned off these suggestions, and any ads that made it through, and will work harder to stop this from happening again.\u201dThese series of problems with advertising make the company look unprepared to handle the power of its ad system, said Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School.\u201cThey\u2019ve created a very complicated ad platform \u2014 it has all kinds of options and doodads and things working automatically and manually, and they don\u2019t know what they built,\u201d Professor Edelman said. \u201cThe machine has a mind of its own.\u201d\u201cThis is drawing a new level of public awareness to how targeted advertising can be used to manipulate and affect politics and political conversation in ways that didn\u2019t used to be feasible at all or easy,\u201d Mr. Pariser said.Advertisement"}

The restaurants generally fork over a fixed percentage of an order as a fee, while customers also pay a fee to the delivery service.\u201cThe number-one concern for all of these delivery companies is Amazon,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at the equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Company who follows the food delivery space. \u201cHow could Amazon use its network to crush our business? They have the logistical network and the balance sheet to be able to compete on the price side with all of these players.\u201dMatt Maloney, the founder and chief executive of Grubhub, said his company\u2019s focus on food orders set it apart.\u201cUber has built a great company focused on black car service and human transportation, but succeeding in food delivery is a different game,\u201d Mr. Maloney said in a statement. \u201cWe are known for one thing only \u2014 takeout ordering \u2014 and we have engineered our entire product around this purpose.\u201dBoth Amazon and Postmates declined to comment on UberEats.Uber first dabbled in food delivery in Los Angeles in 2014 under the name UberFresh, offering prepackaged lunches and dinners from restaurants. Uber also tried other experiments, like UberEssentials, a way to deliver pantry and drugstore items quickly.\u201cIf you can hit a button and get a car in a few minutes, what else can you get in a few minutes?\u201d Mr. Droege said.But the situation wasn\u2019t ideal, with drivers usually carting food around in a safe storage container in their car trunks. That led to issues with food quality, and customers were unhappy when their food arrived cold. People also wanted a greater selection of restaurants, something that competitors like Postmates provided.In December 2015, Mr. Droege\u2019s division introduced a separate app, UberEats, in Toronto, working with restaurants to provide freshly cooked meals that could be ordered with a few touches of a smartphone button. The service took off, and over the next 18 months UberEats expanded its sales force to bring more restaurants on board and to open in new cities.Uber has also spent the better part of a decade mapping cities and finding the most efficient routes, which the company said may help improve delivery times. And since the problems with UberFresh, it has invested in better technology and added more drivers in participating cities. The ideal UberEats delivery has the driver arrive at the restaurant just as the food has finished cooking, and has it delivered to the customer while still warm.\u201cWhat Uber has are the last-mile logistics, and that\u2019s crucial,\u201d Mr. Cakmak said.Uber said it had invested in increasing its UberEats sales force, as well as hiring data scientists to analyze daily information on customer orders and preferences to help restaurants improve their service or promote their more popular menu items.For Mr. Gordon, the owner of Footprints Cafe, Uber\u2019s investments have been a boon for business. He said the delivery service had helped his restaurant reach new customers outside its loyal Caribbean community, without spending on advertising or promotion on Facebook or Groupon, as he did in the past.\u201cWe\u2019ve employed people who just work on Uber deliveries, and have a counter just for Uber driver pickup,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cIt has definitely been worth it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gunman Kills 8 at Cookout at Suburban Dallas Home", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 A gunman opened fire during a cookout for a Cowboys game at a suburban Dallas home on Sunday night, killing eight people before a police officer fatally shot him, the authorities said.An officer with the Plano Police Department responded to the home within minutes of 911 calls and found several people wounded in the backyard of the home, located in the 1700 block of West Spring Creek Parkway, a residential area surrounded by parks near Spring Creek. After the officer heard additional gunshots, he entered the rear of the home and shot the man, Chief Gregory Rushin of the Plano Police Department said at a news conference on Monday afternoon.Eight people, including the gunman, died at the home. Two people were taken to a hospital, and one later died. Chief Rushin said he did not know the survivor\u2019s condition.The Police Department released few details on Monday about the episode, the worst mass shooting in Plano\u2019s history. The city, a fast-growing suburb of 260,000 north of Dallas, had fewer than eight homicides each year during the past decade.Chief Rushin said the gunman, whose name has not been released, was \u201cknown by people in the residence.\u201d The police have declined to release information about the victims, though local news reports said he was the estranged husband of the homeowner.\u201cShe was a cook, and a quite fine one, and she loved hosting friends and families,\u201d Ms. Lane told WFAA-TV. \u201cThis was her first opportunity to do it after the divorce and he didn\u2019t take it well.\u201dThe episode began a few minutes after 8 p.m., when the police received multiple 911 calls from people who heard gunshots at the house. The first officer reached the scene within two minutes of the calls, Chief Rushin said, and entered from an alley. He said the officer did not wait to enter the home with another officer, as Plano police are trained, because the gunman was still firing in the house.\u201cWhen something like this occurs, you cannot wait,\u201d Chief Rushin said. \u201cSeconds matter. This officer went directly into the fire, where fire was taking place, and stopped the shooter\u2019s ability to continue to kill people.\u201dThe officer, whose name was not released, was placed on routine administrative leave with pay. The Police Department has asked the Texas Rangers to assist in the investigation.Matthew Haag reported from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lurid Lawsuit\u2019s Quiet End Leaves Silicon Valley Start-Up Barely Dented", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "For all the outcry over how women are treated in the tech industry, the resolution of a sexual harassment case against Upload, a virtual reality start-up, shows that little has changed.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At Upload, the parties never seemed to stop.The start-up began by hosting impromptu gatherings to promote virtual reality as the next big thing. It quickly became an entertainment and news hub for the VR industry, hosting hundreds of events. The crowds were young and eager to network. Models did demos, and the liquor flowed.The freewheeling atmosphere was not restricted to the evening hours. There was a \u201crampant sexual behavior and focus\u201d in the Upload office that created \u201can unbearable environment,\u201d a former employee, Elizabeth Scott, said in a lawsuit filed in May.Ms. Scott said in her suit that the Upload office had a room with a bed \u201cto encourage sexual intercourse at the workplace.\u201d It was referred to as the kink room. Men who worked for the company were described in the suit as frequently talking about being so sexually aroused by female colleagues that it was impossible to concentrate. When Ms. Scott, Upload\u2019s digital media manager, complained about the hostile atmosphere and other issues in March with her supervisor, she was fired, the suit said.In a statement after the suit was filed, Upload said that \u201cour employees are our greatest asset\u201d and that \u201cthese allegations are entirely without merit.\u201d The company said Upload\u2019s chief executive, Taylor Freeman, and president, Will Mason, could not discuss the lawsuit and its specifics. On Friday, as this article neared publication, the men issued another statement that said, \u201cWe let you down and we are sorry.\u201dIf the claims were striking, so was the response.A few weeks ago, the suit was crossed off Upload\u2019s to-do list when it was quietly settled for a modest sum, said two people with knowledge of the case who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Both sides had an incentive to come to terms: Upload could say the problem was now in its past, and Ms. Scott, 26, got a victory of sorts without the risk of going to trial.Shortly after Ms. Scott filed her suit, at least a half-dozen members of Upload\u2019s team quit in solidarity, but they did not go public with their complaints. (At its peak, the company had about 20 to 25 employees.) In interviews, two of those who left described what happened but said that even though they were now working elsewhere, they did not want their names used.Behind the scenes, in members-only Facebook groups and other forums, the virtual reality industry is still roiled. People have opinions, they just do not want to be caught uttering them.In more than two dozen interviews for this story, even those inclined to see Upload in the most favorable light said it was the story of a company run by young, immature men who were flush with cash and did not know how to handle their power.The situation at Upload was particularly fraught because its principal product was parties. In the great tradition of Silicon Valley start-ups, the company was less interested in making a profit than in getting attention, said former employees. So the line between work and play, often fuzzy, was entirely erased.The existence of the kink room became the enduring symbol of Upload as soon as Ms. Scott filed her suit. Employees of the porn site Kink.com came to an early Upload party and left behind a sign, said two people with knowledge of the events. It became the name of a room toward the front of the office, a narrow chamber equipped with a bed.\u201cThere was a lack of leadership to cultivate a healthy work environment, and investors who failed to take a more active role in oversight,\u201d Mr. Bye said. \u201cThe only way to resolve these sorts of problems is to confront them head on, and that is precisely what no one seemed prepared to do.\u201dUpload was founded in 2014 as entrepreneurs \u2014 many of them women \u2014 flocked to virtual reality. There was a feeling of vast potential in the young industry, a sense of being able to make a mark by moving quickly and meeting the right people.Upload was the place to do it. Two of the founders \u2014 a third had dropped out \u2014 were in their mid-20s, with energy and ideas but not many credentials. Mr. Freeman, the chief executive, listed \u201cbackpacking in Europe\u201d and \u201cfreelance user experience designer\u201d on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201cI tend to be fairly passionate about things and wear my heart on my sleeve,\u201d Mr. Mason explained in an email about his petition. \u201cLooking back, there are definitely ways I would handle this differently.\u201dAlthough Upload\u2019s ambitions were ill-defined, the company was popular from the start. It quickly raised $1.25 million. One of its most prominent early investors was Joe Kraus, a Silicon Valley veteran who is now at GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm. Mr. Kraus, who invested $25,000 of his own money in Upload, was described by the company as an adviser. He declined to be interviewed.Larger sums came from Shanda Group in China and, in a second funding round of $4.5 million, Colopl, a Japanese mobile gaming company. Colopl\u2019s Shintaro Yamakami is the only non-Upload employee on the company\u2019s board. A spokeswoman for Mr. Yamakami said he was currently \u201crefraining from public relations activity.\u201d A spokeswoman for Shanda, an investment firm, said, \u201cWe do not have comments to offer.\u201dMs. Scott joined Upload in April 2016. She had graduated in 2012 from Emory University, where she was president of a group called the Alliance for Sexual Assault Prevention.She declined to be interviewed. Her mother, Jenny Scott of Gainesville, Fla., said, \u201cElizabeth had several incidents growing up that targeted her physical safety and developed her sense of right and wrong.\u201dMs. Scott, whose Facebook page describes her as \u201cshort, sassy & blonde. Take it or leave it,\u201d managed the stories generated by Upload\u2019s writing team on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube, produced videos and handled relationships with software developers.She said in the suit that she had other work, too: The women at Upload were required to do what were called \u201cwomanly tasks,\u201d including cleaning up. They were also told to act like \u201cmommies\u201d to the men and help them with whatever they needed.The suit presented a portrait of a deeply entitled male culture, one that clashed with the fresh start VR seemed to offer the tech industry. But Ms. Scott\u2019s suit was the second in the virtual reality industry in just a few months to present such an unwelcoming picture.Two-thirds of the women, Ms. Hart said, had experienced unwanted sexual interactions, such as being groped or kissed, or hearing comments about the physical attractiveness of women colleagues and sexual jokes or references that made them uncomfortable. One-third talked about men they worked with expressing romantic interest that was not reciprocated.This and other surveys suggest that in some ways, Silicon Valley has not evolved much over 50 years, even as more and younger women arrived.Some young women said they did not expect much from Silicon Valley. Amanda Joan, a VR developer, said the \u201cmisogynistic and lewd culture\u201d described in Ms. Scott\u2019s suit was as common to Silicon Valley as heavy traffic and expensive housing.About 11 months after Ms. Scott joined Upload, Ms. Scott said in her suit, she complained to a supervisor about the office atmosphere, about being shunned by Mr. Freeman and Mr. Mason and about being paid less for equal work and forced to perform menial and demeaning tasks. She was subsequently fired.All the success on the surface masked a workplace where, one former employee said, \u201cwomen are seen as the candy in the room.\u201d At Upload events, VR technology was demonstrated by women hired from a company called Models in Tech. Ms. Scott\u2019s suit said the founders tried to secure \u201csubmissive Asian women\u201d for a fund-raising trip to Asia.\u201cUpload was a boisterous culture, a \u2018bro\u2019 culture,\u201d said another former employee, Greg Gopman, in an interview. \u201cVirtual reality is hyped and no one was hyping it more than Upload. Within the industry, they were loved for giving people attention in the most positive way. They had a lot of clout and were able to act as they wanted until someone called them out.\u201dMr. Gopman, 33, is mentioned in Ms. Scott\u2019s suit. Other male employees, the suit said, would talk about how he \u201crefuses to wear a condom\u201d and \u201chas had sex with over 1,000 people.\u201dMr. Freeman, the chief executive, said in an interview that the company was moving on. The lesson he learned, he said, was that employees need to talk more, and that especially in times of trouble they need someone to hear their complaints. Under the agreement to end Ms. Scott\u2019s suit, Mr. Freeman was precluded from discussing it.\u201cA lot of things could be avoided if there is an open line of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you have five people, male or female, at a start-up you need external HR. Not having someone to go talk to about your potential concerns just makes it so much worse.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re the strongest as a company that we\u2019ve ever been because of this.\u201dAs for Ms. Scott, she now works for a camera company. She told friends that she had numerous interviews with VR companies, but as soon as they found out she had filed suit against her previous employer, they all declined to hire her.A woman runs Upload now. Kind of.Anne Ahola Ward, a specialist in increasing internet traffic, was a consultant to Upload. In June, when many of the employees were quitting, she proposed taking over. Her title is chief operating officer.\u201cAnne has had a lot of experience, and experience is a huge thing,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. He demurred when asked whether she was the \u201cadult supervision\u201d that all start-ups are said to need. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults here,\u201d he said.Ms. Ward, 38, is wry about the opportunity.\u201cI\u2019m a woman in Silicon Valley,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think someone would have handed me the keys to a start-up that wasn\u2019t beleaguered?\u201d Her husband asked the obvious question: Why aren\u2019t you the chief executive? \u201cThe title isn\u2019t important to me,\u201d she said.The kink room is now Ms. Ward\u2019s office. There is no bed there. She has instituted mandatory anti-harassment training: a two-hour session led by an outside consultant. There is now a human resources department. People have formal job descriptions. And as a joke \u2014 but not quite \u2014 people in the office gave Ms. Ward a sheriff\u2019s badge.An article on Saturday about a lawsuit against the virtual reality start-up Upload misstated the age of Elizabeth Scott, the plaintiff in the case. She is 26, not 27.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dying Art of Disagreement", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet me begin with thanks to the Lowy Institute for bringing me all the way to Sydney and doing me the honor of hosting me here this evening.I\u2019m aware of the controversy that has gone with my selection as your speaker. I respect the wishes of the Colvin family and join in honoring Mark Colvin\u2019s memory as a courageous foreign correspondent and an extraordinary writer and broadcaster. And I\u2019d particularly like to thank Michael Fullilove for not rescinding the invitation.This has become the depressing trend on American university campuses, where the roster of disinvited speakers and forced cancellations includes former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, former Harvard University President Larry Summers, actor Alec Baldwin, human-rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, DNA co-discoverer James Watson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, filmmaker Michael Moore, conservative Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George Will and liberal Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen, to name just a few.So illustrious is the list that, on second thought, I\u2019m beginning to regret that you didn\u2019t disinvite me after all.The title of my talk tonight is \u201cThe Dying Art of Disagreement.\u201d This is a subject that is dear to me \u2014 literally dear \u2014 since disagreement is the way in which I have always earned a living. Disagreement is dear to me, too, because it is the most vital ingredient of any decent society.To say the words, \u201cI agree\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s agreeing to join an organization, or submit to a political authority, or subscribe to a religious faith \u2014 may be the basis of every community.And the problem, as I see it, is that we\u2019re failing at the task.This is a puzzle. At least as far as far as the United States is concerned, Americans have rarely disagreed more in recent decades.We disagree about racial issues, bathroom policies, health care laws, and, of course, the 45th president. We express our disagreements in radio and cable TV rants in ways that are increasingly virulent; street and campus protests that are increasingly violent; and personal conversations that are increasingly embittering.This is yet another age in which we judge one another morally depending on where we stand politically.The polarization is geographic, as more people live in states and communities where their neighbors are much likelier to share their politics.The polarization is personal: Fully 50 percent of Republicans would not want their child to marry a Democrat, and nearly a third of Democrats return the sentiment. Interparty marriage has taken the place of interracial marriage as a family taboo.Finally the polarization is electronic and digital, as Americans increasingly inhabit the filter bubbles of news and social media that correspond to their ideological affinities. We no longer just have our own opinions. We also have our separate \u201cfacts,\u201d often the result of what different media outlets consider newsworthy. In the last election, fully 40 percent of Trump voters named Fox News as their chief source of news.Thanks a bunch for that one, Australia.It\u2019s usually the case that the more we do something, the better we are at it. Instead, we\u2019re like Casanovas in reverse: the more we do it, the worse we\u2019re at it. Our disagreements may frequently hoarsen our voices, but they rarely sharpen our thinking, much less change our minds.It behooves us to wonder why.* * *Thirty years ago, in 1987, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago named Allan Bloom \u2014 at the time best known for his graceful translations of Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic\u201d and Rousseau\u2019s \u201cEmile\u201d \u2014 published a learned polemic about the state of higher education in the United States. It was called \u201cThe Closing of the American Mind.\u201dThe book appeared when I was in high school, and I struggled to make my way through a text thick with references to Plato, Weber, Heidegger and Strauss. But I got the gist \u2014 and the gist was that I\u2019d better enroll in the University of Chicago and read the great books. That is what I did.What was it that one learned through a great books curriculum? Certainly not \u201cconservatism\u201d in any contemporary American sense of the term. We were not taught to become American patriots, or religious pietists, or to worship what Rudyard Kipling called \u201cthe Gods of the Market Place.\u201d We were not instructed in the evils of Marxism, or the glories of capitalism, or even the superiority of Western civilization.As I think about it, I\u2019m not sure we were taught anything at all. What we did was read books that raised serious questions about the human condition, and which invited us to attempt to ask serious questions of our own. Education, in this sense, wasn\u2019t a \u201cteaching\u201d with any fixed lesson. It was an exercise in interrogation.To listen and understand; to question and disagree; to treat no proposition as sacred and no objection as impious; to be willing to entertain unpopular ideas and cultivate the habits of an open mind \u2014 this is what I was encouraged to do by my teachers at the University of Chicago.It\u2019s what used to be called a liberal education.The University of Chicago showed us something else: that every great idea is really just a spectacular disagreement with some other great idea.Socrates quarrels with Homer. Aristotle quarrels with Plato. Locke quarrels with Hobbes and Rousseau quarrels with them both. Nietzsche quarrels with everyone. Wittgenstein quarrels with himself.These quarrels are never personal. Nor are they particularly political, at least in the ordinary sense of politics. Sometimes they take place over the distance of decades, even centuries.\u201cThe Closing of the American Mind\u201d took its place in the tradition of these quarrels. Since the 1960s it had been the vogue in American universities to treat the so-called \u201cDead White European Males\u201d of the Western canon as agents of social and political oppression. Allan Bloom insisted that, to the contrary, they were the best possible instruments of spiritual liberation.He also insisted that to sustain liberal democracy you needed liberally educated people. This, at least, should not have been controversial. For free societies to function, the idea of open-mindedness can\u2019t simply be a catchphrase or a dogma. It needs to be a personal habit, most of all when it comes to preserving an open mind toward those with whom we disagree.* * *That habit was no longer being exercised much 30 years ago. And if you\u2019ve followed the news from American campuses in recent years, things have become a lot worse.These attitudes are being made plain nearly every week on one college campus or another.The protesters succeeded in shutting down the lecture. We were forced to move to another site and broadcast our discussion via live stream, while activists who had figured out where we were banged on the windows and set off fire alarms. Afterward, as Dr. Murray and I left the building . . . a mob charged us.Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray, but when I took his right arm to shield him and to make sure we stayed together, the crowd turned on me. Someone pulled my hair, while others were shoving me. I feared for my life. Once we got into the car, protesters climbed on it, hitting the windows and rocking the vehicle whenever we stopped to avoid harming them. I am still wearing a neck brace, and spent a week in a dark room to recover from a concussion caused by the whiplash.Middlebury is one of the most prestigious liberal-arts colleges in the United States, with an acceptance rate of just 16 percent and tuition fees of nearly $50,000 a year. How does an elite institution become a factory for junior totalitarians, so full of their own certitudes that they could indulge their taste for bullying and violence?There\u2019s no one answer. What\u2019s clear is that the mis-education begins early. I was raised on the old-fashioned view that sticks and stones could break my bones but words would never hurt me. But today there\u2019s a belief that since words can cause stress, and stress can have physiological effects, stressful words are tantamount to a form of violence. This is the age of protected feelings purchased at the cost of permanent infantilization.The mis-education continues in grade school. As the Brookings findings indicate, younger Americans seem to have no grasp of what our First Amendment says, much less of the kind of speech it protects. This is a testimony to the collapse of civics education in the United States, creating the conditions that make young people uniquely susceptible to demagogy of the left- or right-wing varieties.Another consequence of identity politics is that it has made the distance between making an argument and causing offense terrifyingly short. Any argument that can be cast as insensitive or offensive to a given group of people isn\u2019t treated as being merely wrong. Instead it is seen as immoral, and therefore unworthy of discussion or rebuttal.The result is that the disagreements we need to have \u2014 and to have vigorously \u2014 are banished from the public square before they\u2019re settled. People who might otherwise join a conversation to see where it might lead them choose instead to shrink from it, lest they say the \u201cwrong\u201d thing and be accused of some kind of political -ism or -phobia. For fear of causing offense, they forego the opportunity to be persuaded.Take the arguments over same-sex marriage, which you are now debating in Australia. My own views in favor of same-sex marriage are well known, and I hope the Yes\u2019s wins by a convincing margin.But if I had to guess, I suspect the No\u2019s will exceed whatever they are currently polling. That\u2019s because the case for same-sex marriage is too often advanced not by reason, but merely by branding every opponent of it as a \u201cbigot\u201d \u2014 just because they are sticking to an opinion that was shared across the entire political spectrum only a few years ago. Few people like outing themselves as someone\u2019s idea of a bigot, so they keep their opinions to themselves even when speaking to pollsters. That\u2019s just what happened last year in the Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election, and look where we are now.If you want to make a winning argument for same-sex marriage, particularly against conservative opponents, make it on a conservative foundation: As a matter of individual freedom, and as an avenue toward moral responsibility and social respectability. The No\u2019s will have a hard time arguing with that. But if you call them morons and Neanderthals, all you\u2019ll get in return is their middle finger or their clenched fist.One final point about identity politics: It\u2019s a game at which two can play. In the United States, the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d justifies its white-identity politics in terms that are coyly borrowed from the progressive left. One of the more dismaying features of last year\u2019s election was the extent to which \u201cwhite working class\u201d became a catchall identity for people whose travails we were supposed to pity but whose habits or beliefs we were not supposed to criticize. The result was to give the Trump base a moral pass it did little to earn.* * *So here\u2019s where we stand: Intelligent disagreement is the lifeblood of any thriving society. Yet we in the United States are raising a younger generation who have never been taught either the how or the why of disagreement, and who seem to think that free speech is a one-way right: Namely, their right to disinvite, shout down or abuse anyone they dislike, lest they run the risk of listening to that person \u2014 or even allowing someone else to listen. The results are evident in the parlous state of our universities, and the frayed edges of our democracies.Can we do better?This is supposed to be a lecture on the media, and I\u2019d like to conclude this talk with a word about the role that editors and especially publishers can play in ways that might improve the state of public discussion rather than just reflect and accelerate its decline.I began this talk by noting that Americans have rarely disagreed so vehemently about so much. On second thought, this isn\u2019t the whole truth.Yes, we disagree constantly. But what makes our disagreements so toxic is that we refuse to make eye contact with our opponents, or try to see things as they might, or find some middle ground.Instead, we fight each other from the safe distance of our separate islands of ideology and identity and listen intently to echoes of ourselves. We take exaggerated and histrionic offense to whatever is said about us. We banish entire lines of thought and attempt to excommunicate all manner of people \u2014 your humble speaker included \u2014 without giving them so much as a cursory hearing.The crucial prerequisite of intelligent disagreement \u2014 namely: shut up; listen up; pause and reconsider; and only then speak \u2014 is absent.Perhaps the reason for this is that we have few obvious models for disagreeing well, and those we do have \u2014 such as the Intelligence Squared debates in New York and London or Fareed Zakaria\u2019s show on CNN \u2014 cater to a sliver of elite tastes, like classical music.Fox News and other partisan networks have demonstrated that the quickest route to huge profitability is to serve up a steady diet of high-carb, low-protein populist pap. Reasoned disagreement of the kind that could serve democracy well fails the market test. Those of us who otherwise believe in the virtues of unfettered capitalism should bear that fact in mind.I do not believe the answer, at least in the U.S., lies in heavier investment in publicly sponsored television along the lines of the BBC. It too, suffers, from its own form of ideological conformism and journalistic groupthink, immunized from criticism due to its indifference to competition.Nor do I believe the answer lies in a return to what in America used to be called the \u201cFairness Doctrine,\u201d mandating equal time for different points of view. Free speech must ultimately be free, whether or not it\u2019s fair.But I do think there\u2019s such a thing as private ownership in the public interest, and of fiduciary duties not only to shareholders but also to citizens. Journalism is not just any other business, like trucking or food services. Nations can have lousy food and exemplary government, as Great Britain demonstrated for most of the last century. They can also have great food and lousy government, as France has always demonstrated.But no country can have good government, or a healthy public square, without high-quality journalism \u2014 journalism that can distinguish a fact from a belief and again from an opinion; that understands that the purpose of opinion isn\u2019t to depart from facts but to use them as a bridge to a larger idea called \u201ctruth\u201d; and that appreciates that truth is a large enough destination that, like Manhattan, it can be reached by many bridges of radically different designs. In other words, journalism that is grounded in facts while abounding in disagreements.I believe it is still possible \u2014 and all the more necessary \u2014 for journalism to perform these functions, especially as the other institutions that were meant to do so have fallen short. But that requires proprietors and publishers who understand that their role ought not to be to push a party line, or be a slave to Google hits and Facebook ads, or provide a titillating kind of news entertainment, or help out a president or prime minister who they favor or who\u2019s in trouble.Their role is to clarify the terms of debate by championing aggressive and objective news reporting, and improve the quality of debate with commentary that opens minds and challenges assumptions rather than merely confirming them.This is journalism in defense of liberalism, not liberal in the left-wing American or right-wing Australian sense, but liberal in its belief that the individual is more than just an identity, and that free men and women do not need to be protected from discomfiting ideas and unpopular arguments. More than ever, they need to be exposed to them, so that we may revive the arts of disagreement that are the best foundation of intelligent democratic life.The honor the Lowy Institute does tonight\u2019s nominees is an important step in that direction. What they have uncovered, for the rest of you to debate, is the only way by which our democracies can remain rational, reasonable, and free.An earlier version of this article misidentified Charles Murray\u2019s host for his speech at Middlebury College. He was invited by the campus American Enterprise Institute Club and the political science department, not by Prof. Allison Stanger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Maria Does \u2018Mind-Boggling\u2019 Damage to Dominica, Leader Says", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 It was about midnight, as Hurricane Maria was battering the Caribbean nation of Dominica, that Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit took to Facebook. Roofs everywhere, he wrote, were being torn off by the powerful storm\u2019s winds. He himself had to be rescued from his official residence.\u201cWe will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds,\u201d he said, describing the damage as \u201cmind-boggling.\u201dAnd then silence. From Mr. Skerrit \u2014 and, it appears, from the rest of the island.As the storm, described by the National Hurricane Center as \u201cpotentially catastrophic,\u201d moved toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday, little could be learned about the conditions on Dominica. By early Tuesday morning, phone and internet signals on Dominica appeared to be down, leaving the island virtually incommunicado.The island of 72,000 was hit with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 miles per hour.He said the island\u2019s immediate priority was to rescue people who were trapped and provide medical care to the injured. \u201cI am honestly not preoccupied with physical damage at this time, because it is devastating \u2026 indeed, mind boggling,\u201d Mr. Skerrit said.Early reports suggested that the neighboring islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique had not been as badly hit as Dominica, though at least one person was killed on Guadeloupe, by a falling tree, officials in the French overseas territory reported. Officials in Guadeloupe also said that two people were reported missing after their boat sank off the island of D\u00e9sirade, part of the territory\u2019s archipelago.Guadeloupe residents were struck less by the power of the slow-moving storm than how long it lingered.\u201cWe spent the whole night holding a door that was shaking,\u201d said Colette Cyrille, 52. \u201cWe tried to put beds, tables, wood, anything to keep it shut. I haven\u2019t slept all night.\u201dReal-time map showing the position and forecast for Hurricane Maria, and the storm\u2019s impact in Puerto Rico.The territory\u2019s prefect urged civilians to remain in their homes and shelters to allow emergency crews to clear the streets of fallen power cables and debris, and said the military would be deployed to help the police maintain order.The French island of Martinique, to the south of Dominica, suffered limited damage, French government officials said. Two people reported minor injuries, two localities lost water service and between 25,000 and 33,000 households lost power.But some restaurants on the beaches were badly damaged, including in Le Carbet, in the northwest part of Martinique.\u201cThis is a disaster for Le Carbet,\u201d Marcel Palmont, a restaurant owner, told a local news site. \u201cThe economy of the restaurants took a big hit. I have been here for 25 years. I have rebuilt four times. I think it will be the last time.\u201dJacques Witkowski, France\u2019s head of civil security, said he had ordered local officials on Martinique to make a reconnaissance flight over Dominica to survey the damage. If the government there requires help, the French authorities will send rescue teams to the island, he said at a news conference in Paris on Tuesday morning.Around 250 military personnel and firefighters are scheduled to leave from France\u2019s mainland to its overseas territories on Thursday, complementing a force of 4,600 military personnel and search-and-rescue teams already on French islands in the Caribbean, Mr. Witkowski said.As the hurricane blew west-northwest through the Caribbean on Tuesday morning, residents in the British Virgin Islands raced to prepare for its arrival. The debris left behind by Hurricane Irma is still piled high on the sides of roads and homes remain damaged, but crews operating heavy machinery were trying to clear as much of the wreckage as possible Tuesday morning while marina workers secured boats.\u201cWe are all stressed trying to finish what needs to be done before we have to hunker down,\u201d said Christine Perakis, who rents an apartment on Tortola where she weathered Hurricane Irma. \u201cWhat makes us hopeful is that we took Irma head-on, and this one is about 60 miles away.\u201dFor Hurricane Maria, Ms. Perakis was staying with friends who live in the island\u2019s marina and have opened their home to outsiders. For now, there is food and water as they count down to another hurricane, holed up inside the house.\u201cI don\u2019t know what they did to get two hurricanes in a row,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly do some rain dances to stop this.\u201dKirk Semple reported from Mexico City, and Azam Ahmed from Miami Beach. Reporting was contributed by Elian Peltier from Paris; Coline Racloz from Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, Guadeloupe; Laurie-Anne Virassamy from Fort-de-France, Martinique; Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong; and Matthew Haag from New York.Advertisement"}

Why is Google, which has repeatedly failed to make it big in hardware, spending so much to become a big player? But the answer is really straightforward: because it has the money, so why not? We\u2019re at that stage in the tech industry where every one of the five tech giants is doing everything, because their money is endless and their appetites are ferocious.

{"Headline": "A Political Conservative Goes to Berkeley", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionYou\u2019d think that the cosmopolitan denizens of the San Francisco Bay Area would have encountered a few, if not in the form of an uncle at Thanksgiving, then perhaps in, I don\u2019t know, a field trip down to Orange County. But to judge from the pre-emptive reaction to Mr. Shapiro\u2019s speech scheduled for this Thursday at the University of California, Berkeley, you\u2019d be mistaken.Let\u2019s hope the protest against this \u201cfascist\u201d who has been the regular target of actual ones doesn\u2019t result in any violence. But the brouhaha over Ben Shapiro is significant not because of what might go down Thursday at Berkeley, but because it is a perfect exhibition of a much broader phenomenon increasingly apparent in the wake of the Charlottesville, Va., demonstrations last month: the sloppy conflation between actual white supremacists and, well, run-of-the-mill conservatives, libertarians and classical liberals whose main beef is with some on the left who seem like they\u2019d rather do without the First Amendment.What happened at the Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville was the real article: a gathering of proud white supremacists, neo-Nazis and fellow travelers brandishing torches and flags and a Dodge Challenger in order to terrify residents, kill a counterprotester and injure 19 others.Later in August, however, there were long-planned free-speech protests across the country that had nothing to do with that ugly demonstration. Liberty Weekend in the Bay Area was one of them.The demonstration was organized by the leader of a right-wing group Patriot Prayer, Joey Gibson, who advertised the event this way: \u201cNo extremists will be allowed in. No Nazis, Communist, K.K.K., Antifa, white supremacist, I.E., or white nationalists. This is an opportunity for moderate Americans to come in with opposing views. We will not allow the extremists to tear apart this country. Specifically, Richard Spencer and Nathan Damigo will not be welcome.\u201dSan Francisco\u2019s mayor, Ed Lee, asked residents to avoid \u201cengaging with members of Patriot Prayer\u201d lest anyone \u201cdignify their message of hate and their mission of division in our city of love of compassion.\u201dWatch it.

The collaboration between the Lower East Side designer Maryam Nassir Zadeh and the jeweler Sophie Buhai offers a striking example. The pieces, available at Ms. Zadeh\u2019s boutique and website, translate what has become Ms. Buhai\u2019s signature aesthetic \u2014 bold, sculptural shapes \u2014 into on-trend (and very slightly more budget-friendly) Lucite.It\u2019s a rare label that appeals equally to the fashion elite and the street wear heads. One such anomaly/rarity is Off-White, designed by the multihyphenate (and onetime Kanye West right-hand man) Virgil Abloh. If you want to score style points in both camps, snap up something from his industrial-look accessories. Or, head over to Off-White\u2019s newly opened Empty Gallery, at 51 Mercer Street, which is outfitted with trees, metal cages and art you can take home. It\u2019ll serve up major inspiration completely free.The designer Shaina Mote is taking her offhand yet thoughtful aesthetic down a level \u2014 to ankle height, to be exact. This month, Ms. Mote is introducing a footwear collection inspired by ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement. Each style \u2014 there are mules, oxfords and boots \u2014 has a bamboo heel, handcrafted and applied by Italian cobblers.That strain of just-this-side-of-batty chic ushered in by Alessandro Michele at Gucci hasn\u2019t waned. The easiest way to play into the trend is to carry a handbag with an air of luxe eccentricity. The faux fur and faux pearl bags from the British label Shrimps hit all the right notes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Parents Become Activists in Australian Marriage Debate", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 It was a scene that plays out nearly every day in schoolyards across Australia: A couple, standing among a dozen other parents, waited for the final school bell to ring.On cue, Reid Duggan-Tierney, 7, came bounding out of school last Friday and ran toward Michael and Jarrad Duggan-Tierney \u2014 his fathers.The Duggan-Tierneys are one of around 6,800 Australian same-sex couples with a child. In many ways, their family represents the chasm that has emerged between the law and people\u2019s lives. As the debate over same-sex marriage in this country becomes increasingly hostile, gay parents are balancing the daily routines of playtime and homework with activism.Their hope, the men say, is to normalize same-sex parenting for a broad audience.The men have been together for 16 years. Though they are not legally married, they each wear a ring on their left hand and changed their legal names to share a surname.Reid was born to a surrogate in India, and he keeps a photo of the woman by his bed. In a biological and legal sense, only one of the men is his father, as the couple have not sought a parenting order from the courts.\u201cBut we are already a family in our minds and hearts,\u201d Michael said.The mundane truths \u2014 and challenges \u2014 of gay couples who parent have been hard to find in the heat of the national debate. Gay parents describe the difficulties of completing even small administrative tasks. At the hospital, the Duggan-Tierneys might be greeted with, \u201cAre you the dads?\u201d But a government official renewing Reid\u2019s passport expected to meet the boy\u2019s mother, the men said.Earlier this week, a Fairfax/Ipsos poll found that around 70 percent of Australians would vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the government\u2019s survey.The vocal \u201cno\u201d camp is undeterred by the recent opinion polls.Opponents of gay marriage argue that children would \u201close the right\u201d to have a mother and a father and that legalizing marriage would open the door to \u201cradical gay sex education programs.\u201d They view themselves as David staring down a politically correct Goliath, and with the postal vote results expected in November, they are predicting victory.\u201cWe have many hundreds of thousands of concerned people who will, like \u2018Brexit\u2019 and like Trump, move and assert their quiet preference over the coming weeks,\u201d said David van Gend, a spokesman for the Coalition for Marriage, a group that opposes legalization.Dr. van Gend said Columbia was engaging \u201cin public advocacy\u201d and \u201cmischievous science\u201d in releasing the summary, and he said that none of the studies that showed positive outcomes had significant data.Simon Crouch, an Australian researcher whose study was cited by Columbia, said the report is solid and reliable. \u201cThree decades of research in this area points to no difference \u2014 and sometimes, some benefits \u2014 for children in same-sex parent families,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are hurtful things being said,\u201d said Senator Penny Wong, a member of the Labor Party and a gay parent. \u201cThey might be said politely, but they are hurtful and inaccurate, about our families, about our children.\u201dMs. Yeats, who has an 8-month-old daughter with her female partner added, \u201cI fail to see how extending this right to minority groups takes anything away from anybody else.\u201dThe same day, the government passed emergency laws instituting penalties for vilification, intimidation and threats during the campaign.In response to the \u201cno\u201d campaign\u2019s vitriol, many same-sex couples have felt compelled to speak out and share their lives in more public ways.On their living room table last week were hundreds of thousands of fliers that Rodney Chiang-Cruise, a gay-rights activist, planned to stuff in local mailboxes. The fliers introduced his family and asked his neighbors for their support in the survey.\u201cThis is not how I want to be spending my weekends,\u201d Rodney said.In between sorting and stuffing envelopes, Rodney was interrupted by Ethan, his 8-year-old son, wondering whether he could play soccer in the park after Chinese school. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d came the reply.A few days later, Rodney expanded his campaign into digital territory, writing the flier up as a Facebook post and paying for its promotion.\u201cI feel like I am groveling. It is demeaning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will survive.\u201dGay parents say the fight to legalize marriage is a fight for their children\u2019s dignity. They want their children to be treated the same way the children of heterosexual parents are treated.One Friday after school, 7-year-old Reid Duggan-Tierney was asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the most special thing about having two dads?\u201dReluctantly looking up from his afternoon snack of blueberries and apple, the boy squished his face in concentration.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as everyone else,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But many are geniuses. Just ask the MacArthur Foundation, which responded to our president\u2019s frequent demonization of immigrants, including that infamous phrase, by doing a little math.Every year since 1981, the foundation has bestowed so-called genius grants on more than 20 of the country\u2019s most accomplished and promising scientists, scholars, artists and writers. These awards are a huge deal, trumpeted in the media and worn with pride forevermore. And the winners, typically in the middle of their careers, get $625,000 each.Conrad wondered whether MacArthur fellows are anomalies. They\u2019re not. She looked back over the past three and a half decades \u2014 which is the life span of the fellowships \u2014 to see who\u2019d received other top honors given only to United States citizens and residents.He studied hard and got a master\u2019s degree from Princeton. He said that his four siblings, like him, have good jobs, two as high school teachers. Long before Trump\u2019s campaign, he heard and cringed at complaints that Mexican immigrants were criminals, freeloaders. \u201cEspecially early on, I began to believe: Maybe I was lazy, maybe I was broken?\u201d said Qui\u00f1onez, 46, who now lives in Oakland, Calif. \u201cBut there was something in our family that helped us reject that narrative. We fought back against that narrative. I never allowed it to seep into my soul.\u201dIt\u2019s possible that the bounty of immigrants who\u2019ve won MacArthur grants demonstrates some predisposition among foundation executives toward certain life stories and a desire to promote people who have been overlooked and underappreciated. Some critics of the foundation have asserted that.But it\u2019s worth noting that if the foundation took into account children of immigrants as well as immigrants themselves, the percentage of its geniuses that reflects the benefits of immigration would be higher than 21.7. It\u2019s also worth noting that for most of the grant\u2019s history, foreign-born people constituted less than 10 percent of the United States population.I asked her what she made of immigrants\u2019 prevalence among MacArthur geniuses. \u201cI think most of us feel very lucky to be here, so we work extremely hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think maybe trauma is part of what drives us.\u201d She added that in terms of innovation, \u201cHaving the different perspectives, having the different life experiences, makes you see things differently.\u201d Fresh ideas and great art are often born that way.Conrad, the MacArthur Foundation executive, said that in all the debate lately about how many immigrants our country needs for jobs of varying skill levels, she hears too little about the ambient impact of immigrants on America\u2019s creative climate. \u201cThey have certain attributes,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey are risk takers.\u201d And their thinking and discoveries are nourished by \u201cthe experience of dislocation, of navigating a new culture and a new set of norms,\u201d she said.They come with a sort of hunger and a kind of gaze that don\u2019t subtract from what those of us already here have but, instead, add to it. They give us insights, inventions, art. Embracing their genius is the genius of America.An earlier version of this column described the acronym STEM incorrectly.

Or more tellingly, the ones they reject.Every year since 1990, hundreds of complaints by parents, educators and the public have poured into the association\u2019s online reporting system. There were 323 challenges to published books recorded in 2016. The details are confidential: The association is more interested in how people think about specific books and censorship than in publishing who called for a ban and where.\u201cWe are like fire spotters \u2014 we look for signs of smoke,\u201d said James LaRue, the director of the group\u2019s Office for Intellectual Freedom, which receives the reports. \u201cWhat is it that America is worried about now?\u201dIn a telephone interview, he did not hesitate to answer.\u201cAmerica seems to be very exercised about sex,\u201d Mr. LaRue saidAnother trend involved parents objecting to books meant for high school students.\u201cWhat we are seeing is helicopter parents are turning into Velcro parents,\u201d Mr. LaRue said. \u201cThey are completely attached to the skull of the child and it goes all the way up through high school, just trying to preserve enough innocence, even though one year later they will be old enough to marry or serve in the military.\u201d\u201cWhen we wrote this book, our goal was to create a story that explored the experience of summer and of adults, from a young person\u2019s perspective,\u201d the novel\u2019s creators said in an email.\u201cWe worry about what it means to define certain content, such as L.G.B.T.Q. content, as being inappropriate for young readers, which implicitly defines readers who do relate to this content, who share these experiences, as not normal, when really they are part of the diversity of young people\u2019s lives.\u201dThe main character, Rose, \u201cis often afraid, confused, exposed to things outside of her comfort zone, things she doesn\u2019t completely understand,\u201d the creators said. \u201cWe believe that is part of growing up.\u201dThe graphic novel, for children ages 10 to 14, is about a student who becomes the set designer in her middle school\u2019s stage production.

{"Headline": "Burgers and Franks Go Over the Top at Prontito in Queens", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosIt\u2019s hard to know whether to eat a cholado or sip it, or to somehow try both at once. Better just to say that you submit to it, this red-orange tower of fruit, ice and condensed milk like a mashed-up sunrise.At Prontito, in Elmhurst, Queens, a cholado begins with pulverized ice, chiming at the bottom of a cup. Passion fruit and blackberry syrups trickle down, and then a pileup of fruit summons every gradation of sweetness: fleshy chunks of guanabana (soursop), pineapple, papaya, mango, banana and strawberries; crisp, bracing apple and honeydew melon; a tatting of grated coconut.All is drowned in lechera (condensed milk). The fruit half-melts, half-swims, and the lechera rests lazily on the tongue, like a custard that couldn\u2019t be bothered to set. Passion fruit seeds snap. A maraschino cherry rests on top, alien red, stem askew, as if seconds from being sucked under.This costs $6. It could not be more luxurious if it were a cup of boiled gold. And why stop now? For another dollar, you may add a scoop of helado (ice cream), then toddle heavily, happily home.Cholados are Colombia\u2019s gift to the world. Here, they are made by Dira Llanos, a native of Santuario in western Colombia, and her husband, Douglas Cevallos, who grew up in Santa Ana, El Salvador, and has learned her recipes. They work in the kitchen alongside Ms. Llanos\u2019s mother and sister, turning out some of New York\u2019s finest cholados, raspados (the same ingredients, minus the fruit) and salpic\u00f3ns (fruit half-smashed so the juices run, with a crimson seep of grenadine).The excess \u2014 I think of it as generosity \u2014 spills over to the rest of the menu, a catalog of ornately swagged hot dogs and hamburgers that look designed with a snake\u2019s jaws in mind. A super perro mix is a hot dog simply boiled in water (some vendors in Colombia use Coca-Cola) and buried so deep it\u2019s invisible, under a crumble of potato chips, frilly bacon, carrot-cabbage slaw, coste\u00f1o cheese in ivory curls, pineapple sauce like pulped sun, and ketchup and mayonnaise merged into creamy-sweet salsa rosada.Hard-boiled quail eggs anchor each end, impaled on toothpicks.The hamburguesa Prontitos deploys the same sauces, bacon and chips, adding ham, two slices of white American cheese (above the burger, melted and oozing, and below, stretchy but still intact), lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, with a quail egg affixed to the top like a white flag. It arrives as if frozen mid-landslide.The quality of the hot dog and the burger themselves is beside the point. It\u2019s the gleeful abundance that matters, the counterpoints of salt and sugar, crunch and yield, spikiness and velvet. French fries, on the other hand, are exemplars of the form, crispy even under a siege of mozzarella, holding their own against squeaky hot dog nubs ensnared in the cheese.Prontito is Spanish slang for quick and snappy, but the food here isn\u2019t. It takes time to build monuments; best to call ahead or settle in. The staff is patient with English speakers and sometimes protective, as when I asked to try champus. \u201cDo you know the taste?\u201d the woman at the cashier asked gently. \u201cSome people really don\u2019t like it.\u201dIt turned out to be an indigenous drink of dried corn simmered and stirred with panela (unrefined cane sugar), broken-down pineapple and lulo, a fruit with a clean tang and citrus sting. It tasted like pineapple talked down from the ledge, its sweetness tuned down from a shriek to a whisper.Advertisement"}

They found her car. But they did not find Ms. Renick until Thursday \u2014 11 days after she went missing.Ms. Renick, a spa manager at the hotel, was among the workers who decided to ride out Hurricane Harvey there on the night of Aug. 26.Floodwaters began filling up the basement of the building the next morning before dawn, according to Ms. Renick\u2019s sister, Pam Eslinger, who said she had spoken about the matter with the Omni hotel management. At 5:40 a.m. Ms. Renick, 48, called the front desk and reported that she was stuck in an elevator, with the water rising around her.For days, the hotel management, and the police, told Ms. Eslinger that they were unable to find any trace of her sister. On Thursday, Capt. Mark Lentini of the Houston Police Department said that a body presumed to be Ms. Renick\u2019s had been discovered in the ceiling of the basement near the elevators.\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that the search for my sister, Jill Renick, has concluded with the confirmation of her death,\u201d Ms. Eslinger said in a statement. \u201cWe are heartbroken.\u201dNearly two weeks after Harvey made landfall in Texas, 22 people remain missing, presumably as a result of the storm, and are being actively sought by investigators from the Police Department. They include a journalist who was recently diagnosed with dementia, and a 23-year-old woman who had worked with disabled children. They are professional people and homeless people, young adults and seniors. Two of them are children.The roster is grim proof that things are still far from normal in Texas\u2019 largest city, despite some superficial signs that it is bouncing back, with traffic again clogging wide freeways under blue skies and Tex-Mex restaurants in the luckier neighborhoods thrumming with business.The storm slammed through a wide swath of East Texas far beyond Houston, and officials said this week that at least 63 deaths in the state were storm-related or suspected to be storm-related so far. But no one really knows yet how many people are missing across the state, partly because it is difficult to distinguish who went missing as a direct result of the storm, and partly because many local officials are overwhelmed by the post-storm chaos.Aunjelique G. Lindsey, of La Marque, Tex., posted a picture of her brother, William Loving Jr. Reached by phone Wednesday, Ms. Lindsey, 21, said that her brother, who is in his mid-20s, was mentally ill. She was not sure whether anyone in her family had filed an official missing persons report.\u201cSomebody said they saw him that Friday before the storm hit in downtown Houston,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s O.K. or not.\u201dSenior Officer Darrin Buse, an investigator in the Houston Police Department\u2019s missing persons unit, said that he and his fellow officers have already resolved more than 30 storm-related cases. And he said that the local morgue had some unidentified bodies that might help them bring other cases to their sad conclusions.Over all, there has not been a wave of missing persons cases in Houston like this one since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when thousands of Louisiana evacuees arrived in Texas, often by bus, seeking shelter. In the confusion of the Louisiana evacuations, many children were separated from their parents. This time, according to Beth Alberts, chief executive of the nonprofit Texas Center for the Missing, the unaccounted for are more often adults.Houston officials knew that some people were likely to go missing in the chaos of the hurricane. A few days into the storm, Ms. Alberts\u2019s group began staffing a missing persons booth downtown at the George R. Brown Convention Center, which, at the peak of the crisis, housed some 10,000 evacuees. Working with law enforcement, Ms. Alberts said, her group helped locate more than 120 people, often without formal police cases being opened. Three of the missing, she said, were discovered dead: two women, ages 40 and 73, whose cause of death was unknown to Ms. Alberts, and a 51-year-old man who drowned.Some of the unresolved cases are resonating far beyond the shelters. In the trendy Montrose neighborhood, a coffee shop called the Black Hole was stocked this week with missing-person fliers for a man named James B. Simmon. His family believes the cafe might be the last place anyone saw him.Mr. Simmon, 63, who goes by Jim, is a former newspaper editor who worked at The Houston Chronicle and The Houston Press, an alternative weekly. On Wednesday, his ex-wife Jamie Kaelin, 58, met a reporter in the badly flooded Meyerland neighborhood, at a cafe that was back in business despite its water-damaged floor. Ms. Kaelin was mostly focused as she told the story of how Mr. Simmon walked out of his Montrose home after the worst of the rains had subsided. But there were moments when she broke down in tears.She said that Mr. Simmon had learned he was in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in February.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty functional, but little things will slip him up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can ask him anything about the Astros, music, current events, literature, books. I would drive him around the city and say, like, \u2018Oh, remember when we went there?\u2019 and jog his memory. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Which way should we go?\u2019 and he would pretty much tell me.\u201dAs with other cases, it is difficult to say if Mr. Simmon\u2019s case is storm-related, or if it has just been particularly difficult to find him amid the post-storm confusion.Mr. Simmon and his 28-year-old son Luke Simmon, who live together, had hunkered down at home to ride out the storm. When the rains let up on Aug. 30, Mr. Simmon told his son he was going to go for a walk to the Black Hole, and then to a nearby bank.Five or six hours later, he called his son and told him he was by an aquatic center in Fort Bend County, some 20 miles west. Ms. Kaelin assumed he had walked there. She tried calling the police, she said, \u201cbut it just rang and rang and rang.\u201d The system was overwhelmed.Mr. Simmon\u2019s son, who does not own a car, found a ride to the aquatic center the next morning. But by then there was no sign of him.Houston police have since begun a missing-persons investigation, and the family, aided by a group of journalist friends, have also been scouring the area for him, so far to no avail.Ms. Kaelin said that Mr. Simmon, despite his disease, had no problem recounting his name, address and social security number from memory. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really been worrying,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he could spout that stuff.\u201dA similar drama was unfolding this week in Rosenberg, Tex., more than an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Houston. There, Lashunder Smith, 43, a nursing home worker, has been hoping to hear something about her daughter, Alexzandra Smith, 23.The missing-person flier posted by the police says that Alexzandra last communicated with her mother on Facebook on Aug. 25, around the time Harvey slammed into the Texas coast. She had told her mother she was at the Greenspoint Mall, on the north side of town. Her younger sister Ashlee Smith, 15, with whom she stayed in close touch, has not heard from her either.On Tuesday evening, Ms. Smith and her younger daughter were holed up in their modest apartment. The floodwater had not reached the place, but a group of children were in the parking lot, jousting with fallen palm fronds.Ms. Smith, through tears, said that her elder daughter had been working at a group home for children in Houston, but recently left that job. She did not know where she was staying. She showed a photo of Alexzandra\u2019s dark blue Crown Victoria sedan, with big rims. She showed her daughter\u2019s high school diploma.And she showed photo after photo of Alexzandra herself, with big cheeks and sleepy eyes. \u201cIf you look at her picture she looks like a big ol\u2019 doll,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Facebook Wins, Democracy Loses", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 On Wednesday, Facebook revealed that hundreds of Russia-based accounts had run anti-Hillary Clinton ads precisely aimed at Facebook users whose demographic profiles implied a vulnerability to political propaganda. It will take time to prove whether the account owners had any relationship with the Russian government, but one thing is clear: Facebook has contributed to, and profited from, the erosion of democratic norms in the United States and elsewhere.The audacity of a hostile foreign power trying to influence American voters rightly troubles us. But it should trouble us more that Facebook makes such manipulation so easy, and renders political ads exempt from the basic accountability and transparency that healthy democracy demands.The majority of the Facebook ads did not directly mention a presidential candidate, according to Alex Stamos, head of security at Facebook, but \u201cappeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dThe ads \u2014 about 3,000 placed by 470 accounts and pages spending about $100,000 \u2014 were what the advertising industry calls \u201cdark posts,\u201d seen only by a very specific audience, obscured by the flow of posts within a Facebook News Feed and ephemeral. Facebook calls its \u201cdark post\u201d service \u201cunpublished page post ads.\u201dThis should not surprise us. Anyone can deploy Facebook ads. They are affordable and easy. That\u2019s one reason that Facebook has grown so quickly, taking in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, virtually all of it from advertisers, by serving up the attention of two billion Facebook users across the globe.The service is popular among advertisers for its efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness. Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more. There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it\u2019s being used for commerce instead of politics. What\u2019s alarming is that Facebook executives don\u2019t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.A core principle in political advertising is transparency \u2014 political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from. And it\u2019s expensive to run even one version of an ad in traditional outlets, let alone a dozen different versions. Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.None of that transparency matters to Facebook. Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing. The potential for abuse is vast. An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened. Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.Unfortunately, the range of potential responses to this problem is limited. The First Amendment grants broad protections to publishers like Facebook. Diplomacy, even the harsh kind, has failed to dissuade Russia from meddling. And it\u2019s even less likely to under the current administration.Daniel Kreiss, a communication scholar at the University of North Carolina, proposes that sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a repository of campaign ads so that regulators, scholars, journalists and the public can examine and expose them. But the companies have no impetus to concur and coordinate. And Congress is unlikely to reform a system that campaigns are just learning to master.Facebook has no incentive to change its ways. The money is too great. The issue is too nebulous to alienate more than a few Facebook users. The more that Facebook saturates our lives, families and communities, the harder it is to live without it.Facebook has pledged to install better filtering systems using artificial intelligence and machine-learning to flag accounts that are run by automated \u201cbots\u201d or violate the site\u2019s terms of service. But these are just new versions of the technologies that have caused the problem in the first place. And there would be no accountability beyond Facebook\u2019s word. The fact remains that in the arms race to keep propaganda flowing, human beings review troublesome accounts only long after the damage has been done.Our best hopes sit in Brussels and London. European regulators have been watching Facebook and Google for years. They have taken strong actions against both companies for violating European consumer data protection standards and business competition laws. The British government is investigating the role Facebook and its use of citizens\u2019 data played in the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 national elections.We are in the midst of a worldwide, internet-based assault on democracy. Scholars at the Oxford Internet Institute have tracked armies of volunteers and bots as they move propaganda across Facebook and Twitter in efforts to undermine trust in democracy or to elect their preferred candidates in the Philippines, India, France, the Netherlands, Britain and elsewhere. We now know that agents in Russia are exploiting the powerful Facebook advertising system directly.In the 21st-century social media information war, faith in democracy is the first casualty.Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, is writing a book about Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixing the \u2018Brain Damage\u2019 Caused by the I.P.O. Process", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cIt seems like a way of living in hell without dying.\u201dIt is no secret that the public stock markets \u2014 despite the heights they\u2019ve reached (and the credit that President Trump has taken for them) \u2014 are fundamentally broken. No chief executive wants to live in the glare of the public spotlight and deal with pesky investors who hold stocks in time frames of days and months, not years and decades.The number of companies listed on public stock exchanges is half what it was two decades ago. Last year, fewer companies went public than during the financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange world. If it was 10 years ago, we\u2019d be public by now,\u201d Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, an office messaging company worth $5.1 billion, told The Financial Times over the weekend.The idea is to remove \u201cthe process of going public that is true brain damage,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said.At the same time, Spotify, the streaming music company worth some $13 billion, has been exploring a plan to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange directly, without raising any new money from public investors.Perhaps the most ambitious and provocative effort is a company that until now was in \u201cstealth mode\u201d: LTSE (Long-Term Stock Exchange), led by the entrepreneur Eric Ries. Backed by a who\u2019s who of venture-capital investors \u2014 Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Steve Case among them \u2014 the new exchange aims to reimagine what it means to even be a public company. Among its changes to the ecosystem: the voting rights of investors (the longer you own, the more voting power you have), new disclosure policies (including a moratorium on \u201cguidance\u201d) and a complete rewrite of compensation schemes so that executives truly focus on the long term (it recommends vesting stock over as long as a decade).Before we go too far down the rabbit hole of how to fix the problem, it is worth understanding how the I.P.O. process \u2014 and the markets themselves \u2014 became so broken.To hear Mr. Palihapitiya tell it, the shift \u2014 at least in Silicon Valley \u2014 began during the financial crisis, when he was working at Facebook. His candid explanation is surprising.\u201cWe at Facebook basically flipped the narrative, and we did it on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cOur whole thing was \u2018Let\u2019s stay private longer.\u2019 And the reason we did that was we were pretty sure it would trick a lot of other people into not trying to go public or take advantage of the capital markets.\u201dHe said Facebook hoped that \u201call those companies would eventually die because they were not that good and we would suck up all of their talent.\u201dWhether it was a trick or not, \u201cstay private longer\u201d became a mantra in Silicon Valley. And given all the cash sloshing around the technology industry, companies have been able to put off going public without going broke.But it has created all sorts of problems, not least of which is that employees have felt that their social contract with companies \u2014 working for little salary but lots of stock on the assumption the companies would go public \u2014 has fallen apart. And it may very well be affecting innovation.Mr. Palihapitiya said the lament of many employees had become this: \u201cI can\u2019t pay for my house on \u2018mission and values.\u2019 I actually need current compensation. Silicon Valley is now one of the most expensive places to live.\u201d So many employees, he explained, have been hopscotching from one company to the next in search of an elusive I.P.O.\u201cNow you have these attrition rates of like 20-plus percent,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you supposed to build an iconic legacy business when your entire employee base walks out the door every five years?\u201dMr. Palihapitiya\u2019s answer is to eliminate the I.P.O. process and its year and a half of \u201cdistractions trying to craft a bogus narrative,\u201d as he described it, to entice investors. Instead, through his publicly traded vehicle, a unicorn company \u2014 shorthand for a $1 billion-plus private technology company \u2014 could reverse merge into it, instantly becoming public.Unlike an initial public offering, in which employees and early investors all have certain \u201clockup\u201d dates for when they can sell stock, he can write the rules however the company wants. Certain employees, for instance, could sell early, or the sales could be staggered so there isn\u2019t an \u201coverhang\u201d on the stock that would depress the price before a major lockup period expired.Mr. Palihapitiya also was able to choose most of the company\u2019s big investors, who have agreed to their own lockups, making them much more oriented toward the long term. For all this, he takes a tidy fee: 20 percent of the $600 million. But if his company acquires a business five to 20 times its size through a reverse merger, he said, the fee is the same as or smaller than a banker\u2019s fee \u2014 and it is all in stock, so unlike the banks, Mr. Palihapitiya\u2019s interests are aligned with the company\u2019s.But Mr. Palihapitiya\u2019s approach is just the tip of the iceberg. The most provocative plan floating around Silicon Valley is Mr. Ries\u2019s LTSE. \u201cIt\u2019s an intellectually thoughtful idea,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said.The idea, at its core, is to change the dynamic between the stock exchange and whom it serves, Mr. Ries explained, suggesting that traditional stock exchanges focus more on investors \u2014 and all associated trading revenue \u2014 than on the companies listed. That, he believes, leads to short-term thinking and trading.Mr. Ries, who wrote a book titled \u201cThe Lean Startup,\u201d is hoping to create an exchange that is focused on the needs of companies with a long-term vision and investors who are similarly aligned. He believes the problem facing private companies isn\u2019t just the I.P.O. process but also \u201cthe lived experience of being a public company.\u201dPerhaps the most unusual part of his exchange\u2019s approach \u2014 which is still working to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 is how much influence and voting power investors would have over companies.Currently, an investor who owns one share for a month, or even a day, has the same voting power as someone who has owned a share for years. Mr. Ries wants what he calls \u201ctourists\u201d \u2014 short-term shareholders \u2014 to have less voting power than long-term shareholders, whom he calls \u201ccitizens of the republic.\u201d Over time, shareholders of companies on the LTSE would gain more votes based on their length of ownership.Such a system might make dual-class structures, like at Snap (or The New York Times) less attractive to its founders. That would also help end another problem that has emerged: Dual-class companies pay the chief executive, on average, three times as much as companies with a single share class.Mr. Ries also takes aim at compensation plans. He wants companies that list on his exchange to have stock vesting programs of at least five years and recommends 10 years, even for executives who leave the company.Now, this may be very hard to put into practice, and it\u2019s tough to know whether it would work. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said. \u201cOurs is not as intellectually ambitious.\u201d But all of these efforts are meaningful attempts to fix the system. Even if they don\u2019t work as advertised, hopefully the establishment will take notes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reddit Limits Noxious Content by Giving Trolls Fewer Places to Gather", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThere are \u2014 and always have been, and probably always will be \u2014 trolls, scoundrels and reprobates on the internet.It is a problem that has vexed multibillion-dollar corporations and the smartest computer programmers in the world. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all declared war on abuse and harassment, spent years training sophisticated algorithms and hired vast armies of moderators to root out hateful content.And yet, the trolls persist.But what if a better way of combating online toxicity were right under our noses?The researchers analyzed 100 million posts originating on two forums on Reddit, the hugely popular online message board. The forums, r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown, were among several that Reddit administrators banned in 2015 as part of a sitewide crackdown on poisonous behavior. (In case the names weren\u2019t a tipoff, fatpeoplehate was devoted to photos that mocked overweight people, and CoonTown was filled with racist bile.)Researchers generated a list of hateful terms used on the two forums, and tracked the use of those terms across Reddit. They also compared the activity of users who posted hateful terms before the bans with those users\u2019 activity after, to determine whether they had infiltrated other Reddit forums.The goal was to figure out what happened when these toxic communities were shut down. Did the amount of hateful language on Reddit decrease? Did users of hateful forums migrate to other parts of the site? Did any of them change their behavior as a result of the bans?The study found that, to a large extent, the bans worked. Some users who had posted offensive material on the forums that were shut down stopped using Reddit entirely. Of those who continued to use the site, many migrated to other forums, but they did not bring significant amounts of toxic speech with them, and the forums they moved to did not become more hateful as a result of their presence. Over all, the users who stayed on Reddit after the bans took effect decreased their use of hate speech by more than 80 percent.\u201cBy shutting down these echo chambers of hate, Reddit caused the people participating to either leave the site or dramatically change their linguistic behavior,\u201d the researchers wrote.In an interview, two of the researchers who led the study told me that although they had only examined Reddit, their findings might be applicable to social networks like Facebook and Twitter, which tend to enforce their rules against individuals, rather than groups. They also tend to issue bans in a defensive, case-by-case manner, often in response to user-generated reports of bad behavior.But the results of the study suggest that proactively shutting down nodes where hateful activity is concentrated may be more effective.\u201cBanning places where people congregate to engage in certain behaviors makes it harder for them to do so,\u201d said Eshwar Chandrasekharan, a doctoral student at Georgia Tech and the study\u2019s lead author.Eric Gilbert, an associate professor at the University of Michigan and one of the researchers involved in the study, said that Reddit\u2019s approach worked because it had a clear set of targets. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ban people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ban words. They banned the spaces where those words were likely to be written down.\u201dThis is, of course, a small case study \u2014 two Reddit forums out of millions of online spaces where antisocial behavior occurs \u2014 and methods for quantifying hate speech are still imperfect. (This study\u2019s approach would have flagged one user chastising another for using a racist slur as hateful speech, if the slur were repeated as part of the chastising, for example.) The study also did not account for users who left Reddit altogether, some of whom may have continued to use hate speech elsewhere online.As these platforms strategize about how to take on hate speech, it would be smart to study the geography of their networks \u2014 which groups, pages and subcommunities tend to encourage this behavior \u2014 and the effect of closing those spaces, even without a specific violation or report of abusive speech.It might seem odd to focus on a space, rather than on a person or an act. But as the Reddit example shows, the broadest approach is sometimes the right one.An earlier version of the picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to Alexis Ohanian\u2019s role at Reddit.

{"Headline": "The Coming War on Business", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe only time I saw Sam Francis face-to-face \u2014 in the Washington Times cafeteria sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s \u2014 I thought he was a crank, but it\u2019s clear now that he was at that moment becoming one of the most prescient writers of the past 50 years. There\u2019s very little Donald Trump has done or said that Francis didn\u2019t champion a quarter century ago.In a series of essays for conservative magazines like Chronicles, Francis hammered home three key insights. The first was that globalization was screwing Middle America. The Cold War had just ended, capitalism seemed triumphant and the Clinton years seemed to be an era of broad prosperity. But Francis stressed that the service economy was ruining small farms and taking jobs from the working class.His second insight was that the Republican and conservative establishment did not understand what was happening. He railed against the pro-business \u201cEconomic Men\u201d who thought G.D.P. growth could solve the nation\u2019s problems, and the Washington Republicans, who he thought were infected with the values of the educated elites.In 1991, when his political mentor, Pat Buchanan, was contemplating a presidential bid, Francis told him to break with the conservative movement. \u201cThese people are defunct,\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cGo to New Hampshire and call yourself a patriot, a nationalist, an America Firster, but don\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.\u201dHis third insight was that politics was no longer about left versus right. Instead, a series of smaller conflicts \u2014 religious versus secular, nationalist versus globalist, white versus nonwhite \u2014 were all merging into a larger polarity, ruling class versus Middle America.\u201cMiddle American groups are more and more coming to perceive their exploitation at the hands of the dominant elites. The exploitation works on several fronts \u2014 economically, by hypertaxation and the design of a globalized economy dependent on exports and services in place of manufacturing; culturally, by the managed destruction of Middle American norms and institutions; and politically, by the regimentation of Middle Americans under the federal leviathan.\u201dMiddle American voters, he wrote, were stuck without a party, appalled by pro-corporate Republican economic policies on the one hand and liberal cultural radicalism on the other. They swung to whichever party seemed most likely to resist the ruling class, but neither party really provided a solution. \u201cA nationalist reaction is almost inevitable and will probably assume populist form when it arrives. The sooner it comes the better.\u201dFrancis urged Buchanan to run an unorthodox campaign (of the sort Trump ended up running), and was ignored. \u201cIf Buchanan loses the nomination, it will be because his time has not yet come,\u201d Francis wrote. The moment would end up coming in 2016, 11 years after Francis\u2019 death.Francis\u2019 thought was infected by the same cancer that may destroy Trumpism. Francis was a racist. His friends and allies counseled him not to express his racist views openly, but people like that always go there, sooner or later.The Civil War was an open wound for many in his circle, and in 1994 Francis told a conference, \u201cThe civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.\u201dHe was fired by The Washington Times and cast out of the conservative movement by William F. Buckley and others.When you look at today\u2019s world through the prism of Francis\u2019 work, a few things seem clear: Trump is not a one-time phenomenon; the populist tide has been rising for years. His base sticks with him through scandal because it\u2019s not just about him; it\u2019s a movement defined against the so-called ruling class. Congressional Republicans get all tangled on health care and other issues because they don\u2019t understand their voters. Finally, Trump may not be the culmination, but merely a way station toward an even purer populism.Trump is nominally pro-business. The next populism will probably take his ethnic nationalism and add an anti-corporate, anti-tech layer. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple stand for everything Francis hated \u2014 economically, culturally, demographically and nationalistically.As the tech behemoths intrude more deeply into daily life and our very minds, they will become a defining issue in American politics. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a new demagogue emerged, one that is even more pure Francis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fake Americans Russia Created to Influence the Election", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes an international offensive begins with a few shots that draw little notice. So it was last year when Melvin Redick of Harrisburg, Pa., a friendly-looking American with a backward baseball cap and a young daughter, posted on Facebook a link to a brand-new website.\u201cThese guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US,\u201d he wrote on June 8, 2016. \u201cVisit #DCLeaks website. It\u2019s really interesting!\u201dMr. Redick turned out to be a remarkably elusive character. No Melvin Redick appears in Pennsylvania records, and his photos seem to be borrowed from an unsuspecting Brazilian. But this fictional concoction has earned a small spot in history: The Redick posts that morning were among the first public signs of an unprecedented foreign intervention in American democracy.The DCLeaks site had gone live a few days earlier, posting the first samples of material, stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers, that would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into the Trump presidency. The site\u2019s phony promoters were in the vanguard of a cyberarmy of counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts, a legion of Russian-controlled impostors whose operations are still being unraveled.The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Mrs. Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia\u2019s experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the American companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda.On Twitter, as on Facebook, Russian fingerprints are on hundreds or thousands of fake accounts that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages. Many were automated Twitter accounts, called bots, that sometimes fired off identical messages seconds apart \u2014 and in the exact alphabetical order of their made-up names, according to the FireEye researchers. On Election Day, for instance, they found that one group of Twitter bots sent out the hashtag #WarAgainstDemocrats more than 1,700 times.The Russian efforts were sometimes crude or off-key, with a trial-and-error feel, and many of the suspect posts were not widely shared. The fakery may have added only modestly to the din of genuine American voices in the pre-election melee, but it helped fuel a fire of anger and suspicion in a polarized country.Given the powerful role of social media in political contests, understanding the Russian efforts will be crucial in preventing or blunting similar, or more sophisticated, attacks in the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 presidential election. Multiple government agencies have investigated the Russian attack, though it remains unclear whether any agency is focused specifically on tracking foreign intervention in social media. Both Facebook and Twitter say they are studying the 2016 experience and how to defend against such meddling.Critics say that because shareholders judge the companies partly based on a crucial data point \u2014 \u201cmonthly active users\u201d \u2014 they are reluctant to police their sites too aggressively for fear of reducing that number. The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites \u2014 328 million users on Twitter, nearly two billion on Facebook \u2014 means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints.Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a \u201ctrends\u201d list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a \u201cbot cancer eroding trust on their platforms.\u201d But he added that while Facebook \u201chas begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,\u201d Twitter has done little and as a result, \u201cbots have only spread since the election.\u201dAsked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company\u2019s measures. But it declared that Twitter\u2019s \u201copen and real-time nature is a powerful antidote\u201d to falsehoods.\u201cThis is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.\u201dRussia has been quite open about playing its hacking card. In February last year, at a conference in Moscow, a top cyberintelligence adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin hinted that Russia was about to unleash a devastating information attack on the United States.\u201cIP addresses can be simply made up,\u201d Mr. Putin said, referring to Internet protocol addresses, which can identify particular computers. \u201cThere are such IT specialists in the world today, and they can arrange anything and then blame it on whomever. This is no proof.\u201dThe trail that leads from the Russian operation to the bogus Melvin Redick, however, is fairly clear. United States intelligence concluded that DCLeaks.com was created in June 2016 by the Russian military intelligence agency G.R.U. The site began publishing an eclectic collection of hacked emails, notably from George Soros, the financier and Democratic donor, as well as a former NATO commander and some Democratic and Republican staffers. Some of the website\u2019s language \u2014 calling Mrs. Clinton \u201cPresident of the Democratic Party\u201d and referring to her \u201celectional staff\u201d \u2014 seemed to belie its pose as a forum run by American activists.DCLeaks would soon be followed by a blog called Guccifer 2.0, which would leave even more clues of its Russian origin. Those sites\u2019 posts, however, would then be dwarfed by those from WikiLeaks, which American officials believe got thousands of Democratic emails from Russian intelligence hackers through an intermediary. At each stage, a chorus of dubious Facebook and Twitter accounts \u2014 alongside many legitimate ones \u2014 would applaud the leaks.During its first weeks online, DCLeaks drew no media attention. But The Times found that some Facebook users somehow discovered the new site quickly and began promoting it on June 8. One was the Redick account, which posted about DCLeaks to the Facebook groups \u201cWorld News Headlines\u201d and \u201cBreaking News \u2014 World.\u201dThe Redick profile lists Central High School in Philadelphia and Indiana University of Pennsylvania as his alma maters; neither has any record of his attendance. In one of his photos, this purported Pennsylvania lifer is sitting in a restaurant in Brazil \u2014 and in another, his daughter\u2019s bedroom appears to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. His posts were never personal, just news articles reflecting a pro-Russian worldview.The same morning, \u201cKatherine Fulton\u201d also began promoting DCLeaks in the same awkward English Mr. Redick used. \u201cHey truth seekers!\u201d she wrote. \u201cWho can tell me who are #DCLeaks? Some kind of Wikileaks? You should visit their website, it contains confidential information about our leaders such as Hillary Clinton, and others http://dcleaks.com/.\u201dSo did \u201cAlice Donovan,\u201d who pointed to documents from Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations that she said showed its pro-American tilt and \u2014 in rather formal language for Facebook \u2014 \u201cdescribe eventual means and plans of supporting opposition movements, groups or individuals in various countries.\u201dMight Mr. Redick, Ms. Fulton, Ms. Donovan and others be real Americans who just happened to notice DCLeaks the same day? No. The Times asked Facebook about these and a half-dozen other accounts that appeared to be Russian creations. The company carried out its standard challenge procedure by asking the users to establish their bona fides. All the suspect accounts failed and were removed from Facebook.On Twitter, meanwhile, hundreds of accounts were busy posting anti-Clinton messages and promoting the leaked material obtained by Russian hackers. Investigators for FireEye spent months reviewing Twitter accounts associated with certain online personas, posing as activists, that seemed to show the Russian hand: DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, Anonymous Poland and several others. FireEye concluded that they were associated with one another and with Russian hacking groups, including APT28 or Fancy Bear, which American intelligence blames for the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails.Some accounts, the researchers found, showed clear signs of intermittent human control. But most displayed the rote behavior of automated Twitter bots, which send out tweets according to built-in instructions.The researchers discovered long lists of bot accounts that sent out identical messages within seconds or minutes of one another, firing in alphabetical order. The researchers coined the term \u201cwarlist\u201d for them. On Election Day, one such list cited leaks from Anonymous Poland in more than 1,700 tweets. Snippets of them provide a sample of the sequence:@edanur01 #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54@efekinoks #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54@elyashayk #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54@emrecanbalc #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55@emrullahtac #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55Ms. Usedom had no idea that her account had been commandeered by anti-Clinton propagandists. \u201cI was shocked and slightly confused when I found out,\u201d she said.Notably, the warlist tweets often included the Twitter handles of users whose attention the senders wanted to catch \u2014 news organizations, journalists, government agencies and politicians, including @realDonaldTrump. By targeting such opinion-shapers, Mr. Foster said, the creators of the warlists clearly wanted to stir up conversation about the leaked material.Mr. Trump \u201creceived more direct replies than anyone else,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cClearly this was an effort to influence Donald Trump. They know he reads tweets.\u201dThe suspected Russian operators at times lacked sophistication. \u201cThey are not always Americanophiles who know every nuance of U.S. politics,\u201d said Mr. Foster, the FireEye researcher.For instance, last October, hundreds of Anonymous Poland Twitter accounts posted a forged letter on the stationery of the conservative Bradley Foundation, based in Milwaukee, purporting to show that it had donated $150 million to the Clinton campaign. The foundation denied any such contribution, which would have been illegal and, given its political leaning, highly unlikely.Only a small fraction of all the suspect social media accounts active during the election have been studied by investigators. But there is ample reason to suspect that the Russian meddling may have been far more widespread.Several activists who ran Facebook pages for Bernie Sanders, for instance, noticed a suspicious flood of hostile comments about Mrs. Clinton after Mr. Sanders had already ended his campaign and endorsed her.John Mattes, who ran the \u201cSan Diego for Bernie Sanders\u201d page, said he saw a shift from familiar local commenters to newcomers, some with Eastern European names \u2014 including four different accounts using the name \u201cOliver Mitov.\u201d\u201cThose who voted for Bernie, will not vote for corrupt Hillary!\u201d one of the Mitovs wrote on Oct. 7. \u201cThe Revolution must continue! #NeverHillary\u201dWhile he was concerned about being seen as a \u201ccrazy cold warrior,\u201d Mr. Mattes said he came to believe that Russia was the likely source of the anti-Clinton comments. \u201cThe magnitude and viciousness of it \u2014 I would suggest that their fingerprints were on it and no one else had that agenda,\u201d he said.Both on the left and the pro-Trump right, though, some skeptics complain that Moscow has become the automatic boogeyman, accused of misdeeds with little proof. Even those who track Russian online activity admit that in the election it was not always easy to sort out who was who.\u201cYes, the Russians were involved. Yes, there\u2019s a lot of organic support for Trump,\u201d said Andrew Weisburd, an Illinois online researcher who has written frequently about Russian influence on social media. \u201cTrying to disaggregate the two was difficult, to put it mildly.\u201dMr. Weisburd said he had labeled some Twitter accounts \u201cKremlin trolls\u201d based simply on their pro-Russia tweets and with no proof of Russian government ties. The Times contacted several such users, who insisted that they had come by their anti-American, pro-Russian views honestly, without payment or instructions from Moscow.Ms. Justice said she had first taken an interest in Russia during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, while looking for hockey coverage and finding what she considered a snide anti-Russia bias in the Western media. She said she did get a lot of news from Sputnik and RT but laughed at the notion that she could have Kremlin connections.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle of information, and I and my peers have decided to take sides,\u201d said Mr. Sardo, who constantly cites Russian sources and bashed Mrs. Clinton daily during the campaign. But he denied he had any links to the Russian government.If that\u2019s so, his prolific posts are a victory for Russia\u2019s information war \u2014 that admirers of the Kremlin spread what American officials consider to be Russian disinformation on election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and more.\u201cListen, does it even matter who hacked this data?\u201d he said, in a point that Mr. Trump has sometimes echoed. \u201cThe important thing is the content that was given to the public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Internet-Famous Cookie Worthy of Baking in Real Life", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast fall, an aberrant chocolate chip cookie turned up in my Instagram feed. As wide as a salad plate and flat as a flounder, it appeared thin, but it was somehow layered with slabs of chocolate. Oddest of all, it was ringed, like a tree trunk \u2014 as if a chunk of chocolate had been dropped in the center and somehow made waves out to the edges. I assumed it was a mutant, posted by a troubled baker as a cry for help, and I kept scrolling.\u201cIt\u2019s all in the pan-bang,\u201d she said.Here\u2019s how it works: After the cookies have risen a bit in the hot oven, she pulls out the cookie sheet and bangs it hard on top of the stove, or on the oven rack. Just as a half-done cake falls in the center when bumped, the middle of the cookie collapses, pushing barely-baked dough out to the edges. She returns the pan to the oven and, at intervals, repeats the process, building up the crinkled rim that makes it possible to have both soft and crunchy textures in a single cookie. It is, I can attest, a leap forward in cookie technology.It\u2019s not clear even to Ms. Kieffer how the pan-bang came to her. But as a trained baker, she had the skills to develop a recipe around it that maximizes the ripple effect: making the cookies very large, chilling the dough balls before baking and using chopped chocolate instead of chips.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a better chocolate chip cookie,\u201d said Ms. Kieffer, who makes and posts the cookies often, usually generating over 2,000 \u201clikes\u201d for each image. \u201cBut you never know what someone else will think of.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will the Trump Era Transform the School Lunch?", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cYour dedication and creativity was being stifled,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. \u201cYou were forced to focus your attention on strict, inflexible rules handed down from Washington. Even worse, you experienced firsthand that the rules were failing.\u201dMr. Perdue then outlined how his department was loosening some of those rules. He finished with a folksy story about a child who asked whether Mr. Perdue could make school lunches great again.Some in the audience cheered. Some walked out. School food was not going to escape the sharp political divisions that began to simmer in the Obama years and have been laid bare by the election of President Trump.As a new school year begins, many Americans are wondering what lies ahead. Will Mr. Perdue\u2019s promises have an impact? Will the Obama-era changes be rolled back? And just what will children be eating this year?That\u2019s why, in part, Mr. Perdue\u2019s comments about local control resonated the loudest: Many districts are already improving school meals without federal intervention.\u201cAll the conversations about school meals have been unnecessarily polarized,\u201d said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokeswoman for the School Nutrition Association, an advocacy organization that represents 57,000 school-food professionals and counts many of the country\u2019s largest food companies among its supporters. \u201cPeople in every district are really dedicated to making sure kids are getting the healthiest food possible.\u201dCertainly, what a healthful school meal looks like varies tremendously, depending on geography and one\u2019s definition of health. With more than 30 million lunches being served every day, the taste and quality can hinge on something as simple as the attitude of a principal or a lack of proper kitchen equipment. Large, urban schools face different challenges from small rural ones. Some people see nothing wrong with serving breaded chicken strips. Others have tried to eliminate them completely.Still, by most accounts, school lunches in America are better than they have been in decades. Cooking from scratch is on the rise, salad bars have been added to tens of thousands of schools and a federally supported farm-to-school program is operating in 42,500 schools.Many questions remain, though. Here are answers to a few:Has the Trump administration begun to dismantle the Obama initiatives?\u201cWhat he said didn\u2019t change anything, honestly,\u201d Ms. Hayes said.The changes fall into three areas. The first involves how much whole grain the federal government requires in school meals that qualify for at least some federal reimbursement. Under rules set by the Obama administration, buns, pasta and other foods made from grain must be at least half whole grain. Districts can apply for exceptions, which are especially popular with regional foods that are traditionally made with white flour.\u201cIn the South, they are very worried about biscuits,\u201d Ms. Hayes said. \u201cIn areas with large Asian populations, they are really worried about brown rice. In the Northeast, they are worried about bagels.\u201d Whole-wheat tortillas are troublesome because they tend to crack when folded. \u201cAnd everyone had a problem with pasta,\u201d Ms. Pratt-Heavner said.The Trump administration measures merely allow districts more time to apply for exemptions, although Mr. Perdue indicated that more changes could be in store.Milk is another point of contention. The Obama-era rules allowed milk with 1 percent fat, but said flavored milk must be nonfat. Mr. Perdue\u2019s change allows schools to serve flavored milk with 1 percent fat. But cafeteria administrators say 1 percent flavored milk isn\u2019t readily available because dairy processors have already geared up to make milk in school-size containers based on the Obama regulations. Besides, they say, children have become used to nonfat chocolate milk.The third, and perhaps most significant, change slows the imposition of new requirements that would have greatly limited salt. Districts still have to reduce sodium, but not as aggressively \u2014 a move that has won widespread support.That all sounds pretty abstract. So what are school meals like these days?To a large degree, today\u2019s school food closely mimics the fare that children have grown up eating in restaurants. It is engineered for a generation of young eaters who are more sophisticated about food than ever before.Students are increasingly viewed as customers to be wooed rather than as participants to be counted for federal reimbursement. As a result, food is fresher, and more children are being introduced to a wider range of fruits and vegetables and foods prepared from scratch.Customization is big, so children are moving through cafeteria lines that mirror the kind of build-your-own-meal approach at Chipotle or Sweetgreen. Some schools are experimenting with ordering food through apps; others serve made-to-order subs, tacos and noodle bowls. Spice and sauce bars are popular, and precooked meals, while still predominate, seem to be losing popularity as even the largest districts begin to make their own pizza dough, salad dressings and sauces.School districts in California have taken over farms, and are growing enough tomatoes to make their own pizza sauce. Alaska pollock is being paired with grits in Greenville, S.C. In Waynesboro, Ga., local grain is being milled into flour for whole-wheat baked goods.Companies that supply processed food have started to improve their offerings as well, using fewer artificial flavorings and colors, more grass-fed beef and chicken raised without antibiotics. Baked goods are being developed with whole-grain flour that looks and tastes more like white flour but meets the federal requirements.International dishes are becoming more popular \u2014 a reflection of changing demographics, the popularity of TV food shows and a generation of parents who have broadened their children\u2019s palates. Think Thai-style fish tacos, spicy Korean barbecue and tikka masala.How much can schools rely on the federal government to improve food?Not as much as they once did. The game is local now, with newly empowered chefs and parents joining in.Ann Cooper, the food service director for Boulder Valley Schools, in Colorado, calls herself \u201cthe renegade lunch lady.\u201d She\u2019s not hopeful that free school lunches and other food programs for the poor will get additional money under the Trump administration. In fact, their budgets will most likely be cut.\u201cIf we want to see changes happen, they are going to come out of public-private partnerships or foundations and N.G.O.s,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need to take matters into their own hands.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get people to move from nuggets and Tater Tots to roast chicken,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cWe can spend our time counting the grain in a chicken nugget as part of the whole-grain federal mandate, but should we even be talking about chicken nuggets?\u201dThe issue has revived discussions about tying school food to curriculums and providing free school meals to all children. The idea is that the money saved from the mountain of paperwork and the complex payment systems a district must maintain to get federal reimbursement could be better spent on the actual meal.Are other changes simmering in Washington?The biggest school-food issues at the moment are proposed cuts to the Department of Agriculture budget and a battle over the new Farm Bill.A number of congressional hearings on elements of the Farm Bill that could affect school nutrition are scheduled for October. Although leaders from both parties hope to pass a substantially leaner bill by the end of the year, the prospects are good that the matter will roll into 2018.The Trump administration has also called for a 21 percent cut to the Department of Agriculture budget, which could severely curtail school food funding and individual programs that pay for new kitchen equipment and fresh, local fruit and vegetables.Advertisement"}

Mr. Wieser is one of two analysts with a \u201csell\u201d rating on Facebook shares, compared to 42 \u201cbuy\u201d recommendations and three \u201chold\u201d ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Facebook said on Wednesday that the numbers are not designed to match census and population estimates, noting its figures are self-reported by users and include non-residents. The estimates are based on \u201cFacebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices, and other factors,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThey are designed to estimate how many people in a given area are eligible to see an ad a business might run.\u201dThis latest flare-up underscores why publishers and ad agencies have been pushing for more accountability and oversight of tech companies like Facebook and Google by outside companies, said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a small media company or small seller of advertising that has a gap in their numbers,\u201d Mr. Kint said. \u201cThis is one half of what we call the duopoly that\u2019s capturing most of the growth in the media industry.

{"Headline": "Who\u2019d Create a P.R. Crisis on Purpose? Well, Only the Sweat Was Real", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust as I was stammering out some version of \u201cno comment\u201d to a reporter from BuzzFeed, my editor was about to field a call from The New York Post. Our company\u2019s reputation was careening out of control, and we had no idea how to stop the damage \u2014 or slow the seemingly endless torrent of social media posts that were berating us for our ties to the world\u2019s largest polluter.Thankfully, the situation was entirely fictitious. It was created by a crisis communications firm that regularly simulates dire circumstances for companies in hopes of preparing them for when real public relations disasters hit. The setup is a bit like \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d for corporate America, where the adventure is in fact a social-media-driven nightmare.As social media makes these moments ricochet around the web like never before, companies are realizing they don\u2019t have the luxury of calmly sitting back, assessing the situation and then deciding on a solution. They need to be ready before it happens.And that\u2019s the purpose of exercises like this. CommCore Consulting Group agreed to come up with a situation that would give us a sense of what it\u2019s like to be in the middle of a corporate crisis. The firm would provide the story line, play characters like inquiring reporters and angry protesters, and provide supporting material like social media posts and published articles, all designed to make us feel increasingly panicked. We would supply the sweaty palms.The goal is to give companies a better understanding of what they may face and how they should respond. Even if, like me, you mismanage the situation so badly that it ends with a video of a masked hacker growling out his plans to destroy your company.I sat with my editor and a photographer in a small, glass-walled conference room. For this exercise, we were pretending that we worked on the business side of The New York Times.In less than five minutes on the job, things went seriously awry. One of the newspaper\u2019s biggest institutional investors had become the largest shareholder in a company that was the world\u2019s biggest polluter, and the connection was drawing attention. A prominent blog proclaimed that The Times was \u201cexchanging blood money for ink,\u201d and a video from a major environmental group called on our organization to cut ties with the investor.Now, the three crisis consultants across the table told us, we had to figure out what to do.\u201cThe whole goal is faster reaction time, faster recognition of the issues and hopefully faster getting the issues off the front page or out of social media,\u201d said Andrew D. Gilman, CommCore\u2019s chief executive, who has consulted with the likes of Johnson & Johnson and General Motors during crises.At the same time, creating a realistic P.R. issue for a company to navigate \u2014 or, in our case, hobble through \u2014 is its own challenge. After all, clients weren\u2019t concerned about being mentioned in a tweet from the president a year ago, Mr. Gilman said. And last month, the consulting group added the possibility of being tied to white supremacists to its list of risks.On a whiteboard, we had scrawled out the key issues at stake and a list of employees we needed to loop in about the burgeoning situation. It\u2019s trickier than it appears: Too many people can complicate decisions about who\u2019s doing what; too few and you risk not being able to adequately respond to issues as they appear.The story had been picked up by financial news sites like The Motley Fool and environmental groups that were angrily posting to their Facebook and Twitter pages. There was even a nascent petition on Change.org.Just as that was sinking in, two reporters from national outlets called. How was The Times going to respond to this outcry? I fended them off in a panic, saying that we didn\u2019t have a comment yet. I couldn\u2019t consult with my editor, who was on the phone with a member of the investor\u2019s P.R. staff.The simulation blended fact and fiction to make it feel more realistic. The materials included articles and social media posts, complete with pre-filmed videos, designed to look as if they had come from real publications and environmental groups. Two of the consultants had left the room to make the reporter calls to our cellphones, timing them so that we had trouble coordinating our responses.Often, the companies doing these drills involve a variety of departments, such as legal, information technology and investor relations, in hopes that they know how to work together if a crisis does hit.The crisis was designed by Dale Weiss, whom Mr. Gilman referred to as something of a \u201cmad scientist\u201d when devising each round of facts. Mr. Weiss likened the pace to cooking a frog.\u201cIf you put them in a hot pot, they\u2019re going to jump right out, but if you take a frog and slowly create a nice little hot tub environment, he\u2019ll stay in and finally boil,\u201d Mr. Weiss explained, a little too gleefully. We were the frogs.By now, we had issued a brief statement and linked to it on Twitter. But then, a huge poison gas leak hit one of the polluting company\u2019s major factories, forcing thousands of people to evacuate and injuring many others. A video news report about the disaster included coverage of our newspaper\u2019s ties to the polluter through our institutional investor, and noted the growing controversy.Our newsroom was covering the disaster aggressively, activists were planning to picket outside our annual shareholder meeting and, somehow, the polluter claimed we were blocking its requests to run a full-page ad in the paper. This was all playing out on social media, and people were calling for boycotts of The Times.There were so many outlets, advocacy groups and internal stakeholders to respond to that it was hard to keep them straight \u2014 and the list of options we could use to respond was similarly lengthy. Post a statement through a series of tweets? Put screenshots of a longer statement on social media? Film a YouTube video? Arrange an interview of our top executives with a journalist we trust? With each question, the room seemed to get a little hotter.Ideally, a company would have different contingency plans set up for various possibilities, along with a set list of employees who would handle them.\u201cThere might be holding statements about your investments, your manufacturing facilities, about your people, that you can pull from and take pieces so you\u2019re not having to create it at the very last minute,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Mr. Gilman added, \u201cSeveral of our clients have war rooms where they want to be ready just in case there\u2019s a Trump tweet, and in the same kind of way, if it\u2019s an agency or a company that\u2019s advertising a ton or any other business, they want to be prepared.\u201dThat sort of thinking could have helped United Airlines respond more quickly to the video of the passenger\u2019s removal. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of crisis plans,\u201d Mr. Gilman said, \u201cbut mostly about aircraft crashing, not a customer issue like that.\u201dNobody cared that our company wasn\u2019t responsible for the actions of an investor, but it turned out that was part of the training as well.\u201cYou\u2019re a public company. People buy your stock,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cStuff happens. Companies don\u2019t do anything wrong \u2014 they do what they\u2019re supposed to do \u2014 and yet you get hit by this firestorm of stuff.\u201dAs the crisis worsened, three prominent reporters and columnists quit the newspaper, citing its ties to the problematic investor. A major environmental group sold its shares in The Times and urged other groups to follow, saying the impartiality of our reporting couldn\u2019t be guaranteed. The Change.org petition had amassed thousands of signatures, and the boycott was expanding.And just as we were reeling from all of this, here came the grand finale: a video from a masked hacker speaking in a low, distorted voice. He praised the boycott efforts by environmental groups and delivered a grim message. Based on the investment connection, we were told, a group of concerned hackers planned to use a virus to wreak havoc on our facilities so long as The Times kept exchanging \u201cblood money for ink.\u201d He proclaimed the group would keep fighting for the environment, ending with: \u201cWe\u2019re also doing this because we can.\u201dStunned silence followed. Then our photographer, Sam, piped up. \u201cDo we bring the F.B.I. in?\u201dDespite any pressure we may have felt during the simulation, we had the luxury of going back to our actual jobs when it was over. But the quick escalation of the disaster and criticism from all sides made it clear why companies are paranoid about ending up in that kind of situation \u2014 even without an ominous video from a hacker \u2014 and why they feel the need to plan.\u201cYou can\u2019t prevent any crisis from happening,\u201d Mr. Gilman said. \u201cBut you can shorten the duration, you can lessen the impact and do better preparation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wheaton College Football Players Charged With Violent Hazing Attack", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive football players at Wheaton College, an evangelical school in Illinois, were charged with a string of felonies on Tuesday in connection with what prosecutors said was a hazing episode in 2016 in which another student was bound, beaten and left half-naked on a baseball field in the middle of the night.Paul Darrah, a spokesman for the DuPage County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, said arrest warrants had been issued for the five suspects: James W. Cooksey, Kyler S. Kregel, Benjamin W. Pettway, Noah R. Spielman and Samuel J. TeBos.Mr. Darrah said the suspects were charged with a range of crimes including mob action, unlawful restraint and aggravated battery, which is the most serious charge and carries a potential penalty of two to five years in prison.Mr. Cooksey, Mr. Pettway and Mr. TeBos did not respond to voice mail messages seeking comment on Tuesday. Phone calls to Mr. Spielman and Mr. Kregel were not answered, and Mr. Kregel did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mike Swider, who is the head coach and has worked on the Wheaton coaching staff for 33 years, also did not respond to an email seeking comment.The victim, whose name prosecutors did not release, provided a statement about the episode through his lawyer, Terry A. Ekl. In the statement, he accused the suspects of abducting him from a dorm room on March 19, 2016; wrapping duct tape around his arms, legs and chest; and transporting him in a vehicle to a baseball field. On the way there, he said, they beat him; partly stripped him; threatened to rape him; tried to sodomize him with an unidentified object; and took his phone, wallet and one shoe. They then dumped him half-naked in the field shortly before midnight, he said.During the assault the assailants played Middle Eastern music on their car radio, put on fake Middle Eastern accents and threatened to rape him, the victim said. His lawyer said the victim was not Muslim or of Middle Eastern descent and he believed that the assailants pretended to be Middle Eastern to \u201cscare\u201d the victim.\u201cWe have all seen situations where young men engage in foolish and immature conduct,\u201d Mr. Ekl said. \u201cWhat was done to our client in this case is far beyond what is acceptable behavior or which can be dismissed as merely harmless hazing.\u201dAfter the assault, the victim made his way back to campus and called his mother, who arranged for him to meet his grandparents at a nearby hospital. Emergency room staff members there called the police and conducted a rape test, which concluded that he had not been penetrated, his statement said.The victim said the assault caused \u201ca tremendous amount of pain\u201d and left him with labral tears in both shoulders that required surgery. The day after the attack, his father moved his belongings out of his dorm and he now attends a college in Indiana, Mr. Ekl said.\u201cThis has had a devastating effect on my life,\u201d the victim said in a statement. \u201cWhat was done to me should never occur in connection with participation in a football program or any other activity.\u201d\u201cI am confident that the criminal prosecution will provide a fair and just punishment to the men who attacked me,\u201d the victim added.Wheaton College is an evangelical Christian institution in Wheaton, Ill., about 25 miles west of Chicago. The liberal arts college, which has about 2,850 students, describes its mission as providing excellence in Christian education.College administrators were told about the hazing allegations by the coaching staff and members of the football team in March 2016, Ms. Taylor, the college spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday. She declined to say whether the players were taken off the team at that time or to explain why they were on the 2017 team roster.\u201cWheaton College aspires to provide an educational environment that is not only free of hazing, but practices our values as a Christian community,\u201d the statement from the college said. \u201cAs such, we are deeply troubled by the allegations brought by law enforcement against five members of our football team.\u201dAfter an internal investigation, the players were given a \u201crange of corrective actions,\u201d the college said. The school said it was unable to disclose what those correction actions may have been because of federal student privacy protections.The college defended itself against criticism that its actions violated academic freedom or displayed anti-Muslim sentiment. Ms. Hawkins agreed to \u201cpart ways\u201d with Wheaton after the controversy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: What if Legal Pot Costs More Than Black-Market Pot?", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief.California has a marijuana conundrum.As regulators in California prepare for the start of recreational marijuana sales in January, people in the industry say they are concerned that the rollout may not be as smooth as was promised by the promoters of Prop 64, the ballot measure last November that legalized pot.Three years ago, when Colorado began its recreational marijuana program, prices at dispensaries there were significantly lower than the black market, providing an incentive for consumers to join the legal system.The situation is reversed in California. There is so much pot being grown in California that the wholesale price has been falling sharply in recent years and any pot sold on the legal market in January will have the added costs of taxes, fees and mandatory testing for pesticides and other chemicals.Tawnie Logan, chairwoman of the board of the California Growers Association, an advocacy group for small-scale marijuana producers, says the black market price for an eighth of an ounce of marijuana is around $20, compared with $50 in dispensaries.She predicts a bump in legal sales in January when recreational pot goes on sale because of the novelty of being able to buy pot in a store. But that novelty may wear off, she said.\u201cAll of a sudden they are calling their buddy again,\u201d Ms. Logan said, referring to black-market vendors who have thrived in California in recent decades.When regulators are asked how they plan to handle the black market their answer is law enforcement. This may prove difficult in areas of Northern California where pot is central to the local economy.\u201cYou would be turning these law enforcement agencies against their own communities,\u201d said Terry Garrett, a manager at Sustaining Technologies, a marketing company that researches the cannabis market in Sonoma County.\u201cThat\u2019s the conundrum for California.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)With the start of the N.F.L. season, the reality of a Charger-less San Diego is sinking in.The team had been in San Diego more than half a century.Some resolved to put their anger at Mr. Spanos aside and continue to root for the players.

He cited the camaraderie among fans that the Chargers had fostered for decades in San Diego.\u201cA lot of us are suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people in San Diego will never forgive Spanos, never.\u201dWatching the Chargers play the Broncos last week, he had an idea to get back at the team.Just say \u201cSpanos Taco\u201d and pick any taco off the menu.On Monday, a day after the Chargers fell to the Dolphins, the line was out the door all day, Mr. Lopez said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who founded Google, and Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy of Snap are among those who hold a disproportionate share of voting power over their companies.The impetus for the stock reclassification came after Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, his wife, celebrated the birth of their first daughter, Maxima. The couple used the occasion to found the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company that acts as the main vehicle for the couple to give away their wealth over the coming years.\u201cAt the time, I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I thought it was the only way.

Kelly, Democrat of Illinois, sent a letter on Tuesday to Mark Zuckerberg, the C.E.O. of Facebook, expressing concern about the advertising practices of the social media company.\u201cIt is my belief that Facebook cannot be the Trojan horse through which America\u2019s vulnerabilities are exploited,\u201d Ms. Kelly wrote in the letter. \u201cWith the information we now have in tow, you have a moral responsibility to rigorously assess your advertising policies and implement reforms that ensure that malicious actors \u2014 both foreign and domestic \u2014 do not pervert your site to promote a divisive and destabilizing agenda.\u201dA spokesman for Facebook confirmed that the company received Ms. Kelly\u2019s letter and that it was in communication with her office.Ms. Kelly, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee\u2019s subcommittee on information technology, and several of her colleagues contacted Facebook seven days after President Trump\u2019s win in November to express deep concerns about Facebook allowing advertisers to exclude and target ethnic groups.Tuesday\u2019s letter ratchets up their concerns as several social networking sites face scrutiny from Congress and as other Congressional Black Caucus members such as Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, say they worry about Facebook\u2019s role in the election and in allowing users to discriminate online.Representative Cedric L.

You\u2019re not above ordering in, but, given the cost of takeout and the inevitable soggy-steamy contents of the delivered goods, you would prefer to cook something.Delis or butcher shops are more likely to have fresh, house-made sausages. Supermarkets might also have good ones, but many carry those vacuum-packed precooked sausages or ones containing preservatives and \u201cnatural flavorings.\u201d If you like spicy sausages, ask for the hot ones; otherwise get the sweet. The only difference is the addition of crushed red pepper.Now, as for how to cook the sausages, there are many methods. Some people prefer to cook them in a frying pan over medium heat, turning them every few minutes and letting them brown slowly, or to roast them in a medium oven. However, to get the meal on the table quickly, I like to simmer them gently for about five minutes, then let them steep in the pot off the heat. This ensures they will be fully cooked. Then, I briefly brown them in a skillet. Whatever way you cook yours, be sure to prick them all over with a skewer first, to prevent them from breaking open. A burst sausage, while edible, always looks sad.I can\u2019t resist adding a sunny-side-up egg, fried in olive oil, to complement the sausage and peppers and to add richness.

And she expressed uncertainty about why Muslims might be fleeing the country, even as she sidestepped evidence of widespread abuses by the security forces by saying there had been \u201callegations and counter-allegations.\u201dHer speech was remarkably similar in language to that of the generals who had locked her up for the better part of two decades, in the process making her a political legend: the regal prisoner of conscience who vanquished the military with no weapons but her principles.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the assassinated independence hero Aung San, who founded the modern Burmese Army. She is a member of the country\u2019s elite, from the highest class of the ethnic Bamar Buddhist majority.Officials in her government have accused the Rohingya, who have suffered decades of persecution and have been mostly stripped of their citizenship, of faking rape and burning their own houses in a bid to hijack international public opinion. She has done nothing to correct the record.A Facebook page associated with her office suggested that international aid groups were colluding with Rohingya militants, whose attack on Myanmar police posts and an army base precipitated the fierce military counteroffensive. In a statement, her government labeled the insurgent strikes \u201cbrutal acts of terrorism.\u201dDuring her address, made from a vast convention center in Naypyidaw, Myanmar\u2019s capital, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi tried to evoke a program of grand goals including democratic transition, peace, stability and development.But she also cautioned that the country\u2019s long experience with authoritarian rule and nearly seven decades of ethnic conflict in Myanmar\u2019s frontier lands have frayed national unity.\u201cPeople expect us to overcome all these challenges in as short a time as possible,\u201d she said, noting that her civilian government only took office last year. \u201cEighteen months is a very short time in which to expect us to meet and overcome all the challenges that we are facing.\u201dMyanmar\u2019s generals \u2014 who ruled the country for nearly half a century and turned a resource-rich land also known as Burma into an economic failure \u2014 stage-managed every facet of the political transition. The Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar Army is known, kept the most important levers of power for itself.It also effectively relegated Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to the post of state counselor by designing a Constitution that kept her from the presidency.\u201cIt\u2019s always a dance with the generals,\u201d said U Win Htein, an N.L.D. party elder and former military officer, who served alongside some of the Tatmadaw\u2019s highest-ranking generals.He warned that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had to placate an army with a history of pushing aside civilian leaders under the pretext of defending national sovereignty.\u201cThe army, they are watching her every word,\u201d he said. \u201cOne misstep on the Muslim issue, and they can make their move.\u201dYet even before the compromises that accompanied her ascension to power, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was already distancing herself from the hopes invested in her by the rest of the world.Such a recasting of her role has disappointed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureates. In an open letter, Desmond Tutu, the South African former archbishop, advised his \u201cdearly beloved younger sister\u201d that \u201cif the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep.\u201dMuhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi social entrepreneur and recipient of the prize in 2006, was more pointed.\u201cShe should not have received a Nobel Peace Prize if she says, sorry, I\u2019m a politician, and the norms of democracy don\u2019t suit me,\u201d he said in a telephone interview with The New York Times. \u201cThe whole world stood by her for decades, but today she has become the mirror image of Aung San Suu Kyi by destroying human rights and denying citizenship to the Rohingya.\u201d\u201cAll we can do,\u201d he said, \u201cis pray for the return of the old Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201dBeyond her personal legacy, the direction of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s leadership carries global consequence.\u201cThis is a democratic moment, and she represents Burma\u2019s democratic promise,\u201d said Derek Mitchell, the former American ambassador to Myanmar. \u201cThe country sits at the crossroads of Asia in a region where democracy is in retreat, which makes Burma\u2019s success even more important.\u201dIn Tuesday\u2019s speech, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, acknowledged the state of democracy in her country.\u201cWe are a young and fragile democracy facing many problems,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have to cope with them all at the same time.\u201dBut she also stressed that \u201cmore than 50 percent\u201d of Rohingya villages in Myanmar\u2019s western state of Rakhine remained \u201cintact.\u201d And she seemed to borrow vocabulary from a self-help manual when she described the need to research why certain villages had not been touched by the violence.\u201cWe have to remove the negative and increase the positive,\u201d she said.Through all of the current Rohingya crisis, and a series of military offensives against other ethnic armed groups, she has publicly supported the military.\u201cWe do not have any trust in Aung San Suu Kyi because she was born into the military,\u201d said Hkapra Hkun Awng, a leader of the Kachin ethnic group from northern Myanmar, one of more than a dozen minorities whose rebel armies have fought the Tatmadaw over the decades. \u201cShe is more loyal to her own people than to the ethnics. Her blood is thicker than a promise of national reconciliation.\u201dEven before the mudslinging of the 2015 election campaign, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was sidestepping questions about the sectarian violence in Rakhine that disproportionately affected the Rohingya. Rather than condemning pogroms against the persecuted Muslim minority, she has dismissed accusations of ethnic cleansing and called, instead, for rule of law to solve any problem.Because most Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship by the military, it has not been clear how any laws might apply to them. Even though Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said Tuesday that Myanmar was prepared to repatriate refugees who can establish that they are residents of Myanmar, that may be a formidable task for people who are unlikely to have documents proving that.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has largely shielded herself from the media and has holed up in the capital. Although a year ago, as the nation\u2019s new civilian leader, she attended the United Nations General Assembly, and was celebrated by world leaders, this year she chose not to attend, avoiding criticism of her stance on the Rohingya.Several heads of state who spoke on the General Assembly\u2019s first day of speeches on Tuesday in New York assailed Myanmar for the Rohingya crackdown, with some describing it as an anti-Muslim atrocity.The president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, whose country\u2019s population of nearly 200 million is nearly half Muslim, said \u201cthe Myanmar crisis is very reminiscent of what happened in Bosnia in 1995 and in Rwanda in 1994.\u201d The president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country is majority Muslim and who spoke with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi recently, said the Rohingya had been \u201csubjected to almost an ethnic cleansing, with provocative terrorist acts used as a pretext.\u201dMs. Aung San Suu Kyi is attuned enough to public sentiment to understand the deep reservoir of anti-Muslim sentiment in Myanmar. If anything, her equivocations on the Rohingya have given currency to the widely held assumption in Myanmar that they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who have occupied land that rightfully belongs to the Burmese.Since Myanmar\u2019s political transition began, a virulent strain of Buddhist extremism has pushed such attitudes further into the mainstream. Influential monks have preached anti-Muslim rhetoric and pushed successfully for a law that circumscribes interfaith marriage.\u201cBuddhist nationalist radicalism has been allowed to spread basically unchecked,\u201d said Min Zin, the executive director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy Myanmar. \u201cThe government is doing very little to stop it.\u201dSaw Nang contributed reporting from Naypyidaw, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samantha Power: Why Foreign Propaganda Is More Dangerous Now", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewWhen George Washington gave his Farewell Address in 1796, he urged the American people \u201cto be constantly awake\u201d to the risk of foreign influence. In the wake of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 United States election, the president\u2019s warning has a fresh, chilling resonance.The debate in the United States about foreign interference concentrates on who did what to influence last year\u2019s election and the need for democracies to strengthen their cybersecurity for emails, critical infrastructure and voting platforms. But we need to pay far more attention to another vulnerability: our adversaries\u2019 attempts to subvert our democratic processes by aiming falsehoods at ripe subsets of our population \u2014 and not only during elections.In the Cold War era, Soviet attempts to meddle in American democracy were largely unsuccessful. In 1982 Yuri Andropov, then the K.G.B. chairman, told Soviet foreign intelligence officers to incorporate disinformation operations \u2014 the so-called active measures meant to discredit adversaries and influence public opinion \u2014 into their standard work. They had an ambitious aim: preventing Ronald Reagan\u2019s re-election.Soviet agents were instructed to infiltrate party and campaign staffs in the United States in search of embarrassing information to leak to the press, while Soviet propagandists pushed a set of anti-Reagan story lines to the Western media. Ultimately, they failed to influence the election. President Reagan defeated Walter F. Mondale, winning 49 states. Margaret Thatcher, who was similarly targeted, also won re-election in a landslide.What exactly has changed since then to make foreign propaganda far more dangerous today?During the Cold War, most Americans received their news and information via mediated platforms. Reporters and editors serving in the role of professional gatekeepers had almost full control over what appeared in the media. A foreign adversary seeking to reach American audiences did not have great options for bypassing these umpires, and Russian dezinformatsia rarely penetrated.After the election, around 84 percent of Americans polled by Pew described themselves as at least somewhat confident in their ability to discern real news from fake. This confidence may be misplaced.Russia has keenly exploited our growing reliance on new media \u2014 and the absence of real umpires. Last year the Russian government supplemented the growing reach of its state-owned, English-language media outlets \u2014 RT and Sputnik \u2014 by employing a network of trolls, bots and thousands of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts that amplified damaging stories on Hillary Clinton.In the United States, the vulnerability to foreign influence is exacerbated by divisions within the political establishment. During the Cold War, the larger struggle against communism created a mainstream consensus about what America stood for and against. Today, our society appears to be defined by a particularly vicious form of \u201cpartyism\u201d affecting Democrats and Republicans alike. This divisive environment can make the media more susceptible to repeating and amplifying falsehoods.Because of the attention to last year\u2019s Russian election meddling, there is a risk that going forward we will be inclined to \u201cfight the last war\u201d \u2014 mobilizing our defenses with a focus on Russia or on the next election cycle. But we must be on our guard toward all adversaries at all times.The bipartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy, meanwhile, has begun tracking and exposing Russia\u2019s extensive disinformation efforts in the here and now.For example, the alliance documented how on the same day in August when Mr. Trump signed a bill imposing significant sanctions on Russia, the top story promoted by Russian-associated Twitter accounts concerned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s links to foreign arms sales. More recently, the alliance showed how Russia-linked accounts promoted alt-right conspiracies about the violence in Charlottesville, Va., as well as stories that slammed those \u2014 like Senator John McCain \u2014 who had criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocal response.It is a testament to our times that it now seems unthinkable that the State Department \u2014 much less the president \u2014 would publicly call out the misinformation being spread. But now that there is a genuine risk of foreign powers who, in George Washington\u2019s words, \u201cpractice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion,\u201d it is incumbent on the rest of us to enhance our vigilance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Clam Chowder That Tastes Like Summer", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenA traditional chowder of corn, potatoes and clams is like a clambake in a bowl, minus the lobster. Everything bobs about in a delicious broth, highlighting the sweetness of each ingredient.Now, some purists may say corn isn\u2019t traditional, since you can add it only in the summertime. But I\u2019m pretty sure most people don\u2019t mind, as recipes for clam chowder with corn are widely found.The humble building blocks for many clam chowders are salt pork (or bacon), potatoes and milk \u2014 inexpensive ingredients that any New England cook would have on hand \u2014 and, of course, clams.Whether digging their own or buying them, most people use briny, flavorful quahog clams. Large and meaty, they come only four or five to the pound, and must be chopped. Cherrystones are somewhat smaller and also make good soup. For the most elegant, delicate chowder, use littlenecks, which are small and tender enough to eat whole. Steam your own, if possible, or buy chopped clams from the fishmonger. (If canned clams are your only best option, so be it.)Traditionalists should read no further. My corn and clam chowder has a somewhat Italian slant: It employs polenta and zucchini, and tastes like summer \u2014 bright, spectacular, golden and fleeting.My approach stems from a Tuscan vegetable soup I know that uses a small handful of polenta to thicken the broth just slightly. I added a little polenta to my brothy corn and clam soup toward the same end, and to reinforce the corn flavor. In a way, you could think of clam chowder as a vegetable soup with clams, so adding market-fresh zucchini makes sense, right?Perhaps I haven\u2019t the right to call it chowder, though I wasn\u2019t aiming for a correct chowder so much as a tasty one. I may as well confess to further transgressions. No bacon.Instead, I give it a dollop of not-very-Italian cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, a squeeze of lime and dash of crushed red pepper.This soup may not recall childhood memories of chowder, but it is comforting nonetheless.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Everyday Vegetable Dishes, Meera Sodha Is the Master", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe my mother and grandmother should have been the ones to teach me their repertory of satisfying vegetarian dishes from Gujarat, in western India. But they never measure or write anything down.On a trip to London, looking for a cooking lesson, I traveled east to the northern end of the Victoria line and met Ms. Sodha at her home in Walthamstow, where we rolled chapatis side by side as her Airedale terrier trotted around the kitchen. My chapatis were slow to come together, imperfectly shaped, but Ms. Sodha was a patient, precise instructor.While researching vegetarian dishes for the book, in India, she had run into cooks who wouldn\u2019t share what they knew, who had said she couldn\u2019t possibly replicate their food at home. But one of Ms. Sodha\u2019s gifts is that she can not only recreate and improve on the familiar \u2014 she can also streamline techniques and edit flavors, then clearly instruct others how to do the same.Ms. Sodha showed me how to make bharela ringan, the baby eggplant cooked on the stovetop until thoroughly tender, with a mixture of blitzed coconut, peanuts and chiles inside. It wasn\u2019t as time-consuming or as complex as my grandmother had led me to believe.By the time I got back to Brooklyn, I wanted to make Ms. Sodha\u2019s vegetarian recipes part of my weekly routine. I started with her basic moong dal, and graduated to her quick-cooking dal made from red lentils and finished with coconut milk, served with a pile of tender kale on top.To make her summery recipe for a Gujarati corn-on-the-cob curry, a simple sauce of yogurt thickened with chickpea flour, I hunted down the sugary corn that made its way to Brooklyn markets in mid-September.Stranded with two small heads of broccoli and no inspiration, I turned to her recipe for malai broccoli. Her adaptation of the cream sauce was a lean, bright and intensely delicious update: a mix of ground almonds with cream cheese and Greek yogurt, spiked with nutmeg and squished into every last crevice of the broccoli florets. Roasted on high heat for about 20 minutes, the mixture became golden brown in places, and the broccoli charred, expanding its flavor.Ms. Sodha got the idea after trying a similar dish in Goa. \u201cYou know when you realize what you\u2019re eating is just so magnificent, and there\u2019s a sort of rip in the atmosphere?\u201d she said. \u201dMy brain started racing and I thought, how do I make this?\u201dBack in her London kitchen, she tinkered until she figured it out. \u201cTo develop a recipe, I have to trust my tongue,\u201d she said.In \u201cFresh India,\u201d Ms. Sodha traces a line from the variety and sophistication of seasonal Gujarati cooking back to the third century B.C., when the emperor Ashoka banned the slaughter of animals. The region\u2019s vegetarian cuisine has flourished over many centuries, and as families have left the region with their foods, they have adapted their dishes in new homes all over the world.Ms. Sodha\u2019s grandfather and great-grandfather left India for Uganda. When her parents were exiled from that country in 1972, along with many thousands of Ugandan-Asians, they settled in England.Ms. Sodha was born and raised there, in a farming village in Lincolnshire, down the road from fields of potatoes and rainbow chard. She watched as her mother took to these new local ingredients and rearranged them like a musician. Ms. Sodha came to understand how spontaneity, resourcefulness and the ability to adapt define good home cooking.Andaz is a Hindi word meaning \u201cstyle,\u201d and to say a cook has andaz is a great compliment, Ms. Sodha said. Some people may use the term to mean a gift for making a dish one\u2019s own, or the ability to make food with a special harmony.Ms. Sodha describes andaz as a kind of knowledge, particular to a cuisine that is rooted in oral tradition, that can only be learned through observation and apprenticeship, mistakes and repetition.\u201cIt\u2019s a sense of judgment that\u2019s built up through doing,\u201d she said.I thought that following Ms. Sodha\u2019s recipes could help speed the process a little. But still, there is only way to get there: Cook.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Fake News Turned a Small Town Upside Down", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "FeatureAt the height of the 2016 election, exaggerated reports of a juvenile sex crime brought a media maelstrom to Twin Falls \u2014 one the Idaho city still hasn\u2019t recovered from.Supported by\u201cWe have been made aware of a situation,\u201d said the first speaker, an older man with a scraggly white beard who had hobbled up to the lectern. \u201cAn alleged assault of a minor child and we can\u2019t get any information on it. Apparently, it\u2019s been indicated that the perpetrators were foreign Muslim youth that conducted this \u2014 I guess it was a rape.\u201d Brown recognized the man as Terry Edwards. About a year earlier, after The Times-News reported that Syrian refugees would very likely be resettled in Twin Falls, Edwards joined a movement to shut the resettlement program down. The group circulated a petition to put the proposal before voters. They failed to get enough signatures to force a referendum, but Brown was struck by how much support around town the movement attracted. In bars after work, he began to overhear conversations about the dangers of Islam. One night, he heard a man joke about dousing the entrance to the local mosque with pig\u2019s blood.After he finished watching the video, Brown called the police chief, Craig Kingsbury, to get more information about the case. Kingsbury said that he couldn\u2019t discuss it and that the police reports were sealed because minors were involved. Brown made a couple phone calls: to the mayor and to his colleague at the paper who covers crime. He pieced together that 12 days earlier, three children had been discovered partly clothed inside a shared laundry room at the apartment complex where they lived. There were two boys, a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old, and a 5-year-old girl. The 7-year-old boy was accused of attempting some kind of sex act with the 5-year-old, and the 10-year-old had used a cellphone borrowed from his older brother to record it. The girl was American and, like most people in Twin Falls, white. The boys were refugees; Brown wasn\u2019t sure from where. In his article about the meeting, Brown seems to anticipate that the police chief\u2019s inability to elaborate was not going to sit well with the people whose testimony he had just watched.That weekend, Brown was on his way to see a movie when he received a Facebook message from Jim Dalos Jr., a 52-year-old known to Twin Falls journalists and police as Scanner Man. Dalos is disabled; he works six hours a week as a dishwasher at a pizzeria but spends most of his time in his apartment, sitting in a reclining chair and drinking Diet Pepsi out of a 52-ounce plastic mug, voraciously consuming news. He reads the local paper, old issues of which litter his living-room floor, and keeps the television blaring \u2014 usually Fox News. He got his nickname because he constantly monitors an old police scanner, a gift he received as a teenager from his father, and often calls in tips to the media based on what he hears. He also happens to live at the apartment complex, Fawnbrook, where the laundry-room incident occurred.Dalos told Brown that he had seen the police around Fawnbrook and that the victim\u2019s mother told him that the boys had been arrested. He also pointed Brown to a couple of Facebook groups that were created in response to the crime. Brown scrolled through them on his cellphone and saw links flying back and forth with articles that said that the little girl had been gang raped at knife point, that the perpetrators were Syrian refugees and that their fathers had celebrated with them afterward by giving them high fives. The stories also claimed that the City Council and the police department were conspiring to bury the crime.Over the weekend, Brown plowed through his daily packs of cigarettes as he watched hundreds, then thousands, of people joining the groups. Their panic appeared to be piqued by a mass shooting, the deadliest in American history, that had just occurred at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The perpetrator had declared allegiance to ISIS. The commenters also posted stories that claimed refugees were responsible for a rash of rapes in Europe and that a similar phenomenon in the United States was imminent. \u201cMy girl is blond and blue-eyed,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cI am extremely worried about her safety.\u201dThe details of the Fawnbrook case, as it became known, were still unclear to Brown, but he was skeptical of what he was reading. For one thing, he knew from his own previous reporting that no Syrians had been resettled in Twin Falls after all. He woke up early on Monday to get a head start on clarifying things as much as possible in order to write a follow-up article. Before he got into the office, a friend texted him, telling him to check the Drudge Report. At the top, a headline screamed: \u201cREPORT: Syrian \u2018Refugees\u2019 Rape Little Girl at Knifepoint in Idaho.\u201dMost Twin Falls residents are churchgoing, and about half of those are Mormons. Locally owned stores and restaurants are generally closed on Sundays, and the city has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936. Liberals often register as Republicans just to have an opportunity to participate in the electoral process, by voting in the primaries. If a Republican is going to win regardless, the thinking goes, they would at least like to play a role in deciding which one prevails.The same qualities that bind the townspeople together can, in turn, be alienating to newcomers. The refugee community has begun to experience this effect as its demographic makeup has changed. Over the past decade and a half, as conflict spread across North Africa and the Middle East, Twin Falls started to resettle larger numbers of refugees with darker skin who follow an unfamiliar religion \u2014 two things that make it difficult to blend into a town that is 80 percent white.On a national scale, an ascendant network of anti-Muslim activists and provocateurs has exploited the fears brought on by these changes, finding a platform and a receptive audience online. The narrative they espouse \u2014 on blogs with names like Jihad Watch \u2014 is that America, currently 1 percent Muslim, is in the midst of an Islamic invasion. Central to the worldview of these bloggers, some of whom have celebrity-size social-media followings, is that Muslims have a propensity toward sexual violence. They seize on any news item that bolsters this notion. Perhaps their biggest touchstone is an incident that took place in Cologne, Germany, on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2015. Mobs of men, many of them asylum seekers from the Middle East, pick-pocketed and groped more than a thousand women in and around a train station. The German police acknowledged the incident had taken place only under pressure, as the women\u2019s stories began to leak out through the media. This established, for these activists, the contours of a narrative that they believe has been repeating itself. The Fawnbrook incident quickly drew their interest.What happened in Twin Falls was sadly somewhat commonplace but not in the way the activists believed. The local Police Department investigates sex crimes on a weekly basis, and in about half a dozen of those that proceed to court each year, the victims and the accused are both minors. \u201cIf it\u2019s younger kids, it\u2019s them being curious,\u201d J.R. Paredez, the lead investigator on the case, explained to me. Some children who act out sexually have been victimized themselves, he said, while others have been exposed to explicit material at home or at school or, as is more common recently, on their cellphones. \u201cAs they start to get older, there\u2019s more of the actual sexual component to it.\u201dTwo weeks after the incident, the boys were charged with lewd and lascivious behavior against a minor. (The 14-year-old who lent his cellphone to the boys was initially charged with the same crime. He was not present in the laundry room, and his charge was eventually reduced to make him an accessory.) In Idaho, this statute applies to physical contact \u201cdone with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person, such minor child, or third party.\u201d Paredez said that the cellphone video made clear what specifically had happened between the children, but that he couldn\u2019t show it to the reporters who asked him about it, because doing so would have constituted criminal distribution of child pornography. He called most of the details that he read about the case on the internet \u201c100 percent false, like not even close to being accurate.\u201d (The family of the accused declined to comment.)As more time passed without a solid account of what happened inside the laundry room, lurid rumors continued to surface online and came to dominate conversations in grocery stores and at school events. And while the City Council members did not have control over the case, the bloggers who wrote about it placed much of the blame on them.On the Monday when Twin Falls was the top story on Drudge, the City Council held another weekly meeting. Normally only a handful of people attend, and Brown is one of the few reporters among them. But that night, the auditorium filled until there was standing room only, and television news crews appeared from Boise and other nearby cities. When it came time for public comments, one man got up and praised the city\u2019s handling of the case, followed by more than a dozen others who laid into the council members. Terry Edwards handed each of them a small copy of the Constitution and told them to do their jobs. A woman named Vicky Davis, her hair in a satiny white bob, stood up and proclaimed that Islam had declared jihad on America.\u201cThey are not compatible with our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cThey hate us. They don\u2019t want to be Americans. They don\u2019t want to assimilate. What do you need to see? What more proof do you need?\u201dThis was a highly unusual meeting, but Brown wasn\u2019t exactly surprised. Several months earlier, when the anti-refugee activists began to organize, he started reading up to try to better understand their views. He picked up a book by Ann Coulter and began to follow the anti-refugee blogs. At the meeting, he felt as if he were hearing all that he had read being repeated aloud by his neighbors.Kingsbury, the police chief, read from a statement while fumbling with a thicket of microphones piled onto the lectern by visiting reporters. In between exasperated breaths, he explained why he could not disclose the details of the incident but said that he could address some of the misinformation that was spreading online. There was no evidence of a knife, he said, or of any celebration afterward or of a cover-up, and no Syrians were involved: The boys were from Sudan and Iraq. \u201cI\u2019m a kid who grew up in Idaho,\u201d he said. \u201cLaw enforcement takes these types of allegations very seriously. However, we can\u2019t act on them within an hour. It\u2019s not like a crime show.\u201d He told the audience that the boys had been arrested, to applause.But online, Kingsbury\u2019s words only inflamed the activists more. Just after midnight, someone posted his work email address on Jihad Watch, along with those of the council members and the mayor. A commenter on another website called The Muslim Issue posted the phone numbers and email addresses for the town\u2019s government officials, the head of the refugee-resettlement center and some administrators at the college, which runs the refugee resettlement program. From there, the information spread to more blogs and to the comments sections of far-right news outlets with massive audiences.By 9 the next morning, messages were pouring into the inbox of the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, nearly every minute. Barigar grew up in a neighboring town and went to work in Boise as a television news anchor before moving back to start a family. His even keel and the air of sophistication he picked up while living in a comparatively big city have made him popular politically. He is left of the town on many social issues, which has made some of his constituents suspicious of him. But most of the people who contacted him that summer were from other states and even other countries. Some people demanded that the city pay for a new car and apartment for the victim and her family. Others said that local officials\u2019 attempts to correct inaccurate details about the incident were veiled efforts to suggest that no crime had occurred at all, in order to protect the refugees. Others accused him of being a \u201cglobalist,\u201d a word that has taken on many definitions but in this case meant he was part of a vast, arcane conspiracy. They believed that establishment politicians wanted to turn red states like Idaho blue by starting wars and then importing refugees from those war zones as cheap labor who would not only displace American workers but also reliably vote Democratic.Many of the people who wrote to the mayor had a much simpler goal: to unleash their hatred of Islam. One message, with the subject line \u201cMuslims,\u201d said that refugees were committing rapes and hit-and-runs and urinating on women and that the mayor was guilty of treason. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the bag, [expletive],\u201d it read. \u201cWe will and are holding you responsible for any and all crimes committed by these quote refugees. No courts. No police. Just us. You will answer to us in the darkness of night.\u201dThe next day, Camille Barigar, the mayor\u2019s wife, arrived in her office at the college, where she ran the performing-arts center, and started listening to her voice mail. In a calm, measured voice, a man who sounded as if he was reading from a script went on for nearly four minutes. \u201cI wonder, Miss Barigar, if your residence was posted online and your whereabouts identified, how you would feel if half a dozen Muslim men raped and sodomized you, Miss Barigar, and when you tried to scream, broke every tooth in your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I wonder how you\u2019d feel if, when you went to the Twin Falls Police Department, they told you to run along, that this is simply cultural diversity.\u201dThe caller said that life was \u201cbecoming difficult\u201d in the United States, just as it had in England. He referenced Jo Cox, a British member of Parliament who spoke out in support of refugees and later \u201cmet with opposition in the form of a bullet to the head.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s dead now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve buried her.\u201dThen 50, Stranahan was relatively new to journalism. He had spent a few decades as a television producer and a graphic illustrator in Los Angeles, and on the side he shot erotic photography, which is how he met his wife. Stranahan\u2019s transition into journalism began during the television writers\u2019 strike of 2007 and 2008. To keep himself entertained, he created parody political advertisements and posted them on YouTube. One of the first was a satirical Rudy Giuliani ad, asking Republican primary voters to support him because he had taken good care of his mistress, offering her private security courtesy of the N.Y.P.D., whereas Mitt Romney \u201cdidn\u2019t even bother\u201d to take on a paramour. Stranahan says that within weeks, the videos led to invitations to appear on CNN and to meet with a vice president at NBC and to a job offer, which he accepted, writing political comedy for The Huffington Post.In college, Stranahan was a libertarian and even attended Ayn Rand\u2019s funeral. But when he moved to California, he became a liberal, vehemently opposing the Iraq war and the presidency of George W. Bush. He voted for Barack Obama in 2008. Two years later, Stranahan interviewed Andrew Breitbart, a fellow Huffington Post alumnus, for an article he was writing about Jon Stewart\u2019s Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. They spoke for more than three hours, bonding over their shared love of Depeche Mode. Eventually, Breitbart became Stranahan\u2019s mentor, converted him to conservatism and offered him a job. In 2011, Breitbart took Stranahan to the Conservative Political Action Conference and introduced him to Michele Bachmann, who, in Stranahan\u2019s recollection, convinced him that she had uncovered disturbing details about Islam that no one in the establishment was willing to talk about. Stranahan says this conversation was the genesis of his concerns about the religion.Stranahan arrived in Idaho in August, after covering the national party conventions. The sealed nature of the case prevented any journalist from an exhaustive examination, and the accused and the victim\u2019s families refused to speak to the mainstream media. But Stranahan thrived in the void of facts. He was granted one of the few interviews with the victim\u2019s family, but his account of the crime offered little more information than others\u2019 had \u2014 and far more inaccuracies, according to the police and the county prosecutor. He described what took place as a \u201chorrific gang rape\u201d and wrote graphic details about the incident, which the Twin Falls Police say are untrue. On Breitbart radio, Stranahan openly wondered whether Barigar, the mayor, was \u201ca big, you know, Shariah supporter.\u201d And he suggested repeatedly that mass rapes by refugees had occurred in Europe and were inevitably coming to the United States. \u201cIf you want to wait until your country turns into France or Cologne, Germany. If you want to wait, you can wait,\u201d he warned the audience. \u201cBut if you want to watch it and stop it now, you\u2019ve got a chance to do it in November.\u201dStranahan says his Breitbart editors sent him to Twin Falls to report on the \u201cMuslim takeover\u201d of the town. (Breitbart denies this and says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd.\u201d) But he soon became enamored of a grander theory about what was happening in southern Idaho: globalism. He wrote that local businesses received government kickbacks for employing foreigners instead of Americans. (Stranahan did not cite any evidence of this, and it is untrue, according to the state Department of Labor.) And he often referred to a Syrian refugee crisis, though no Syrians were ever resettled there. Then, to bring the story full circle, he claimed these Muslim refugees were being used to replace American workers and that the government, big business and law enforcement were either conspiring to conceal the sexual-assault case or intentionally looking the other way, in order to keep the machine turning.\u201cBottom line, this is bad for business,\u201d he told me in an interview last winter, explaining his interpretation of the city officials\u2019 rationale: \u201c\u2009\u2018I\u2019m not really going to look into this too deeply because if I find out the truth, if I discover what actually happened, if I figure out the truth, it\u2019s not really good for business.\u2019\u2009\u201d Stranahan believed that Chobani, a Greek-yogurt company, was at the center of the scheme. Breitbart had been covering the company for months, ever since the owner, Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish-born businessman, made a speech at the World Economic Forum at Davos encouraging other chief executives to pledge financial and political support to refugees.While he was in town, Stranahan embedded with critics of the refugee program. They drove him to some of his interviews and to the yogurt factory to shoot drone footage. Stranahan doesn\u2019t get around well on his own in part because he has been mostly blind in one eye since grade school, when a neighborhood kid threw a rock at him, shattering his right optic nerve. Rather than a round pupil, his is jagged-edged, and so large that it nearly covers his iris. He shuffles when he walks because of neuropathic foot pain from diabetes, which he regulates by eating a ketogenic diet, usually one meal a day, consisting entirely of protein and fat. In Twin Falls, he subsisted most days on blackened chicken from Popeyes.During the three months he was in Twin Falls, City Council members refused his interview requests, leaving him stuck inside an echo chamber with the activists, which he amplified online. When I was in Twin Falls, I found myself empathizing: These same activists refused to speak with me. One of the most outspoken among them is a woman named Julie DeWolfe, who lives atop a grassy hill 20 minutes outside town and who spent significant time with Stranahan. When I went there to ask for an interview, she came outside with several barking dogs and told me to leave. \u201cThe company you work for is not trustworthy,\u201d she said.As the summer came to a close, The Times-News was bombarded with threatening phone calls and email from all over. After it received a threat that was deemed credible enough to engage the F.B.I., the editor of the paper told Brown and the other reporters to conduct their interviews outside the office and ordered the entire staff to walk in pairs when going out to their cars. For months, the reporters covered protests around town, which were widely hyped on social media but, for the most part, sparsely attended. At least once the Police Department deployed plainclothes officers into the crowds, with instructions to look after the journalists. Later, it turned out that fake Facebook accounts linked to the Russian government helped to spread stories about Twin Falls and even organized one of the rallies there. The event was also poorly attended but is the first known Russian attempt to spark a demonstration on American soil.The phone and email attacks continued through the fall and spiked each time a new conspiracy theory was posted online. One council member told me that she gained 15 pounds from the stress. At night, Shawn Barigar would lie down with his iPad and spend hours reading stories that called him a crook, a liar or an ISIS sympathizer. He had to shut down his Twitter account after someone accused him of having been convicted of sexual assault. Before he could debunk the myth, the post had spread, leaving untold numbers of constituents under the impression that he was a rapist. He stopped sleeping and struggled to focus at work or to be present with his family. He and his wife say they bickered all summer.\u201cIt was like being in a hole,\u201d he told me, his eyes welling up with tears. \u201cIt was all-consuming.\u201dHe expressed no contrition about the reporting he did in Twin Falls, though many of the conclusions that he drew on the radio and online have been debunked. Still, many of the outlets that covered Twin Falls made only minor tweaks to their stories or did nothing at all. Many of the falsehoods that were written about the Fawnbrook case still appear at the top of a Google search of the city.The most transparent course-correction resulted from a lawsuit against Alex Jones, the publisher of InfoWars, for its misleading stories about Chobani. After initially vowing to fight the yogurt company in court, Jones retracted several stories and issued an apology in order to make a lawsuit go away. Stranahan said that his editors forced him off the Twin Falls story during the fall and suggested that they had done so under threat from Chobani. (Breitbart denies this.)Stranahan and I spoke a handful of times over the course of the last year, each time for several hours. Talking with him feels like being inside one of his conspiracy theories. When you ask him a question, he begins to answer and then immediately swerves in a different direction, bouncing like a pinball between topics that barely connect to one another \u2014 from the Fawnbrook case to clitorectomies and stoning, then Syrian refugees, then a prominent Wahhabi cleric \u2014 and seems to increase in velocity as he ricochets off them. It\u2019s an exhausting exercise, but also a fascinating one. He seems perpetually on the precipice of pulling the argument together, sparking just enough curiosity that you let him keep going. Stranahan uses this talent most effectively in his work, painting himself as a champion of people who are understandably uninformed about other cultures and religions based on their own experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s just easy to brand these people as a bunch of Islamophobic, racist yokels,\u201d he told me, with a hint of disgust in his voice. \u201cI just don\u2019t like it.\u201dStranahan struck me as passionate about his stories; not about their veracity but about the freedom he and the critics of refugee resettlement should have to speculate as they wanted without being belittled by the fact-mongering mainstream. When I reached him by phone this June, he told me he was planning to travel back to Idaho for more reporting on Fawnbrook, now that he was no longer constrained by his editors at Breitbart. He told me that he believed that he had uncovered another dimension of his globalist theory related to Chobani\u2019s participation in the federal school-lunch program. He felt compelled to follow up on the earlier coverage, because he was frustrated that Alex Jones and others were forced to retract their stories and apologize under pressure. \u201cI don\u2019t like people getting shut up like that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if their stories have problems, I don\u2019t like journalists getting shut down.\u201dI started to ask why anyone should be allowed to publish false information for the express purpose of angering their audience and pushing them further away from those with whom they disagree, but Stranahan cut me off. \u201cHey, I\u2019m walking into the White House right now,\u201d he said. He had just arrived for a press briefing with the president\u2019s spokesman. \u201cLet me call you back.\u201dLate one Monday night in June I received a phone call from Dalos, the Scanner Man. He asked if I had heard about the \u201cfireworks flying around Twin Falls.\u201d The news of the boys\u2019 fate had somehow reached the public. \u201cThe suspects didn\u2019t go to jail or nothing,\u201d he said, adding that people in town were \u201cirate.\u201d Facebook posts about the story were again flooding his feed. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming it on Muslim law,\u201d he said. One of the articles circulating, from a site called Bare Naked Islam, included a photograph of the judge in the case with a large red arrow pointing toward his head, next to the caption \u201cCorrupt Judge.\u201d Another article published the judge\u2019s home address and phone number, inciting another flood of harassment, a year after the initial onslaught.Shawn and Camille Barigar\u2019s bickering has subsided, but they have discovered that they disagree over whether Islamic teachings conflict with American social norms. \u201cI can\u2019t take the leap,\u201d Shawn told me, \u201cthat because you are Muslim therefore you are reading the Quran verbatim, and you\u2019re going to go out and do genital mutilation.\u201d Camille said she supported the local resettlement program but thought that her husband\u2019s unwillingness to even consider cultural differences or acknowledge any nuance was na\u00efve. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be afraid to talk about it entirely or, like, sound racist.\u201d It is precisely this discomfort that provides an opening for people like Stranahan to dominate the conversation.Part of the reason a fear of Islam has persisted in Twin Falls is because the local leadership refused to defuse it, according to Matt Christensen, 36, the editor of The Times-News. While Brown wrote articles that sorted out the truth about the Fawnbrook case, Christensen was publishing commentary that castigated the people who were spreading falsehoods. He told me that he had closed-door meetings with city officials, in which he asked them to write guest editorials doing the same, but none of them did. Christensen suspected that they were afraid of one of the most reliable political dangers in the region, the same force that leads would-be Democrats there to register as Republicans: being outflanked on the right is the quickest way to lose your job.\u201cBehind closed doors, they would all tell you they were pro-refugee, and we wanted them to step forward and make that declaration in a public arena, and it just never really happened,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was frustrating to us especially at the beginning because it really felt like the newspaper was out there all alone.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere were days where we felt like, Godammit, what are we doing here? We write a story and it\u2019s going to reach 50,000 people. Breitbart writes a story and it\u2019s going to reach 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 million people. What kind of a voice do we have in this debate?\u201dThe refugee resettlement center received a dramatic increase in donations from local residents during the last year. But those in the town who support the program have often been drowned out by the relatively smaller, but louder, group of activists who oppose it. Brown said he expected to see an anti-Shariah bill introduced in the State Legislature when the next session starts in 2018. Bills like this, which try to bar Islamic law from being used in American courts, have been introduced in the past two years in Boise but never passed. He speculated that the momentum of the past year could force a different outcome. \u201cThere are a lot of people who feel like society is changing too quickly, like the community is changing too quickly,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd who view other people not like them or who don\u2019t speak their language as a threat or a sign that their culture is going to be weakened. And they want to do what they can to stop that.\u201dCaitlin Dickerson is a national reporter for The Times.

{"Headline": "Emboldened China Wields Its Laws to Silence Critics From Abroad", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 On the morning he disappeared, the activist Lee Ming-cheh crossed from Macau into mainland China to meet with democracy advocates.It was 177 days later when he reappeared in public, standing in the dock of a courtroom in central China last week, confessing to a conspiracy to subvert the Communist Party by circulating criticism on social media.The circumstances surrounding Mr. Lee\u2019s detainment remain murky, but what has made the case stand out from the many that the Chinese government brings against its critics is that Mr. Lee is not a citizen of China, but rather of Taiwan, the self-governing island over which Beijing claims sovereignty.The proceedings against Mr. Lee, who is expected to be sentenced as soon as this week, punctuated what critics have warned are China\u2019s brazen efforts to extend the reach of its security forces to stifle what it perceives as threats to its power emanating from overseas.\u201cChina has been extending its clampdown \u2014 its choking of civil society \u2014 throughout the world, and often it is attempting this through official channels such as the U.N. or Interpol,\u201d said Michael Caster, a rights campaigner who was a co-founder of the Chinese Urgent Action Working Group. \u201cUnfortunately, they\u2019re very adept at doing it.\u201dChina\u2019s economic and diplomatic clout has meant that few countries are willing or able to do much to challenge its extraterritorial legal maneuvers. Some have even gone along.\u201cTreating Lee Ming-cheh as a mainland Chinese marks a major watershed,\u201d said Hsiao I-Min, a lawyer at the Judicial Reform Foundation in Taiwan, who accompanied Mr. Lee\u2019s wife from Taiwan to attend the trial.In response to Mr. Lee\u2019s legal odyssey, Ms. Tsai\u2019s government has been relatively muted. \u201cOur consistent position on this case is that we will do everything in our power to ensure his safe return while protecting the dignity of the nation,\u201d said a spokesman for the presidential administration, Alex Huang.China and Taiwan had in recent years cooperated on criminal investigations under a protocol that required each to notify the other in cases involving the arrests of its citizens. The Chinese government has recently abandoned such diplomatic niceties, officials in Taiwan say.Taiwan\u2019s government was notified of Mr. Lee\u2019s arrest only when the public was \u2014 10 days after his detainment in March near Macau, the former Portuguese colony that, like Hong Kong, is a special administrative region of China with its own legal system.Whatever the veracity of his courtroom confession, Mr. Lee, 42, assumed enormous risk to make contact with rights campaigners inside China. A manager at Wenshan Community College in Taiwan\u2019s capital, Taipei, Mr. Lee volunteered for a rights organization called Covenants Watch and often traveled to the mainland.Mr. Lee\u2019s wife, Lee Ching-yu, learned his case had come to a head when a state-appointed lawyer contacted her this month. She only found out about his court appearance last week in Yueyang, in the southern province of Hunan, from news reports that circulated two days later, according to Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International.According to excerpts released by the Yueyang Intermediate People\u2019s Court, Mr. Lee entered a guilty plea. He appeared with a Chinese co-defendant, Peng Yuhua, and together they were accused of trying to organize protests using the social media platforms WeChat and QQ, as well as Facebook, which is banned here.Mr. Lee told the court that watching Chinese state television during his prolonged detention convinced him that he had been deceived by Taiwan\u2019s free news media and was wrong about China\u2019s political system. \u201cThese incorrect thoughts led me to criminal behavior,\u201d he said.Mr. Hsiao, the lawyer from Taiwan, said none of Mr. Lee\u2019s acquaintances had heard of the co-defendant. Mr. Peng testified that together they had established chat groups online and formed a front organization, the Plum Blossom Company, with the aim of fomenting change. Mr. Hsiao said that no such company existed.\u201cHe was a fake,\u201d Mr. Hsiao said of Mr. Peng. \u201cThis guy does not really exist. He was playing a role.\u201dMs. Lee, too, denounced her husband\u2019s trial as a farce. \u201cToday the world and I together witnessed political theater, as well as the differences between the core beliefs of Taiwan and China,\u201d she said at her hotel in Yueyang, adding that the \u201cnorms of expression in Taiwan are tantamount to armed rebellion in China.\u201dOne bookseller, Lee Bo, is a British citizen. Another, Gui Minhai, is a naturalized Swedish citizen; he vanished from his seaside apartment in Pattaya, Thailand, in October 2015 and returned to China in a manner that has not been fully explained. He appeared on state television in January 2016 and said he had voluntarily returned to face punishment for a fatal car accident in 2003. He remains in prison.\u201cWhat happened to my father is a much larger issue,\u201d Mr. Gui\u2019s daughter, Angela Gui, who has been campaigning for his release, wrote in an email. \u201cIt shows that foreign citizens aren\u2019t safe from Chinese state security, even when they are outside China\u2019s borders. I find it strange that governments aren\u2019t more worried about China\u2019s new self-proclaimed role as world police.\u201d Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Chris Horton from Taipei, Taiwan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Life\u2019s Many Acts Culminate in the Kitchen at NA/NA in Paris", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike most French chefs, Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello started cooking when she was a child \u2014 but not, as the clich\u00e9 goes, at her grandmother\u2019s elbow amid the vapors of pot au feu.\u201cI don\u2019t have childhood memories of something smelling good in the cuisine,\u201d she said, using the French word for kitchen. Raised by a single mother in the Parisian suburb Marnes-la-Coquette, Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello grew up in the era of canned foods. Dinner often meant eggs at 9 p.m.\u201cI taught myself to cook because I had to,\u201d she said.Good scents were abundant, however, on a recent afternoon in the tiny, L-shaped kitchen of NA/NA, in the 11th Arrondissement, emanating from a dessert on the evening\u2019s menu. There was the buttery, nutty smell of black sesame streusel; the earthy, bittersweet aroma of single-origin chocolate; the saline funk of small-batch sweet miso from Kyoto, Japan.All would be combined on handmade ceramic plates, just a few shades darker than the black sesame-miso cream on top. The almost savory, panna cotta-like layer is crowned with silky, chocolate ganache and shards of the cocoa streusel. It is a textural delight \u2014 soft and creamy, with a crunch varying from sandy to brittle-crisp, and sophisticated flavors that flit from salty to bitter to sweet.As both the aesthetic and flavors in this dish illustrate, Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello\u2019s cooking is influenced by time spent in Japan, much of it during her former career as a journalist covering ecological issues.Although opening NA/NA in her 50s without any restaurant experience was, in a way, terrifying, Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello and her partner Charlotte Demonceau were ready for the challenge.\u201cAt first I thought I didn\u2019t want a restaurant, that I was too old,\u201d Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello said. \u201cBut then I thought if we make it a little rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and do things our way with intelligence and kindness, we could have something to be proud of.\u201dDoing things her way means changing the menu twice a day, every day, to be best able to react to the unpredictability of finding seasonal, fair-trade and sustainable ingredients. If the line-caught white tuna from the Basque Country (served perhaps with local haricots vert and a citrus pur\u00e9e), wasn\u2019t available two hours before dinner service, off the menu it went \u2014 with or without a replacement.The formula worked. Within weeks of opening, the 32-seat venue secured its place among a coterie of new, critically acclaimed all-day Paris restaurants \u2014 the kind that transition from the homemade granola on sheep milk yogurt for breakfast to beet velout\u00e9 with yuzu for lunch, to lamb brains with mint, followed by bee pollen meringue, for dinner.The speed of NA/NA\u2019s success may have seemed surprising. But, for Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello, it was a natural progression in a rich, full life.\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have been able to do what I did so quickly,\u201d she said, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t done what I\u2019d done before.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 16 Futile Years, Congress Will Try Again to Legalize \u2018Dreamers\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For 16 years, advocates for legalizing young immigrants brought here illegally by their parents have tried to pass legislation to shield them from deportation. The bill was called the Dream Act, and in Congresses Democratic and Republican, and in the Bush and Obama administrations, whether by stand-alone bill or comprehensive immigration legislation, it failed again and again.Now, with 800,000 lives in the balance and a fiercely anti-immigration current running through the Republican Party, lawmakers are being asked to try again \u2014 with a six-month deadline, to boot. The prospects for success after more than a decade of false starts would already be daunting, but President Trump may have made the odds even longer after he promised voters last year that Republicans would take a hard line on immigration, then punted the issue to Congress.His invitation to lawmakers on Tuesday to \u201cdo something and do it right\u201d for the so-called dreamers will run into the headwinds of his own politics. On the other hand, lawmakers who for 16 years have been unwilling to grant legal status to a sympathetic group of unauthorized immigrants may find that taking their legal status away is even harder than conferring it.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that this is a moment where we are forced to finally do something,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and an original author of the Dream Act \u2014 the letters stand for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. \u201cWe want to call this bill for a vote on the floor of the House and the floor of the Senate. I am hoping that we will have enough votes to pass it.\u201dSenator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she believed there is \u201cwidespread bipartisan support for legislation that would provide some measure of protection to children who are brought to this country through no decision of their own.\u201dAnd in 2013, language allowing dreamers to stay in this country and work or attend school was included in a broader immigration package that passed the Senate with 68 votes \u2014 then failed in the House.There are roughly 800,000 current beneficiaries of the DACA program. Here\u2019s who they are.Frustrated after years of failings, President Barack Obama signed DACA as a temporary order in the hope that Congress would eventually pass the Dream Act and broader immigration changes. But with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, the Dream Act stalled once again.Some Republicans have softened, as well. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican who chairs the House Republican Conference, said in a statement that while she has long said she did not agree with the way Mr. Obama enacted his program, Congress \u201cmust protect\u201d the dreamers who are currently shielded from deportation.She added, \u201cThat principle is fundamental for me.\u201dThe Dream Act\u2019s history is tortured. In 2001, a concerned guidance counselor for a frightened young woman whose family immigrated from South Korea reached out to Mr. Durbin for help. The young woman, Tereza Lee, was a pianist who was hoping to apply to top-ranked music schools, but the law said she would have to leave the United States for 10 years and apply for re-entry. To help Ms. Lee, Mr. Durbin introduced the Dream Act.Democrats had a hand in the legislation\u2019s historical futility. For years, they used the Dream Act as a bargaining chip to push for broader immigration legislation, hoping a sympathetic group of young immigrants could help win a pathway to citizenship for the far broader pool of 12 million unauthorized immigrants. Now, most Democrats say there is no time for comprehensive immigration changes.But Republican leaders indicated that they will need sweeteners, perhaps funding for a border wall or other measures to bolster border security.\u201cThe process of taking care of the kids will be a negotiated process,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who appeared with Mr. Durbin on Tuesday at a news conference to call for bipartisan action. \u201cThere are a lot of people who believe that a good marriage would be border security and Dream Act.\u201dBoth Mr. Graham and Mr. Durbin made clear they could support such a marriage \u2014 albeit reluctantly, in the case of Mr. Durbin \u2014 but negotiations look inevitable. Others agreed.\u201cI think it\u2019s an opportunity for us to deal with a myriad other issues that we need to deal with, with a broken immigration system,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. Among those issues, he said, are border security, efforts by immigrants to overstay their visa and the so-called \u201cE-Verify\u201d system for employers to certify that their workers are in this country legally.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, was definitive. \u201cI think what President Trump did is appropriate, which is to kick it to Congress, and so we will take that up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way that it will stand alone.\u201dIn the House, Republican moderates say they are willing to work with Democrats to enshrine the program in legislation \u2014 and to force Republican leaders to abandon their customary strategy of passing bills only with overwhelming Republican support \u2014 a \u201cmajority of the majority.\u201d\u201cI believe the votes are there to pass some kind of a DACA program in the House,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a chairman of the so-called Tuesday Group of House moderates. \u201cI\u2019m not saying a majority of the majority, but there are 218 votes.\u201dRepresentative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican who represents a narrowly divided, heavily Latino district, said Monday that he planned to push a legislative maneuver to get a vote on a temporary extension of DACA that he wrote with Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois. The so-called discharge petition for the Bridge Act would force Republican leaders to bring the bill to the floor if it has 218 signatures.\u201cDemocrats have to decide, O.K., do we allow the deportation of these young people because we don\u2019t like a Republican taking leadership on this issue? Or do we go with a Republican led initiative?\u201d said Mr. Coffman, a top target for Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections.Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez weighed in for Mr. Coffman\u2019s efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t care who gets the credit. There are 800,000 kids\u2019 futures at stake,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cThe only consideration we have is how do we legislatively fix this problem.\u201dIt remains unclear if Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, would back the Bridge Act, which would extend DACA for three years, and rally others to do the same.But she has requested a meeting with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who has the power to bring the Dream Act to a vote at any time and who said Tuesday he hoped to find consensus to ensure \u201cthat those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Human Toll of Harvey Comes Into View as Waters Recede", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne couple had just another stop or two in their pickup truck, a check on an elderly uncle. A 60-year-old woman had just lain down for a much-needed nap. An 8-year-old boy was riding in a van with his extended family in search of higher ground.All were claimed by Hurricane Harvey, which brought torrential rains and catastrophic flooding as it churned through southeast Texas for days. Beyond the billions in damage to homes, businesses and roads, the storm has taken a human toll, so far claiming the lives of at least 50 people across eight counties, officials said, a number that is expected to grow as rescue efforts shift to recovery.As the floodwaters recede, the picture of Harvey\u2019s devastation is becoming clearer. But the range of victims and their circumstances, with some found alone in their homes and others lost while undertaking rescue operations, reflect the wide reach of a storm that battered young and old alike.The search for the dead is far from complete, as volunteers and relief workers move door to door and sift through the wreckage.Nearly all of those killed in the storm drowned. Many have not yet been identified, including a 65-year-old man who was seen collapsing in floodwaters.Six members of the Saldivar family \u2014 Belia and Manuel and their four great-grandchildren \u2014 Devy, 16; Dominic, 14; Xavier, 8; and Daisy, 6 \u2014 were found dead in a van, which was submerged in high water in east Houston.Two people died because they could not get the necessary medical treatment, officials said.There were those who braved the storm willingly, steering boats and cars through rising waters. Surviving family members said this week that their relatives were aware of the dangers of a storm that was bigger and more ferocious than any they had ever seen, but were overcome by a desire to help those who were imperiled.Some victims lived alone and died solitary deaths. They called and texted loved ones with reassuring messages as the storm took hold, only to be found lifeless the next day.In Galveston County, three men, aged 54, 59 and 83, were each found alone after the storm, drowned in their houses. Galveston attracts outdoorsy, headstrong, \u201cloner-type folks,\u201d said Erin Barnhart, the county medical examiner, noting that after days of searching, officials there have yet to locate the next of kin for one of the men.\u201cPresumably they were attempting to ride out the storm,\u201d she said on Friday, adding that surviving previous hurricanes in Galveston could have left some residents feeling invincible. \u201cThey think they can handle it. They may have been a stubborn old man who said, \u2018I\u2019ve lived my life and if this is it, this is it.\u2019\u201dA few of the victims died under unknown circumstances, leaving relatives and friends anguished over what they might have endured in their final hours.Agnes Stanley, 89, a longtime volunteer for a conservation group in Houston, died in her one-story brick home there on Sunday. She was found floating in four feet of floodwater. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d a son, Gregory Stanley, said.As Harvey raged this week, social media platforms quickly became clearinghouses for people looking for friends and relatives. Deborah Tucker of Baytown, Tex., posted on Facebook that her husband was missing. \u201cHis name is Mike Tucker, 66 yrs old, approx. 5\u20199,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am very worried for his safety and appreciate any information.\u201dLater, an update appeared: \u201cHe has been found and didn\u2019t make it. ThK u all for ur prayers. This is her daughter and she needs time before talking.\u201dWhile many in southeast Texas banded together to survive, there were others who died after venturing out to help others. Jorge Raul Perez, 33, and Yahir Rubio-Vizuet, 45, were killed in a boating accident while on a search-and-rescue mission in Harris County, their family said, adding that two men who joined them remain missing.Sgt. Steve Perez, 60, a 34-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, drove in the dark for hours on Sunday morning while attempting to get to work; police said he had reached an underpass, had driven into the water and drowned.Thelma Hooker, of Katy, Tex., said she was still trying to piece together the events of Wednesday, when her brother, Donald Rogers, called her to say that he and his wife, Rochelle, were busy checking on relatives, but would be home soon. They just needed to be satisfied, he told his sister, that everybody was all right.\u201cHe didn\u2019t come and I started getting worried,\u201d Ms. Hooker said. Her phone soon rang with a frantic message, passed from a cousin to Ms. Hooker\u2019s sister to her: There was a white truck in the raging water in nearby Fulshear, west of Houston, and it looked like their brother\u2019s.\u201cThe police officer said the current was so strong, it just wiped them off the bridge,\u201d Ms. Hooker said, adding that she could not make sense of the situation. \u201cMy brother was a minister. He followed every rule.\u201dJoDell Pasek, of Houston, wept on Thursday as she described what had happened to her youngest son, Andrew, who was 25. An animal lover who once pulled over his car in San Antonio to rescue two abandoned puppies, Andrew was worried about his sister\u2019s cat, D\u2019Artagnan, left in her two-story house when she evacuated.\u201cHe was a selfless person,\u201d Ms. Pasek said. \u201cHe found out that they couldn\u2019t take the cat with them, so he decided he was going to go over there.\u201dAfter parking his car, Andrew began wading through shallow floodwaters and was electrocuted, possibly by a live wire, according to Harris County officials.Before he died, he shouted at a friend who had tagged along, Sean Stuart, not to touch him. \u201cHe knew immediately that if Sean touched him, he would be electrocuted too,\u201d Ms. Pasek said.A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the victims of Hurricane Harvey misstated the relationship between Belia and Manuel Saldivar and four children who were found dead with them after the storm. As the article correctly noted, the couple were the children\u2019s great-grandparents, not their grandparents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ta-Nehisi Coates and the Making of a Public Intellectual", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileWhen Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s first book, \u201cThe Beautiful Struggle,\u201d was published in 2008, it landed with barely a ripple. At the time, Mr. Coates was a struggling writer. He had lost three jobs, and he and his family relied on unemployment checks, his wife\u2019s income and occasional support from his father to stay afloat. By the time the book came out in paperback, his fortune had shifted slightly; he\u2019d become a regular contributor to The Atlantic magazine, writing a blog that attracted a moderate but engaged audience.\u201cI went and did a few events. I did one in Brooklyn and I did one in San Francisco, and maybe 30 people showed up. And I thought, \u2018This is what I want. This is it,\u2019\u201d he said in a conversation over a recent lunch.Suffice it to say that Mr. Coates\u2019s second book, \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d published in 2015, did not suffer the same lack of readership. An early galley was sent to Toni Morrison, who strongly endorsed the book, calling it \u201crequired reading\u201d and likening Mr. Coates to James Baldwin. That year, Mr. Coates was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship and the National Book Award in nonfiction. His appearances filled auditoriums and the book was adopted on college syllabuses. It has sold 1.5 million copies internationally and has been translated into 19 languages, catapulting him to prominence.At the age of 41 (he turns 42 on Saturday), Mr. Coates has become one of the most influential black intellectuals of his generation, joining predecessors including Ms. Morrison, Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Dr. Cornel West. \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star,\u201d said Dr. Nell Irvin Painter, professor emeritus of American history at Princeton University, adding that Mr. Coates is asking questions that even \u201cother historians have not been asking.\u201dHis new book, \u201cWe Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy,\u201d traces this ascent. In it, he collects articles he wrote for The Atlantic during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, interspersing them with explanatory, autobiographical essays. The book goes on sale Tuesday, Oct. 3, and already, his book-tour stop at Brooklyn\u2019s Kings Theater has sold out \u2014 a far cry from the intimate crowds of his early career.In the beginning of September, about a month before his book was to be published, Mr. Coates gave a preliminary reading at BLVD Bistro, a soul-food restaurant in Harlem tucked into the ground floor of a brownstone that preserves old-school features like brick walls and a tin ceiling. Mr. Coates stood at the head of the room, in front of a large wall decal of James Baldwin\u2019s face lined with the words, \u201cOur crown has already been bought and paid for. All we have to do is wear it.\u201d He wore a white button-down shirt, jeans and blue and white Nike sneakers.The event was brimming with people close to Mr. Coates: his wife, son and mother; the New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb; Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight\u201d; and Dr. Painter, among others. Mr. Coates was comfortable and relaxed, joking once about the rap music that blasted in through the windows as a car drove by \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s so appropriate, being upstaged by Kendrick.\u201d He seemed, in that moment, perfectly settled in between the intellectualism and hip-hop that influenced him, freed from, as he describes in \u201cWe Were Eight Years,\u201d \u201cthose young years trapped between the schools and the streets.\u201dWhen the discussion was opened up to the audience, one attendee, Adrian Hopkins, asked how Mr. Coates advised his son on the subject of political activism. Mr. Coates answered that his own father had been part of the Black Panther Party and had later become disillusioned with mass politics. Mr. Coates\u2019s advice to his son, Samori, was to educate himself before getting involved in protests. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that was the correct answer,\u201d he said, \u201cProtest is a very, very real thing, but for me, it\u2019s much more private.\u201dThat perceived detachment has drawn criticism. When \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d was published, Dr. West took issue with Ms. Morrison\u2019s comparison of Mr. Coates to Baldwin and expressed as much in a Facebook post, writing that, unlike Mr. Coates, \u201cBaldwin\u2019s painful self-examination led to collective action and a focus on social movements.\u201d In his view, Mr. Coates\u2019s inattention to the Black Lives Matter movement and political activists in \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d \u201cshows a certain distance\u201d from his subject matter.Mr. Coates counters that he hopes he writes \u201cthings that clarify stuff for people that go to those marches, that clarify things that inspire people who go and think about policy. I necessarily need a little bit of distance.\u201dThe National Book award-winning author Jesmyn Ward, who edited \u201cThe Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race\u201d last year, had a similar response: \u201cWriters use the weapons that they have at hand,\u201d she said, \u201cand though I know that there are many writers that do attend protests \u2014 I\u2019ve attended protests in my time \u2014 perhaps Ta-Nehisi feels that his most powerful weapon and his most appropriate weapon is his voice.\u201dThere has been criticism, also, of the conspicuous absence of women\u2019s experiences in Mr. Coates\u2019s work. In a review of \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d Buzzfeed\u2019s Shani O. Hilton wrote, \u201cBlack womanhood in real life isn\u2019t \u2014 as it largely is in \u2018Between the World and Me\u2019 \u2014 about beating and loving and mourning black men.\u201d She lamented that Mr. Coates\u2019s book, which is specifically about the lives of black males, \u201cis one that many readers will use to define blackness.\u201dIt\u2019s a position that Mr. Coates has seriously considered, but he said that the book focused on black male life because \u201cit was the story I had.\u201d He\u2019d been mulling for years over the death of his friend, Prince Jones, a black man, and the decision to address the book to his son necessarily skewed its perspective. Ultimately, he said, \u201cwe just need more books.\u201dYet Mr. Coates\u2019s work has resonated deeply. In a telephone conversation, Dr. Painter said that his vision of the United States was congruent with her own. \u201cI think the education that he gave himself \u2014 his upbringing and his reading as a student, his reading since that time \u2014 all of that has given him a really solid intellectual basis for what he\u2019s talking about.\u201dChris Jackson, Mr. Coates\u2019s longtime editor and the publisher of One World, an imprint of Random House, said that Mr. Coates\u2019s curiosity is \u201cmatched with a kind of obsessiveness.\u201d\u201cHe would read 1,000 books about the Civil War. He would talk to every scholar,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019d read novels and slave narratives. Then, at a certain point, he started to synthesize all this information into some conclusions about, \u2018what does this mean?\u2019\u201dIn 2015, just before \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d was published and became a sensation, Mr. Coates and his family moved to Paris. He experienced the frenzy surrounding his book \u201cthrough a filter,\u201d and the presidential election from a distance. He noted a \u201cclear difference\u201d between how his blackness was perceived in Paris; there, his Americanness was the most conspicuous part of his identity. Mr. Coates laughs off the parallel to Baldwin\u2019s time in Paris, saying that the move was his wife\u2019s idea and \u201cnot at all\u201d inspired by the famed intellectual\u2019s experiences.He returned to the United States last year, ill-prepared for his newfound celebrity. He started to receive invitations to \u201csecret rich people meetings.\u201d He was offered opportunities unrelated to his work as a journalist: to direct music videos (which he turned down) and write comic books and screenplays (which he accepted). His appearances became spectacles, and he found it strange for people to clap for him when he walked into a room.\u201cI can tell you with a fair degree of certainty that Ta-Nehisi never wanted to be famous,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, who has known Mr. Coates for more than two decades. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s been difficult for him, because you want to have people engage with you and engage your work, but it\u2019s also put a huge target on his back.\u201dDuring our conversation, Mr. Coates said, \u201cWhat I have to accept is that I\u2019m a part of it now.\u201d He added: \u201cNobody thinks \u2018He\u2019s from West Baltimore.\u2019 Nobody thinks, \u2018He dropped out of school.\u2019 Nobody sees that anymore.\u201dAs to what he plans to do next, Mr. Coates mentions his continued collaboration with Marvel Comics on the Black Panther comic book series, which \u201csatisfies the kid in me\u201d and is \u201cthe place where I can go to do something that sort of feels private again.\u201d He was tapped to write a screenplay called \u201cWrong Answer,\u201d which will be directed by Ryan Coogler and is based on the standardized test cheating scandal that occurred in Atlanta public schools from 2005 to 2012.He is also working on a novel, due by the end of the year. The project is tightly under wraps, though his editor, Mr. Jackson, described it as \u201chistorical\u201d with \u201celements of the fantastical,\u201d and Mr. Coates said it deals with race.He has plans to return to Paris as much as he can, but when asked if he would ever stay, he says: \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. The war is here. The war is right here.\u201dAn article on Sept. 30 about the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates misidentified an audience member who asked him a question at an event in Harlem. The question was from Adrian Hopkins, not from the filmmaker Barry Jenkins. (Mr. Hopkins works for The New York Times, but was not reporting on the event.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruling Conservative-Led Bloc Wins Norway\u2019s National Elections", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSLO \u2014 The coalition led by the center-right Conservative Party won the final round of Norway\u2019s national elections on Monday, in what was seen as a referendum on taxes, immigration, energy policy and European integration.In Norway, which has multiple parties and proportional voting, it is effectively impossible for any party to secure an outright majority.Before the election, the Green Party, which advocates curbing Arctic oil exploration, seemed to have be gaining popularity and there was speculation that it could provide the edge to a Labor-led government. But the Greens won just one seat in Parliament, which is what they had before.As in Britain, which historically has had close ties to Norway, relations with Europe are a touchy subject, as is immigration. Norway\u2019s population of 5.3 million is still fairly homogeneous, but it is becoming increasingly diverse.The right-wing Progress Party, founded in 1973, is more moderate than its counterparts in Scandinavia: the far-right Sweden Democrats and the Danish People\u2019s Party, which are largely considered outside the mainstream. Unlike those parties, the Progress Party has been part of day-to-day governance, controlling major portfolios like finance, transportation and oil.\u201cThe four years of coalition government has tamed the Progress Party and made it harmless,\u201d Mr. Baldersheim said.In any event, the New Parliament will include more women than ever before. On Tuesday night, the Norwegian news agency NTB estimated that 70 of the 169 seats would go to women, meaning that female representation in Parliament for the first time would pass 40 percent.Mr. Gahr Store, 57, unusual for a Labor politician, is the heir to a fortune, in fireplace manufacturing. He has been criticized in the press for investing in overseas venture capital funds that do not abide by rules as strict as those followed by the sovereign wealth fund, which is commonly called the Oil Fund. Mr. Gahr Store, who has served as foreign minister and health minister, has also faced accusations in the news media of not paying full taxes on improvements to a country home that he made in 2011.Both candidates were active on social media. Mr. Gahr Store\u2019s campaign posted footage of him voting on Facebook. Ms. Solberg used the platform to post a message thanking the Norwegian people \u201cfor letting me be your prime minister the last four years.\u201dOn YouTube, as part of a campaign to stimulate youth engagement, the candidates were challenged to do impromptu sketches. (Ms. Solberg drew a school and a treasure chest to reflect her commitment to educational improvements and lower taxes; Mr. Gahr Store drew figures and a map that he said depicted his commitment to lowering climate emissions.)His party won 18 seats, up from 10.Voter turnout in Norway is typically high; in the 2013 elections, it exceeded 78 percent.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the time that polls close in Norway\u2019s elections.

W.

SMS texts sent through cell networks will not be allowed, per regulatory restrictions, the airline said.Delta trumpeted its service, saying it would be the first global carrier based in the United States to offer onboard texting without charging for online access.The Delta service announced on Wednesday will not support photo or video files. Text messaging will be available as a subset of Delta\u2019s Wi-Fi offerings; customers will still have to pay to browse the web.But the ability to communicate with the ground free of charge is appealing for many types of jet-setters.Texting can help coordinate pickup times so that loved ones don\u2019t have to loop around the airport waiting out a flight delay.

{"Headline": "In Power Move at Uber, Travis Kalanick Appoints 2 to Board", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The divisions between Uber and its former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, are widening.But behind the scenes, Mr. Kalanick and Uber\u2019s board continued to wrestle over who had control of the privately held company through the amount of stock they owned and the voting rights that those shares conferred.On Thursday, Uber and one of its investors, Goldman Sachs, made a proposal to the board that would reduce Mr. Kalanick\u2019s voting power at the company, according to people briefed on the negotiations, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The board could vote on the proposal as early as Tuesday, these people said.In response, Mr. Kalanick made a move late Friday to reassert his control. The former chief, who holds outsize voting rights at Uber, said he had added Ursula Burns, a former chief executive of Xerox, and John Thain, a former chief executive of Merrill Lynch and the New York Stock Exchange, to the eight-member board.Because of the proposal to reduce voting rights, it is \u201cessential that the full board be in place for proper deliberation to occur,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in a statement.In its own statement, Uber said Mr. Kalanick\u2019s move \u201ccame as a complete surprise to Uber and its board.\u201d That is why, it added, the company is \u201cworking to put in place world-class governance.\u201dThe back-and-forth also presents a problem for Mr. Khosrowshahi, who has to deal with a deeply divided board. Mr. Khosrowshahi had already had a taste of Uber\u2019s ups and downs in recent days, when the company was told that it would lose its operating license for London, one of the biggest cities where it does business.The power plays on Uber\u2019s board are centered on a move made by Mr. Kalanick last year that allowed him to obtain outsize control of several board seats. At the time, he got Benchmark to approve an amendment to the company\u2019s charter that gave him the right to nominate three new directors to add to Uber\u2019s eight-member board. Mr. Kalanick occupies one of those seats, and he has contended that he gets the right to fill the other two seats.To prevent Mr. Kalanick from exercising that right, Uber and Goldman Sachs proposed on Thursday to reduce his voting rights. If approved, the proposal would also reduce voting power for other early Uber shareholders and board members, including Benchmark, Lowercase Capital and Menlo Ventures.Uber is also negotiating a sale of some of its existing shares to new investors, including the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Goldman Sachs is also one of the financial firms that is managing Uber\u2019s potential share sale to SoftBank.The fight over voting speaks to the balance of power at young Silicon Valley start-ups. In recent years, entrepreneurs have asked for \u2014 and been given \u2014 more voting rights by venture capitalists and other investors who are eager to get into a hot deal. Other companies, like Snap and Facebook, also have structures that allow their founders to hold disproportionate voting power.These sorts of bare-knuckle fights usually unfold behind the scenes in venture capital, where investors and founders have incentives to maintain a positive public persona. Entrepreneurs start companies more than once, and have to tap the same pool of firms for money over time. And the firms need to be perceived as founder friendly in order to cozy up to the most promising deals.Follow Katie Benner on Twitter @ktbenner and Mike Isaac @MikeIsaacAdvertisement"}

He once called former Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, the first gay man to hold the post, a pedophile. Mr. Louis left Parliament in 2014.Mr. Louis was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and fined over $20,000 at his 2015 trial, which centered on online statements he made that questioned the number of Jews killed in gas chambers during the Holocaust. After that sentence was changed on Wednesday, he celebrated on Facebook and apologized \u201cto anyone who may have been hurt by my remarks.\u201dMr. Louis is a marginal figure in Belgium, but political observers said his case illustrated growing worries about anti-Semitism as well as the different approaches that the United States and Europe have taken in response to the expression of far-right views.That is in sharp contrast to the United States, where the right to express far-right views, including neo-Nazi beliefs and white supremacy, is protected by the First Amendment.In his statement on Wednesday, Mr. Louis said he would obey the ruling and \u201crepent every year in a death camp.\u201d In addition to being \u201cvery educational and very powerful on a human level,\u201d he said the experience would also be a chance to \u201cdenounce current genocides.\u201d That is language he has used in the past to refer to Israel\u2019s actions in the Gaza Strip.\u201cLaurent Louis is generally considered as a baffoon,\u201d said Dave Sinardet, a professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels. \u201cHe unites Belgian politicians all across the board in the sense that none of them take him seriously.\"But Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta, said even fringe figures should be taken seriously. She called his sentence \u201cunusual.\u201dMr. Sinardet said Mr. Louis\u2019s election to Parliament in 2010 was \u201can accident\u201d caused in part by the complexity of Belgium\u2019s byzantine political system, which divides power between the country\u2019s French- and Dutch-speaking communities.Mr. Louis joined and left or was expelled from several parties during his time in Parliament, often because of his \u201cborderline racist declarations,\u201d Mr. Sinardet said.In the speech, Mr. Louis said Zionism was \u201cworse\u201d than Nazism and falsely claimed that the Talmud compared non-Jews to monkeys and that it \u201cauthorizes\u201d Jews to rape non-Jewish children, according to a video of the speech posted to YouTube. Defending Mr. Dieudonn\u00e9, he said the Holocaust was \u201cone of the only historical facts that cannot be called into question.\u201dAt trial in 2015, online statements Mr. Louis made in support of the French far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen were found to have violated a law against the minimization, justification or approval of the Holocaust.\u201cTo summarize, I have invited the people who follow me to ask about Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s condemnation of his remarks with regard to the gas chambers, which he considered to be a \u2018detail\u2019 of the Second World War,\u201d Mr. Louis wrote in an email on Wednesday night. He said he had never denied the existence of the Holocaust, \u201cbut I have questioned the essential role of the gas chambers in this extermination and this questioning is prohibited by Belgian law.\u201dMs. Lipstadt said that defense was common among Holocaust deniers and others on the far right who \u201cmarket\u201d their beliefs by posing as reasonable people who are simply asking hard questions.\u201cYou could have someone who says, \u2018Look I know the Holocaust happened, I don\u2019t believe in that, but I think maybe it wasn\u2019t as bad, maybe it was exaggerated,\u2019\u201d she said. And she worried that Mr. Louis could use his sentence to make more inflammatory claims.\u201cWhen he said, \u2018The court has recognized my talents as a writer?\u2019 Give me a break,\u201d she said. \u201cCan he write, \u2018Well, I went and I didn\u2019t see anybody being killed\u2019 or, \u2018These gas chambers were incapable of killing someone?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Chicago Teenager Is Found Dead in a Walk-In Hotel Freezer, Mystery Lingers", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA young woman was found dead in a hotel freezer on the outskirts of Chicago over the weekend, and the many unanswered questions surrounding the investigation have led to widespread speculation.The police have said that the woman, Kenneka Jenkins, 19, attended a party at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in the Village of Rosemont, Ill., just northwest of Chicago, on Friday night. She was declared missing on Saturday, and investigators found her body in a walk-in freezer on Sunday morning. The cause of her death remains unclear.Now, a wide network of amateur online sleuths has taken up interest in the case. Videos from the party have been viewed millions of times on social media. And many people have used Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to criticize the police for acting too slowly.Some speculated that the authorities had not made the investigation into Ms. Jenkins\u2019s disappearance a priority because she was black.Videos from the party that Ms. Jenkins attended seem to show several people around her age talking, drinking and dancing in a hotel room.Poor audio quality and plenty of cross talk make the conversations difficult to understand, but some viewers claimed that they could hear people discussing rape and murder.\u201cThere are literally dozens of conspiracy theories that have been offered and countless people who are attempting to play detective and solve the case as to what happened over there,\u201d Gary Mack, a spokesman for the Village of Rosemont, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.\u201cOur police officers are leaving no stone unturned as far as trying to put all the pieces together.\u201dMs. Jenkins\u2019s mother, Tereasa Martin, said in public appearances that the police took too long to investigate after the family alerted them to the teenager\u2019s disappearance early on Saturday morning.The police formally recognized Ms. Jenkins as a missing person shortly after 1 p.m. on Saturday, and her body was found in the freezer around midnight, according to a statement from the Rosemont Public Safety Department released on Sunday.At a news conference in front of the hotel on Monday, Ms. Martin suggested that the police did not seem to be on the right track.\u201cThey think that she walked into a cooler, intoxicated, barely able to hold herself up,\u201d she said of the investigators, adding that walk-in freezer doors are heavy and difficult to open.\u201cI believe it was foul play involved,\u201d she said.Detective Joe Balogh, a spokesman for the Rosemont police, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that he could not share details about the case because the investigation was continuing.\u201cOur detectives are actively working to interview all the subjects who were involved that night,\u201d he said, adding that all relevant social media footage was also under review.The police are also reviewing surveillance videos from the Crowne Plaza Hotel and awaiting the results of a toxicology report on Ms. Jenkins, which is being carried out by the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office. A spokeswoman for the office said that determining a cause of death could take weeks.At the news conference on Monday, Ms. Martin extended a plea to anyone who might know anything about how her daughter ended up dead in a hotel freezer.\u201cPlease, please, please, I beg you, let me know something,\u201d she said. \u201cHelp me.\u201dPublic safety officials said in a statement on Wednesday that they were keeping Ms. Martin up-to-date on the investigation, which has not been deemed a criminal investigation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Offers Concessions to Europe After Record Antitrust Fine", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle announced concessions on Wednesday to European regulators over its online shopping service, signaling a new willingness by the Silicon Valley company to bow to tightening pressures from governments around the world.Google said the changes would be introduced early on Thursday morning, meeting a deadline to open up its shopping platform to greater competition or potentially face further fines from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm. As a result, about a dozen shopping sites from companies besides Google could become more visible and accessible.\u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping,\u201d Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said.The fine against Google in June was among the most aggressive moves against an American technology company taken anywhere in the world. It immediately confirmed Europe\u2019s role as the Western world\u2019s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany\u2019s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.\u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,\u201d said Mr. Verney.The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.Google would like the measure it\u2019s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google\u2019s formidable search platform.Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.Any decision to separate traditional web search from other search-related functions, such as shopping for products, looking for travel bookings or seeking restaurant reviews, could reverse a profitable evolution of the company\u2019s moneymaker.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Weird Brilliance of Joaquin Phoenix", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "He\u2019s the greatest screen actor of his generation, but also a reluctant celebrity.Supported byHis performances are inquisitive and improvisatory, and he\u2019s resolutely a screen actor. (When in talks about doing a play, Phoenix learned how long the run would be: \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018At least five months?!\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re outta your mind!\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019) Time means more to him now than it ever has. When asked if he\u2019d ever do a Marvel movie, he says, \u2018\u2018Something that\u2019s going to demand six months of my time? I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u2019 Part of his reluctance to discuss acting is that he works in an intuitive, untrained way, lately in idiosyncratic, large-scale auteur movies helmed by James Gray and Paul Thomas Anderson. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s just instinct,\u2019\u2019 he says. He has no idea where his craft comes from. He\u2019s suspicious of the actor who \u2018\u2018nails\u2019\u2019 it, and he doesn\u2019t like rehearsing: \u2018\u2018If I figured it out, I would be much happier and more confident and less anxious every time I work. But I enjoy not figuring it out. Bad acting is being self-conscious. Sometimes it\u2019s a couple weeks on set before it feels like I find something.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018The best directors I\u2019ve worked with always adjusted to what was happening with the actor,\u2019\u2019 he says. For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director\u2019s hands \u2014 it\u2019s ultimately the director\u2019s world he\u2019s entering. \u2018\u2018On set I\u2019ve seen things when actors have given great \u00adperformances and once it\u2019s cut together you don\u2019t feel it, you don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve done stuff that I thought was garbage and then it\u2019s put together and it\u2019s really effective.\u2019\u2019 He says this with a combination of sincerity and befuddlement, as if he\u2019s caught between two truths. \u2018\u2018When I was younger I thought the idea was to construct a character, figure out its arc \u2014 now I think arcs are kind of BS. The director creates the arc.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s one of his finest performances \u2014 naked, hilarious, obscene, an act of mad self-immolation. Any trace of magnetic sexy leading man is erased: fat and bearded with a matted rat\u2019s nest of dreadlocks, disheveled and ranting, Phoenix is at the center of this elaborate hoax, one so poker-faced that it caused epic confusion in the entertainment press as it was being shot. Playful but lacerating, it\u2019s a riveting spectacle of celebrity burnout that seems both real and staged, and for anyone who has been in proximity to the L.A.-N.Y.-Vegas-Miami orbit of youngish celebrity, the movie is unnervingly authentic. It reaches its peak with the infamous David Letterman interview with \u2018\u2018Joaquin,\u2019\u2019 ostensibly there to promote \u2018\u2018Two Lovers\u2019\u2019: sullen, mumbling, chewing gum, refusing to remove his sunglasses, barely interacting with Dave \u2014 the audience tittering uncomfortably \u2014 and then lashing out at him. The interview made Phoenix more famous than he\u2019d ever been, and was endlessly parodied around the globe.When asked why he felt the need to make \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Still Here,\u2019\u2019 he says the process was \u2018\u2018terribly humiliating\u2019\u2019 but that he thought it was important to do. Phoenix says it started as a joke, a 10-\u00adminute short in the vein of a \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\u2019 skit, but that Affleck pushed Phoenix to announce he was retiring from acting to a TV reporter. Phoenix didn\u2019t think it would go anywhere, and instead it went viral, and the idea for an actual feature grew from the media\u2019s response: the notion being that Phoenix gives up his career and then desperately tries to get it back, all of this invented but played straight in public. Phoenix was aware the movie might fail but it was also the ultimate distillation of how he likes to work. \u2018\u2018An amazing experience: not finding your light, not hitting the mark, not memorizing lines,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It allowed me to be bold in my decisions instead of being safe.\u2019\u2019For two years after, he didn\u2019t work, even after admitting \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019\u2019 was a stunt. There were offers, but nothing he would have considered. When he returned it was as Freddie Quell in \u2018\u2018The Master,\u2019\u2019 the drunken disciple of Lancaster Dodd, an L. Ron Hubbard-esque cult leader played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Many consider this Phoenix\u2019s greatest performance \u2014 he had lost all the weight from \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019\u2019 and appears taut, almost gaunt. Perhaps his most powerful scene on film is the \u2018\u2018processing\u2019\u2019 sequence, with Dodd intensely interrogating Quell about his troubled childhood, the camera staying close on Phoenix as his innocence morphs into possessed rage.HE ADMITS HE HAS a mortgage and that he needs to work but adds that \u2018\u2018I never did anything for money,\u2019\u2019 and when you look over his filmography, you realize this is probably true. When asked why he decided to play Jesus in the upcoming \u2018\u2018Mary Magdalene,\u2019\u2019 a retelling of the New Testament story by the director Garth Davis, he says, \u2018\u2018I was looking for something meaningful. I was looking for an experience. I was friends with Rooney.\u2019\u2019 (Rooney Mara plays Mary Magdalene in the movie. The two are now a couple.) Jesus, in the film, is \u2018\u2018just a man\u2019\u2019 and playing him was \u2018\u2018just instinct, just a gut feeling.\u2019\u2019Phoenix\u2019s life is remarkably simple compared to what people might imagine. He lives with Mara in the Hollywood Hills (he\u2019s never been married and has no children) and is usually asleep by 9 p.m. and up at 6. When he\u2019s not working his daily routine consists of answering emails, \u2018\u2018chilling\u2019\u2019 with his dog, meditating, taking a karate class, eating lunch, reading scripts and dinner \u2014 but for most of last year he\u2019d been on location. He watches documentaries on Netflix (and he watched the 10-hour true-crime doc \u2018\u2018The Staircase\u2019\u2019 recently because Mara wanted to) but rarely watches new movies. When asked if any recent films have excited him, he thinks about it, stuck, and then answers, genuinely surprising himself: \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Moana\u2019! I thought it was beautiful.\u2019\u2019 (He later corrects himself and says it was actually \u2018\u2018The Lost City of Z,\u2019\u2019 James Gray\u2019s latest \u2014 Phoenix has starred in four of Gray\u2019s seven films.)Twelve years ago Phoenix went into rehab for alcoholism. \u2018\u2018I really just thought of myself as a hedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn\u2019t engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to. I was being an idiot, running around, drinking, trying to screw people, going to stupid clubs.\u2019\u2019 There was no intervention, Phoenix says, he just checked himself in. \u2018\u2018I thought rehab was a place where you sat in a Jacuzzi and ate fruit salad. But when I got there they started talking about the 12 steps and I went: \u2018Wait a minute, I\u2019m still gonna smoke weed.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 He offers a startled, questioning look, and then later admits: \u2018\u2018I think at the core of the program is a spirituality that is important to me, but .\u2009.\u2009. I am a hippie, you know.\u2019\u2019 Though he still drinks when he flies (the last drink he had was a month ago on a flight to \u00adLondon) he has stopped smoking marijuana. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s too many things I enjoy doing and I don\u2019t want to wake up feeling hungover.

{"Headline": "Blocked in China, Facebook Is Said to Seek a Shanghai Office", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is blocked in China, but it is feeling comfortable enough there to look for its own place.The social media giant in recent months has quietly scouted for office space in Shanghai, according to two people with knowledge of its efforts there. Those offices would house employees working on Facebook\u2019s effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans.Facebook\u2019s plans are tentative, the people said, and would depend on approval from the Chinese government. But if successful, it would be a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade.\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to questions about the office plans.At the moment, Facebook uses third parties and its own employees to sell ads in China. Because of cybersecurity concerns, Facebook employees run special security software on devices when they travel in China and do not have access to secretive or critical business information.Opening an office in Shanghai allows more support for its employees when they are in China, but also raises security questions. The Building 8 teams, which focus on their own hardware projects, would have less need to access sensitive Facebook data when in China, one person said. The office could also help Facebook work more with local Chinese companies.If it opens a Shanghai office, Facebook would not be the only Western internet company banned in the country to have some space there. Google, which pulled its servers out of China in 2010 after it decided to stop censoring search results, retained offices in Beijing and Shanghai that support both advertising and research and development. Google still maintains extensive advertising sales and research facilities there.Facebook over the past three years has pulled out all the stops to court the Chinese government and gain approval for its network. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has showed off his Mandarin at one of the country\u2019s top universities and has directly courted Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.The office search comes just months after Facebook released the Chinese-language version of Moments. That app, called Colorful Balloons, originally went largely unnoticed but briefly rose into the top 50 in the photo and video section of China\u2019s iPhone app store after The New York Times reported its release last month, according to app research company App Annie.Like other cities in China, Shanghai has been eager to attract technology start-ups and other internet-related investments.That the Colorful Balloons app has not come down could be a sign that Facebook has done something right with the government, said Teng Bingsheng, a professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. Opening an office, if it happens, would be another sign.\u201cIt has symbolic meaning,\u201d Mr. Teng said, \u201cbecause it must be the result of good communication with the government.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The scent of it wafted through my childhood home for hours as the meat braised slowly, with the familiar bouquet of bay leaf and onion, the beefy perfume of the simmering broth.Granted, this was quite a few years ago, in the fairy-tale land of brisket and noodle kugel, where all was right with the world.My mother was a brisket expert, with a method from which she never veered. First, she would shower the meat with a popular commercial brand of \u201cseasoned salt,\u201d then slice up an onion or two. The brisket was plunked into a large copper-bottomed Revere Ware skillet (she had the whole set, down to the smallest saucepan). A bay leaf and a couple of cups of water were the only other ingredients \u2014 though it\u2019s entirely possible there was a beef bouillon cube tossed in too.The lid went on, and the meat was placed in the oven at a low temperature. Three or four hours later, out came a perfect brisket, deeply flavored, moist and succulent. It was a foolproof recipe with no bells or whistles. The only variable was the meat itself. If it was well marbled with fat, the result was juicy; if it was too lean, it could be dry. Fatter was always preferable.Like beef short ribs, a prime brisket is no longer the cheap cut it once was. But the investment is well worth it. Among its other virtues, it tastes best prepared a day or two in advance and reheated.Cooking a brisket this week, I aimed for the benchmark example I was raised on. There were minor differences. One was making my own seasoned salt with salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne. Adding a few cloves and allspice berries seemed appropriate. I also wanted tons of caramelized stewed onions, which I cooked separately on top of the stove.While my brisket could not, of course, compete with the glorified-in-memory perfection of my mother\u2019s, the heady aroma swirling around my apartment came pretty close.cookingAdvertisement"}

So I assume people just thought I was lazy.Far too often, I would regard an off-the-cuff remark by a work colleague, a roll of the eyes when I offered an idea at a meeting, or a sigh when I arrived late, as aggressive and threatening, an insult directed toward me.At another office where I was working as a commercial copywriter it still pains me to recall the time someone asked what I was listening to on my headphones. When I replied \u201cColdplay\u201d and my colleagues all laughed, I wasn\u2019t sure why. Maybe they found me as depressing as the artists I listened to? Once again it felt like I was being bullied. I quit that job shortly afterward.To this day I am unsure if I was a victim of bullying in the office or just overly sensitive to others.And a 9-to-5 office role is relentless. It doesn\u2019t allow me the flexibility to see a therapist on a regular schedule. I also often forgot general medical checkups, and many times forgot to re-order my medication at the pharmacy, which would send me into a panic attack.Luckily, every office has its own underdog or \u201cpecked hen.\u201d They usually gravitated to me as a kindred spirit, taking me aside to calm me down or nip out for a cigarette.I remember on one occasion catching the girl who sat next to me glancing at my computer screen to see what I was working on. But she held the glance for about 10 seconds, which seemed like a really long time, more like an intrusive stare. I got very upset and sent a strongly worded email to the company manager, with a few line managers cc\u2019d for good measure. The email was so strongly worded that my colleague had tears in her eyes when she was called in about it and was granted permission to leave work for the day. She even brought some chocolate to say sorry to me and mentioned more than once that she was Christian.Once I left that job she unfriended me on Facebook, on my birthday. Even though by that point she knew I had mental health problems.When I got my dream job as a fashion writer in London, at a very decent salary, the \u201cflights of ideas\u201d that are part of my illness, compounded by the restlessness brought on by my medications, sabotaged my success. I\u2019d been there for two weeks when I asked if it was possible I could take a six-month leave to work as a trainee reporter at a local newspaper in Hawaii. That wasn\u2019t allowed, but two weeks later I took three days of holiday and a weekend away to travel to Paris to write a deodorant review for a small, independent magazine. I took another week off soon after to host writing workshops for people with disabilities.My boss was very understanding, and I did last in that job for 18 months but ended up resigning to be closer to my mother, who was having health problems. My office goodbye card was memorable: Even though I hadn\u2019t told many people about my condition, all the notes went along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ll miss the madness.\u201dAn important lesson I have learned by overcoming adversity in the workplace and learning to live with mental illness is that we can build castles with the stones that life throws at us. I now work from home as a freelance writer, at hours to suit, which allows me the flexibility to get the regular therapy sessions and medical checkups that I need.I mostly write about mental illness. I am also writing my first book, \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Sanity,\u201d with a highly regarded professor of psychiatry.I made just $6,260 last year as a freelance writer. But I\u2019ve seen very real and positive results.My psychiatric diagnosis has changed from paranoid schizophrenia to schizoaffective disorder. People with schizoaffective disorder are considered more social than those with a schizophrenia diagnosis but have occasional \u201cmood swings.\u201dMy new work life, along with therapy, has also taught me that qualities such as confidence as well as work-based skills can be learned and built on.Perhaps most important, I\u2019ve come to accept that I am a work in progress.Erica Crompton is a freelance writer and mental health campaigner from Staffordshire, England.Advertisement"}

We were supposed to choose our favorite Ashbery line and write something about it. I found it impossible to choose just one line \u2014 not only because there are so many good ones, but because, really, in an Ashbery poem, the action is always in transit, always hovering somewhere between the last line and the next in a sort of quantum superposition. I chose a passage from \u201cThe Other Tradition.\u201d I\u2019ll include it here because it seems, now, a fitting epitaph:Meaning in an Ashbery poem is always about to arrive like the \u201cstudious\u201d butterfly that settles all too briefly (or doesn\u2019t), then veers off. A butterfly is never jaded! The reader arrives in the wake of some event, perhaps momentous, perhaps quotidian. Who knows now?

Klausner, a facial plastic surgeon with a practice in New York.But as with any new products you\u2019ll be introducing so close to your wedding date, play it safe and do a skin-patch test first before applying to your face. Dr. Klausner suggests testing on the inner wrist. \u201cThe skin there is thinner, less exposed to the sun,\u201d she said, \u201cand is similar to the skin on your face.\u201d\u201cStress shows on your skin, which can lead to dryness, flakiness, blotchiness and acne,\u201d said Dr. Melissa K.

Cortisol breaks down collagen, weakens facial elasticity and increases inflammation and oil production, among other unwanted effects.\u201cPampering yourself with low-impact, mini-like spa treatments the night before is a good way to naturally lower cortisol while taking a moment to be good to yourself and focus on your skin,\u201d Dr. Levin said.You\u2019ve already done all the hard work.

{"Headline": "Avoiding Cameras While Training the Lens on Food", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Pete Wells, The Times\u2019s restaurant critic, discussed the tech he is using.How has tech transformed the world of dining?There are lots of incremental, behind-the-scenes changes that affect restaurants more than consumers, such as more sophisticated reservation systems and point-of-sale software, but I think the most powerful, sweeping change has come from digital photography hooked up to the internet. Photography is now the main way we communicate about restaurant cooking. As a word guy I hate to say this, but it\u2019s true.Now everybody is installing pin spots in the ceiling pointing straight down at the table, which is why you see all these very sharp and high-contrast pictures of plates on Instagram. The restaurants are doing this because it\u2019s largely free marketing. (Some Instagrammers are so popular that restaurants will invite them in for a comped meal, so it\u2019s not entirely free.) I was told that one major restaurant publicity firm in New York has a full-time employee who does nothing but help restaurants with Instagram.This solves one of the main problems that restaurants used to have in the days when \u201cold\u201d media was the only game in town: How do you keep people talking about your place after the initial buzz dies down?Besides the marketing, there are creative implications. For one thing, chefs are much more focused now on sending out food that photographs well. So I end up eating a lot of flowers and leaves that don\u2019t really taste like much but make the plate more colorful, because most cooked food is brown. Ditto all the boards and slates and rocks that are being asked to stand in for plates.It has also sped up the rate at which ideas about food travel from one place to another. Chefs don\u2019t just use photography for marketing. They are also documenting their work for their peers; you see this in the way Ren\u00e9 Redzepi in Copenhagen uses Instagram. It\u2019s one reason his style has spread around the world in the span of just a few years.And how has it changed the way you do your job? What are the pros and cons?The best thing about having everybody take pictures of food is that I can do it without giving myself away. I used to be really self-conscious when I took out my phone; I\u2019d run to the restroom and take surreptitious notes in the stall. Now I just snap away all night long, and I look like everybody else. And photography is the first stage of my note-taking now. After I get home I reconstruct my impressions of the meal, starting with my pictures of my food and the menu. When I started this job, a former critic advised me to steal menus when I could get away with it, and that\u2019s completely unnecessary now.What\u2019s your opinion on Yelp, where everyone is a wannabe food critic?The basic problem is that Yelp was built to reward frequent posting rather than knowledge or insight or expertise. And yet there are people on Yelp who know a lot about food and eat around and have a pretty solid basis for comparison. I find that Yelp is most useful with Korean, Chinese and Japanese food, because, for a number of reasons, there tend to be a lot of Yelpers who know those cuisines pretty well.I don\u2019t. I almost never eat at home, and when I do, I want to cook. I did use Caviar in the context of a restaurant review a few weeks ago and was pretty happy with how well it worked.Sites like Yelp give people plenty of information about restaurants. Yet many restaurants still have their own websites. Is this necessary?The most valuable thing a restaurant can do on its website is post the current menu and drinks lists, with prices. All the other data you might want, and there\u2019s not really very much, can be served up much more efficiently by Google, although I still think website designers who don\u2019t put the restaurant\u2019s address and phone number and hours right on the home page should be sued for malpractice.As our food critic, you have to stay unrecognized when you try new restaurants. How do you do that in an era that demands us to sacrifice privacy on the internet?This isn\u2019t a major issue. People are always surprised when I say that, but it\u2019s one of the things that has been least affected by technology.Now the fidelity and resolution are higher, but the picture of me that most restaurants seem to have on their wall is about 10 years old. There are a few more recent shots, taken across a dining room while I was eating, that are in circulation, but they\u2019re pretty terrible. My friends know they\u2019re not supposed to put pictures of me on Facebook. I don\u2019t take selfies, but I probably wouldn\u2019t be a selfie guy even if I had another job.Most of the time when I\u2019m recognized it\u2019s because somebody is working in that restaurant who waited on me in another place I\u2019ve reviewed. I don\u2019t get caught by technology; I get caught by human memory. It\u2019s sort of reassuring, I guess.Advertisement"}

Watching the esteemed leader\u2019s head turning jerkily, like an old electric fan, from teleprompter to teleprompter, I almost felt pity. His is the Age of Indecency.We\u2019ve had a big fall. For the perpetrators of the attack on America, the biggest success has been the injection of fear into the national psyche. Not even they could imagine how social media could turn fear into contagion and how the politics of fear would help propel a buffoon with feral instincts to the White House.Looking back over the years since the attack that bright September morning \u2014 it was my daughter Adele\u2019s 4th birthday and she had just recovered from an infection so serious I had to hold her little body while doctors performed a spinal tap \u2014 I am reminded of lines from Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises.\u201d\u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\u201d Bill asked.\u201cTwo ways,\u201d Mike said. \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201dFirst, there was the downward glide: the misbegotten war, the soldiers and shoppers, financial implosion, impunity for the mighty, recession, anxiety and polarization. Then Americans, and not only Americans, decided it was better to blow things up than have more of the same. That\u2019s when things precipitated.The esteemed leader won even though Americans know he makes stuff up and wants a victorious small-to-medium-sized war that will allow him to proclaim American greatness restored. People do crazy things. They invade Russia, for example. Just look at history. Trump might think bombing Iran is his ticket in 2020.What is all the fear about? It\u2019s the loss of sanctuary. Menace could be anywhere since it came out of a clear blue sky. It\u2019s the loss of victory. There is none to be had. It\u2019s the loss of confidence. America\u2019s power is greater than its ability to use it. It\u2019s the loss of community. Technology is a great connector but also a great isolator. It\u2019s the loss of self-worth. Life in the Facebook age can become an endless invitation to feel inferior or unloved.All of this has fed a tissue of fear and disquiet easily exploited by the esteemed leader, whose instincts are above all for human weakness.In \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Hemingway wrote something else: \u201cIt is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to shrug off the darkening skies. The worst of 9/11, almost a generation on, is the feeling that the perpetrators won. They didn\u2019t buckle Western freedom and democracy, but they injured them. They disoriented the West. They sucked some of the promise out of a new century.The assassins of Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi and John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King took the lives of great men but did not destroy their ideas. Perhaps they reinforced the immortality of those ideas. The assassin of Yitzhak Rabin and the mass murderers of 9/11 dispatched by Osama bin Laden were, however, more successful.And Humpty Dumpty wants to build a wall he can sit on to contemplate xenophobia and Islamophobia.I broke down a couple of days after 9/11 when I saw an image of a woman\u2019s ultrasound stuck on a subway wall at 42nd Street with the words: \u201cLooking for the father of this child.\u201d Perhaps, in retrospect, my sobs were for all the innocence lost that day, the dreams unborn.Adele was very brave through the spinal tap.

Not bad for a small country \u2014 except that all of them left Hungary to make their lives and careers elsewhere.The United States provides the opposite example. The American economy is 12 percent larger today than it was at the time of the financial crisis. We\u2019re also taking in roughly half a million legal new arrivals a year. The foot-voting continues, and we\u2019re still coming out on top.A common American conceit is that we attract brilliant foreigners because we have brilliant things: great universities, vast financial resources, a dynamic economy, high-tech. That gets things mostly backward. It\u2019s because we have brilliant foreigners that we have those things in the first place. Google. Comcast. eBay. Kraft. Pfizer. AT&T. They all had immigrants as founders.Opponents of a liberal immigration policy often insist they welcome legal immigrants and only object to illegal ones. Rubbish. The immigration reform bill introduced in Congress this year by Republicans Tom Cotton and David Perdue and endorsed by Donald Trump aims to cut legal immigration by half.Restrictionists also argue that we need to favor newcomers with \u201cskills\u201d and educational credentials. More rubbish. Jan Koum arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine in 1992 as a 16-year-old boy with his mother, living off food stamps. She worked as a babysitter. He later dropped out of college. In 2009 he came up with an idea for a mobile messaging app. Five years later Facebook purchased WhatsApp for $22 billion.Should it make any difference to WhatsApp\u2019s billion-plus users that Koum arrived in the United States legally? And if it turned out that he hadn\u2019t, should he be required to leave the country, presumably so he can pay income tax \u2014 and create jobs \u2014 in his native Ukraine?That would be self-defeating. But it\u2019s the fate that may soon await 800,000 or so young people who were brought without visas to the United States as children, grew up in the country, in some cases only speak English, and now face deportation because the Trump administration seems poised to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that allowed them to stay in school or their jobs.Lose that faith, and lose what\u2019s best about America, too.Advertisement"}

They have stitched together a do-it-yourself operation: Mr. Marcy, the winemaker, buys grapes from a network of 12 vineyards, all within an hour of the farm, and tends the vegetable crops, and Ms. Carver, an accomplished artist, looks after the business, including drawing labels, wrapping bottles in paper by hand, marketing, entertaining visitors and raising animals.The Big Table menagerie includes 16 Irish Dexter cattle that are raised for beef, two American Guinea hogs, a couple of horses, six beehives, chickens, assorted dogs and cats, and an old goat who roves the place as a sort of mascot.This is no show farm. Ms. Carver slaughters the hogs for home consumption. I can testify that a leg of Iberico-style ham from Bert, a former denizen, was delicious. To sell the beef commercially, the cattle must be sent to a licensed slaughterhouse, though Ms. Carver takes care of the abrupt conversion of male calves to steers. The chickens and vegetables may be served up for team lunches with the farm\u2019s two employees or meals for the harvest crew.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of continuity and grounding that comes with being connected to the place,\u201d Ms. Carver said.You can sense that in the wines, too, largely pinot noirs and chardonnays that are both charming and delicious, if not always perfectly refined. Their barnlike winery, which they designed and built themselves, was financed partly by crowdfunding. One hundred people gave $1,700 each, for which they received wine and a plaque in the winery. The last and most costly piece, clearing and planting their own vineyard, remains a dream. But they have identified approximately 5 to 15 likely acres on the farm.Big Table is one of many energetic, heartfelt operations that make Oregon such a fascinating place. I\u2019m not one to make grand pronouncements about wine. The subject is too complex \u2014 and the stakes, frankly, too low \u2014 to warrant the sort of bold simplifications that seem to win at politics but lose at any deeper understanding of even this small part of the world.But after spending 10 days here in late July, visiting winemakers, tasting an awful lot of bottles and, incidentally, speaking at the International Pinot Noir Celebration, I can\u2019t help but conclude that Oregon is right now the single most exciting winemaking area in the United States.That is not to say that great things are not happening in the rest of the country. I am fascinated by what producers are achieving all over California; in Walla Walla, Wash.; and in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Great wines are being made in Michigan, in Vermont, in Texas and beyond.Collectively speaking, nowhere else does the level of quality seem so high, the perspectives so diverse or the experimentation so fierce as it is in Oregon right now.Yet pinot noir is not the sole narrative of the Willamette Valley. After a few false starts with chardonnay, the quality in the last decade has gotten better and better, especially in wines with a lean, minerally, energetic style.Oregon has established itself so well that a thriving wine counterculture has arisen, which, if not exactly rebelling against the dominance of pinot noir, is seeking to offer alternatives that are delicious and cheaper.Brianne Day of Day Wines, whose fine pinot noirs from the Willamette are nuanced, also buys grapes like tannat and cabernet franc from the Applegate Valley in the south of Oregon to make almost instinctive blends that are balanced and delicious.During my visit, I tried dolcettos and nebbiolos, assyrtikos and aligot\u00e9s, gew\u00fcrztraminers and others from labels like Holden Wine Company, Franchere Wine Company, Smockshop Band and Hiyu Wine Farm. Many were terrific. Seek them out if you are in the mood to sample some surprising, provocative wines.Part of what I love about Oregon, and the Willamette Valley in particular, is the small scale. Most Willamette wineries are family operations, and the business of the valley is clearly agriculture, not tourism. It has yet to see the large-scale hotels, fancy restaurants and extravagant winery structures that make, say, Napa Valley seem more Disney than farmland.Big wine companies like Jackson Family Wines and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates have started to buy in. This is not a bad thing, but it does bring with it the possibility, at least, that big companies will want to push tourism, and that land values will rise quickly. In which case, dreams like Big Table Farm\u2019s may no longer be possible, even a little bit at a time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Palestinian Gunman Kills 3 Israelis at West Bank Crossing", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAR ADAR, West Bank \u2014 Each weekday scores of Palestinians from the surrounding West Bank villages line up at a yellow metal barrier on the edge of Har Adar, an affluent Israeli border community, awaiting entry for work. That quiet routine was disrupted on Tuesday when one worker opened fire, killing three Israeli security personnel and wounding a fourth.The attacker, a resident of the neighboring Palestinian village of Beit Surik who had regularly worked in Har Adar, was armed with a pistol, according to the police, and was fatally shot at the scene.The victims were identified as a border police officer, Sgt. Solomon Gavria, 20, from Beer Yaakov in central Israel, and two civilian security guards, Yusuf Othman of the nearby Arab-Israeli village of Abu Gosh and Or Arish of Har Adar.The attack on Tuesday shattered weeks of relative calm. While most of the assailants have been young, single Palestinians, often unemployed, the gunman, identified by the authorities as Nimer Mahmoud Ahmed Jamal, 37, did not fit that profile. A father of four, Mr. Jamal had an Israeli-issued permit allowing him to work in Har Adar.Mr. Jamal\u2019s motives appeared to be more personal than ideological. A preliminary investigation indicated that Mr. Jamal \u201chad significant personal and family problems, including those regarding family violence,\u201d Israel\u2019s Shin Bet internal security agency said in a statement. The agency added that Mr. Jamal\u2019s wife fled to Jordan weeks ago, leaving him with their children.In a private Facebook message to his wife that was later shared on social networks and in the news media Mr. Jamal asked her forgiveness and said she had been a good wife and mother.\u201cI am to blame for mistreating her,\u201d he wrote, citing what he called his \u201cfoolish jealousy.\u201dPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel vowed that the assailant\u2019s house would be demolished and that his relatives\u2019 work permits would be revoked.\u201cThis murderous attack is the result, inter alia, of systematic incitement of the Palestinian Authority, and of other elements,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu added in broadcast remarks at the start of a cabinet meeting.The United States Embassy in Tel Aviv and Consulate General in Jerusalem issued a joint statement in English and Arabic saying, \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms today\u2019s horrific attack in Har Adar. We also condemn statements glorifying terrorism and call on all to send a clear message that terrorism must never be tolerated.\u201dTens of thousands of Palestinian laborers enter Israel on a daily basis, with or without permits. Many come to work in home renovations, hotels and other service jobs in Nataf, Maaleh Hahamisha, Qiryat Anavim and other Israeli communities in the vicinity of Har Adar and Abu Gosh.Israeli Jews flock to Abu Gosh, which sits on the Israeli side of the 1967 line, on weekends to shop and eat in the restaurants. Jawdat Ibrahim, a local celebrity who won the jackpot of millions of dollars in the Illinois State Lottery in 1990, then returned to his hometown, said the area was known for \u201cnormal life.\u201dSitting in the Abu Gosh Restaurant, which he owns, he said, \u201cThere is no difference between Abu Gosh, Nataf and Har Adar.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell my children that for two and a half years a terrorist worked in our house,\u201d she said.Most of the Palestinian workers who had already entered Har Adar on Tuesday were sent home early. Yaron Arnon, the secretary and treasurer of Har Adar\u2019s council, said it would be up to the security authorities to decide when to allow them back but added, \u201cNothing will change from our perspective.\u201dYael Cohen, 42, a mother of three who holds workshops for healthy cooking, said a Palestinian man from another neighboring village had been cleaning her home since she moved to Har Adar 10 years ago. Ms. Cohen said he had called her on Tuesday morning, from another house where he was working, and asked her for money, worried that he would not be able to get back in to work for a while. She said she took over some money \u201cbecause I care about him, and I hope he cares about us.\u201dMs. Cohen said she did not know the assailant personally but she did know Mr. Othman, the security guard from Abu Gosh who was killed. Mr. Othman had tried to protect the residents of Har Adar, she said, but \u201cwe did not manage to look after him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Turns out I\u2019m a proud member!\u201d\u2014 Kimberly Mullaney, 54, Maplewood N.J.\u201cIt added stability and predictability to my commute. There were absolutely no cancellations or disruptions, just a bit more crowded.\u201d\u2014 Jimmy Schwecherl, 31, Rockville Centre, N.Y.\u201cThe commute this summer was more mentally than physical exhausting, as there were a lot of steps involved in getting me to my office in Rockefeller Center. What good came out of it? I really appreciate the steps people take to get to work every day. And I certainly appreciate Penn Station a whole lot more!\u201d\u2014 Lauren Mirman, 38, South Orange, N.J.\u201cDuring construction this summer I left the house 20 minutes earlier, which is no easy feat as I try to spend every minute possible with my 2-year-old. But it got me to work before most of my office, which makes for a nice and relaxing start to my morning. I\u2019m going to keep going in early.\u201dLisa Kim, 36, Rockville Centre, N.Y.\u201cMy favorite part of the summer was when my daily evening conductor spoke over the loudspeaker to announce that after already being delayed for 45 minutes, we were going to be stalled again so another train could pass us mid-route. \u2018I would say I\u2019m sorry, but I know you don\u2019t believe us anymore,\u2019 he said, to a train full of laughs.

Tell us in the comments.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Labor Day may have come and gone, but don\u2019t put away your beach blankets just yet.Summery weather \u2014 and a few showers \u2014 are in the forecast this week.But it ain\u2019t all pretty.One model was told she needed to follow a 700-calorie diet.Many were scouted as teenagers, or younger.And some went into debt with the agencies that represented them.The interviews also detailed other problems in the modeling industry, including a lack of diversity (only about 28 percent of models who walked down the runway for fall 2017 collections were models of color) and unfair payment practices (sometimes models are paid in clothes).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Luxury Building Boom Hits Montreal", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetAlong the main shopping street in the area of downtown Montreal known as the Golden Square Mile, Sonya Szczygiel and her husband, John Guinto, have sold beaded bracelets made of semiprecious stones for the last five years.From their kiosk on Saint Catherine Street, near Montreal\u2019s downtown Apple Store, the pair have had front row seats for a transformation playing out in the neighborhood and throughout Montreal.It is one of the many changes that Ms. Szczygiel welcomes. \u201cHigh-end hotels, stores and restaurants attract people with a higher disposable income,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should obviously benefit us and other retailers.\u201dThe current revitalization of the Golden Square Mile mirrors the larger comeback of Montreal.During a period of political instability, starting in the 1980s and leading up to a referendum about Quebec leaving Canada in 1995, many companies became skittish of keeping outposts in Montreal. The Four Seasons, which had opened a hotel in 1976 called Le Quatre Saisons, stopped managing the location in 1994. As businesses left, retail and restaurants, particularly the high-end sector in the Golden Square Mile, suffered.But over the last decade, after the city\u2019s politics had stabilized, companies started to come back. New start-ups have popped up, for example, particularly in the fields of technology, artificial intelligence and gaming. Facebook just announced it is creating an artificial intelligence research lab in Montreal, and last fall Google said that it would open a similar facility there.\u201cThe stable political environment in Montreal these last years, especially when we take into consideration the more unstable global environment created by Brexit and other elections in Europe, has made Montreal more attractive to business and leisure visitors,\u201d said Denis Coderre, Montreal\u2019s mayor.\u201cThe Montreal economy is booming,\u201d Mr. Coderre said.He added that the unemployment rate had reached one of its lowest levels since 2010, the labor force was growing and investments were increasing. New taxes on foreign investors in Toronto and Vancouver also appear to have played a part.But the city also has something else appealing to business, according to J. Allen Smith, the Four Seasons chief executive: \u201ccultural sophistication, European influences and storied history.\u201dPartnering with Carbonleo Real Estate, a Quebec developer and property manager, the Four Seasons project will include a 166-room hotel and 18 condos priced from nearly $3 million to over $12 million. The hotel will be connected to the flagship location for Ogilvy, a high-end department store that is undergoing more than $100 million in renovations and merging with Holt Renfrew, another luxury retailer.Near the new Four Seasons, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel just reopened its doors this July after a $114 million renovation.The Ritz Carlton blazed the path for high-end hoteliers in Montreal. The hotel, which first opened in 1912, reopened in 2013 after renovations that cost about $200 million. Those changes added 45 condos, larger hotel guest rooms and now features Maison Boulud, the first Montreal restaurant of acclaimed French chef Daniel Boulud.Visitors flock to Montreal for business, bachelor and bachelorette parties, as well as music festivals and sports events such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix car race. With four major universities, Montreal also attracts many students and educators.The Golden Square Mile, where the new Four Seasons will sit, is at the foot of the hilly Mont Royal park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted about 16 years after he helped create Central Park in New York. Between 1850 and 1930, some of North America\u2019s wealthiest families built mansions, as well as churches and universities in the Golden Square Mile. Now boutiques, restaurants, theaters, cinemas, art galleries and book stores populate the area.The developers of the new Four Seasons in Montreal, which is set to open next year, expect the shopping to be a big draw. While many high-end hotels feature luxury boutiques on their street level, the Four Seasons will be connected directly to the 250,000 square foot-luxury Ogilvy/Holt Renfrew department store.The Four Seasons will be a monochromatic 18-story building with tinted windows creating a reflective charcoal facade broken up by \u201ca golden thread that emphasizes the shift between volumes and outlines its main entrances,\u201d said Eric Pelletier, an architect and design principal at the firm designing the project. The gold inlay also highlights the 6,000-square-foot ballroom that will seat 500 guests.Four Seasons brought in Parisian-based architects Gilles and Boissier to design the hotel rooms, which are \u201ca balance of New World and Old World,\u201d said Dana Kalczak, vice president of interior design for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.In contemporary shades of white, cream, rose and gold, the rooms maximize natural light, including bathrooms with windows that allow light to pass in from the room outside. Old world touches include a built-in cocktail cabinet featuring all the equipment for \u201cshaking up a great cocktail or pouring a super scotch,\u201d said Ms. Kalczak.The building will include condos, which went on sale this June and range from 2,886 to 6,910 square feet. The largest penthouse includes a home gym and 2,060-square foot terrace with a fire pit and the option of a pool.It remains to be seen whether the timing is good. This year the overall condo market is \u201ca lot healthier than it was,\u201d says H\u00e9l\u00e8ne B\u00e9gin, a senior economist at Desjardins Economics. But she noted that a surplus of high-end condos remain on the market.The most interest in purchasing Four Seasons residences has come from affluent empty nesters from Montreal and further afield, people looking to swap out large family homes for new homes \u201cthat don\u2019t represent a downgrade in lifestyle,\u201d said Jos\u00e9e Legault, a marketing director for Carbonleo Real Estate.While Ms. Szczygiel and her husband have been upbeat about how the various new developments, along with Montreal\u2019s many festivals and events, have made the city more dynamic and increased tourism, she acknowledged there is a downside.\u201cWe are unfortunately in for a lot of construction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hopefully it will lead to long term benefits for business owners.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: London to Ban Uber", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt also argued that Uber had demonstrated a \u201clack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues.\u201dThe regulator\u2019s complaints also touched on:\u2022The company\u2019s approach to reporting serious criminal offenses,\u2022 Its approach to background checks on drivers for the service, and\u2022 Uber\u2019s explanations about how it used Greyball software to prevent regulators from gaining full access to the app.From a statement by an Uber spokesman:\u201cUber operates in more than 600 cities around the world, including more than 40 towns and cities here in the UK. This ban would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers.\u201dJoe Murphy, the political editor of London\u2019s Evening Standard newspaper, had this to say on Twitter:Related ReadingLawmakers had complained that Facebook had turned over evidence of Russian-linked political advertisements to special counsel Robert S. Mueller, but not to Congress.The technology giant is now bowing to the pressure, agreeing to turn over more than 3,000 of those ads to congressional investigators.\u201cThat\u2019s not what we stand for,\u201d he said.\u2022 The service will now show which Facebook page paid for the ad, and the advertiser\u2019s page will show all the ads the entity is running. (Still, that doesn\u2019t necessarily identify who is running the page.)\u2022 \u201cWe will strengthen our ad review process for political ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg promised.\u2022 Facebook will hire 250 more employees for its security team.\u2022 The company will expand coordination with global election commissions.\u2022 It also promised to work closely with other technology companies to share threat information.Mr. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was monitoring activity related to the German elections on Sunday:\u201cWe\u2019re also examining the activity of accounts we\u2019ve removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany. This is incredibly important and we have been focused on this for a while.\u201dThe ResponseSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, to The Times:\u201cThis is a good first step,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed it\u2019s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they\u2019ve become much more transparent.\u201d He said he believed there were additional \u201ctroll farms\u201d in both Russia and Eastern Europe, \u201cand it\u2019s really important that Facebook work with us to investigate other sources of advertising and fake accounts.\u201d\u201cIt will be necessary to hear directly from Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as others in the tech sector, including in open hearings that will inform the American public,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, the committee\u2019s investigation will require greater and ongoing cooperation by Facebook and other social media companies on this and other issues.\u201dThe ContextFacebook is trying to stave off stricter government regulation. Tech executives have been worried that new rules could lay huge burdens on the world\u2019s biggest advertising business.\u201cTelevision stations have to keep records that literally anyone in the public can see, in windows close to elections, who bought ads,\u201d Mr. Rutenberg said. \u201cMaybe who bought it is \u2018Citizens for Blue Skies,\u2019 and you have to figure out who they are, but there\u2019s a record of this. And there\u2019s talk now about making social media properly accountable for this kind of advertising.\u201dAt the same time, Facebook and Alphabet are finding themselves under pressure from older tech companies and other sometime allies.In the debate-du-jour in the U.S. Senate, Oracle, Disney, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and 21st Century Fox recently voiced support for an anti-sex trafficking bill that would change the bedrock internet platform law, the Communications Decency Act\u2019s Section 230, to put more legal liability on web companies like Facebook and Alphabet. Co-sponsored by Republican senator Rob Portman of Ohio, it is aimed mainly at Backpage.com, a classifieds site that ran ads connected with sex trafficking. But it is written broadly enough that most big consumer internet companies have voiced concerns. Related Reading\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better,\u201d he asks with a sly smile, \u201cif it was actually an accepted thing for people to want to go understand how other people were living?\u201dHe also complained about perceptions among the media that he is being inauthentic:As he says this, his publicist stands up and indicates the interview is over, but Zuckerberg isn\u2019t quite done. He smiles and then says, \u201cI need to give you a hard time.\u201d He proceeds to complain about a Bloomberg Businessweek story in January that noted he employs a team of about a dozen content moderators \u2014 as well as communications managers, professional photographers, video producers, Morgan Freeman \u2014 who are all responsible for maintaining his personal Facebook page. \u201cYou\u2019re taking away from all the time that I spent on this,\u201d he says. \u201cTo some degree some of these companies are very old-school advertising companies in a completely new dress. Some of the things that they do, they are amazing. These are innovations that have changed our societies. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they still have a responsibility. If you\u2019re a dominant company, you have a special responsibility.\u201dI asked Bengio if the companies should be broken up. He harrumphed and responded that antitrust laws should be enforced. \u201cGovernments have become so meek in front of companies,\u201d he said.Schultz spoke with The Washington Post at a job fair for young people on Wednesday, and while he insisted he wasn\u2019t talking politics, it wasn\u2019t difficult imagine him delivering the same words in a stump speech in Des Moines.On the Political FrontAfter months of very public infighting among her cabinet members, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain appears ready to commit to a negotiating strategy for her country\u2019s exit from the European Union.At a speech in Florence today, Ms. May is expected to announce plans for a two-year transition period after leaving the political bloc.The goal is to maintain trade ties to the U.K.\u2019s biggest market and give businesses time to adjust to the new regime. A holdover period would protect companies from being hit with unwieldy tariffs and regulations overnight, if no long-term trade deal has been struck by Brexit day in March 2019.It is thought May will offer to pay enough into the EU to ensure no member state need make extra contributions during the current budget round, which ends in 2020 \u2013 a year after the UK leaves. This would amount to about \u20ac20bn (\u00a318bn), although she may not mention a figure.On the Business FrontBritain is hoping to keep the financial services sector from fleeing to continental Europe with a more industry-friendly approach to regulation.[David Davis, Britain\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator] believes that if Britain maintained the same regulatory framework for financial services as the EU in the long term \u2014 without having any influence over its composition \u2014 this would erode any competitive advantage the UK-based industry would gain from being outside the bloc.For years, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s independence was all but guaranteed by the 33-percent stake held by the family of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of the cosmetics giant.A spokeswoman for Nestl\u00e9 told DealBook that the company declined to comment beyond this statement:\u201cIt is with great sadness that we received the news of the passing away of Mrs. Liliane Bettencourt. We express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to Mrs. Bettencourt\u2019s family and to all at L\u2019Or\u00e9al at this difficult moment.\u201dWhat Investors ThinkShares of L\u2019Or\u00e9al were up 3.5 percent this morning on the Euronext Paris stock exchange, at 182.80 euros, or nearly $218, their highest level since July.Related ReadingL\u2019Affaire Bettencourt had captivated France since 2007, when a daughter\u2019s lawsuit charged that Mrs. Bettencourt, ranked as the richest woman in the world, had been bamboozled by a society photographer 25 years her junior for cash, annuities, fine art and, it seemed, an island in the Seychelles.This became a government scandal, too, when a former family accountant suggested that Mrs. Bettencourt had made contributions to Nicolas Sarkozy shortly before his election as president of France.Ms. Ruden recounts how a student in a Latin class she had taught was outraged at having received an A-minus.From her piece:This professor didn\u2019t ask to see any evidence. He accepted the student\u2019s plea that he had \u201cworked really hard.\u201d Then, in front of the student, he pressed me to explain the reason for my poor teaching, apparently the only thing that could reveal why the student wasn\u2019t satisfied with his grade.Ms. Ruden adds:Many of the better-off young people at Harvard appeared to require intense favoritism to reassure them, perhaps because of the less-moneyed achievement and potential that loomed all around. Though some of the anointed developed their capabilities to the full, the institutional imperative to establish a hierarchy between them and us took precedence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fast Track to Citizenship Is Cut Off for Some Military Recruits", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMohammed Anwar enlisted in April 2016 in the United States military through a program that promised him a fast track to citizenship. His ship date for basic training, expected within six months, was postponed twice. \u201cIt was common knowledge that there were delays because of new security checks,\u201d said the 27-year-old Pakistani national, who lives in Jersey City.Each month he donned a uniform and, as required, attended drill training with his Army Reserve unit in Connecticut.Last week, Mr. Anwar got a call from his recruiter informing him that his enlistment had been terminated. \u201cI was shocked, confused and angry that the United States government didn\u2019t keep up with its commitment to me,\u201d said Mr. Anwar, who was to work as a nurse.The reason behind the decision to cut Mr. Anwar from the military remains unclear to him.In the last week, recruiters have rescinded contracts for an unknown number of foreign nationals who had signed up for Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or Mavni, a program introduced in 2009 to attract immigrants with certain language and other skills that are in short supply into the armed forces.More than 4,000 Mavni recruits have been in limbo since late last year, when the Department of Defense began introducing additional vetting. The protracted process has indefinitely delayed basic training for many enlistees, making it more difficult for recruiters to meet their targets. Recruiting stations are flooded with calls from many concerned that their lawful presence in the country could lapse while they await clearance.Many Mavni recruits have been airing their concerns on Facebook. In interviews, some said they feared they could be deported.H.J. Zhu, a Chinese national who signed an enlistment contract in January 2016, said that he has been calling his recruiter constantly because his student visa expires in two months and he has yet to receive a date to report for basic training.\u201cEmotionally, I can\u2019t move forward with my life,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, 27, who has master\u2019s degrees in engineering from Columbia University and the University of Wyoming. \u201cI am sure my contract is on the verge of being rescinded,\u201d he added, because enlistees must report to training within two years of signing a contract.Paul Haverstick, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the Army must discharge recruits who have not shipped to initial military training within two years.\u201cUnfortunately, some Mavni recruits have been unable to complete the increased security screening required by the Department of Defense to ship to training within two years of enlistment,\u201d he said, adding that the Army is still seeking ways to help those who have been affected.\u201cThe Mavnis have become a huge problem for the recruiting command because they can\u2019t ship out to their training until they complete mandated background checks,\u201d said Margaret Stock, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who helped create the program. \u201cIf they can\u2019t ship out, they aren\u2019t doing the Army any good.\u201dAnkit Gajurel, a Nepalese mechanical engineer who enlisted in the Army Reserve in May 2016, recently had his training date postponed for the second time. But several of his references had been contacted by security officials, and he had been told by his recruiter that his \u201ccounterintelligence interview,\u201d one of the last steps in the vetting process, would be scheduled for November.\u201cI was hopeful and happy things were moving,\u201d said Mr. Gajurel, 24, who lives in Minneapolis.Instead, last week his recruiter phoned him to say that he was a \u201cMavni loss\u201d and instructed him to turn in his military identification and stop attending training drills with his unit in Colorado. \u201cI felt blindsided when that came over the phone,\u201d Mr. Gajurel said.Ms. Stock said that with the end of the fiscal year approaching, the military offered \u201closs forgiveness\u201d to recruiters of Mavni soldiers, a bureaucratic incentive to cancel their contracts so that they do not count against their performance.Since 2009, more than 10,000 immigrants, mostly individuals on student or employment-based visas, have enlisted mainly in the Army. Mr. Anwar and Mr. Gajurel both came to the United States on student visas and then secured temporary work visas.\u201cI thought this would give me the opportunity to better myself and build my life in the United States as a citizen,\u201d Mr. Gajurel said.Typically, participants in the program are sworn in as citizens after completing basic training, without having to first obtain a green card or permanent residency, making the program the quickest path to citizenship available. In exchange, they serve eight years in the military. They can lose their citizenship if they fail to serve honorably.The program\u2019s success stories include Paul Chelimo, a native of Kenya who won a silver medal for the United States in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro; Saral Shrestha, a Nepalese national, who was named the United States Army soldier of the year; and Dr. Marco Ladino, originally from Colombia, who works at the V.A. hospital in Miami.Many have served as interpreters on military missions to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, or helped fill shortages of health professionals, like dentists. They also have trained American soldiers in language and culture.Supporters of the program have advocated its expansion, saying it attracts a high caliber of recruits at a time when it is especially difficult to bring in well-educated, high-skilled Americans.But critics have expressed concerns that terrorists could infiltrate it. There has never been a Mavni recruit charged with terrorism. However, dozens of native-born recruits have been charged with terrorism.The program, which is renewed annually, has been suspended in the past.Shortly after the November 2009 killing of 13 people at Fort Hood in Texas by an Army psychiatrist, an American-born son of immigrants, the program was suspended for about two years pending additional security reviews.Immigrants with legal residency have long been eligible to join the military, but a law passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks allows other documented immigrants to join if it is in the nation\u2019s vital interest. Mavni applicants must have lived legally in the country for at least two years to be eligible.Immigrants currently represent about 13.5 percent of the United States population. They constituted 18 percent of the Army soldiers in World War I and 43 percent of the Union Army during the Civil War. Immigrants represented 5 percent of those in the armed forces and about 8 percent of Army recruits last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "International Tourism to the U.S. Declined in Early 2017", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFewer international travelers came to the United States during the first few months of this year than over the same period last year, confirming concerns of some in the travel industry.\u201cIt\u2019s not a reach to say the rhetoric and policies of this administration are affecting sentiment around the world, creating antipathy toward the U.S. and affecting travel behavior,\u201d said Adam Sacks, the president of Tourism Economics.In response to a Facebook post by The New York Times, European readers overwhelmingly cited the Trump administration and its policies as reasons for avoiding or canceling trips to the United States.\u201cWe are British Muslims and live in London,\u201d Sabaa Farrukh wrote. \u201cWe wanted to visit N.Y.C. this summer but decided against it simply because we felt we wouldn\u2019t be welcome there and didn\u2019t want to waste precious holiday time in case there was a problem at passport control at the airport.\u201dOthers cited violence and safety. Marika Treichel, who lives in Denmark, wrote, \u201cI have always dreamed of visiting the US. But the rise of gun violence and political chaos has made me want to cancel all future travels to the U.S. until I can feel safe as a tourist.\u201dThis has been a strong year for the U.S. dollar, which makes travel more expensive for other currencies \u2014 though exceptions make that an unsatisfying explanation for the tourism drop. The Canadian dollar, for example, is weaker than it has been in previous years (despite a summer surge), yet Canadian tourism to the United States was up 14.8 percent January through April.Within Europe, the tourism declines were largest in Switzerland at nearly 28 percent, Belgium at 20 percent and Britain at 15.5 percent. Britain accounts for the largest share by country of European arrivals in the United States, with 4.5 million tourists last year, making its slowdown significant. (Asian tourism was about the same as last year \u2014 up .6 percent \u2014 mainly due to a surge of South Korean travelers, up over 15 percent in the first quarter.)Some of the decline in first quarter results may be because of the shift of the Easter and Passover holidays, when travel usually spikes. Those occurred in March of 2016 and April this year, possibly skewing first quarter figures. April figures ease the overall decline of foreign visitors to the United States from 4.2 percent to 1.2 percent. A boost in arrivals from Canada, up 7.8 percent through April after two years of declines, helped offset slowdowns from Mexico at 4.9 percent for the first four months of the year and Britain. at 6.9 percent for the same period.Factoring in the April figures brings the loss to the U.S. economy to $1.7 billion, according to Tourism Economics.\u201cGiven the current political and social climate, now is an especially important time for the travel industry to stand for open borders, inclusivity and the celebration of diversity,\u201d wrote Leigh Barnes, the regional director for Intrepid Travel, in an email.Lucy Taylor, an Australian who is spending several weeks this summer and fall visiting the United States with her husband, altered the couple\u2019s itinerary based on anticipated xenophobia.\u201cWe decided not to do a road trip across the U.S. and just to stick to blue states,\u201d she said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what kind of reception we would have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Online Chats Tie Politicians to the Troll of Staten Island", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkThere, a political operative set up fake Facebook pages to hurt people running for local office.Two politicians from the borough denied being involved in the phony Facebook page operation, but details of private communications between them and the operative, Richard A. Luthmann, appear to undercut those assertions.One of them, Kamillah Hanks, a candidate in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary for City Council, said she hired Mr. Luthmann only to help her get on the ballot. Asked last week about a fake page that he set up to attack her opponent, Ms. Hanks referred the inquiry to a spokeswoman.\u201cMs. Hanks had no prior knowledge of these social media pages,\u201d the spokeswoman, Jennifer Blatus, said.Since that denial, The New York Times has reviewed a Facebook Messenger conversation that Ms. Hanks had with Mr. Luthmann. In it, he passes along a post from a sham Facebook page set up in the name of her opponent, City Councilwoman Deborah Rose, inviting people to support her \u201cpartnership\u201d with a real estate developer to turn a property into an \u201cSRO Welfare Hotel full of Criminals.\u201dMs. Hanks does not respond to that. Then Mr. Luthmann points out to Ms. Hanks that a community board includes a member they apparently consider unpopular or controversial.\u201cYes! Check who appointed her,\u201d Ms. Hanks replies, adding, \u201cI would BET it was Debi Rose.\u201dShe concludes, \u201cFind out.\u201dMs. Hanks would not discuss the exchange with Mr. Luthmann. For his part, Mr. Luthmann said he regarded Ms. Hanks as his \u201cconscience\u201d and said: \u201cShe is a far better woman than I am a man. These were almost motherly communications.\u201dThe other political figure, Ron Castorina Jr., who serves in the Assembly and as chairman of the county Republican Party, said last week that he was merely attempting to \u201cplacate\u201d Mr. Luthmann.The assemblyman reiterated that more strongly on Thursday when asked about specific material from their conversations. In another chat reviewed by The Times, Mr. Luthmann sends Mr. Castorina pornographic images, including one altered to make it appear as though Mr. Castorina\u2019s female opponent had been photographed while engaged in a sexual act.\u201cShe will jump in front of a bus,\u201d Mr. Luthmann writes.Mr. Castorina responds with an abbreviation for a phrase that loosely means he is laughing so hard, a part of his body will fall off.The assemblyman also writes:\u201cthere\u2019s her pearl necklace whe always wears.\u201dMr. Luthmann says that some \u201csick\u201d individual has just posted the image to the internet. Mr. Castorina responds, \u201cI hope not.\u201dReplies Mr. Luthmann: \u201cDark web. Untraceable IP.\u201dMr. Castorina is not assuaged. \u201cIt will be twisted and turned by her and come back at me,\u201d he writes. \u201ci\u2019m just going to win on the merits.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d replies Mr. Luthmann. \u201cIt won\u2019t get publicized.\u201dHe adds that the image was next to a picture of another Staten Island politician being sodomized. Mr. Castorina says he worries that he will be subject to retaliation, but once again signals through abbreviation that he finds the matter hilariously funny.All the exchanges, Mr. Castorina said Thursday, were initiated by Mr. Luthmann, and his own responses were calculated to avoid setting off disputes. \u201cIn the context of a private conversation, I made political decisions to placate this guy,\u201d Mr. Castorina said. \u201cHis memes and communiqu\u00e9 are not my actions, nor did I ask to see them. They are horrible, unwanted and I totally disavow them. Some of my own reactions were crude and off-color, and I apologize for that, but all were simply meant to placate. I wanted to move the conversation on, and not embolden his actions.\u201dThe material was being made public, Mr. Castorina said, because of a feud among Staten Island Republicans.Mr. Luthmann said he was the victim of a criminal act in the intrusion on his exchanges, which include doctored pornographic images involving several public officials and, in one case, the adult son of an official. \u201cI throw some outlandish things out there in private conversations to see what was within the bounds of discourse,\u201d he said. \u201cI never intended for my personal and private thoughts to be strewn across the public square.\u201dHe expressed no regrets or remorse for any fake social media pages. Mr. Luthmann said they were simply shrewd politics.\u201cFor public officials, there\u2019s no proscription against staking a claim in digital real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I knew there were 15 or so contestants for the next presidential election, I would be a smart person to grab the handles on Facebook and Twitter. \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erick Erickson: How to Find Common Ground", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionA year ago my life went to hell. After I declared myself unable to support the election of Donald Trump because of my faith and conservative convictions, three protesters showed up on my front porch. They did not threaten physical harm. But they did express feelings of betrayal and declared their intention to ruin my career as a conservative talk radio host and writer. I needed to carefully reconsider, or else.I just could not bring myself to do it. For the next three months, we had armed guards parked outside our house. People called my radio station demanding I be fired. My children came home from school in tears because other kids were wondering when I would be shot or telling them about all their family members who hated me.A woman in my wife\u2019s Bible study group said that she and her friends wanted to punch me in the face. For a while we stopped going to church. At the grocery store, my children were accosted by a stranger yelling that their father was destroying their lives and the country. And in the middle of this I found it harder and harder to breathe. But it wasn\u2019t the stress of the situation causing it.In April 2016, with my blood oxygen level below 90 percent, doctors rushed me into a cardiac intensive care unit when they discovered blood clots in my lungs. There were so many that a doctor who saw my scan wondered if my corpse had been taken to the morgue yet.As I lay in a CT machine getting scanned that day, the Mayo Clinic called my wife to inform her that doctors thought she had lung cancer. Less than six months later they confirmed she has a genetic, incurable form of the disease. Fortunately, she can take an oral chemotherapy pill that keeps her cancer at bay. The cancer cells will eventually mutate so they can\u2019t be suppressed by the medicine, and we can only pray new drugs are developed before each mutation. Our family life is now focused on three-month windows of normalcy between my wife\u2019s CT scans.Contemplating these things, last November I posted a short essay on my website of things I would want my children to know if their mother and I died before they woke. I would want to confess my sins, some of which have been written about in this newspaper. I was mindful that should they Google me they would find out a lot of terrible stuff, some of it very true and some of it not so much.A publisher asked me to turn my essay into a book of love letters for my children, \u201cBefore You Wake.\u201d Little did my editors know they would also get a collection of recipes as the penultimate chapter.Writing a book like that forced me to confront my faults, my fears and my aspirations for my children. I want them to do what is right, not what is popular, and I want them to measure their self-worth by being ethical individuals, not by the applause they receive on social media.As we have moved more of our lives onto the internet, we have stopped living in actual communities. Instead we have created virtual communities where everyone thinks the same. We do not have to worry about the homeless man under the bridge because he is no longer part of our community. He is someone else\u2019s problem. But that simply is not true.Even as the internet provides us great advances, it also segments us. We have social-media tribes and our self-esteem is based on likes and retweets. We have hundreds of television channels and even more video choices online where Hollywood no longer has to worry about broad appeal. There is a channel for everyone, and everyone in the tribe will get the inside jokes. Social-media interactions have replaced the value of character.The truth, though, is that our Facebook friends are probably not going to water our flowers while we are on vacation and our Twitter followers will not bring us a meal if we are sick. But the actual human being next door might do both if we meet him.This is what I want my children to know if I should die before they wake. The kitchen table is the most important tool they have to reshape their community. Preparing a home-cooked meal and inviting people over, both those we know and those we want to know, forces us to find common ground.Not everything should be political, and we can only make everything political when we decide the other side is evil just because they disagree with us. We can see the world only in this polarized way if we never take the time to know anyone on the other side, if we never find ways to build friendship despite our differences.Every person has an interesting story to tell. I want my children to know my story. But I also want them to know that the stranger next door has one, too, and that even if they disagree on much, they can still be friends.We may also never find that common ground with people whose politics or faith conflicts with ours. But we owe it to one another to disagree agreeably, without anger or intimidation, whether on a front porch or a Facebook page. A little more grace among us all would go a long way toward healing the nation.Erick-Woods Erickson is the editor of the website The Resurgent and a talk-show host on radio station WSB.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Puerto Ricans Off the Island, a Struggle to Make Contact After Maria", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the more than five million Puerto Ricans living on the United States mainland, it was bad enough to watch news reports on Wednesday of Hurricane Maria ripping through an island where relatives and friends lived. What made it worse was not knowing how their loved ones had fared.With the entire power grid knocked out and with more than 95 percent of wireless cell sites out of service, communication was all but impossible on Thursday, and an already emotional day became even harder for the Puerto Rican diaspora.\u201cWe\u2019re all anxious, we\u2019re all desperately seeking information and we\u2019re all on call to help Puerto Rico and give it whatever it needs,\u201d said David Galarza Santa, 48, a Brooklyn resident who said he had been unable to reach his family in the municipality of Florida, west of San Juan, since noon on Wednesday.Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in a statement that the hurricane\u2019s impact on the island\u2019s communications infrastructure had been \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d and that the commission was trying to help.Some services, like texting and a few internet messaging apps, were reported to be working, but not consistently.Mr. Galarza said he was optimistic that his family on the island, including his father and two older sisters, were doing well, in part because they had all hunkered down at his father\u2019s sturdy cement house. He also noted that Puerto Ricans were old hands when it came to surviving devastating storms.Relief efforts were quickly organized despite the communication challenges. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City offered help to Puerto Rico in a news conference Thursday, saying that, \u201cNew York City stands with you and we will be there to help.\u201d\u201cThere are 700,000 New Yorkers who are of Puerto Rican descent and feel a direct, powerful tie to their homeland, and they are feeling this crisis,\u201d he said.Those sentiments were shared by Puerto Ricans in other cities. It was a feeling of \u201cimpotence,\u201d said Eliezer V\u00e9lez, 44, of Atlanta.Mr. V\u00e9lez, who works for the Latin American Association in Atlanta, said that he was hoping to get in touch with his mother, two brothers and a number of uncles and cousins. He said a sister who lives on the island was able to send him a message through WhatsApp on Thursday morning; she relayed that everyone was O.K.\u201cWe\u2019re praying for them and hoping for the best,\u201d Mr. V\u00e9lez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad that you\u2019re here, but your mind and your heart are on the island. We are here, but we belong there. I cannot describe the frustration that I\u2019m not there.\u201dMaricarmen Romero-Vazmina, a resident of Sarasota, Fla., said she was \u201cfreaking out, because I was able to talk with my mom five minutes yesterday and have not been able to communicate again.\u201dMs. Romero-Vazmina grew up in Guaynabo, P.R., and works in Florida as a court interpreter and mediator. \u201cWe here are nervous, terrified by the news and the photos, and unable to do much for our families and the thousands that have no roof.\u201dShe said she had been able to communicate only sporadically, through text messages. Her 91-year-old mother might be receiving her messages, she added, but \u201cshe does not get how to respond.\u201dMs. Romero-Vazmina said there were \u201cthousands of Puerto Ricans on the mainland trying to know something about their loved ones\u201d in the wake of the storm, without success.\u201cI have been contacted by at least 10 people, hysterical, trying to get info,\u201d she said. \u201cThey keep calling and that is worse because they are tying up the few lines available.\u201dYou can also register on the site by texting SAFE to 78876. Those worried about missing friends or relatives with a serious health condition are encouraged to call the Red Cross at 800-733-2767.\u2022 The Puerto Rico Tourism Company has set up a hotline at 877-976-2400 for people staying at hotels.\u2022 The radio station WIPR in San Juan is taking emergency calls at 787-777-0940.Reporting was contributed by Nick Madigan from Miami and Jonah Engel Bromwich, Jennifer Harlan and Allya Yourish from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Ad Scandal Isn\u2019t a \u2018Fail,\u2019 It\u2019s a Feature", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat does it take to advertise on Facebook to people who openly call themselves \u201cJew haters\u201d and want to know \u201chow to burn Jews\u201d? About $10 and 15 minutes, according to what the investigative nonprofit ProPublica recently uncovered.Some of Facebook\u2019s users may find it even harder to accept what happened. How could the site that we use to keep in touch with friends and family, share baby pictures, and keep up with politics and volunteer work be made so easily to cater to the interests of Nazis?But anyone who understands how Facebook works shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. That\u2019s because the same digital platform that offers us social interaction, news, entertainment and shopping all in one place makes its money by making it cheap and easy to send us commercial or political messages, often guided by algorithms. The recent scandal is just a reminder.Almost every feature on Facebook is designed to make the site engaging \u2014 to encourage you to spend time there while Facebook serves more ads to you. At the same time, users can share \u201cpromoted posts\u201d \u2014 targeted messages that advertisers pay Facebook to place in their feeds \u2014 merging pay-for-play content with the natural flow of information among friends and family. It\u2019s a powerful combination.People who use the platform to keep in touch with loved ones may forget that the site makes its money by serving as a conduit for whatever messages people with money want to push at us. You\u2019ll rarely hear the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, mention that when he offers lofty statements about how his company makes the world more open and connected and brings us closer together.While it does help us communicate and stay in touch, it also does much more: Facebook has become the go-to site for anyone hoping to reach a big audience \u2014 whether to sell shoes or to sell politics, and it\u2019s become profitable by doing so. That is because most of its systems are either largely or entirely automated. This lets the site scale up \u2014 it is up to two billion monthly users now \u2014 and keeps costs down.Facebook also saves money through community policing, relying heavily on its users to do the legwork of flagging inappropriate content. Policies are enforced unevenly. For example, many people use Facebook pseudonyms, which violate the site\u2019s \u201creal names only\u201d policy. But whether such users see their accounts suspended often depends on whether they\u2019re reported by other users. This means those using pseudonyms to protect their identities while posting about human rights violations in repressive regimes and are flagged by members of those regimes may face consequences for breaking the rule, while others go unnoticed.Human employees are expensive, and algorithms are cheap. Facebook directly employs only about 20,658 people \u2014 roughly one employee per 100,000 users. With so little human oversight and so much automation, public relations crisis like the one that surrounded the ads for hate groups are inevitable.So why do billions of us still use Facebook? Because everyone else is already there. Economists call this a \u201cnetwork effect\u201d \u2014 there are products that are hard to compete with once they capture an substantial audience. Facebook also uses its enormous cash pile to gobble up competitors or to copy their features, and has already hoarded giant amounts of data that provide it with ad-targeting advantages that would-be competitors cannot easily replicate. It\u2019s a combination that leaves it without effective competition.This, combined with deep surveillance-based profiling, enormous scale, automation, lack of sufficient human oversight and a tendency to react to public relations crises instead of making proactive changes helps to explain why, during the 2016 presidential race, the site was swamped with misinformation and outright fraudulent fake news, with actors ranging from foreign troublemakers to make-a-buck hucksters to ideologically motivated political groups.Here\u2019s the hard truth: All these problems are structural. Facebook is approaching half-a-trillion dollars in market capitalization because the business model \u2014 ad-targeting through deep surveillance, emaciated work force, automation and the use of algorithms to find and highlight content that entice people to stay on the site or click on ads or share pay-for-play messages \u2014 works.The trouble is Facebook\u2019s business model is structurally identical whether advertisers are selling shoes, politics or fake diet pills, and whether they\u2019re going after new moms, dog lovers or neo-Nazis. The algorithms don\u2019t know the difference, and Facebook\u2019s customers are not its users.Rather, as this latest incident should remind us, we are Facebook\u2019s product. Our attention and eyeballs are sold to the highest bidders, whatever they may be peddling.OpinionAdvertisement"}

Facebook says that more of those ads ran in 2015 than in 2016, but not how many more.Nor has Facebook reported whether the people who were targeted were from specific demographic or philosophical groups \u2014 all of which means we really don\u2019t know the full extent of the duping on Facebook, and maybe Facebook doesn\u2019t either.Facebook says it is working to prevent a repeat. And it was hardly the only platform that Russia is presumed to have used to disrupt the political debate in America; there were others in the mix as well, particularly Twitter, which has divulged even less than Facebook has.Mr. Shane\u2019s report helped fill in some blanks when he unearthed several of the phony accounts, like that of one Melvin Redick, a professed Pennsylvanian. On his Facebook page, Mr. Redick appears to be a loving dad of an adorable little girl, but as it turns out he doesn\u2019t actually exist. That account was early to spot and promote DCLeaks, the site that became a receptacle for hacked information about prominent Americans.So a picture starts to emerge. But it\u2019s a spotty one, only as good as the journalism that\u2019s working so hard to fill the canvas, and the scraps we\u2019re getting from law enforcement and the social platforms themselves.When I asked Facebook why it couldn\u2019t be more forthcoming with the public, the company responded with a statement saying, \u201cDue to federal law, and the ongoing investigation into these issues, we are limited as to what we can disclose publicly.\u201dFacebook, which didn\u2019t elaborate, appears to be saying it is legally restricted from the willy-nilly handing-over of information about its users to the government or, for that matter, the public. And it\u2019s certainly a challenge for Facebook to decide where the line is between sharing vital details about its use in a plot like election meddling, and exposing private data about its legitimate users.On Friday, I asked Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or Epic, an advocacy group, where he stood on the question.\u201cThe best case for that is that the First Amendment protects anonymous speech,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the United States government were to try to comprehend the identities of controversial speakers, we\u2019d be up on the front lines saying the government doesn\u2019t have the right to do that.\u201dBut in this case, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about non-U.S. persons engaging in political speech in U.S. elections, and it\u2019s a stretch to extend that kind of protection to this type of activity,\u201d he said.Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington, told me that the electronic communications privacy law did not extend protections to advertisements or posted messages that were readily accessible to the public.That\u2019s not to say that Mr. Mueller\u2019s involvement doesn\u2019t add to the sensitivity for Facebook. It does. But sooner rather than later Facebook owes it to the public to provide still more detail about the ads. And it owes it to its users to let them know if they have directly interacted with the equivalent of digital spies sent to influence them.Then there\u2019s democracy itself, and the new problems the social platforms are creating for it.The American electoral system includes a complicated campaign finance regime that was devised to keep Americans informed about who finances the media messages designed to sway them.The Russian effort was able to elude those laws through social media, where the system has clearly \u2014 and fundamentally \u2014 broken down.As of now, we don\u2019t even know the full extent to which the Russian ads violated the current legal requirements. That\u2019s something Mr. Mueller should be able to determine. But Facebook and other platforms need to get more information out there publicly, too, so the necessary discussion about potential remedies doesn\u2019t have to wait for the Mueller investigation to conclude. Hopefully they will.This much should be clear: Arguments that sites like Facebook are merely open \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 and not \u201cmedia companies\u201d that make editorial judgments about activity in the digital worlds they created \u2014 fall woefully flat when it comes to meddling in our democracy.The platforms have become incredibly powerful in a short amount of time. With great power has come great profit, which they are only too happy to embrace; the great responsibility part, not always so much.\u201cGiven the role they played in this election, they now have a major responsibility to help solve this problem,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said.After all, the 2018 midterms are just around the corner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Yankees\u2019 Judge\u2019s Chambers: A Promotion to Dismiss?", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a game Thursday night when the Yankees\u2019 marketing ploy suddenly was golden; when a real Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor, donned a black robe and sat in the Judge\u2019s Chambers at the Bronx stadium to cheer on Aaron Judge.But on most other nights, the whole costume party feels about as timely as last year\u2019s Halloween gala. Yankees employees must scour the stands before each home game for enthusiastic fans wearing Judge jerseys, then ask if they\u2019d like to relocate to the Judge\u2019s Chambers in Section 104 \u2014 a paneled area of 18 seats arranged in three rows, set below and adjacent to the right-field bleachers.As further enticement, these fans are handed foam \u201cAll Rise\u201d gavels, cardboard signs and black robes with Judge\u2019s uniform number, 99, on the back. They can keep these items, they are told, as long as they remain in their seats for at least six innings.\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure, but it\u2019s an experience,\u201d said John Pipia of Massapequa, N.Y., who had hesitantly moved with his wife and three children to the Judge\u2019s Chambers on Wednesday between games of a doubleheader, from a much better seating position behind home plate.As a bonus, fans sitting in the Judge\u2019s Chambers may be awarded five seconds of fame on television, shown standing and cheering when Judge does something special. But this last part of the deal happens with less and less frequency of late, as Yankees fans know all too well.Many superstitious rooters might argue the chambers had something to do with that, right alongside the home run derby that Judge won during this year\u2019s All-Star festivities. Too much pressure, too soon? Something happened to Judge, for sure.The same Ruthian figure who batted .329 with 30 homers and 66 runs batted in, and with an on-base percentage of .448, swooned into an epic slump after the All-Star break. Since then, he has been hitting just around .180 and had managed just seven more homers going into Friday night\u2019s game against Boston. He now strikes out in more than a third of his at-bats. During a recent record-breaking streak, he struck out at least once in 37 consecutive games.Judge\u2019s overall season numbers remain remarkable for a rookie. He still gets on base a lot because the pitchers won\u2019t give in and give him a good pitch to hit, and end up walking him. But the arrow is clearly pointing in the wrong direction. Judge insists that opposing hurlers are not doing much differently, that he is just missing their mistake pitches.There is a good chance that Judge will snap out of this thing soon enough. His struggles even led Manager Joe Girardi to bench him earlier this week. All these developments have made the Judge\u2019s Chambers appear all the more silly \u2014 a jump-the-gun marketing gimmick that may have to disappear quietly after the season. For now, though, the club has no plans for dismantling the section.This promotional idea was drastically uncharacteristic of the Yankees, who were never known for trumpeting individual players. There are no names on the backs of jerseys, except during special, league-mandated occasions. When the team installed the chambers in late May, it was a bit of a shock to traditionalists. The Bleacher Creatures, who sit right above the paneled area in right field, were particularly derisive about such a caprice and took to Facebook to express their discontent.The club went ahead anyway, as part of a new marketing push aimed at filling seats with a younger demographic. The scheme worked well for a while. Now, unless a Supreme Court justice shows up, it is lost in the narrative of wild-card and division races.On Wednesday, Judge was not in the lineup for the first game of the doubleheader. As a pinch-hitter, he fanned for the final out in the ninth inning. He was back in the lineup for the nightcap, batting cleanup, and the Judge\u2019s Chambers were filled with a fresh crew. The recruits did their best to root on their hero.\u201cI have faith,\u201d said Matthew Balgobin of Queens, who was moved to the chambers from a seat in the left-field bleachers. \u201cPitchers have found a way to pitch to him. But he\u2019ll be back.\u201dIn that second game, Judge\u2019s performance was fairly typical of his second half. He reached first base on an infield single in the second inning, hustling hard and leading the chambers group to rise and cheer. \u201cGot to start with something,\u201d Pipia said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it.\u201d Judge was called out on strikes in the fourth inning. He walked in the sixth. He flew out to right in the ninth.The Yankees fell behind early and were routed, 9-4. It wasn\u2019t easy to stay in those seats for six innings, to claim the robes. The day at the ballpark stretched close to seven hours, complete with two defeats. There was also a final twist: Even if Judge had blasted one over the fence, the home run was very unlikely to land in the chambers because of an overhanging deck.Pipia, like Sotomayor, never really had a chance to catch a ball.Advertisement"}

But Western wedding customs are not global and many brides choose a dress style and color \u2014 white, red, sleeveless or more modest \u2014 according to their cultural, or religious, traditions.An Orthodox Jewish bride usually wears white and her collarbone, elbows and knees must be covered, said Rabbi Ari Raskin, the rabbi of congregation B\u2019nai Avraham in Brooklyn Heights. \u201cAnd she must wear a veil.\u201d But, Rabbi Raskin added, it is important for every bride to ask her rabbi for his guidance before buying a dress. \u201cFor some rabbis it is O.K. for a woman to wear a jacket over a less modest dress when they are under the huppah,\u201d he added.\u201cModesty is part of my life and it was extra important on my wedding day to be mindful of my modesty,\u201d said Arielle Wernick, who was married in May to Yaakov Teles in New Jersey.Rabbi Daniel Nevins, a Conservative rabbi and the dean of the Rabbinical School at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, said, \u201calthough there are no formal guidelines for the Conservative Jewish bride we encourage all people to appreciate the day as a day of holiness.\u201dA modern, reform Jewish bride may wear whatever she wants, said Rabbi Amy Ehrlich of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan. She added, \u201cmore often than not a bride-to-be asks me if she should cover her shoulders under the huppah. I always say if you ask that question you have the answer. I encourage brides to be mindful of the sanctity of the moment.\u201d A bolero jacket or shawl may be worn over a revealing dress for modesty during the ceremony.A Mormon bride must also be modest in her gown; any slits in the skirt have to be sewn up and there are special garments to be worn under the dress for the ceremony inside a Latter-day Saints temple. \u201cL.D.S. brides may wear their wedding dresses through the temple where the sacred ceremony of marriage takes place if these dresses meet the accepted standards: white, high-neck, long sleeved, modest in design and fabric and free of elaborate ornamentation,\u201d said Irene Caso, a Mormon Church spokeswoman.Mercedes Lopez Blanco, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, said: \u201cThere is no official pronouncement regarding attire for brides at Catholic weddings. Marriage is a sacrament in the Catholic Church. It is assumed by Catholics that they would dress appropriately to respect the sacredness of the vows that they are taking. Catholics are aware that they are making a sacred commitment in a sacred place and dress appropriately.\u201dIn St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, for example, she said that brides are asked to dress \u201ctastefully\u201d and they always do.\u201cConsidering that I\u2019m a first-generation, there was definitely pressure to do things the traditional way,\u201d said Tina Pham, who married Joel Lingat in August at the Emeryville Marina in Emeryville, Calif. Ms. Pham, whose parents are from Vietnam, wore a white wedding dress for the Western ceremony. For the tea ceremony, she said, the bride usually wears a traditional Vietnamese dress, in red, called an \u00e1o d\u00e0i. \u201cThe color is significant since it symbolizes luck for the new journey ahead,\u201d she said.A Hindu bride wears a brightly colored sari, often red with gold threads. \u201cThe sari should be eye catching to the groom and his family,\u201d said Ganapathy Padmanabhar, the public relations officer for the Hindu Temple Society of North America in Queens. \u201cA silk sari in a bright color is worn and there should be lots of fresh flowers around,\u201d he added.\u201cI was raised in Washington D.C., but having a traditional wedding in India was an ode to our South Indian roots,\u201d said Shruti Narasimhan, who married Kalyan Gandikota on July 30 in Bangalore, India. \u201cWe wanted a traditional Indian wedding, an ode to pre-independant India, but my traditional sari in electric blue was a new-age pop of color,\u201d she said.Muslim brides wear long dresses in bright colors or muted ones; usually they are highly decorated or embellished and a hijab or head scarf is traditional. Often a wedding dress comes with a coordinating hijab. \u201cThankfully, I did not feel any pressure to adhere to any religious customs, as there aren\u2019t any in Islam,\u201d said Rehana Khatri, who married Saleem Khatri in June 2013. \u201cAn Islamic marriage is approached as a contract witnessed by the bride, groom, and their families,\u201d she said. \u201cThe customs I did adhere to were cultural, but not foreign as I grew up attending dazzling Pakistani weddings in Florida. I did have to rebel a little bit and go with a blush pink dress instead of the traditional red dress because I always think it\u2019s fun to change what people are expecting the most.\u201dNigerian brides usually wear a colorful traditional fabric from her family\u2019s tribe, her new husband\u2019s tribe or sometimes both. This material is often gifted by a family member, then sewn into a modern design. Brides often wear a Nigerian head wrap, called a gele, to complete the look. It is always prudent for the bride to ask the person who will officiate at a marriage ceremony, in advance of buying a dress, if there are dress codes or requirements, particularly if the wedding is taking place in a religious venue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chechnya\u2019s Persecuted Gays Find Refuge in Canada", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONEY HARBOUR, Ontario \u2014 The Canadian government, working with a Toronto-based nonprofit, has quietly allowed gay men and lesbians from the Russian republic of Chechnya to seek safety in Canada over the past three months.The executive director of Rainbow Railroad, Kimahli Powell, said his organization had joined with the Canadian government to create a program to expedite the safe passage to Canada of 22 gay men and lesbians. They have been deemed government-assisted refugees.The first among them arrived from a safe house in Russia in June. Nine more are expected to arrive in the coming week, and the program is continuing, with more expected to arrive.\u201cThe vast majority of the people we\u2019ve helped are men,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for women to escape Chechnya.\u201dHe said Canada\u2019s response to the Chechen crisis showed that its government was serious about its commitment to gay rights internationally. \u201cWe hope that, in demonstrating Canada can do something, other countries take the lead as well,\u201d he said.While the government refused to speak publicly about the program, a person in the government with knowledge of the program confirmed its existence and the number of Chechens who had been granted asylum so far.The program is another example of Canada\u2019s increasingly positioning itself as global champion of human rights and a welcoming place for refugees, in a world that is increasingly shutting its doors.\u201cWe call for the protection of all people in Chechnya whose sexual orientation makes them a target for persecution,\u201d he said.\u201cCanada appears to be the only country that has done this on a such a massive scale,\u201d Tanya Lokshina, the Russia program director for Human Rights Watch, said over the phone from Moscow, referring to the asylum program. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly exceptional. Canada clearly has done the right thing here. Every extra day they stay in this country is an extra day of dire risk.\u201dMs. Lokshina participated in a panel with Ms. Freeland in April in Arizona discussing human rights in Russia. Ms. Lokshina said she used the chance meeting as an opportunity to press for sanctuary for the Chechens, many of whom had escaped to Russian safe houses.\u201cShe was very open; she wanted it to happen,\u201d Ms. Lokshina said about the foreign minister. \u201cIt was great synergy.\u201dAround the same time, Mr. Powell announced that Rainbow Railroad, which he said had helped 81 people escape persecution in their home countries for being gay in 2016, would focus its energies on secreting gay people out of Chechnya to safety, and he called on the Canadian government to issue emergency visas to them.He said he hoped the emergency program would mark a long-term change in Canada, smoothing the rapid entrance for other people facing sexual and gender persecution. Traditionally, he said, few of the people helped by Rainbow Railroad settle in Canada, because of difficulty getting visas and long waiting lists with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.While the purge stopped in April, gay men and women remain at risk in the traditional, conservative Muslim republic, Ms. Lokshina said.\u201cHomophobia is very rampant and it\u2019s been inflamed,\u201d she said. \u201cThese days, people are on the lookout for gays,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sexual Harassment Charges Roil Elite University Department", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for the past year, the department has become the site of a fierce \u2014 and until recently, secretive \u2014 battle over allegations of repeated sexual harassment. The allegations have led to a federal discrimination complaint, the resignation of one of the department\u2019s founding members, and, in the coming months, the planned departure of four more faculty members.\u201cThis is a bitterly divided department,\u201d Joel Seligman, the university\u2019s president, said at a Tuesday evening town hall meeting attended by hundreds of students, less than 30 minutes after Dr. T. Florian Jaeger, a professor in the department who had been accused of sexual harassment and cleared by the university, announced in an email to students that he would not teach the remainder of his course this semester because of the outcry.Last year, two professors in the department, Dr. Richard Aslin and Dr. Jessica Cantlon, filed a sexual harassment complaint against Dr. Jaeger with the university, which was investigated by Catherine Nearpass, the university\u2019s associate counsel for employment and labor relations issues. Administrators found that Dr. Jaeger had not violated university policy on discrimination and harassment. The professors appealed, and the university upheld the decision. After that, the professors said, they faced sustained retaliation from university leadership.In May 2016, while the investigation was still ongoing, Dr. Jaeger was promoted to full professor.The new federal complaint, to which Dr. Aslin and Dr. Cantlon are also parties, gathered the testimony of 11 women, including a current professor in the department and former undergraduates who had worked with Dr. Jaeger. The accounts range from being approached sexually by Dr. Jaeger at bars to being made to feel so uncomfortable in his lab that they abandoned projects in order to avoid working with him. They depict a man who used his stature to coerce women into crossing professional boundaries, and deceived them into believing that he had the approval of senior faculty in doing so.\u201cI asked the rochester authorities today about certain student-faculty relations and I am in no danger,\u201d he wrote in April 2007 to Dr. Celeste Kidd, one of the complainants, according to a screenshot of a Facebook conversation Dr. Kidd provided to The Times. Dr. Kidd, whom Dr. Jaeger advised at the start of her graduate studies, rented a room in his house for a year, because, she said, he suggested that he would speak poorly of her to colleagues if she did not.\u201cHe made it very clear that to do well in his lab, which everyone was telling me was a good idea, it was not possible to have only a professional relationship with him. That was not his mentor style,\u201d Dr. Kidd said.A year of distress followed, Dr. Kidd said, with Dr. Jaeger describing to her the genitalia of one of his sexual partners, or warning her against \u201cspoiling her physique\u201d when he saw her eating. Once, the complaint says, Dr. Jaeger stuck his hand in beans that Dr. Kidd was cooking and said, \u201cYour beans feel really weird, Celeste.\u201dDr. Jaeger did not return multiple requests for comment. But in his email to students on Tuesday, he said he had received letters of support from former students and colleagues who expressed \u201chow positively they experienced the atmosphere in the lab.\u201d\u201cI have read comments online, and while many of them are personally painful for me to read (as most of these comments do not grant me \u2018presumption of innocence,\u2019 to put it mildly), I am glad that there is now generally so much support for people who speak up against discrimination,\u201d he wrote.Eventually, Dr. Kidd moved out and removed herself from Dr. Jaeger\u2019s supervision. She also abandoned her focus on linguistics, Dr. Jaeger\u2019s specialty; she now studies attention and learning more generally.Other women shared similar stories in the complaint. And all along, they said, they believed that Dr. Aslin and Dr. Elissa Newport, senior faculty in the department at the time, knew of Dr. Jaeger\u2019s behavior.Dr. Aslin acknowledged in an interview that he knew that Dr. Kidd and Dr. Jaeger were living in the same house in 2007. But he said he did not suspect any coercion or inappropriate behavior at the time.Then, in 2016, the department began to debate tightening policies governing faculty-student relationships, a move Dr. Jaeger opposed, according to Dr. Cantlon. Several months before, Dr. Kidd, who had recently been promoted to assistant professor, had begun confiding in Dr. Cantlon about her experiences with Dr. Jaeger. Those two events prompted Dr. Cantlon to take her concerns to Dr. Aslin.After Dr. Aslin and Dr. Cantlon complained to the university about Dr. Jaeger, Dr. Aslin said, administrators and colleagues made clear that they no longer welcomed him or Dr. Cantlon, or the other professors who were known to support their complaint. In a July 2016 memo obtained by The Times, two deans urged departmental faculty to refrain from \u201cgossip that appears to have undermined the confidentiality of the process and fractured the department.\u201d Dr. Aslin said he understood the memo to be a barb at him.In November 2016, Dr. Aslin \u2014 who had worked at the university for 32 years, and had served as dean of the college of arts and sciences as well as vice provost \u2014 announced his resignation.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be an employee of a corrupt institution,\u201d Dr. Aslin said.The faculty was split by the allegations. Three of the professors on the August complaint, including Dr. Aslin, are no longer at Rochester; the four who remain are seeking new positions, Dr. Cantlon said, even though two, including herself, had received tenure within the last 12 months. \u201cFor the past year, I\u2019ve felt ostracized and bullied,\u201d she said.Dr. Jaeger seems to have acknowledged some responsibility in the controversy. In a December email obtained by The Times, he expressed to his colleagues deep regret for his \u201cpart in the struggle that our department has been going through.\u201d\u201cThere are mistakes that I made many years ago that, with the benefit of hindsight, I would not repeat,\u201d he wrote.The university denies any retaliation. In correspondence with the complainants and in memos to the department, administrators repeatedly highlighted policies prohibiting retaliation against those who brought discrimination claims.\u201cIt serves no one\u2019s interests \u2013 not students, employees, the wider University community, nor the institution itself \u2013 to leave unchecked or in any way cover up unlawful behavior,\u201d Ms. Nearpass, the associate counsel, wrote in an email to The Times.At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Seligman, the university president, promised to appoint an independent investigator to review the new claims brought in the federal complaint, which includes the allegations of retaliation in addition to harassment. But he refused students\u2019 calls to remove Dr. Jaeger instantly. \u201cThis is not rule by mob, guys,\u201d he said.In an email to The Times, Mr. Seligman wrote that he is committed to a university where people feel \u201csupported and safe.\u201dMr. Seligman later apologized for the comparison.For the professors making the complaint, the outpouring of support has been bittersweet, they said.\u201cWe loved it here. We never intended to leave,\u201d said Dr. Cantlon, who has been applying to jobs but has not yet accepted one. \u201cWe had really interesting and lively research programs. We had a lot going for us.\u201d\u201cThere was every reason to stay here and stay together,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they took that from us.\u201dA picture caption on Saturday with an article about accusations of sexual harassment at Rochester University referred incorrectly to Dr. T. Florian Jaeger, who was accused of sexual harassment and then cleared by the university. He is not facing a federal lawsuit.

{"Headline": "South Koreans Worked a Democratic Miracle. Can They Do It Again?", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewThe country\u2019s advanced information technology infrastructure made the difference. Smartphones turned front-line protesters into videographers. Millions commented on the political situation on Kakao Talk (a Korean messaging service), Facebook and other social media channels.Technology alone is not enough to establish true democracy. Not all technologically advanced nations have vibrant grass-roots political engagement, and in many countries, devices and software are being abused \u2014 used for surveillance or to manipulate information, while anti-democratic extremists spread their views on the same platforms.Advanced technology can enable democracy by giving citizens more time and energy for political engagement and by making corrupt political practices like vote-buying more difficult. However, what\u2019s most important is constant civic engagement \u2014 without that, democracy withers away.The popular \u201cAsian values\u201d thesis suggests that Asians are culturally disinclined to democracy because they favor the good of the community over individual rights. That is untrue: South Koreans have fought for democracy throughout modern history.In 1945, when the Japanese left after 35 years of colonial rule, no South Korean called for the restoration of the monarchy. In 1960, a mass protest against misrule and electoral fraud ousted the republic\u2019s first president, Rhee Syngman. Throughout General Park\u2019s 18 years of iron-fisted rule, students and workers agitated and risked their lives for democracy. In 1987, 19 days of violent street demonstrations led by students, workers and even young managers ended his successor\u2019s military rule.With the \u201ccandlelight revolution,\u201d Koreans have elevated their democracy to another level. But the challenge they face is formidable. The protesters were calling for more than just the ousting of an errant president and her cronies: They want to create a cleaner and fairer society.Some believe that corruption can be eliminated by further deregulation, with the idea that this would reduce the number of opportunities for collusion with public officials, and by strengthening minority shareholder rights, on the theory that shareholders will expose corrupt dealings by those who run the chaebols. However, a much more fundamental shift in the distribution of power is required if there is to be a reduction in corruption. Decision-making abilities need to be transferred from the political and business elites to citizens, civic organizations, trade unions and other \u201ccountervailing powers,\u201d to borrow an expression from the economist John Kenneth Galbraith.Then there is the issue of fairness. Increasing deregulation has reduced protections for small factories and shops, which used to supply jobs that kept income inequality relatively low. The spread of American-style salary norms in the past decade or so has led to a tremendous increase in wage inequality \u2014 South Korea has one of the fastest-growing levels among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.But what angers South Koreans most is the marked drop in social mobility and the sense of hopelessness that haunts young people from less-privileged backgrounds \u2014 that is, most young people.The barriers to university applicants are usually subtle. It\u2019s the extras that make a candidate for admission stand out, such as extracurricular activities or expensive private tutoring for university entrance exams. At the beginning of their careers, expectations that candidates have completed internships may stand in the way. Poor parents cannot even dream of helping their children with such things.Many young Koreans believe, rightly, that equality of opportunity is impossible in the face of ostensibly fair rules that favor the daughters and sons of the rich and the powerful.Removing these barriers to social mobility will be even more difficult than reducing corruption. Big changes in the education system are needed, and especially in the university application process. This will also require the expansion of the welfare state so that children from less-privileged backgrounds can have a chance at moving up the social ladder through early learning programs, publicly funded enrichment schemes, and the increased parental attention and family stability that extra income can provide.Koreans have shown the world that an engaged citizenry, armed with the latest technologies, can work a democratic miracle.

It could mean millions of more people under the gun for weather.\u201dWhat areas of New York City are more prone to flooding?What can we expect on the waterways?Here\u2019s what else is happening:President Trump\u2019s visit to New York continues, and his schedule is packed with individual meetings with world leaders.In the past, Mr. Trump has called the United Nations an elitist \u201cclub\u201d and has signaled large cuts in contributions from the United States, the largest contributor to its budget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citizens of Gucci-land, Unite!", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewMILAN \u2014 On a giant industrial campus in the far reaches of Milan, past the room with the giant chinoiserie swans painted on the walls and the plush velvet chairs, past the garden with its crawling ivy and purple blooms, in a cavernous space traced by a river of winding blue, a mummy lay.Nearby was the Sphinx; diagonally across the room, an enormous Buddha; somewhere in close vicinity, an Aztec arch. Greek statuary was mounted on plinths, ditto Egyptian gods, and flanking it all on one wall were the arches of the Roman Forum. Then the strobe lights came on.So did Milan Fashion Week begin.It\u2019s where, in any case, the designer Alessandro Michele is attempting to build his own brave new world. One without borders or even boundaries; one where everyone is free to be you and me, as Marlo Thomas once sang. Or perhaps more pertinently, to let their freak fly. To pledge allegiance to \u201cResist the mantra of speed.\u201d And \u201cResist the illusion of something new at any cost.\u201d(Those appeals from the rallying cry/show manifesto entitled \u201cThe Act of Creation is an Act of Resistance,\u201d handed to attendees entering the spring show.)If nowhere else at least on his runway, surrounded by the souvenir stand relics of civilizations past. Lots of civilizations past.107 PhotosMr. Michele\u2019s omnivorous imagination is like the Blob, indiscriminately absorbing any adjective, philosopher and decorative detail in its path.Or at least that\u2019s how it looked under the strobes. They were there to make everyone focus on the \u201cexperience\u201d instead of the clothes, or so said Mr. Michele (blue-jeaned, bejeweled, purple aviators covering his eyes and rock star-worthy shaggy brown hair covering his face) before the show.The problem is it just underscored the fact that if everyone embraces the same wild idiosyncrasy, then they all start to look the same. Even reduced to a constituent part, you can spot a denizen of Gucci-land from across a crowded room. Unrelenting nonconformity bears an ironic resemblance to conformity \u2014 which once upon a time was called fashion victimhood.It\u2019s possible that\u2019s what people want now: citizenship in a community defined by a brand, be it the phone they carry or the clothes they wear. After all, more traditional communities are breaking down. Certainly it\u2019s become a working premise for fashion.In the hills of Umbria, Brunello Cucinelli has a campus of his own (more like a feudal town, actually, but perhaps these days that\u2019s semantics), which the designer transplants to his Milan headquarters , the better to model the slow life and his deeply seductive vision of high luxury athleisure: cashmere hoodies with glinting gold stripes down the arm; dark denim evening vests atop feather and sequined playsuits; T-shirts made from stiff pleated tiers of tulle.You can see the appeal when faced with the head-scratching about-face of Alberta Ferretti, who abandoned her signature frothy, fragile femininity in search of what she called renewal. Which began with bathing suits and ended with some metallic sorbet-shaded trousers and shirts knotted above the waist by way of Halston-lite jersey gowns and sparkly baby-doll dresses.Where was she going with this? It was hard to tell, because she never actually arrived.(By contrast, Fausto Puglisi\u2019s decision to detour from his recent trash-\u2019n\u2019-vaudeville version of Siciliana to produce a collection of relatively simple white and black lace and linen slip dresses, shirtdresses and ballerina frocks was a good one.)And you can, perhaps, begin to understand the impetus for the unexpected return of logomania, not just at Gucci (yes, Mr. Michele did that, too) but at Max Mara, where a rococo rendering of the brand\u2019s name was revived as a print on beige pencil skirts paired with matching jean jackets and matching shoulder bags, and at Fendi.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s like our personal monogram,\u201d Silvia Fendi said of the double F, before a show with its own unforced energy that layered \u2014 literally \u2014 the geometries of Italian Futurism with the leaves and lightness of the tropics.Shoulders and waists did double duty as erogenous zones, and stripes \u2014 \u201canother one of our codes,\u201d according to Ms. Fendi \u2014 soared diagonally, horizontally and every other which way, mixed in and over logos old and new (\u201cI refreshed it,\u201d the designer Karl Lagerfeld said of the single gold F in a pink circle that created a punctuation mark at the end of the runway).The letter appeared on belts and buckles, bags, mink bombers, socks and sheer nylon mesh skirts. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for everyone to be part of our family,\u201d Ms. Fendi said. To signal, perhaps, their membership in a social network of a different kind.slide showslide showslide showslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Storm Reaches Puerto Rico: \u2018There Is Nothing Like This\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic, hit the eastern Caribbean on Wednesday with winds of up to 185 miles an hour, but had slowed to 180 m.p.h. by Thursday morning.\u2022 The French interior minister, Gerard Collomb, said at least eight people had been killed in French Caribbean territory, and at least three deaths were reported elsewhere. The authorities warned that the toll would rise as communications improved.\u2022 President Trump declared a state of emergency in Florida, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. The storm is expected to reach Florida early on Saturday, potentially causing catastrophic flooding.Early on Wednesday, Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda said his nation had been spared the worst of the hurricane, declaring in a statement, \u201cThe essential point is that our main infrastructure has stood up and our country can resume normal life within hours.\u201d He went so far as to add, \u201cI dare to say that no other country in the Caribbean would have been as well prepared as we were.\u201dThis turned out to be stunningly inaccurate: While the damage in Antigua was not as severe as expected, Mr. Browne announced in the afternoon that 95 percent of all structures on its sister island, Barbuda, had been damaged or destroyed, rendering the island \u201cbarely habitable.\u201d A telecommunications tower was broken in two. At least one person, an infant, was killed.Barbuda, home to about 1,600 people (3 percent of the country\u2019s population), \u201cis literally rubble,\u201d the prime minister told ABS TV/Radio Antigua.In his initial statement Wednesday morning, Mr. Browne suggested he had been receiving reports from Barbuda. But he later clarified that, in fact, the storm had knocked out all official communication systems on the island, rendering officials there unreachable after the storm. As a result, it was not until the afternoon, when the prime minister surveyed Barbuda from the air, that the extent of the devastation became clear.\u201cWhat I saw was heart-wrenching \u2014 I mean, absolutely devastating,\u201d Mr. Browne told ABS TV afterward, estimating that it would take at least $150 million to return the island to some semblance of normalcy.\u201cHurricane Irma would have been easily the most powerful hurricane to have stormed through the Caribbean,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is extremely unfortunate that Barbuda was right in its path.\u201dMr. Browne said he had been caught off guard by the utter destruction in Barbuda because it is so close to the comparatively unscathed Antigua. The islands are less than 40 miles apart.\u2014 CARL JOSEPH, KIRK SEMPLE and MAGGIE ASTORPresident Emmanuel Macron of France said on Wednesday evening that it was too early to say how badly the islands of St. Martin and St. Barth\u00e9lemy had been damaged or how many casualties there were. But French officials reported that the death toll was at least two, and Mr. Macron said the aftermath would be \u201charsh and cruel.\u201d\u201cWe will have victims to lament, and the material damage on the two islands is considerable,\u201d he said after a crisis meeting in Paris, adding that the \u201centire nation\u201d stood beside the inhabitants of the islands.Mr. Macron said that emergency services were focusing on re-establishing contact with the affected areas and that rescue operations would be coordinated from the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, where the French minister for overseas territories, Annick Girardin, was headed on Wednesday evening.Javorn Micheal Fahie, a taxi driver in Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, said most of the galvanized steel roofs in his neighborhood had blown off. He saw two of them, from houses facing his, flying away in the wind.\u201cAll the trees around us have no leaves,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything is empty.\u201dLate on Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency tweeted a photo from a resident of St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands.Earlier in the day, Kelsey Nowakowski, who lives in St. Thomas, described how she and four friends had hunkered down and waited for the storm to pass.\u201cWe\u2019ve all been in hurricanes before, but have never felt anything like this before,\u201d Ms. Nowakowski said in a message via Twitter. \u201cIt feels seismic, it feels catastrophic.\u201d\u2014 RICHARD P\u00c9REZ-PE\u00d1A and KIRK SEMPLEGov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3 said at a televised briefing on Wednesday that six to eight inches of rain were expected in Puerto Rico, with some areas receiving up to 12 inches.\u201cAs the history with Harvey states,\u201d he said, referring to the hurricane that battered Houston, \u201cflooding can become the major cause of death in events of this nature.\u201dWith the storm expected to pass just north of San Juan between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., the governor had cautioned people to take shelter by noon in homes or in one of 156 government-run facilities. He warned that the authorities would suspend rescues once winds reached 50 m.p.h.Carmen Caballero, 69, hastily packed supplies and rushed to the nearest government shelter in San Juan around 3 p.m., after the power went out in her home and branches began to fall. As a retired doctor, she said she had offered her services to other evacuees, including two people with Alzheimer\u2019s and some children with autism.\u201cThis is phenomenal,\u201d Mr. Acevedo said in a phone interview. \u201cThere is nothing like this.\u201dOfficials warned that the island\u2019s fragile electrical grid could be shut down for months in some areas. The Puerto Rico electric company said nearly 300,000 people had lost power by early Wednesday afternoon. More than 4,000 had lost water service, mostly because of power failures. The governor has asked the Defense Department to activate the Army National Guard for recovery efforts once the storm passes.\u2014 FRANCES ROBLES and LUIS FERR\u00c9-SADURNIThe French interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, said the four \u201cmost durable\u201d buildings on St. Martin had been destroyed.President Trump owns a property there, Le Ch\u00e2teau des Palmiers, a walled waterfront estate that is currently up for sale. It is unclear whether that property was damaged.Power was out on St. Barth\u00e9lemy, and many roofs had been blown off, according to a statement from the prefecture on the French island of Guadeloupe.The situation on St. Martin was similar: There was no power, the fire station was flooded, and the police station no longer had a roof. The island\u2019s administrative offices were also \u201cpartially destroyed,\u201d the statement from Guadeloupe said, adding that the staff had taken shelter in a concrete room.Live, updated maps showing where the storm has made landfall and how much of the state has been hit by tropical-storm- and hurricane-force winds.By midmorning on Wednesday, the hurricane was \u201cpounding\u201d the island nation of Anguilla, according to the National Hurricane Center. An officer who answered the phone at the Royal Anguilla Police Force headquarters said that one person had died in the territory.Alex Woolfall, a British public relations consultant, was staying at The Westin St. Maarten resort in St. Martin when the storm made landfall early Wednesday. Mr. Woolfall tweeted updates during the storm before the power eventually went out.\u2014 AURELIEN BREEDEN and KIRK SEMPLEHundreds of evacuees from the southern Bahamas began arriving in the capital, Nassau, a day after Prime Minister Hubert Minnis urged them \u201cnot to be foolish and try to brave out this monster storm.\u201dMarionette Simmons, 60, who left the Inagua district with three of her grandchildren, said she had stayed put during Hurricane Ike in 2008 and \u201cwasn\u2019t going to take that chance again.\u201d\u201cMy life is more important than anything I might have left behind,\u201d Ms. Simmons said.Dion Foulkes \u2014 the Bahamas\u2019 labor and consumer affairs minister, who is coordinating the evacuations \u2014 said that only about 200 people had chosen to stay on the islands, which will most likely start to feel the effects of Irma on Thursday evening. Earnel Brown, who owns a small hotel in Pirates Well on the island of Mayaguana, is one of them.\u201cI am a person of tremendous faith, and I believe that things don\u2019t just happen, they happen for a reason,\u201d Mr. Brown, 54, said. \u201cI believe everything is meticulously planned by God. I am not worried at all.\u201dMost projections have Irma slamming into the state by Sunday, although it is unclear where it might make landfall.Gov. Rick Scott activated the state National Guard and declared a state of emergency across Florida. At a news conference, he urged residents to heed evacuation advisories and to act while the storm is still days away. Irma, he said, is more powerful and dangerous than Andrew.\u201cKnow your evacuation zone,\u201d he said. \u201cListen to your locals. This storm has the potential to devastate the state. Take it seriously.\u201dThe governor said 1,000 National Guard troops would be on duty by Wednesday night, and ordered most state government offices closed on Friday. He urged people to stock up on basics and refill their prescriptions, and said the state was working to address shortages of fuel and bottled water.Evacuation orders for Miami-Dade County were expected Wednesday or early Thursday, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said, as a precaution for what is expected to be unprecedented coastal flooding. The county plans to open shelters on Wednesday, and ordered schools closed on Thursday.The Florida Keys were under a mandatory evacuation order: Wednesday morning for visitors and Wednesday evening for residents. The islands\u2019 three hospitals began evacuating patients on Tuesday.Hurricane Harvey was weighing heavily on people\u2019s minds. \u201cI think because of Texas, people are freaking out,\u201d said Yoseyn Ramos, 24, a Miami resident who said she was worried because she could not find gas anywhere.\u2014RICHARD P\u00c9REZ-PE\u00d1A and MARC SANTORAAdvertisement"}

The Wildhorse was a divine revelation \u2014 white people, they\u2019re just like us!My visit to the South was long overdue. I\u2019ve lived in five countries on three continents, but the United States has always been the unifying thread; my America is diverse and dynamic and molded by immigrants. But how well did I really know it? Last fall, when I returned from a four-year stint as an expat in South Africa, I deplaned into unfamiliar territory. There was an acrid, unseen fog looming: two weeks later came Election Day.President Trump began his term with a travel ban on certain Muslim-majority countries; this week he\u2019s expanding that diktat, and in what\u2019s become the hallmark of a turbulent presidency, no one has any clue what\u2019s next. As a Muslim American immigrant, am I just a few 140-character proclamations away from having my citizenship revoked? But fear also sparked curiosity. To me, \u201cWyoming\u201d sounds foreign and peculiar, spilling lazily off the tongue like a yawn and evoking in my mind the wild terrain someone else might associate with a Zimbabwe or Mozambique. What\u2019s exotic to me isn\u2019t food gilded with turmeric and six-day weddings \u2014 it\u2019s grits and rodeos. How much time did I have left to experience them?I wondered if, given Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, I would feel like a foreigner in my own home. So I hit the road over the Fourth of July to see how much of an outsider I really was.\u201cThe songs really don\u2019t help the stereotypes,\u201d Sobia remarked.Every explorer needs a sidekick, so I\u2019d drafted a friend whose curiosity rivaled my own. Sobia was the Clark to my Lewis, the Finn to my Sawyer, the Buzz Lightyear to my Woody; we were two Muslim-American women trying to demystify guns, cowboys, and church, and hopefully evading lard in the process. At that moment, however, our ambitions were limited to making sense of the song on the radio: \u201cI was sittin\u2019 there sellin\u2019 turnips on my flatbed truck\u2026\u201dYou have to hand it to country music. You want to mock its clich\u00e9s? It\u2019ll cram each verse with so many mommas and daddies and shotguns and Chevys that it insulates itself from satire. It\u2019s self-aware and sassy, somewhere between caricature and cultural anthropology \u2014 just look up the lyrics to Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s \u201cA Country Boy Can Survive.\u201d Recurring themes of booze, small-town boys chasing blonde-haired girls, guns, and pickup trucks are not my domain. The heartbreak, however, is breathtakingly relatable.If the God-fearing and gun-loving bumper stickers in these parts are anything to go by, Jesus himself might have drafted the Second Amendment. So as we hit the highway from Nashville, I insisted on a pit stop at Walmart to see what the hype was about.A gun-browsing native by the display of hunting rifles caught me ogling and chuckled. \u201cHow many do you own?\u201d I asked him.\u201cFour, including this one,\u201d he answered, lifting his shirt. My eyes widened at my first glimpse of a gun in the wild. \u201cYou need one in Memphis.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m... headed to Memphis.\u201d\u201cThen I suggest you get one.\u201dI invested in a $6 red, white, and blue cowboy hat instead.The Mississippi Delta\u2019s history is shaped by slavery and poverty, igniting a musical genre that\u2019s inspired everything from jazz to rock \u2018n roll to R&B. \u201cWhen I first got the blues, they brought me over on a ship, men were standing over me, and a lot more with a whip,\u201d sang B.B. King. \u201cAnd everybody wanna know why I sing the blues. Well, I\u2019ve been around a long time, I\u2019ve really paid my dues.\u201dSobia and I found many nationalities and shockingly few sequins among Graceland\u2019s pilgrims. \u201cSo many people try to copy him, but he was the ultimate,\u201d said Rishi Khanna, a fan since his youth in India, before singing a few bars of \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling in Love.\u201d \u201cElvis\u2019s music is from the divine.\u201dHis words lingered that evening, when a jovial elderly man chatted us up at a doughnut shop. The store had run out of doughnuts; I may have missed dessert, but I was treated to a serving of white privilege when I asked him about life in Memphis during the civil rights struggle.\u201cBlacks and whites never had problems,\u201d he claimed.\u201cBut weren\u2019t blacks second-class citizens?\u201d\u201cThey never thought about it until Martin Luther King,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf they thought about it, it never came up.\u201dThe man was in his 80s, and his filter had clearly reached its expiration date. Most people of color have heard rumors of this camaraderie that exists among some white folks, where racist banter is exchanged with strangers as nonchalantly as chitchat about the weather. But I\u2019ll never be part of that club, and was startled by his bluntness. I don\u2019t wear a head scarf that identifies me as Muslim, yet surely one would assume I\u2019m Indian, or Arab, or Hispanic, or Persian \u2014 origins rooted in some place where the people are brown, the governments are temperamental, and the food is delicious (\u201cthe hot-sauce zone,\u201d my friend Aarti dubs it).It was more peculiar since I was joined by my friend Nazia, a Memphis transplant, who does wear a scarf. Confederate statues aside, though, she feels Southern hospitality typically trumps bigotry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of respect for people of faith,\u201d she said later. \u201cThey might not agree with you, they might think Jesus needs to save you, but they believe they need to be good and kind because that\u2019s the way Jesus would have been.\u201dThis ain\u2019t my first rodeo. I liked my first one so much that I was back for seconds the next night.Is this how outsiders feel when they encounter their first Indian wedding? Was my flimsy Walmart-issue cowboy hat cultural appropriation?After the show it\u2019s the after-party, and a packed Dairy Queen was where we found some cowboys hanging out post-rodeo. \u201cIt\u2019s like strapping yourself onto a moving truck and rolling it down a hill,\u201d said Dalton Epperson when I tried to pinpoint the appeal of mounting a riled-up bull. \u201cPretty much tying yourself to death.\u201d In two nights, I only saw one bull rider last a full eight seconds; when I attempted a turn atop a mechanical bull, I went airborne after two.Cavorting with death is a common Western pastime, in the way I might go to brunch or a museum. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world out here. This is the wilderness,\u201d said Ron, a local I met on Cody\u2019s main drag. \u201cYou go 15 minutes one way and there\u2019s a wolf; 15 minutes in the other direction there\u2019s a grizz. Guns aren\u2019t a macho thing, it\u2019s a way of life.\u201dI tried that way of life at a shooting range, unloading a Ruger SR22 semiautomatic into a target that offered visual confirmation that I had not uncovered a hidden talent.\u201cHave you ever had to use one in self-defense?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, but it\u2019s the same thing as having a fire extinguisher \u2014 I have one in my house but I hope I never have to use one, either.\u201d I personally wouldn\u2019t brandish a fire extinguisher on my belt while running errands, but that\u2019s a sartorial choice I\u2019ll have to live with.The frontier has always intrigued me, but from a safe, playing-Oregon-Trail-in-a-computer-lab kind of distance. Now there I was, except I was steering an American-made Ford, not a rickety wagon prone to absconding wheels, and death by dysentery wasn\u2019t a significant concern. We stopped at a ranch to try horseback riding, and Caleb, a teenager who could ride before he could walk and has had his own gun since he was nine \u2014 the kind of fella who probably would have survived a non-pixelated Oregon Trail just fine \u2014 guided us through a forest of lodgepole pines with snowcapped mountains, pleated like the folds of a sari, rippling in the distance.Things weren\u2019t as serene inside the world\u2019s oldest national park. Yellowstone was established by Ulysses S. Grant in 1872 as \u201ca public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\u201d; people took that to heart, and now they seem to outnumber bison and buffalo. We battled peak summer crowds to see blindingly white hot springs, steaming pools whose kinetic colors resemble semiprecious gemstones in liquid form, and one particularly unreliable geyser. Despite its tardiness, Old Faithful draws crowds that rival Disneyland. \u201cThis feels more like a theme park than Graceland did,\u201d Sobia said.Rebranding aside \u2014 looking at the map, one thing is for sure: Minneapolis is a long way from Mogadishu.\u201cI wanted to bring the goodness to the mainstream,\u201d said the owner Abdirahman Kahin. \u201cThe goodness\u201d is Somali cuisine; judging by the patrons \u2014 college students, middle-aged officegoers \u2014 the mainstream loves it.It\u2019s not a perfect world, and the community is anxious about perception problems \u2014 several young Somali Americans asked not to be quoted.

Melt a few knobs of unsalted butter into a saut\u00e9 pan and, when it foams, slide the cutlets into the fat.

{"Headline": "A Golfer Aiming to Save More Than Strokes on a Scorecard", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERSEY CITY \u2014 At the 2015 Presidents Cup, the Australian Marc Leishman beat Jordan Spieth, then the world No. 1, in the singles competition. Leishman\u2019s 1-up victory came three months after he lost in a British Open playoff, but his hot streak didn\u2019t do much for his public profile.Before Leishman went wire-to-wire this month to win the third of four events in the recently completed FedEx Cup playoffs, Jim Mackay, the former caddie of Phil Mickelson, described him as golf\u2019s most underrated player.Leishman\u2019s circle of followers has recently expanded to include, among others, Erica Cornelius, an Arkansan who does not consider herself a golf fan. And yet she will faithfully watch the tournament coverage whenever Leishman is competing, including this week when he leads the International team against a heavily favored United States squad in the Presidents Cup at Liberty National Golf Club.\u201cHis smile, even if you are having the worst day ever, will make you smile,\u201d Cornelius said in a telephone interview.Cornelius\u2019s initial link to Leishman was his wife, Audrey, who, like Cornelius, is a survivor of sepsis. In April 2015, Audrey Leishman developed toxic shock syndrome, which triggered sepsis, a life-threatening reaction by the body to an infection. She spent the better part of five days in a medically induced coma and was given a 5 percent chance of survival. Marc Leishman cannot forget how close he came to losing her.He took a photograph of his wife when she was breathing with the help of a ventilator. Audrey Leishman said she refers to it whenever she is laid low by lingering fatigue and muscle weakness, because it reminds her of how far she has come.\u201cIt took a very, very long time for me to feel good again,\u201d she said.Cornelius, who has battled sepsis twice, started a support group on Facebook for survivors. The page attracted the attention of Audrey Leishman, who responded to a post. From there, a friendship took root.Identifying the symptoms early is critical, Marc Leishman said, because every hour that sepsis goes untreated, the mortality rate increases by 7 percent. \u201cIf you can catch it early, it\u2019s antibiotics, probably in the hospital for a day, and see you later,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t catch it early enough, there\u2019s probably going to be a funeral not too far down the road.\u201dThe trip was a big deal to Cornelius, who said her bouts with sepsis have made her reluctant to leave the house because she becomes anxious that she will get sick again.\u201cAudrey and Marc have changed my life,\u201d said Cornelius, who cited their financial and emotional support.\u201cThere are people I\u2019ve known my whole life who disappeared because they really didn\u2019t know what to do or say,\u201d Cornelius said, adding: \u201cAudrey\u2019s always there when I need an ear. She\u2019s so compassionate.\u201dThe burden on the caretakers of sepsis survivors can be great. Audrey Leishman said Marc had \u201creally stepped up\u201d during her recovery, taking a more active role in caring for their sons, Harvey, 5, and Oliver, 3.Leishman\u2019s willingness to do whatever is required of him dates to his late teens when he briefly worked a graveyard shift operating a laser cutter, turning thick sheets of metal into different shapes, to help pay his tournament entry fees. He had a hard time staying awake, an occupational hazard of an undertaking in which, he said, \u201cyou could lose a limb pretty easily if you\u2019re not careful.\u201dLeishman, 33, wanted to proceed with extreme caution when his wife, who had been trying to get pregnant at the time she developed sepsis, expressed a desire last year to have another child. Fearful of how Audrey\u2019s body would respond to a pregnancy, Leishman remained opposed to the idea even after gaining assurances from her doctor that she would be O.K. He swallowed his concerns when he saw how much having another baby meant to her.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like our family was complete,\u201d Audrey Leishman said, adding, \u201cIf we had stopped, I would have always felt that getting sick robbed us of another child, and I think I would have grieved that loss for the rest of my life.\u201dIn July, she gave birth to a daughter, Eva. Asked when he stopped worrying about his wife during her pregnancy, Marc said, \u201cNever.\u201dLeishman, the 2009 PGA Tour rookie of the year, had one victory in his first seven seasons before winning twice in his eighth. Going into last week\u2019s Tour Championship, he was a career-high 15th in the world rankings. Because his responsibilities at home have increased, he is practicing less, but with more purpose \u2014 smarter, not longer. On tournament weeks, bad shots or sideways rounds do not sting as much.\u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot off the golf course, the stuff with Audrey, and I feel like that kind of makes golf not less important, but it\u2019s easy to put things into perspective,\u201d Leishman said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a golf tournament. It\u2019s not a life-or-death situation.\u201dLeishman\u2019s easygoing nature was what attracted Audrey to him as they forged a long-distance relationship after a chance meeting in a Williamsburg, Va., bar. But it has also made an indelible impression on others.After meeting the Leishmans, Cornelius said, she was taken with one of Marc\u2019s favorite catchphrases. It has become her daily mantra: \u201cNo worries.\u201dFollow Karen Crouse on Twitter: @bykaren.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Politics of Nondiscrimination Have Gone Too Far\u2019: Readers Debate Free Speech", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe baker, Jack Phillips, said that supplying the cake to the couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, would violate his Christian faith and his right to express himself. The couple says that freedom of speech does not give Mr. Phillips the right to discriminate against same-sex couples.Here is a selection of responses, which have been edited for length and clarity.I\u2019m gay myself but in this situation, I\u2019m actually finding myself siding more with the baker than the gay couple. The baker stated that he would create other types of cakes for gay people or any people \u2014 just not wedding cakes. It clarifies he\u2019s not broadly discriminating against gay people.I think the politics of nondiscrimination have gone too far and are being too often used now to bully people. Yes, in an ideal world, this baker would have his eyes opened and would not allow religion to narrow him in this way. But I think we are going too far with the state trying to force people to be completely without prejudice.Let\u2019s be real about this. The baker is not being asked to do anything that violates his religion, unless his religion prohibits the baking, decorating and selling of cakes. What the baker is doing is attempting to impose his religious beliefs on others. This is simple intolerance, and he is breaking the law which prohibits discrimination. Any sane judiciary would see this and make short work of it.I do see this as a freedom of speech issue. Many comments here make the argument that, \u201cIf you serve the public, you must serve all the public.\u201d On the face of it, that sounds great, but what happens when that public stands for ideas which are abhorrent to the business owner?Was Airbnb violating the rights of white nationalists when it canceled their reservations in Virginia a few months ago? If the KKK wants a celebration cake made, can the baker and the recreation hall owner choose not to enter into that contract, despite \u201cserving the public\u201d?I own and operate a printing company. We make graphic tees, printed coffee mugs, key chains, bumper stickers, you get the idea.We live and work in a conservative Colorado city on the other side of the Continental Divide from Denver. My husband and I are left-leaning, especially socially. Most of our customers, both retail and wholesale, are Trump supporters, whom I personally find repugnant.But when they come in and order a stack of religious, gun-toting slogans on bumper stickers, I make them. Despite my discomfort at aiding the spread of some of their messaging, I make them.Because my business is open to the public, because conservative money has the same value as liberal money, because my company is not capable of having its own moral ideas outside of what I built into it, because that is the only intelligent way to run a successful business.There is a distinction between a pre-made cake sitting in a display and a request for a custom-designed cake. This falls within the category of art or craft, not merely the sale of food.A portrait painter may choose who they will accept a commission from. I would think that the cake designer would fall within the same category.So long as the bakery allowed the sale of pre-made cakes or cakes that one selected from a book of available cakes, where no real creativity was involved, to L.G.B.T. couples, it should be able to allow a cake designer to refuse to design a custom cake for the same coupleI don\u2019t think we should compel people to produce bespoke products against their will. This isn\u2019t like selling an existing product or allowing someone access to a pre-defined service.I doubt that as an interior designer Mr. Craig would want to be compelled to take a commission to design the interiors for a right wing conservative group, particularly if he felt their mission statement was in direct violation of his beliefs.As an architect I would be unlikely to accept a commission from a prison or casino on the basis of personal beliefs. If we are going to create a free and equitable society we need to allow for people to disagree in civil ways. That means that sometimes we will be disappointed, or gain negative business reputations.Jack Phillips has an artistic right to refuse to do designs that he doesn\u2019t like. Maybe he doesn\u2019t care for baby shower cakes that depict the mother\u2019s bulging tummy or wedding cakes with kissing same-sex couples. That\u2019s his prerogative.But it\u2019s discrimination if he sells a wedding cake to a woman who enters his store and then immediately refuses to sell a wedding cake to two men.It\u2019s one thing to be selective about the kind of designs that he is willing to do. If he chooses not to carry Adam & Steve wedding toppers or to create decorative sculptures of the couple or to embellish the cake with a couple\u2019s names, that is his right. But if the two men are fine to have a design like what he has already done for others, the baker has no grounds for refusing to make the cake.If the baker is arguing that his cakes reflect his personal moral beliefs and he can\u2019t sell to anyone who violates them, then he should run background checks and vet all his other cake buyers, too!Frankly, the baker is in the wrong business if he thinks that he must control what is done with his cakes after he has made them. The young woman may be ordering the cake to celebrate a feminist marriage to herself or maybe the \u201ccouple\u201d getting married are her two dogs.A ruling for the baker in this case would set a terrible precedent for this country. My partner and I could be legally discriminated against at a variety of businesses with no legal recourse. It would make entry into an unfamiliar business fraught with anxiety and worry.This is one of the Trump administration\u2019s most egregious and loathsome positions that history will not remember them kindly for. Any L.G.B.T.Q. person that supports this administration also supports legal discrimination against them in the name of religion.The baker did not refuse because of who the plaintiffs are. He refuses to serve them because of what they were doing. This is a major difference that should be recognized by the law. The defendant, though many would disagree, should have every right to refuse service.If he had a policy of refusing to serve gay people the law would have every right to sanction him. However, in this case he should not be forced to participate in a ceremony antithetical to his religious beliefs.I don\u2019t know of any artist that gets to pick her audience. An artist makes the thing: painting, book, or whatever it is, and then it goes out into the world as it is. An artist doesn\u2019t know how it will be received, or who will pay attention to it, if anyone.This isn\u2019t a case about artistic or religious expression, and it makes no difference how beautiful his cakes are. It\u2019s about a prima donna cake decorator thinking that he can control what happens to his \u201cart\u201d after it leaves his workshop.As an artist and illustrator I have turned away clients on principle. I refused a big assignment from a tobacco company, for instance. I would not work for a large meat producer, as I am a vegetarian. These are not religious beliefs but strongly held principles.The fact that our baker in question does not refuse to sell baked goods to gay customers for other events or to sell to a wedding planner, who might happen to be gay, is relevant. I think the baker is an artist, and there is a question of speech here. Refusing to rent a tent or tables and chairs for the event is another matter. Clearly that would be discriminatory.Perhaps the interaction at the bakery could have been handled better, with kindness and best wishes or even a referral. People do have a right to be wrong in their beliefs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Unveils iPhone X and 8 Models as It Upgrades TV Set-Top Box", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple unveiled iPhone X, its first premium-tier phone, at an event in Cupertino, Calif., on Tuesday. Here\u2019s what else the company had to say.\u2022 iPhone X is priced at $999, the most expensive ever for a new iPhone model. It will ship on Nov. 3. (Pro tip: The X is pronounced 10, and not \u201cex.\u201d)\u2022 The phone has a newer screen technology known as OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.\u2022 The screen on the X has a so-called edge-to-edge display that takes up the entire face by eliminating the borders around the screen. Apple also eliminated the physical home button that has been a signature feature of the iPhone for a decade.\u2022 iPhone 8 is also here, as well as its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus. The models include a glass body and a faster chip.\u2022 Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box that has never been a blockbuster hit, got an upgrade. The device will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs.\u2022 Apple took the wraps off a new Apple Watch. Called Apple Watch Series 3, it has cellular capabilities. There\u2019s also a new Watch OS.With the $999 iPhone X, Apple moved to a new premium level of pricing. The smartphone will cost $300 more than the iPhone 8 and $200 more than the iPhone 8 Plus.While that will be too expensive for many people, the company said it saw the iPhone X defining a new era for the smartphone, much like the original iPhone did 10 years ago. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the device would \u201cset the path for the next decade.\u201d That\u2019s because Apple will likely build on some of the iPhone X\u2019s most notable features, including infrared facial recognition, wireless battery charging and sophisticated camera effects.Consumer reaction to the new phone will have a big impact on the company\u2019s revenue and stock price. Right now, analysts are betting on a slow uptake of the top-end phone, both because of production delays and the high price. But if it turns out to be an unexpected hit, like the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 Plus, the company\u2019s sales \u2014 and stock price \u2014 could surge.Wall Street wasn\u2019t immediately dazzled by Apple\u2019s presentation, however, with the stock price down more than 1 percent by the end of the event.The iPhone X is the first redesigned iPhone in three years, and Apple says it is the blueprint for \u201cthe future of the smartphone.\u201d Many of the design details had leaked to the press before today\u2019s unveiling \u2014 we\u2019d heard that it would have a new display that stretched across much more of the phone\u2019s front, and that it would do away with the trademark home button.Much of that turned out to be true. The iPhone X is essentially the same size and overall shape as the iPhone 7, but because the screen occupies all of the front of the phone, it is far larger than that of older models. The screen uses a technology new for Apple (which many competitors already use), called OLED. It produces better image quality than Apple\u2019s older LCD screens.What we didn\u2019t quite know was how Apple would integrate the new button-free design with the operating system \u2014 how would you navigate the phone without a physical button?It\u2019s quite simple: You swipe. To go home, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To see other apps, swipe up from the bottom and pause \u2014 now you see the multitasking pane. And to unlock your phone, you look at it. The iPhone X eliminates Apple\u2019s Touch ID, and replaces it with a facial-recognition system that Apple calls Face ID.Whether people will adjust to the button-free system remains to be seen. For better or worse, Apple has used essentially the same interface for the iPhone for the last decade. Swiping is easy, but it isn\u2019t as easy as hitting a button, and it may throw some people off at first. The learning curve will be interesting to watch.\u2014 Farhad ManjooThe brand-new feature in the iPhone X that has never existed on any other iPhone is infrared face scanning.The technology, called Face ID, uses an infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the phone and authorize mobile payments. The technology works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.For Apple, Face ID has been years in the making. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a camera system that scanned people\u2019s bodies so people could play Xbox games using body movements.Face ID is a direct response to the face-recognition feature in smartphones offered by Samsung, Apple\u2019s fiercest rival. Experts have criticized Samsung\u2019s face-recognition feature, which could be tricked by holding a photo of the smartphone owner\u2019s face in front of the camera.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.The new iPhone 8 line includes the iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the 8 Plus.The phones include a six-core processor that will handle more complex tasks and 3D games more quickly and efficiently than previous iPhones. The phones generally look the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with the exception of glass bodies, as opposed to aluminum.Apple improved the phones\u2019 cameras with new sensors and added new motion sensors to better support applications made for augmented reality, which use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.In particular, the dual cameras in the iPhone 8 Plus take photos with sharp details in low light. Apple also added a new portrait mode to improve the lighting on faces regardless of the background.Another notable new feature is the introduction of magnetic induction to the iPhones. Similar to Apple Watch, the iPhones can now be charged by being placed on a charging pad as opposed to being plugged in with a cable.The new iPhone 8 line will be one of the most important for Apple. Wall Street analysts have estimated that more than half of iPhone buyers will buy the 8 and 8 Plus over the next year. The models have a slightly higher starting price than their predecessors: The iPhone 8 starts at $699, up from $650 for older iPhone models.The new Apple TV, called Apple TV 4K, it is an iteration of the last model, which introduced a touch pad remote control. The new box will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, added that 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, and those who previously bought high-definition titles would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost.Apple said the new Apple TV 4K is also two times faster than the last one and includes support for a new color technology called H.D.R., or high dynamic range. This software feature enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture. In bright colors, you will see brighter highlights; in dark colors, you will see more details.The Apple Watch has been a sleeper hit for the company. Though early reviews were mixed, Apple has steadily improved the device, and now the smartwatch is the best-selling watch in the world, according to Apple.Today, Apple unveiled the third version of the device. It looks identical to the old version, but the new one carries a much-requested feature for the first time: It will come with a cellular chip, meaning it can access the internet even if it isn\u2019t connected to your phone. Among other capabilities, the cellular version can make calls, send texts and stream music when you\u2019re on the go.\u201cNow you have the freedom to go anywhere with just the Apple Watch,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.The cellular version completes a long-term vision for the Watch \u2014 to liberate you, in some small way, from Apple\u2019s best-selling phone. In a demo, a live call was made from the keynote address to an Apple employee on paddle board in the middle of a lake.This is a slightly risky strategy, of course; Apple doesn\u2019t want to kill its golden iPhone goose. But the new cellular watch is unlikely to be a replacement for the phone, just a high-priced complement.The new cellular version sells for $399; a WiFi-only version of the new version sells for $329, and you can still buy the older version for $249. The new watch will begin shipping on Sept. 22.Apple is set to unveil several new gadgets later this morning, but the highlight of today\u2019s event isn\u2019t something you can buy. It\u2019s Apple Park, the company\u2019s new $5 billion spaceship-shaped campus, which the company is showing off to the media for the first time.The press were penned off just out of range of the main building, at the Steve Jobs Theater, the 1,000-seat venue with a commanding view of the spaceship. A quick review: This place is just what you\u2019d imagine an Apple-designed campus would look like. Think of the aesthetics of an Apple Store \u2014 lots of wood and glass, everything in muted tans and greys, all signage in white-on-black Apple Sans type \u2014 set on an otherwise barren landscape.It is, unsurprisingly, very pretty, but its beauty comes with a deliberate touch of fright. Nothing here is to human scale, and the overall impression is one of being overwhelmed by Apple\u2019s sheer might.\u2014 Farhad ManjooAn earlier version of this article misstated the cost comparison of content streamed in 4K resolution on the new Apple TV 4K that was given by Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services. Mr. Cue said that the 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, not rent.An article on Wednesday about Apple\u2019s newly released iPhone models described incorrectly a phone call made during Apple\u2019s product announcement at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. An executive onstage at headquarters demonstrated Apple Watch capabilities by calling an employee on a paddle board in a lake; the employee did not initiate the call.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Houston\u2019s Alley Theater Picks Up the Pieces After Hurricane", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt felt like a death,\u201d Mr. Joseph said. He compared the scene to the opening of the film \u201cTitanic,\u201d when a deep-sea vessel discovers the blanched ruins of the ship decaying at the bottom of the ocean.The Alley is a regular launching pad for American theater\u2019s most promising new plays and playwrights. Since it moved to its current location in the heart of downtown Houston in 1968, it has hosted world premieres from Paula Vogel, Tony Kushner and two earlier works from Mr. Joseph, among others, all featuring performers in its esteemed resident acting company \u2014 one of the last such troupes remaining in the country.\u201cThey\u2019re one of a handful of regional theaters around the country that really make a difference,\u201d said Lawrence Wright, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist whose play \u201cCleo\u201d had been scheduled to premiere at the Alley in late September. (It is now expected to open there next spring.)The day Mr. Joseph stood defeated at the Alley stairway, Dean Gladden, the managing director of the theater for the past 11 years, wasn\u2019t able to survey Harvey\u2019s wrath in person. Forbidding floodwater crept up his own driveway.Other occupants of Houston\u2019s close-knit theater district downtown, including the Wortham Center, which houses the Houston Grand Opera, and Jones Hall, home to the Houston Symphony, experienced some flooding, although less severe, and some concerts had to be canceled or relocated.When Mr. Gladden arrived the next day, after the water there and at home had sufficiently receded, he discovered a harrowing scene. The larger of the Alley\u2019s two spaces, the Hubbard Theater, which is above ground, was relatively unscathed. But the below-ground Neuhaus Theater, a 310-seat space where Mr. Joseph\u2019s play was being staged, was ravaged, along with the 8,000-square-foot prop storage facility in the basement.Water covered five of the auditorium\u2019s six rows of seating. One-of-a-kind props dating back 70 years were sodden. An expensive new electrical system \u2014 a product of the $46.5 million renovation that had been completed just two years earlier \u2014 was ruined. In all, Mr. Gladden estimates that damages could total as much as $15 million.\u201cWe just turned around from buying all this stuff; now I\u2019ve got to turn around and raise money again,\u201d Mr. Gladden said.But first, he has a play to put on.Mr. Joseph\u2019s play will no longer premiere at the Alley, but thanks to last-minute finagling by Mr. Gladden, it will open at the nearby Quintero Theater at the University of Houston on the original Sept. 15 premiere date.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my ears,\u201d Mr. Joseph said when he heard that his show would, in fact, go on. Still reeling from the devastation he\u2019d witnessed, and news reports of calamity across Southeast Texas, he said he had even doubted whether putting on a play would be appropriate.\u201cI took the lead from the Alley,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey said \u2018We want to get back to work,\u2019 and that was really inspiring.\u201dMr. Gladden quickly commissioned the design and construction of an entirely new set. The original was beyond rescue, and the new venue features a thrust stage, whereas the Neuhaus is a theater in-the-round. Next, he tracked down new rehearsal space, zeroing in on an unoccupied trading floor on the 55th story of a downtown skyscraper that is controlled by one of the Alley\u2019s board members.The prop, wig and craft departments have now taken up residence in that building. A theater file server was rescued and relocated to an information technology staffer\u2019s bedroom so an accountant could continue to make payroll.After Mr. Joseph\u2019s debut, Mr. Gladden will begin the formidable work of reviving his theater in earnest. \u201cCleo,\u201d about the romance between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, was almost canceled, but after the Alley\u2019s artistic director, Gregory Boyd, learned that the actors were continuing to rehearse even after having been displaced, he fought for the show to be rescheduled for next year.The hope is to reopen the theater in mid-November, in time for the annual staging of \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d one of the Alley\u2019s most popular and lucrative calendar events. But it will be a steep road.\u201cWe\u2019ve had staff members go through very difficult times,\u201d Mr. Gladden said. \u201cSome have lost their homes, lost their cars. They\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201dEven when the building dries out, the electricity returns and props are restocked, the question will remain: Will Houstonians, many still emerging from crises of their own, have an appetite for often richly priced performing arts?\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Amanda Dinitz, interim co-executive director of the Houston Symphony, which, like the Alley, sits in the arm of the still-engorged Buffalo Bayou. \u201cI think people are going to be craving things that make them feel good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mass Psychology Supports the Pricey Stock Market", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThat was the observation of John Maynard Keynes, who suggested that investors do not actually make money by picking the best companies, but by picking stocks that waves of other traders will want to buy.Investing, in other words, is an exercise in mass psychology.I\u2019ve spent decades studying it, and believe that one way to predict future market moves is to sort through the narratives that sweep through the population and influence decisions on whether to buy or sell. Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.The current number is troubling. After the ratio\u2019s peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market\u2019s history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.The notion that investors were laboring under \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: \u201cSTOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED.\u201dIn early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with \u201c.com\u201d in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing \u201cdot-bombs,\u201d articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.So where are we today?That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else. I don\u2019t really know.That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no danger of a crash. But at the moment, the psychological preconditions for a spiraling downturn don\u2019t appear to be in place.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eager to Create Blue-Collar Jobs, a Small Business Struggles", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "A Michigan auto parts company has transformed itself and made money. But its chief finds herself caught between demands to lower costs and lift wages.Supported byJACKSON, Mich. \u2014 Anita-Maria Quillen blended a strawberry-banana shake, tucked high heels into a Louis Vuitton bag and fired off last-minute requests at her little boys and their sitter.Ms. Quillen, 35, belongs to a much-mythologized class in American life and politics: small-business owners. Politicians heap praise on them, campaigning in their factories and extolling their enterprises as engines of good jobs and good wages. President Trump\u2019s election lifted their hopes for a resurgence.To own a small manufacturing business is to shoulder so many worries you hope your children find an easier career, and to realize how little the airy pronouncements of politicians describe your reality. Ms. Quillen, who voted for Mr. Trump, complies with the Affordable Care Act, but finds that employees who live paycheck to paycheck refuse to buy insurance at $150 a month. When her congressman visited D.E.P. and assumed government regulations must be a burden, she assured him, no, that wasn\u2019t her problem.Carmakers are \u201cconstantly pushing costs down, costs down, costs down,\u201d Ms. Quillen said from the passenger seat of the Tahoe, speeding east. \u201cBut meanwhile people want $15 an hour for minimum wage.\u201dThe business fair she was attending, at a hotel in Dearborn, Mich., promised her the vital chance to meet buyers from Toyota and Fiat Chrysler, in the hopes of bringing new business in the door.As a young female entrepreneur, Ms. Quillen prided herself on having the toughness to make a factory run efficiently. \u201cI have a more challenging time with the more social aspect of things,\u201d she acknowledged.But she could not avoid putting herself out there forever. \u201cI need to be out meeting people, establishing those relationships, getting those potential work opportunities in the door,\u201d she said, as if giving herself a pep talk.Turning to her administrative assistant, who was driving, she confided that a big D.E.P. customer seemed to be preparing to shift its injection molding work to China. \u201cI\u2019ve asked them point-blank, \u2018Have you guys decided to source this somewhere else?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Quillen said. \u201cThey told me no.\u201dShe didn\u2019t believe it. She had sources in the company. \u201cIf that\u2019s their choice, I understand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business decision. But don\u2019t lie to my face. Man up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m 12 and I told you I don\u2019t want to be your girlfriend anymore.\u201dThe reasons include two familiar sources of social upheaval: the widening education gap between rural and urban residents, and a health crisis in rural areas gripped by opioid abuse.Ms. Quillen, who employs 57 people on her factory floor, would like to create more jobs at higher pay in her hometown, where she went to high school and met her husband, Nick Quillen, a former teacher who now oversees the factory floor. (She bristles at suggestion of nepotism, though: \u201cDo not ever refer to him as my husband,\u201d she scolded an underling who made the mistake of doing so.)But an opening for a machine operator, paying $9.50 to $11.50 an hour, can create a near crisis.\u201cEveryone jokes about millennials,\u201d Ms. Quillen says, \u201cbut the generation younger than me, I\u2019ve noticed their sense of responsibility to come to work is nonexistent.\u201dThe opioid epidemic has breached the factory\u2019s walls anyway. Two D.E.P. workers were fired after overdosing in the past year, one in a company restroom.On a piece of plastic no bigger than a cigarette lighter rested great hopes.It was a Friday in late spring, and Ms. Quillen was about to join a conference call with one of the world\u2019s largest parts suppliers. In the automotive food chain, big suppliers like Delphi and Johnson Controls constitute Tier One. They sell directly to the carmakers. D.E.P., which primarily sells to other suppliers, is in Tier Two.\u201cTier Ones are eating whole peanuts,\u201d Ms. Quillen says mordantly. \u201cWe take the crumbs.\u201dD.E.P. was trying to take some control over its destiny.Ms. Quillen was proposing to make a new part used in the transmission of General Motors vehicles. It had taken weeks to design and fabricate a prototype. Now, the little part sat on a conference table in the Tier One\u2019s offices outside Detroit.Ms. Quillen apologized for dialing in rather than attending the meeting. But it was also true that her own office was where she felt most confident, seated at a large L-shaped desk. On her windowsill were two copies of \u201cLean In\u201d by Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. She had been reading the new Ivanka Trump book, \u201cWomen Who Work,\u201d which she praised for \u201cgood information, good suggestions.\u201dShe sees herself as a driver of people, as a manager who places great demands on her workers and on herself. Others could find her intimidating. On one of her two Dell monitors was a sticky note to herself: \u201cIt\u2019s About Feelings.\u201d\u201cI built a wall around myself,\u2019\u2019 she had said earlier, describing how she rescued the company from years of unprofitability. \u201cIf I had allowed myself to be vulnerable, you get hurt, and if you get hurt you start to lose confidence in your ability.\u2019\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I became immune to people,\u201d she said.On the call, the Tier One executive, a woman, expressed interest in the part D.E.P. had designed, but said it would seek competing bids from other injection-molding companies, of which there were many. \u201cIt\u2019s our policy that we have to market-test the part,\u201d the executive said. \u201cYou\u2019d be competing against other suppliers that have the same capability.\u201dMs. Quillen seethed. When the call ended, she turned to Zach Norkey, her sales manager, who had listened in beside her. \u201cDid I not say this?\u201d she said. \u201cWe did all this design work for them and they\u2019re out quoting somebody else.\u201dShe knew that D.E.P. would be outbid. Its own price, after all, factored in the design work the company\u2019s engineers had performed.\u201cWe should almost walk away from this,\u201d said Mr. Norkey, who had joined the company just four months earlier. \u201cWe\u2019re going to end up giving them free consulting.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting used,\u201d Ms. Quillen said.The phone rang. It was D.E.P.\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s representatives \u2014 two freelance salesmen who work for several different companies. They had been at the Tier One\u2019s offices during the call.One of them proposed seeking a patent. Ms. Quillen said that would take years. The salesman said he had reminded the Tier One executive that D.E.P. was minority-owned. Ms. Quillen, whose mother is of Mexican descent, said she doubted that would count for anything.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care what color my skin is,\u201d Ms. Quillen said. \u201cShe just wants to only pay 5 cents.\u201dShe worried that the Tier One would distribute the design specifications of D.E.P.\u2019s prototype to other companies.\u201cThe fact is, I want my part back,\u201d she said, tapping her desk with a lipstick. \u201cI want my information back.\u201dMs. Quillen has her father to thank for her place in life \u2014 and to blame.Travis W. Pearse Jr. was a salesman: a manufacturer\u2019s rep, like the men his daughter now employs. The son of a banker, he built relationships and won contracts over rounds of golf with buyers for the carmakers. He was so good at it that he was able to buy a controlling interest in D.E.P.\u2019s predecessor company, Mid-American Products, in 2001.Those were boom years. The company had 300 employees in three buildings on Wildwood Avenue, a commercial stretch between the airport and downtown Jackson. Employees referred to Building 3, where the executives worked, as \u201cthe country club.\u201dHis daughter was at Michigan State, pursuing a childhood dream to become a doctor. One summer, she took a clerical job at the plant and fell in love with manufacturing.It was controlled chaos, like on TV shows about hospitals, but with machines instead of patients. She left Michigan State and entered the business full time, first in personnel, then in purchasing.Her father\u2019s brand of relationship-driven deal-making was already on the decline when General Motors, Mid-American\u2019s largest customer, sought bankruptcy protection in 2009 during the financial crisis. G.M. yanked away Mid-American\u2019s largest line of business, a valve lifter guide, a part used deep inside an engine block, that provided 80 percent of its revenues.Mid-American was soon forced into bankruptcy.Ms. Quillen was 28. Her mother, Armida Flores, a retired high-school Spanish teacher, had joined Mr. Pearse in the business. Ms. Quillen watched as her parents, who had personally guaranteed company loans, nearly crumbled under the pressure.Their daughter came to the rescue. Cashing in her 401(k) and mortgaging her home, Ms. Quillen and three partners bought Mid-American\u2019s injection-molding machines and other assets, and reopened as D.E.P.In hindsight, she blames her father\u2019s people-pleasing ways, in part, for the bankruptcy. He was too trusting of his executives, too trusting of the automakers. \u201cThere is a huge difference between a salesman and a C.E.O.,\u201d she tells him now.Ms. Quillen calls her father forgiving, a warmhearted person, someone who can make anyone feel good. By contrast, she says, \u201cI\u2019m the tin man, seeking a heart.\u201dIn March 2011, The Jackson Citizen-Patriot ran a five-paragraph article about Mid-American\u2019s bankruptcy and Ms. Quillen\u2019s role in the surviving company.An anonymous commenter took a swipe at her online: \u201cWhat a joke. Time for miss prissy to get a real job instead of mommy and daddy taking care of her. Good luck in the real world Anita.\u201dShe hid out in a restroom so no one would see her tears. \u201cIf your skin is not very thick, and you\u2019re not a driven and dominant personality, an environment like this will just eat you up,\u201d she says.Taking over the business was not easy at all.Her partners did not trust her to manage it, so they hired a president from the outside. Eyeing independence, Ms. Quillen earned an M.B.A. at night while continuing to work full time.In 2013, she bought out two of her partners, eased out the president and began a scorched-earth campaign to reduce costs.But her strict focus on the bottom line has put her at odds with advisers like an informal consultant, Milton H. Roye, Jr., a former G.M. executive, who visited D.E.P. in May. She admitted she had lost potential orders because the company was not growing fast enough.\u201cPeople always look at the top number, and I always look at the bottom number,\u201d she told Mr. Roye in her office, at a table with a sculpture of the word \u201cdream\u201d between them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you make $15 million in sales revenue, but how much money did you make at the end of the year?\u201dHer banker, she said, loves her focus on the bottom line.Mr. Roye steered the conversation to what he saw as a vulnerability: Ms. Quillen\u2019s lack of personal effort building relationships in the industry. \u201cI would embrace this weird thought Milton has that I, Anita, need to get involved,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cFind out who some of the key people are to meet. Don\u2019t send your V.P. of XYZ.\u201dWeeks later, at the hotel in Dearborn, a poster on a gold tripod welcomed Ms. Quillen to the Michigan Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\u2019s \u201cSeventh Annual Diversity Matchmaker.\u201d Toyota and Fiat Chrysler were \u201cmarquee sponsors.\u201dShe circled the ballroom, her long hair tucked up in a conservative bun.In every direction were steel bushings, aluminum engine components and all manner of plastic widgets. But after looking around, Ms. Quillen came to the conclusion that the big companies sponsoring the event had not actually sent representatives to do any business. Her 80-mile trip had been a waste.On the last morning in June, a Friday, there was good news: The company controller reported that D.E.P. had had its most profitable month in years.Ms. Quillen invited her executives to a toast at the end of the day, which was also the last day before the one-week shutdown.\u201cJust a brief story,\u201d Ms. Quillen told executives as she uncorked a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Honey. \u201cI made a commitment that if we hit a certain monthly profit I would do whiskey shots. And we\u2019re celebrating for this June that ended today, which is the best we\u2019ve had in years.\u2019\u2019Ms. Quillen walked the factory floor, hushed after the presses had been shut down and the shift workers had clocked out. Light from clerestory windows bounced off blue-painted walkways.A message board on a wall silently cycled through announcements: the names of workers with perfect attendance in June; employee of the month.She reached up for the power switch. She fumbled for it, searching the sides and the back of the monitor. Then she found it, and the screen went dark.Advertisement"}

Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cGovernments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.\u201dFacebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet\u2019s fragmentation \u2014 and increasingly, its consequences.The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people \u2014 about a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotel Buffets, a Culprit of Food Waste, Get Downsized", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir initial finding \u2014 that guests ate just over half of the food put out \u2014 surprised almost everyone. Perhaps even more striking was that only 10 to 15 percent of the leftovers could be donated or repurposed because of food safety regulations, while the rest ended up in the garbage. The sizable waste generated by coffee, juices and other liquids added to the conundrum.\u201cIt was a shock,\u201d said Mr. Eells, who oversees some 5,000 event buffets annually and many more buffets in the property\u2019s restaurants. \u201cThe scope of the problem was an eye-opener beyond belief.\u201dThough no good data exists yet about how much hotels or their buffets specifically contribute to the overall waste total, the thinking is that hotels are an ideal place to raise awareness and change behaviors around sustainability issues, as they have for water conservation.By targeting buffets, Hyatt and Ideo are zeroing in on a hotel staple that by definition oozes excess. The question is why that is so, and what can be done to rein it in without shortchanging guests.This is potentially tricky territory. For starters, hotels are loath to do anything that might upset guests. Ideo discovered that one key contributor to the food-waste problem is a fear of not having enough food, and so hotel personnel and conference organizers both inflate expected head counts to guard against any shortage. At the same time, guests pile their plates high to avoid going back for seconds, and to ensure that they get enough of the dishes they want.\u201cFor all these different stakeholders, running out of food is their worst nightmare,\u201d said Hailey Brewer, a director with Ideo in New York. \u201cEach person is a little overinsured.\u201dOnce solutions are identified, Hyatt intends to roll them out at properties around the country, and some simple fixes have already been made in Orlando. Instead of large platters of meats and cheese, guests see sample plates that can be ordered directly from servers. Yogurt will be available in single servings, instead of large bowls. Bountiful baskets of bread and butter, long a buffet standard, are shrinking; because of changing dietary habits, they now rank high among leftover foods.Portion sizes of some items are down, too, while more finger pastries are offered in lieu of whole cakes and pies. Mr. Eells said that these changes have already cut buffet costs by about 10 percent, and that guests haven\u2019t objected.Other changes are in the works to engage consumers and to make buffets more data-driven. The Ideo team has been testing subtle messaging that might appear on or near buffets, along with ways for hotels to collect more information about guests\u2019 dietary preferences and meal schedules. These so-called eater profiles would enable chefs and event planners to know in advance when diners plan to eat off-property or if they would like to request special meals.So far, consumers seem open to providing more information about their plans and food sensitivities, especially if it aids conservation efforts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too aware of the waste, but if we could do our part, that would be a good thing,\u201d said Dinesh Collins, a travel business operator who regularly attends conferences.The challenge will be finding the right balance between delivering a high level of service and minimizing waste.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be preached to as they are going through the breakfast buffet,\u201d Mr. Pearson said. \u201cAt the same time, we shouldn\u2019t allow people to stack everything on their plates and then just toss it away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He is a rich man who often behaves like the caricature of a rich man \u2014 a brash, big-talking native New Yorker who flaunts his cars (\u201cI have all the Teslas\u201d), humblebrags about a popular podcast he hosts (he guesses it makes about $1 million in annual revenue, \u201cbut it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s brand-building\u201d), and even promotes his own branded paper coffee cups.\u201cHave you seen my new cups?\u201d he asked by way of greeting during an interview last month. \u201cI love my cups. They\u2019ve got my tagline: \u2018Do The Work.\u2019 \u201dMr. Calacanis, 46, admits his personality is not for everyone. \u201cMost folks think I\u2019m lucky, some say I\u2019m a complete fraud, and a handful think I\u2019m a brilliant hype man, and I don\u2019t agree with any of them \u2014 I agree with all of them,\u201d he writes in his new book, published in July, whose full title is a mouthful: \u201cAngel: How to Invest in Technology Startups \u2014 Timeless Advice From An Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000.\u201dYet there is something refreshing and clarifying about Mr. Calacanis\u2019s frankness regarding his tech-fueled riches. He states plainly what many in Silicon Valley believe but are too politic to say \u2014 and which has lately been dawning on the rest of the world: that the tech industry is decimating the rest of the planet\u2019s wealth and stability.Still, Mr. Calacanis is offering a much more dismal view of the disruptions caused by tech \u2014 and a more radical, if also self-serving, plan for dealing with it. To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future \u2014 and you need to learn Silicon Valley\u2019s ways rather than expect to defeat it.\u201cMost of you are screwed,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel,\u201d arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America. \u201cThe world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which you\u2019re reading this.\u201dMr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead. \u201cIn my mind, candidly, we\u2019ve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dBe warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as \u201cangel investing.\u201d Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing \u2014 he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.\u201cI want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors,\u201d he says.Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice. They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks. Invest in start-ups with your \u201cfun money\u201d but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.Even other tech investors aren\u2019t sold on Mr. Calacanis\u2019s movement. Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms. \u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to lose all your money, you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Walk said.Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups. His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacanis\u2019s isn\u2019t without its apparent grifts. Mr. Calacanis runs a \u201csyndicate,\u201d a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets. The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate \u2014 and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors\u2019 returns.Not that he\u2019s shy about any of this. \u201cOf course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dYou could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades. He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, \u201cWhat would it be like to be rich?\u201dHe got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York. Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million. Along the way, he made dozens of connections \u2014 he casually name-drops every big name in tech \u2014 and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into \u201cdeal flow,\u201d getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.One charge against Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice is that his wins aren\u2019t widely replicable \u2014 not everyone can make a fortune off their friends\u2019 billion-dollar ideas, after all.But Mr. Calacanis isn\u2019t suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to wind up being the GOAT,\u201d he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.\u201dInstead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business. He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his. Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals. He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort \u2014 people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.And he is frank about the risks. The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, \u201cDON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.\u201dBut to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking. The world seems to have lost its moorings; it\u2019s changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.So shouldn\u2019t you do something big? As Mr. Calacanis argues: \u201cNo gamble, no future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Better Beet, Fresh From the Market", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenI know I\u2019m not the only one who grew up on waterlogged canned beets, which definitely predisposes a person to dislike the vegetable. The vacuum-packed, shelf-stable cooked beets are not much better.But, oh, the joy of just-pulled garden beets! Sweet and earthy, they really have no comparison. It\u2019s a pity they don\u2019t sell already cooked beets at farmers\u2019 markets here in the United States as they do in France, fairly asking to be sliced and dressed.Here, we just have to cook them to perfection at home. A little water in the bottom of a tightly covered roasting pan essentially steams them in the oven. Let them cool slightly, and you can rub off the skins with your fingers or a kitchen towel. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re done just as you do with potatoes, when a paring knife slips in easily \u2014 it usually takes a little over an hour.There\u2019s nothing wrong with boiling peeled beets in salted water, and sometimes it is the most expedient way. But cooking them skin-on imparts a more robust flavor. I find it very convenient to roast and peel a half-dozen beets to keep in the fridge, to use one way or another throughout the week. May as well have a few hard-cooked eggs, too. The egg-beet combo is always a good one, especially when bathed with an assertive vinaigrette.A composed salad of sweet beets and ripe tomatoes makes a winning starter. When tomatoes are out of season, use wedges of cooked beets for a satisfying addition to green salads. Beets, like many other vegetables, come in a large assortment of colors. At the market, you\u2019ll find the familiar ruby red along with golden, pale pink, ivory and even striped ones.Yes, I\u2019ll admit to a somewhat obsessive fondness for this earthy root vegetable, with its myriad possibilities. When you get me going, I\u2019m a regular beet booster. Brighten your day with a steaming bowl of borscht, rich with crimson-stained vegetables in a savory beef broth, topped with sour cream. Or eat the soup cold for lunch, and brighten the next day.I recommend sliced yellow beets in a zippy mustard-seed dressing for a perfect first course at home or a fine desk lunch. It couldn\u2019t be easier to put together and keeps for days.Know that dressings and seasonings need to be assertive to stand up to most beets\u2019 overriding sweetness. Cooked beets for a salad can usually handle extra salt and vinegar.I have taken lately to preparing hot roasted beets and serving them \u201cbaked potato style,\u201d with the usual little accompaniments: salt and pepper, sweet butter, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, chives. A pinch of Korean red pepper, perhaps. Or, dressed up with smoked salmon and caviar, they become a deluxe affair.For the best beets, head to the nearest farmers\u2019 market. But when the vendors ask if you want the fresh green beet tops chopped off and discarded, look at them in horror. And spread the word that cooked beet greens taste like chard and spinach twirled together, in the best possible way.This article is an excerpt from \u201cDavid Tanis Market Cooking: Recipes and Revelations, Ingredient by Ingredient.\u201d (Artisan, 2017).cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Matsumoto said that Mr. Shkreli\u2019s post could be perceived as a true threat.\u201cThat is a solicitation to assault in exchange for money that is not protected by the First Amendment,\u201d she said.Mr. Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety as a pharmaceutical executive for increasing the price of a lifesaving drug, Daraprim, by 5,000 percent. He was convicted in August of three counts of fraud, relating to two hedge funds and a pharmaceutical company he previously ran. On Wednesday, he was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 16, but he most likely will not be released before then unless his lawyers can show that he poses no threat to the community.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s online offer last week prompted prosecutors to request that his bail be revoked \u2014 and the Secret Service to investigate. \u201cOn HRC\u2019s book tour, try to grab a hair from her,\u201d he wrote, referring to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWill pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton.\u201dAlthough Mr. Shkreli edited the post to say that he had meant it to be satirical, and he later took it down altogether, prosecutors contended that there was a risk that one of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s social media followers would take the post seriously and act on it.It was, they noted, not the first time that Mr. Shkreli had made inflammatory posts on social media.Just before his conviction, prosecutors wrote, Mr. Shkreli had made a sexual threat toward a female journalist on Twitter; since then, they wrote, \u201cShkreli has engaged in an escalating pattern of threats and harassment.\u201dMr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, argued at the hearing that Mr. Shkreli was not violent and that the post had been \u201ca momentary lapse in judgment.\u201dMr. Shkreli, he said, deserved another chance.\u201cStupid doesn\u2019t make you violent,\u201d Mr. Brafman said, adding that his client\u2019s Facebook posts had shown \u201cimmaturity, satire, a warped sense of humor.\u201dBut Judge Matsumoto was unmoved.\u201cWhat is funny about that?\u201d she responded. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who his followers are.\u201dJudge Matsumoto said that while Mr. Shkreli had edited the original post to say, \u201cthis is satire, meant for humor,\u201d the next day he put up another post that echoed the first: \u201c$5,000 but the hair has to include a follicle. Do not assault anyone for any reason ever (LOLIBERALS).\u201dMr. Shkreli, dressed in a lavender button-down shirt, was animated for much of the hearing, as he had been throughout his trial. But his behavior changed when Judge Matsumoto said that she had decided to jail him, and he sat quietly at the defense table for the rest of the hearing.After the hearing, two deputy United States marshals led Mr. Shkreli to a holding cell adjoining the courtroom. He will be held at a federal jail in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yotam Ottolenghi on Creating Recipes for His Cookbook \u2018Sweet\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere is an image that I can\u2019t shake: It\u2019s a Sunday afternoon, around 4, probably. My husband, Karl, looks out the window of our first-floor West London flat; an expression of clear foreboding appears on his face and then, very quietly, he says, \u201cHelen\u2019s here \u2026 with her cakes.\u201dHelen Goh then walks through our front door like a gust of wind or, rather, an overzealous dusting of icing sugar, carrying more cartons than humanly possible and, before even setting them down, begins apologizing for all the things that went wrong with her cakes. This one hasn\u2019t risen properly, the other bowed around the center, an icing has split during its application, a sabayon lost its air, a sorbet failed to churn, a sugar syrup crystallized, a cookie crumbled and so on and on and on.It took seeing Helen at work \u2014 first on the savory side of the kitchen, then on the pastry side and then, later still, spending much of her time dreaming up pastries, cakes and all manner of sweet things for the company \u2014 for the penny to drop. I finally realized that it was Helen\u2019s restlessness and her insatiable drive for perfection that had brought her to me.What we shared was the notion that there is no upper limit to the number of times you can bake a cake or the amount of thought that can go into the components of a tart in order to get it just right; that you can discuss the minutiae of a chocolate ice cream or a nut brittle as if the fate of the entire universe rests on the conversation, without worrying for a second that this may be, just maybe, a tiny bit over the top.Baking brought out both our inner kids \u2014 and, also, our inner geeks, with all the precise measuring, timing and weighing that informed all of our chats. The combination of the child whose enthusiasm never wanes and the nerd who won\u2019t rest until it\u2019s perfect led to some pretty sweet results.Officially, she\u2019s a \u201cproduct developer\u201d for Ottolenghi, but that doesn\u2019t really do her role justice; her originality and perfectionism have had an enormous impact on what we do. From Australia, she brought wonderfully crumbly and sharp yo-yo cookies, her billowy powder puff cakes that are just impossible to put down, and her chocolate cake, which is the cake grown-up kids dream of, and which a newspaper in Australia once called \u201cthe world\u2019s best.\u201dHer Malaysian heritage came through loudly in her chiffon cakes and pandan-infused pineapple tarts, which we often placed on the counter alongside our mince pies around Christmas. Her fluency in European and American baking traditions are there everywhere, from the almond-and-aniseed nougat bars piled by the register to our cheesecakes, cupcakes, madeleines and scones, which all sit beside the cakes I grew up eating, like the syrup-soaked semolina cake here.Still, as much as we adhered to the old Sunday format, I must say that our capacity to consume sugar and abandon ourselves in cake conversation isn\u2019t quite what it used to be. I suspect it has to do with the fact that we both became parents in recent years. In our first meeting after Helen\u2019s son Sam was born, the 3-week-old was resting in his Moses basket next to us while Helen and I were debating the merits of different consistencies of marshmallow for making s\u2019mores. To my regret, I sent an offhand tweet reporting that an infant is the third wheel in our regular tastings, only to receive a bunch of grave warnings from concerned followers about the fatal risks of feeding cakes to newborns.Setting aside this particular mishap, the arrival of Sam and his brother, Jude, and later on the birth of my boys, Max and Flynn, did slightly alter the nature of our tastings. Our attention now has to be harnessed and somewhat focused; deliberations are shorter.Children\u2019s birthday parties are now natural testing grounds for sponges, and the boys are some of our fiercest critics. Just the other day I offered Max, now 4 years old, a slice of cake, to which he quickly replied, \u201cDid Helen make it?\u201d\u201cI am afraid not,\u201d I said.\u201cNo, then,\u201d was his resolute and final answer. What a few years back may have been a very lengthy discussion was over before it had even started.This article is an excerpt from \u201cSweet\u201d by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh (Ten Speed Press, 2017).cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From an Undervalued Region in France, New Energy, New Inspiration and Great Wines", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourPRAYSSAC, France \u2014 Back in 1975, Jean-Marie Sigaud had a brilliant idea.Those slopes throughout Cahors were now abandoned, covered in trees, with the occasional stone terrace wall the only reminder of the presence of vineyards before the phylloxera aphid devastated the grapevines of Europe in the late 19th century.Cahors has not seen much excitement in a long time, centuries maybe. In the Middle Ages, its coastal rival Bordeaux blocked Cahors and other inland regions from using its ports until Bordeaux\u2019s own wines were sold, effectively stymying growth. Although the quality of the wines was appreciated in the 19th century, Cahors has more recently been little more than a backwater, a place more recognized for its potential than valued for its wines.But a new era of hope seems to have dawned in Cahors. Projects like Mr. Sigaud\u2019s hillside vineyard, along with outside interest in the region and an energetic younger generation of producers, have injected Cahors with a sense of freshness and optimism, backed up by a group of exceptional wines.The malbec connection drew them to Cahors. That, and the fact that Mr. Parra is obsessed with limestone, and believes deeply that limestone and malbec are a wonderful combination for making wines with a distinctive sense of place.\u201cIt took us five years to find limestone in Argentina,\u201d he told me on a recent visit to Cahors. \u201cHere, it took five minutes.\u201dVines in Cahors are largely planted on a series of alluvial and gravel terraces rising from the Lot River, or on the plateau (or causse) above the terrace, where the limestone bedrock is covered by only a thin layer of soil. The limestone slopes in between, which Mr. Parra believes are the best terroir of all, are ignored except by Mr. Sigaud\u2019s vineyard. This, to Mr. Parra, amounts virtually to sacrilege.To Mr. Parra and Mr. Morescalchi, Cahors is a region of wonderful possibilities. In their analysis, Cahors has largely ignored the resources that can make its wines most distinctive. Instead, it has sought to model itself on Argentina, which has achieved great success making ripe, fruity malbecs; or on Bordeaux, which, when imitated by Cahors, yields oaky, blockbuster wines that are seldom interesting.\u201cA terrible bipolarity,\u201d Mr. Morescalchi called it.All are making wines in conjunction with Leonardo Erazo, the winemaker for Altos Las Hormigas. Each has its own label: Causse du Vidot with Croisille, Causse des Ons with Prince and Causse du Th\u00e9ron with the Sigauds. The first vintage of each was 2014, and, though made in small quantities, the wines should be available in the United States beginning this fall.Mr. Parra and Mr. Morescalchi recognize the dangers of outsiders appearing to tell the locals how to conduct their business.\u201cHere we are, two weird guys, telling them you have limestone and the future is great,\u201d Mr. Parra said. \u201c\u2018Who are these people?\u2019\u201dMr. Morescalchi added: \u201cIf we succeed, it\u2019s great. If not, we\u2019re the snake oil salesmen.\u201dSo far, it appears, so good. The wines I have tasted are superb. A 2014 Causse du Vidot from the terrasses was light and lovely, though they lack a great deal of depth. But a 2014 Causse du Vidot from the plateau was fresh and structured, with earthy raspberry flavors and persistent underlying minerality, an excellent wine.A 2014 Causse des Ons from the plateau was fuller and more tannic, not as graceful as the Vidot but powerfully mineral. Best of all was the 2014 Causse du Th\u00e9ron En Pente, from the Sigauds\u2019 hillside vineyard, a wine full of tension, with dense mineral flavors entwined with raspberry fruit, long, deep and intense. Grand cru, indeed.\u201cOur wines have become more elegant and precise, and less extracted,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Sigaud. \u201cWe find flavors that our grandfathers knew.\u201dWhile their project is the most visible sign of evolution in Cahors, it would be wrong to ignore the young Cahors producers who are themselves bringing change to the region with their excellent wines.In the village of Trespoux-Rassiels, Fabien Jouves\u2019s Mas del P\u00e9ri\u00e9 is making superb wines from a number of excellent terroirs. Instead of blending the grapes from the various parcels, as his father did and as has been the custom in Cahors, he now vinifies them separately and aims for grace rather than force.\u201cI\u2019ve changed the style,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too Bordelais. My philosophy is more Burgundian. Instead of mixing it all together, I want to show different sides. Cahors is very complex.\u201dHis first vintage was 2006, which he dismisses. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d he said. Since 2009, he has farmed organically, and since 2011, biodynamically.\u201cWhen I began, the wine was bigger and sweeter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith biodynamics, there\u2019s much more tension, precision and salinity.\u201dMr. Jouves\u2019s 2014 La Roque, from a vineyard of rocky marl, is clear, precise and savory, and it costs only about $20. His two best sites are Les Acacias, with plenty of limestone, which makes an elegant, gravelly wine; and Bloc B763, fractured limestone with a lot of iron, which makes a softly mineral wine of great finesse.\u201cYou have to show your emotions, your personality in the wine,\u201d he said.Nearby, in the village of Saint-Vincent-Rive-d\u2019Olt, Julien Ilbert of Ch\u00e2teau Combel-la-Serre makes easygoing introductions to Cahors, like his 2015 Le Pur Fruit du Causse, which is aged in stainless steel, yet nonetheless demonstrates the underlying mineral character of malbec from Cahors. He also makes exceptional expressions from limestone like Les Peyres Levades, precise, fresh and distinctive with flavors of menthol, herbs and minerals.\u201cI want Cahors on my labels, not malbec,\u201d Mr. Ilbert said. \u201cCahors is the region, the terroir, the people. We\u2019re not malbec, not Argentina.\u201dSo far, no other plans have surfaced to plant vineyards on the hillsides. The cost of clearing trees and working steep slopes may be too great. But the wines emerging from Cahors are so good, and are such good values, that somebody before long may be inspired to make the investment.Looking at the Sigaud vineyard, Mr. Parra said, \u201cThere are many places in Cahors like this, but it\u2019s for the future, the next generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Renews Offensive on Silicon Valley With Tax Reforms", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s offensive against Silicon Valley looks as though it is likely to resume, as officials in Brussels consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by digital titans like Facebook and Amazon.The new proposals, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times on Wednesday, broadly aim to tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.But the plans will give ammunition to critics who argue the European Union unfairly targets the United States technology sector. Though the bloc\u2019s leaders deny that they single out American firms, opponents point to an array of investigations against household names for suspected violations ranging from how they handle user data to antitrust complaints.But it was not clear whether the latest effort by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, would gain sufficient traction. Any such reform would require the unanimous approval of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states. While several major countries like France have pushed for a crackdown, others do not want to change a system in which some of them can attract corporations with tax incentives and other inducements.In seeking to tax revenue rather than profit \u2014 one of the options being considered \u2014 European regulators want to ensure that major internet companies pay taxes to national treasuries where they do business. For example, Amazon, a target of the commission in the past, operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000, and so can take advantage of its low taxes.\u201cThe main challenge is to reform the international tax framework, which was first designed at the start of the 20th century and is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d the report said. It will be published by the commission on Thursday.The existing system \u201chas worked well for traditional \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 companies but as business activities have become more globalized and digitalized the old rules work less well,\u201d it continued.It found that companies that did their business online were paying an effective tax rate of 8.5 percent, or less than half that paid by more traditional businesses.The European Union stepped up its efforts to curb tax avoidance, by companies as well as wealthy individuals, after the financial crisis, which forced many of its member states to adopt belt-tightening measures, slashing public services and raising taxes.The commission said in its latest proposals that it wants to agree to a long-term solution with other countries around the world. But that could take a long time to negotiate, and may not close enough loopholes, so it put forward several shorter-term plans that could wind up meaning companies like Amazon, Facebook and Netflix pay larger tax bills in Europe much sooner.\u201cIn the absence of adequate global progress, E.U. solutions should be advanced,\u201d the commission said, adding that it could make more formal proposals on taxation in the coming months.The potential reforms it outlined include taxing companies based on their revenue rather than their profits, allowing national authorities to tax payments made by consumers to digital businesses, and allowing individual countries to tax revenue generated from advertising by internet companies.France has thrown its weight behind the first of those reforms, in particular. But questions have been raised over whether taxing revenue is a viable plan. Businesses that turn a hefty profit could effectively pay the same as a company of a similar size that has narrower margins, or even loses money.\u201cThe fundamental question is where is the business really being conducted,\u201d said J. Scott Marcus, an analyst at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe devil is in the details with a digital service across borders \u2014 the service can be made anywhere.\u201d\u201cThe question is who gets the tax,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine challenge.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simple Investing for Nonprofits", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe boards of small nonprofit organizations must make major investment decisions, but they are often flying in the dark.There is a simple answer, which works for many small institutions as well as for individuals saving for retirement. It is to put money into low-cost stock and bond funds, allocate the money appropriately and rebalance periodically. But the boards of nonprofits don\u2019t always find this straightforward approach appealing for a variety of reasons, many of them psychological.For one thing, not every nonprofit has board members who want to take responsibility for decisions that could affect their institution\u2019s financial health. Even members with financial expertise may feel ill equipped to make an investment decision in a stressful market.Hiring outside money managers to handle these burdens comes at a price and with no guarantee of success. Assembling a team of superb money managers, as Yale, Princeton and other universities have tried to do, may not be realistic for nonprofits that don\u2019t have an enormous endowment.That\u2019s why Larry Kochard, who oversees the University of Virginia\u2019s $8.6 billion endowment and sits on the board of the $18 million Virginia Environmental Endowment, says the simple solution, equity and bond index funds, makes sense for smaller institutions.Finding good outside advisers is possible for institutions without deep pockets, he said, but it is very difficult. \u201cThe odds of a small endowment finding the right managers are very slim,\u201d Mr. Kochard said.For the most part, he advocated modest goals, saying: \u201cIf we are watching our allocations and spending and rebalancing, we are meeting our obligations.\u201dMs. Shuman also favors index funds for nonprofits, but warns that the success of index funds over the past several years has largely been driven by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\u201cThey drove a disproportionate return,\u201d she said, and if these stocks decline, the indexes will fall, too. She recommends Vanguard\u2019s managed equity and international funds for low-cost but actively managed alternatives.When considering whether to hold hedge funds, which often do not allow immediate liquidation of investments, many nonprofits may need to examine whether they can afford to forgo access to their money for long periods.That\u2019s not always an issue, however. Before Patti Birch died in 2007, for example, she directed that her Patti and Everett B. Birch Foundation spend down all of its funds in the years ahead. The foundation\u2019s president, Vartan Gregorian, said it still gave money to \u201cthe arts, women\u2019s rights, religious and ethnic tolerance, freedom of speech and strengthening American democracy,\u201d all causes that were important to Ms. Birch. Mr. Gregorian is also president of the Carnegie Corporation.The foundation\u2019s remaining funds are all being held in low-risk short-term bonds, said Mark Imowitz, whose firm, Imowitz Koenig and Company, handles the finances.\u201cPatti was not worried about having great appreciation in her investment assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was natural to keep them in low-return funds since the money was being spent down.\u201dMany nonprofits have to think much longer term, however, and don\u2019t have the luxury of holding all of their assets in a single low-risk asset class.Roughly 80 percent of it is allocated to Commonfund\u2019s multistrategy equity fund, which includes a smattering of hedge funds, and it underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by 2.5 percentage points in the three years through April, Mr. Kempner said. The fund has improved lately, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a manager underperforms their benchmarks, you should not just immediately trade managers. You have to understand what is wrong and how can they plan to fix it \u201cFees vary widely and are not always transparent. Commonfund, which manages about $24 billion in nonprofit money for about 1,400 clients, charges an average fee of 0.3 percent directly, according to Keith Luke, Commonfund\u2019s president. But because the managers selected by Commonfund for nonprofit portfolios also charge fees and because there are additional expenses, the overall fee paid by nonprofits is about 1 percent on average, he said.Commonfund \u201cis like an institutional mutual fund,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cWe create a commingled investment vehicle of managers who pick stocks across all strategies.\u201d\u201cThere is scaled pricing,\u201d he said, \u201cand the larger the portfolio, the smaller the fee.\u201d For sizable portfolios \u2014 about $20 million \u2014 the overall fee would be less than 0.14 percent with Vanguard, he said.Geraldine Fabrikant is a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When the Rich Said No to Getting Richer", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA half-century ago, a top automobile executive named George Romney \u2014 yes, Mitt\u2019s father \u2014 turned down several big annual bonuses. He did so, he told his company\u2019s board, because he believed that no executive should make more than $225,000 a year (which translates into almost $2 million today).The old culture of restraint had multiple causes, but one of them was the tax code. When Romney was saying no to bonuses, the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent. Even if he had accepted the bonuses, he would have kept only a sliver of them.The high tax rates, in other words, didn\u2019t affect only the post-tax incomes of the wealthy. The tax code also affected pretax incomes. As the economist Gabriel Zucman says, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to try to earn $50 million in income when 90 cents out of an extra dollar goes to the I.R.S.\u201dThe tax rates helped create a culture in which Americans found gargantuan incomes to be bizarre.The theory behind all those high-end tax cuts \u2014 a theory that I once found persuasive, I admit \u2014 was that it would unleash entrepreneurial energy: The lure of great wealth would inspire business leaders to work harder and smarter, and the economy would flourish.The first half of that theory may well have come true. Many of the world\u2019s most successful companies are American \u2014 not only Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but also Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and JPMorgan Chase. The second half of the theory, however, has been a bust. Most Americans have not flourished in the era of a reduced top-end tax rate.Across society, the most powerful members of organizations have fought to keep more money for themselves. They have usually won that fight, which has left less money for everyone else.What would be the right top tax rate today? I don\u2019t know the precise answer. A top rate of 90 percent clearly has the potential to drive away entrepreneurs. But I am convinced that the current top tax rate, 39.6 percent, is too low.This week, President Trump and Congress will turn their attention to tax policy. After the failure of their health care bill, they are desperate for a legislative win and hope to pass a bill by year\u2019s end. Of course, they are not considering a higher top tax rate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Irma Shifting Forecasts: It\u2019s All a Matter of Probability", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of last week, the predicted track of Hurricane Irma snaked across Florida from south to north. When it seemed to be headed toward Miami, residents on the Atlantic Coast feared the worst, and many on the west side of the state felt safer by comparison.By Saturday, however, the storm track shifted to the west, putting Gulf Coast cities like Naples, Fort Myers and Tampa at risk of the most punishing winds and storm surge.Floridians who had traveled from east coast cities to the west in search of safety were whipsawed, as were those living in the west; Collier County, which includes Naples, did not order its evacuation until Friday.\u201cWe kind of thought \u2018Oh well, maybe we\u2019ve got some breathing room,\u2019\u201d said a spokeswoman in Collier County, Kate Albers. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s bearing down on us.\u201dThe wandering forecast has been a source of consternation for Florida residents. But was this a failure of the models that help officials plan for storms?He said he was willing to take on the risk of a powerful storm, but the prospect of what at the time appeared to be the eyewall of a Category 4 or even 5 slamming into Miami with obliterating force gave him \u201ca sickening vibe,\u201d he said. He recalled thinking, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here.\u201dWhen Irma\u2019s track shifted west, they drove back to face what he expected to be a rough but survivable blow.Even considering his own actions, he says officials in cities on the west coast of Florida could have been more attentive.\u201cFrom my perspective, the east coast and the west coast have been equally in play for the last week,\u201d he said. Counties like Collier should not have been as confident as they seemed to be.\u201cWhen the Keys and Miami started to do evacuations, they should have done Naples and Fort Myers and Tampa equally,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too many people at risk, the storm is big and it\u2019s strong, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in its way to weaken it.\u201dBut the technical forecasting for the storm, he said, was better than average given the current state of the science. \u201cThe models did very well with this,\u201d Dr. McNoldy said.As he explained, \u201cA hundred miles is the difference between the east coast and the west coast \u2014 but a hundred miles in a three-day forecast is really good.\u201dWith such a skinny state, he said, small shifts in the storm track within the broad cone of probability meant the difference between running up the east coast or the west, with nothing in current technology capable of saying with more certainty which coast it would be.\u201cWe\u2019re very many moons away from having accuracy like that\u201d from three days before a storm hits, he said.Many people trying to use forecasts like those provided by the National Hurricane Center, however, do not fully understand the cone of probability and focus instead on the line that runs down the middle, taking it as an accurate prediction of the storm\u2019s path.He wrote it was \u201csomewhat similar to why we have to issue rain forecasts as \u2018percent chance of rain\u2019 rather than telling you exactly that it is going to rain on your house at 5:42 p.m.\u201dThe fact that the track was within 50 to 75 miles of where the storm is headed is \u201ca good forecast, in model speak,\u201d Mr. Lanza said. \u201cBut from a human perspective, it poses enormous communication and risk challenges.\u201dThe degree of uncertainty inherent in the forecasting technology often makes it difficult for officials to make reliable stay-or-go decisions. By comparison, Mr. Lanza said, the predictions for Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall covered an enormous area, from Northern Mexico to just southwest of Houston.While Harris County, Texas has a population of 6.5 million people, much of that coast is more lightly populated. But with millions of people crowded along either Florida coast, \u201cwhere the exact center goes has enormous implications on what weather you see in Miami versus Fort Myers or Naples.\u201d\u201cNo single model is going to be right every time,\u201d Mr. Lanza noted, and considering the tremendous amount of data that has to be digested to come up with forecasts, \u201cI give extreme credit to the National Hurricane Center for the work they do.\u201d\u201cWith climate change expected to make the strongest hurricanes stronger in coming decades, storms like Harvey and Irma will assault our coasts with increasing frequency,\u201d Dr. Masters said. \u201cOur hurricane vulnerability problem is going to get progressively worse unless we dedicate more resources to the problem.\u201dCaitlin Dickerson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If ESPN Wants to Discipline Jemele Hill, She Might Have Law on Her Side", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo days after the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that tweets by an ESPN host disparaging President Trump were a \u201cfireable offense,\u201d she added on Friday that the network \u201cshould hold anchors to a fair and consistent standard.\u201dAny disciplining of the host, Jemele Hill, however, might be out of legal bounds for ESPN. The network is based in Bristol, Conn., and a Connecticut statute provides free-speech protections beyond the First Amendment, making it illegal for ESPN to punish Hill, according to some labor lawyers.\u201cJemele Hill was speaking about an important issue of public concern, one of the most crucial issues of current political life, and the statute was intended to protect people who say things just like what she said,\u201d said James Bhandary-Alexander, a lawyer at the New Haven Legal Assistance Association who frequently represents workers who are disciplined by employers for their speech.Hill posted a series of derogatory comments about the president on Monday, calling him a white supremacist. ESPN issued a statement that said her comments did not reflect the views of the company, and that she recognized that they were inappropriate. But the issue has become part of the intensely charged political atmosphere now gripping the country and raised questions as to whether a sports commentator should be restrained from making such remarks publicly.ESPN, which has veered further into programmed shows heavy on debate and opinion, has empowered, if not directed, its hosts to be provocative on subjects beyond sports, especially culture and society. Some of the opinions have brought sharp and widespread criticism, and the network has struggled to find a consistent approach in responding.The Connecticut Constitution\u2019s free-speech provision largely mirrors the United States Constitution\u2019s and is concerned with actions of the government, not private employers. Connecticut is one of many at-will states in this country, which means private employers can generally (with some exceptions) fire employees for any reason, or for no reason at all.But Connecticut also has General Statute 31-51q, which reads in part that any employer, including private employers, \u201cwho subjects any employee to discipline or discharge on account of the exercise by such employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution\u201d is liable for damages caused \u201cby such discipline or discharge.\u201d\u201cThat statute would prohibit ESPN from disciplining or discharging her based on that speech,\u201d said Todd Steigman, a partner at Madsen, Prestley and Parenteau who was part of the team that tried a major case defining the scope of the statute.ESPN declined to make a company lawyer available for an interview, and Hill\u2019s agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a 2006 case, Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court limited First Amendment protections for government employees. When government employees speak in the capacity of their job, and not as a private citizen, that speech is not protected.This can be interpreted broadly, for instance, to allow a police department to fire a police officer who reports corruption, because part of a police officer\u2019s job is to report criminal activity, and therefore his speech is not protected.But in a 2015 case before the Connecticut Supreme Court, Trusz v. UBS Realty Investors, the court ruled that people who work in Connecticut who comment on matters of \u201cpublic concern\u201d are protected by state law, extending some speech protection for those employees even beyond the First Amendment.Speech of \u201cpublic concern\u201d is an important concept. Hill\u2019s tweets \u2014 regarding President Trump and his beliefs and fitness for office \u2014 are some of the most highly protected forms of speech, legal experts said. \u201cComments on politics is typically one of those areas that is almost always a matter of public concern\u201d said Dan Schwartz, a partner at Shipman and Goodwin.Not all speech of public concern is protected. The Connecticut statute spells out when employees can be disciplined or discharged for it: \u201cProvided such activity does not substantially or materially interfere with the employee\u2019s bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and the employee.\u201dSchwartz, who does not believe the statute prevents ESPN from disciplining Hill, said there is a fair argument to make that Hill\u2019s speech interfered with her job performance. As a high-profile ESPN employee, part of her job is to attract sponsors and viewers, and her comments could have alienated them.\u201cIf you have sponsors who are refusing to support a show, then at what point does it materially interfere with performance?\u201d Schwartz said. That \u201chas to be part\u201d of ESPN\u2019s ability to look at what on-air staff does.On Wednesday night, after Hill said in a statement that she regretted that her public comments \u201cpainted ESPN in an unfair light,\u201d the network released its own statement saying that Hill had apologized for her Tweets, and that the company accepted that apology.On Friday morning, President Trump weighed in. \u201cESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming),\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPeople are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!\u201dThe state statute says that employees in Connecticut who are subject to \u201cdiscipline or discharge\u201d because of their speech may be owed damages. \u201cDischarge\u201d in this case is clear \u2014 ESPN did not fire Hill. But what constitutes discipline is murkier.Bhandary-Alexander said he believed that a warning from a boss constituted discipline.\u201cWe are in a moment where it is more important than ever that working people be able to express themselves politically,\u201d he said.But like Hill\u2019s case, Schilling\u2019s speech was of a political nature, on one of the most resonant issues of the day, and the speech was made on his personal Facebook account in his capacity as a private citizen.\u201cCurt Schilling was fired for his repeated instances of insubordination, some public and some not,\u201d said Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman. \u201cHe was not fired for his politics.\u201dSchilling\u2019s lawyer declined to discuss Schilling\u2019s firing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boys Puberty Book is Pulped After Aging Badly", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook NewsMr. Ragoonanan said that a follower of his blog alerted him to the book, which was originally published in 2013. \u201cThe context of this book is that it\u2019s aimed at boys, young boys, when they\u2019re forming their opinions about women. It was worrying that this kind of passage was out there,\u201d he said in an interview.Usborne Children\u2019s Books, the book\u2019s United Kingdom-based publisher, quickly apologized for the passage and announced on Aug. 31 that it would destroy its remaining stock of \u201cGrowing Up for Boys.\u201d\u201cWe recognize that we have made a mistake. For this we apologize and reiterate that the material will be revised. Our remaining stock will be removed from the warehouse and pulped,\u201d the publisher said.Despite Usborne\u2019s quick response, Mr. Ragoonanan\u2019s post was shared throughout the internet, with Mr. Frith and Usborne coming in for heavy criticism.According to Usborne, \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d has sold over 26,000 copies, mostly in the United Kingdom, and was in its seventh edition. It appears to be available still on Amazon\u2019s British site.When asked about the passage in question, Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the president of New York\u2019s Child Mind Institute, agreed with critics that it crossed a line.\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate statement for a few reasons. One, the audience the book is written for by and large won\u2019t make that shift between scientific fact and humor and, two, if they read it concretely it reinforces the stereotypes we have about boys and girls.\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s a rare pre-pubertal young man who can read a book that is on advice or science and be able to shift from memorizing scientific fact to recognizing something that is tongue in cheek,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do know that young kids are particularly concrete.\u201dMr. Frith and the series editor, Felicity Brooks \u2014 who are both parents themselves expressed dismay that their book might create negative impressions of women in the minds of young men.\u201cOf course a parent is right to be concerned about their child, and I welcome any feedback on my book so that I can make it better! If any parent read the entire book and felt concerned that young boys would grow up thinking they had a biological right to objectify women, then I am horrified,\u201d Mr. Frith said by email.Ms. Brooks echoed her author\u2019s sentiments. \u201cWe wrote these books out of parental concern too,\u201d she said. \u201cI came up with the idea of \u201cGrowing Up for Girls\u201d and \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d when my own daughter was approaching puberty, and I wanted to be well prepared with up-to-date and well researched information to help her and her friends, along with many thousands of others, navigate the minefield.\u201dAs is so often the case these days, the outrage about \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d has largely been expressed in cyberspace. In response to Mr. Ragoonanan\u2019s post, reviewers took to Amazon to register their disapproval. \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d was inundated with one-star reviews and critical messages about its content. One review, from Aug. 28, called the book a \u201cSexist piece of garbage.\u201d Twitter users also took aim at the book, questioning the judgment of its author and publisher.On Amazon\u2019s British page, however, \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d has 3.3 out of 5 stars and is listed as a best-seller in \u201cGeneral Health for Young Adults.\u201d One review, titled \u201cgood guide for tweenagers,\u201d commends its \u201csensible, age appropriate, honest, respectful and reassuring presentation of information.\u201dThis incident is yet another sign of how much the publishing environment has changed in the last few years, with parents and critics calling for greater diversity and attention paid to hidden sexism in children\u2019s books. Something that may have barely drawn attention previously, can now be fatal to a book. And, as Tricia Lowther from Let Books Be Books said, \u201csocial media in particular has been a huge catalyst for change.\u201d It\u2019s also allowed publishers to interact with and understand the concerns of their customers in a new way, she added.Mr. Frith made it clear that he recognizes the section should have been written differently, but added that trying to avoid controversy completely might have created another set of problems.\u201cTo be honest there are a handful of possibly controversial passages in the book \u2013 for example about drugs, pornography and sexuality \u2013 but we felt it was vital to include all of these as they are relevant and important for many of the teenagers who would read it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You must be one of those people \u201cupset about ideas\u201d you disagree with.Are you troubled when agents of a foreign power pose online as American Muslims and post incendiary content that right-wing commentators can cite as evidence that all American Muslims are sympathizers of terrorist groups like the Islamic State? Sounds like you can\u2019t handle a healthy debate.Does it bother you that Russian actors bought advertisements aimed at swing states to sow political discord during the 2016 presidential campaign, and that it took eight months after the election to uncover any of this? Well, the marketplace of ideas isn\u2019t for everyone.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s preposterous defense of Facebook\u2019s failure in the 2016 presidential campaign is a reminder of a structural asymmetry in American politics. It\u2019s true that mainstream news outlets employ many liberals, and that this creates some systemic distortions in coverage (effects of trade policies on lower-income workers and the plight of rural America tend to be underreported, for example). But bias in the digital sphere is structurally different from that in mass media, and a lot more complicated than what programmers believe.In a largely automated platform like Facebook, what matters most is not the political beliefs of the employees but the structures, algorithms and incentives they set up, as well as what oversight, if any, they employ to guard against deception, misinformation and illegitimate meddling. And the unfortunate truth is that by design, business model and algorithm, Facebook has made it easy for it to be weaponized to spread misinformation and fraudulent content. Sadly, this business model is also lucrative, especially during elections. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, called the 2016 election \u201ca big deal in terms of ad spend\u201d for the company, and it was. No wonder there has been increasing scrutiny of the platform.However, at the slightest sign that Facebook might be pressured to institute at least some sensible oversight (as has happened recently in the German and French elections, when the platform mass-deleted fake accounts), right-wing groups and politicians can swiftly bring Facebook to its heels with charges of bias, because Facebook responds to such pressure as much of the traditional media do: by caving and hiding behind flimsy \u201cthere are two sides to everything\u201d arguments.This right-wing strategy has been used to pressure Facebook since before the presidential election. It was revealed in April 2016, for example, that Facebook was employing a small team of contractors to vet its \u201ctrending topics,\u201d providing quality control such as weeding out blatant fake news. A single source from that team claimed it had censored right-wing content, and a conservative uproar ensued, led by organizations like Breitbart. Mr. Zuckerberg promptly convened an apologetic meeting with right-wing media personalities and other prominent conservatives to assure them the site was not biased against them.Facebook got rid of those contractors, who were already too few for meaningful quality control. So what did it do to stem the obvious rise in the scale and scope of misinformation, fake news and even foreign state meddling on the site in the months leading up to the election? Clearly not enough \u2014 for fear, no doubt, that it would again be accused of bias.Make no mistake: The flood of misinformation and fake news that went viral on the site was visible even to casual observers. A good chunk of such content featured outrageous claims about Hillary Clinton \u2014 that she had murdered F.B.I. agents, for example \u2014 as well as unfounded assertions that millions of undocumented immigrants were illegally voting.Even the conservative pundit and wild-eyed conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck, of all people, has expressed befuddlement at the charge that Facebook censored conservative content. He has correctly pointed out that Facebook had been a boon for right-wing groups, especially of the alt-right and Breitbart variety. There has been no change in this state of affairs since the election. Last week, the best-performing post on Facebook was a Breitbart article that called African-American athletes protesting police misconduct \u201cmillionaire ingrates.\u201dWhile there are plenty of left-wing conspiracy theories, outright fake news and fraudulent sites are more prevalent on the right, especially the far right. Opportunist fake news producers who were creating such content purely to make money typically gave up trying to monetize left-leaning fake news because it didn\u2019t go viral as easily on Facebook.After the election, Mr. Zuckerberg characterized the suggestion that such misinformation campaigns played an important role in the election to be a \u201ccrazy idea.\u201d This week, Mr. Zuckerberg reconsidered that comment, saying it was too dismissive. But his latest comments are still too dismissive, portraying those of us who are worried about misinformation campaigns and deception online as intolerant censors bothered by \u201cideas and content.\u201dA more astute observer of American politics than Mr. Zuckerberg might consider that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments are part of an effort to depict Facebook as anti-conservative, lest outrage about the company\u2019s role in the 2016 election prompt the site to adopt policies that would make a repeat of 2016 more difficult.For those of us who are tolerant of a wide range of ideas and arguments, but would still like deception and misinformation to not have such an easy foothold in society, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments do not inspire hope. Indeed, people across the political spectrum should be able to agree that not making it so easy, and so lucrative, for fake news to spread widely is better for all of us, since fake news isn\u2019t necessarily a right-wing phenomenon. But since Facebook has no effective competition, we can look forward only to being lectured on being more tolerant of \u201cideas\u201d we don\u2019t like, and to smug talk of the false equivalency of \u201cboth sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Prosecutors charged Mr. Quezada, 49, with multiple counts of felony sexual assault.At a court hearing on Monday, a judge allowed him to go free pending trial but required Mr. Quezada to wear an ankle monitor and limited his travel outside his house.Steven Wukovits, a lawyer who is representing him, said that Mr. Quezada was innocent and that the woman had fabricated the allegations to try to claim some of his lottery winnings. She is only the latest person to try to take advantage of Mr. Quezada after he won, Mr. Wukovits said.\u201cThe greatest day is when you win the lottery, and the saddest day is every day thereafter,\u201d Mr. Wukovits said in an interview on Monday night. \u201cYou find out that people perhaps only love you not because of the good person you are but because of what you have now.\u201dThe Passaic County prosecutor\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday night. Mr. Wukovits said the woman first told the police about the allegations in August.In March 2013, Mr. Quezada was working 18-hour days owning and operating a bodega in Passaic when he stopped by a liquor store in town and bought a $2 Powerball ticket. On the night of March 23, his numbers were drawn \u2014 17, 29, 31, 52, 53 and Powerball 31 \u2014 and his life changed forever. But not always in the way he had imagined.Mr. Quezada quit his job the day he came forward to claim his prize \u2014 a lump-sum payment of $152 million after taxes. \u201cMy life has changed,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt will not change my heart.\u201dBut seven months after he won, his former girlfriend sued him for a share of the prize. She claimed they had shared earnings and shared ownership of the bodega, meaning that she deserved a slice of the $152 million.The former girlfriend and Mr. Quezada later reconciled, his lawyer said on Monday, and she dropped the lawsuit. They now live together in Wayne, N.J., about 30 miles west of Manhattan.In recent years, Mr. Quezada\u2019s name has been used to try to dupe people in email scams claiming that he will share his earnings with the recipient. A Facebook page under his name also claims that he is giving out loans up to $1 million at 2.5 percent interest.\u201cIt\u2019s been very, very difficult,\u201d Mr. Wukovits said. \u201cThey are constantly being called by people who claim to be long-lost friends and long-lost family and are in dire need of money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Not-So-Glossy Future of Magazines", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne evening in mid-September, a gaggle of writers and bon vivant editors gathered by the outdoor fireplace and ivy-covered trellis of a West Village tavern. Steak was served, and the toasts lasted late into the night, the revelry trickling out to the nearby sidewalk.It could have been a scene from the Jazz Age heyday of the Manhattan magazine set \u2014 or even the 1990s, when glossy monthlies still soaked up millions of dollars in advertising revenue, and editors in chauffeured town cars told the nation what to wear, what to watch and who to read.Suddenly, it seemed, longstanding predictions about the collapse of magazines had come to pass.Magazines have sputtered for years, their monopoly on readers and advertising erased by Facebook, Google and more nimble online competitors. But editors and executives said the abrupt churn in the senior leadership ranks signaled that the romance of the business was now yielding to financial realities.As publishers grasp for new revenue streams, a \u2018\u2018try-anything\u2019\u2019 approach has taken hold. Time Inc. has a new streaming TV show, \u201cPaws & Claws,\u201d that features viral videos of animals. Hearst started a magazine with the online rental service Airbnb. Increasingly, the longtime core of the business \u2014 the print product \u2014 is an afterthought, overshadowed by investments in live events, podcasts, video, and partnerships with outside brands.The changes represent one of the most fundamental shifts in decades for a business that long relied on a simple formula: glossy volumes thick with high-priced ads.\u201cSentimentality is probably the biggest enemy for the magazine business,\u201d David Carey, the president of Hearst Magazines, said in an interview. \u201cYou have to embrace the future.\u201dAt a time of belt-tightening, celebrity editors, with their big salaries and expensive tastes, are increasingly pass\u00e9. Budget-minded executives at publishers like Hearst and Cond\u00e9 Nast are looking more critically at requests for six-figure photo shoots and $5-a-word writers.\u201cThe timing doesn\u2019t really surprise me,\u201d said Tom Harty, president and chief operating officer at Meredith, which publishes Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle. Magazines, Mr. Harty said, often circulate upcoming budget numbers in September.\u201cWhen you start thinking about the revenue stream for the following year,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cit must lead to some cost discussion.\u201dIn some ways, the spate of departures was a coincidence. Mr. Carter, 68, said he would have left earlier this year if not for the election of President Trump, whom he enjoys covering. Mr. Wenner, 71, has been deferring to his son, Gus, 27, who this year was named president of Wenner Media. Nancy Gibbs of Time had worked at the company for 32 years. And Cindi Leive of Glamour and Robbie Myers of Elle both served for nearly two decades.Quietly, optimists in the business say that it may be healthy for a younger generation of editors to take the reins. Older editors are less accustomed to the rhythms and forms of web journalism; Jann Wenner, for instance, famously resisted posting Rolling Stone stories online. Many of the industry\u2019s rising stars are finding ways to raise revenue and gain readers on the digital side.\u201cIf you want to do the same thing year in and year out, you shouldn\u2019t do these jobs,\u201d Mr. Carey said.Kurt Andersen, a former editor of New York and, with Mr. Carter, a founder of Spy magazine, said that print magazines were still breathing, but that the recent upheaval was a sign that the denouement might not be far off.\u201cThe 1920s to the 2020s was kind of the century of the magazine,\u201d he said, noting that The New Yorker and Time were founded in the decade before the Great Depression. Today, he added, the industry was in \u201cmore of a dusk, a slow dusk, and we\u2019re closer to sunset.\u201dIn his spacious aerie in Hearst\u2019s Midtown Manhattan tower, Mr. Carey displays trinkets of an earlier, more glamorous magazine age.Behind his desk is a framed quote from Malcolm Forbes, the exuberant late chairman of Forbes magazine, and a yellowing memo about Tina Brown from Mr. Carey\u2019s days as publisher of The New Yorker. His 43rd floor office overlooks the Hudson River and Central Park.But as the executive leading Hearst\u2019s magazine business into an uncertain future, Mr. Carey said that he was focused on identifying new ways to increase revenue and trim expenses.\u201cWe know that we have to constantly force ourselves to shake things up,\u201d said Mr. Carey, dressed meticulously in navy pinstripe. \u201cAll media companies are going through a period of change, and we\u2019re not immune from that.\u201dHearst, like Cond\u00e9 Nast, is privately held, so the details of its financial performance are unclear. But recent earnings reports from Hearst\u2019s publicly traded competitors provide a glimpse into the magazine industry\u2019s falling fortunes.Revenue at Time Inc. has declined every year since 2011; the company, which recently took itself off the market after speculation about a potential sale, is now aiming to cut $400 million in costs over the next 18 months. Although the print business still accounts for roughly two-thirds of Time Inc.\u2019s $3 billion in annual revenue, the company is shifting resources to video and television.Meredith, whose headquarters in Des Moines has test kitchens, craft studios and a wood shop, is doing comparatively better than its more glamorous rivals based in New York. Its magazines, which focus largely on perennial topics like decorating and recipes, remain popular with the company\u2019s mostly female readers. Still, Meredith reported a slight drop in revenue for its magazine business in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in June.A flurry of recent sales also suggest that smaller publishers are having trouble surviving on their own.Before Mr. Wenner put Rolling Stone up for sale, Wenner Media sold Us Weekly and Men\u2019s Journal to American Media Inc., the owner of The National Enquirer. Johnson Publishing, which is based in Chicago, sold the magazines Ebony and Jet last summer to a private equity firm. Rodale, whose titles include Bicycling, Runner\u2019s World and Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Health, recently said it, too, was for sale; a deal is expected to be announced in the coming weeks.\u201cThere have never been brand names like that that have been sold in such a concentrated period,\u201d said Reed Phillips, a managing partner at the investment bank Oaklins DeSilva & Phillips. \u201cThat alone indicates something is going on.\u201dThe financial outlook remains bleak. Analysts and executives expect double-digit annual declines in print advertising to continue. The ad buying firm Magna projects print magazine ad sales to fall 13 percent this year, with a similar rate of decline in 2018, according to a report released last week.Mr. Phillips said it was only a matter of time until these trends were felt at the industry\u2019s highest levels. \u201cIn the past, magazines could support celebrity editors, but it\u2019s becoming harder and harder with the revenue declines to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really not about making the numbers in 2017, but making the numbers in 2018.\u201dOne day after the fete for Mr. Carter at the Waverly Inn, Time Inc. rolled out a major initiative: PeopleTV.A new iteration of a streaming video network that the company introduced last year, PeopleTV will feature pop culture programming in conjunction with Entertainment Weekly, another Time Inc. title. Among the shows on offer: \u201cPaws & Claws,\u201d which, according to a news release, will feature \u201call of the adorable, viral and buzzworthy animal stories of the week.\u201dPet videos are a favorite on social media, so it is easy to see why Time Inc. wants to jump on the fluffy bandwagon. But that material is a far cry from the award-winning journalism that filled once-thick issues of Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Time, where Mr. Carter got his start in New York journalism.These experiments are part of an industrywide race to find some way \u2014 any way \u2014 to make up for the hemorrhaging of revenue.Hearst recently introduced The Pioneer Woman Magazine, a partnership with the Food Network host Ree Drummond that was initially sold only at Walmart. Its new travel publication, Airbnbmag, is geared toward customers of the do-it-yourself online rental site, with distribution at newsstands, airports and supermarkets. Meredith has started a magazine called The Magnolia Journal with the HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.Even Cond\u00e9 Nast, the glitzy purveyor of luxury titles, has recognized the advantages of outside partnerships. In recent weeks, the company debuted a quarterly print title for Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle brand, with a cover featuring a topless Ms. Paltrow submerged in mud from France.At Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter resisted efforts by Cond\u00e9 Nast executives to shift his design, photo, research and copy teams out of the magazine\u2019s purview, a move required of nearly every other title as part of a companywide cost-cutting effort, according to two people who spoke anonymously to describe private discussions. Mr. Carter was reluctant to make additional cuts that may be forced upon his magazine in the future, the people said.Some veteran editors rue the trend toward corporate metrics in the industry.Terry McDonell, a former top editor at Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone, said that celebrity editors of the past embodied and defined the magazines they ran. \u201cNow that is being replaced by people who believe that you can, in fact, engineer creativity and quality journalism,\u201d he said.Mr. Andersen, who now writes books and hosts a public radio show, said that magazines might eventually gain a cult following akin to the interest around other obsolete media, like vinyl records.\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll become like sailboats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to exist anymore. But people will still love them, and make them and buy them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Moves to Keep Ads From Running on Objectionable Videos", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook\u2019s enormous audience has long been catnip to advertisers. But the company\u2019s vast ecosystem has come under scrutiny this year from major brands, which are increasingly sensitive to the possibility of inadvertently showing up next to objectionable content.The rules, which will be enforced by a mix of automation and human review, restrict ads from content that depicts, among other topics, real-world tragedies, \u201cdebatable social issues,\u201d misappropriation of children\u2019s show characters, violence, nudity, gore, drug use and derogatory language. Facebook is extending the guidelines immediately to videos \u2014 which the company hopes will become an increasingly lucrative part of its business \u2014 and, in the coming months, to articles.Facebook said users who repeatedly violate its content guidelines, share sensational clickbait or post fake news may lose the ability to run ads.\u201cThere have been concerns that marketers have had that are wide-ranging around digital, and we want to do everything we can to ensure that we are providing the safest environment for publishers, advertisers and for people that utilize the platform,\u201d said Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions.The companies are moving quickly to address such issues, particularly as they seek to attract a greater portion of the money earmarked for television advertising to the video content on their sites.\u201cFacebook is this huge, huge, huge platform, and they haven\u2019t really been monetizing original content in the same way as YouTube has,\u201d said John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at GroupM, a media investment group for the advertising giant WPP. \u201cWhat I think is different for Facebook is that this is a much earlier stage for them that they\u2019re going into this, and the scale is different in that there will be much, much less content uploaded than those stupefying numbers you hear about on YouTube.\u201d (YouTube has said 400 hours of video are added to the site every minute.)That should be an advantage in policing content, Mr. Montgomery said, especially with the limits that Facebook is placing on who can make money from certain features. For example, the company required pages and profiles that wanted to run ads on live videos this year to have more than 2,000 followers. They could only show ads if they had at least 300 concurrent viewers after four minutes.Facebook also said it would begin showing advertisers a preview of where their messages may appear before campaigns start, giving advertisers a chance to block undesirable destinations. The company will also report on where the ads actually run.When brands use Facebook to target specific people with ads, they are able to select from a cornucopia of traits, including age, gender and how many lines of credit a person has. Many ads then show up in the main Facebook and Instagram feeds that people flick through, but they can also appear in articles and videos within Facebook and on outside apps and mobile websites that are part of Facebook\u2019s \u201caudience network.\u201dAs YouTube has moved to limit ads from running alongside unsavory content, many creators on the platform have complained that their videos have been unfairly penalized by automated systems. Facebook will probably have to grapple with similar complaints as it expands the number of people who can make money from video ads on the site.\u201cWe are not censoring their content; as long as it abides by our community standards, the content can run on the platform,\u201d Ms. Everson said. \u201cIf a publisher wants to monetize that content, they have to adhere to the monetization eligibility standards.\u201dFacebook previously let advertisers opt out of a more limited list of topics, including sites and apps related to dating, gambling and \u201cdebated social issues\u201d like religion and politics, Ms. Everson said. She added that the new rules would allow publishers to \u201cunderstand where we\u2019re placing ads\u201d and make it easier for advertisers to avoid offensive content.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Myanmar Follows Global Pattern in How Ethnic Cleansing Begins", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, which the United Nations high commissioner for human rights has called a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing,\u201d highlights a problem that the world has not yet figured out how to solve \u2014 and that can contribute, in extremes, to the world\u2019s worst atrocities.National self-determination, the idea that a nation should have the right to freely choose its political status, is a central tenet of the international system. It is enshrined in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, which states that its purpose is \u201cto develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.\u201dBut scholars have long recognized that there is a problem inherent in self-determination that can make it an enemy of the freedoms it is intended to protect.Self-determination means not only defining what a nation is, but also who belongs in that nation and who is an outsider. And during times of political upheaval, when national identity comes under pressure and different groups compete for claims to self-determination, such definitions can provide an impetus for mass violence and even genocide against those deemed to be outsiders.It is easy enough to define a \u201cstate\u201d \u2014 a place with borders, territory and a sovereign government. But a \u201cnation\u201d is a hazier concept \u2014 a group of people bound together by some common characteristic, which may or may not match up precisely with state borders. That is where things get tricky.Most countries have a majority ethnic or religious group whose customs, culture and religion dominate public life. But ethnic or religious definitions of the \u201cnation,\u201d when translated into political priorities, put minority citizens at a disadvantage. If the majority group wins self-determination, the resulting state will not be designed to represent minorities, even if they technically have full citizenship.That kind of definition can also create stress for the majority group. Kate Cronin-Furman, a fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government who studies mass atrocities, said that when nations are defined around a majority ethnic group, that can lead to a sense of siege \u2014 a belief that majority status needs to be protected, because if it shrinks, the claim of the majority on the nation could as well.In Sri Lanka, for instance, the Sinhalese majority has defined the nation as Sinhalese and Buddhist. As a result, Ms. Cronin-Furman said, Sinhalese political rhetoric is consumed with the idea that any expansion of rights to non-Sinhalese citizens is a threat to the nature of the state.Political psychology researchers have long found that when leaders cast outsiders as different and threatening, that can strengthen insiders\u2019 sense of identity and group cohesion. But that can leave minorities at risk of discrimination or even violence.In Europe today, for instance, politicians rarely make overt claims that their national identity should be explicitly white or Christian. But warnings about the impact of Muslim immigration, burqas and mosque minarets have become, even for many mainstream politicians, a way to classify Muslims as outsiders.And the Jews, particularly before World War II, were also often treated as perpetual aliens who were not truly part of the nation.At times of stress from factors like war, major political changes or economic collapse, competition over who is entitled to national self-determination can trigger extreme violence.When states collapse or state borders are withdrawn, he has found, that creates an opportunity for groups to establish their claims to national self-determination. And when multiple groups lay claim to nationhood within the same territory, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d can come to seem like a grim but effective solution, a way to make ethnic and national borders line up by forcing out members of competing groups.When the former Yugoslavia collapsed, for instance, Bosnian Serb forces committed atrocities against ethnic Bosniaks and Croats as part of their effort to establish a Serbian Republic.In Myanmar, the Rohingya have long been demonized as outsiders in their own country. They have been present in Myanmar since the 12th century, according to Human Rights Watch. But excluding them from the nation, and later even from legal citizenship, has long been a political tool, part of the process of defining the nation by deeming some outside it.After British rule ended in Myanmar \u2014 then Burma \u2014 in 1948, the new government argued that the Rohingya were illegal migrants from British-administered India, now Bangladesh, not truly part of the new nation. A 1982 citizenship law effectively stripped many Rohingya of citizenship, deeming them foreigners in their own country.In 2015, the government disenfranchised the Rohingya en masse, preventing hundreds of thousands from voting in national elections. And in recent years, politicians, including the democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, have implied that they were terrorists who threaten the nation.Today, civilian politicians and the military are jostling for control as the country moves toward democracy. Laying claim to national identity is a way to lay claim to power. And once again, that has had tragic consequences for the Rohingya.Independent observers say the army has burned Rohingya villages and targeted Rohingya civilians in a campaign of rape and slaughter.National self-determination is not a license for attacks against minorities. But by emphasizing that right, the international community may, however unintentionally, have seemed to offer an implicit incentive for the catastrophe now playing out in Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion Month, Demystified", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion Month \u2014 the four-week period twice a year when top designers debut their latest collections in New York, London, Milan and Paris \u2014 brings out a horde of photographers intent on capturing interesting clothes, both on the runways in the shows and on the sidewalks outside of them.But when this season\u2019s shows officially begin on Thursday, the last thing New York Times editors will be thinking about is their own attire. \u201cI think a lot of editors learned a long time ago that comfortable footwear is really key during Fashion Month,\u201d said Isabel Wilkinson, the digital director of T: The New York Times Style Magazine. \u201cMost seasoned editors I see stick very diligently to that mantra.\u201dFashion teams from T and The New York Times Styles desk will attend more than 300 runway shows, presentations, parties and store openings in the four fashion capitals. Preparations began months ago for coverage of everything from highly anticipated collections from the likes of Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren to celebrity-packed parties like Rihanna\u2019s Diamond Ball, which takes place the last night of New York Fashion Week.New York Fashion Week began in 1943 as a way for designers to share their new collections with the fashion media and retailers. It has since become part of a monthlong global circuit each September and February that attracts influencers, celebrities, brands, professional party people and lots of social media. The goal of Times editors is to speak authoritatively to the fashion community while recording a larger view of culture across print, web, video, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\u201cWe cover fashion this intensely because it\u2019s about the evolution of social statuses and gender roles; it\u2019s so bound up with celebrity and race,\u201d said Choire Sicha, the editor of Styles. \u201cWe are obsessed with fashion and we cover it rigorously. Not just because it\u2019s an enormous, important business and because clothes are cool, but because it shows where we\u2019re going as a society.\u201dVanessa Friedman, the fashion director of The New York Times, will personally attend approximately 150 shows in New York and Europe. She has been covering Fashion Week for nearly 20 years, and tends to wear the same several dresses, stay at the same hotels and consume the same diet of coffee, candy, bread, the occasional green juice \u2014 and Champagne.But routine allows for focus. \u201cWhen I\u2019m actually sitting in a show, I am thinking, first, \u2018What is this designer actually saying about female identity now?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cIs it a good idea? If it is not a good idea, why is it not a good idea? And how does that relate to the context of the brand? Does it make sense in the continuation of their heritage and their history? Where they have gone before? And what else is going on in the general fashion scene? Is it part of a trend? If it is part of a trend, what is the trend, and why is it important?\u201dReporters typically log 12-hour days, explained Matthew Schneier, a Styles reporter \u2014 not counting the parties.\u201cThere\u2019s an unwritten law of Fashion Week that any two shows scheduled back-to-back must be at the farthest possible distance from each other and be scheduled at a time to maximize traffic getting between them,\u201d Mr. Schneier said. \u201cSo, a good portion of time is spent in the back of a car, a cab or on the subway, trying to make sense of what you\u2019ve just seen and get down enough sponsor-provided bottled water, protein bars and bodega trail mix to constitute a meal.\u201dBeyond the runway, the story continues inside the extravagant, invite-only afterparties, explained Denny Lee, a Styles editor. \u201cA lot of them feel like they are P.R.-driven, but there are some that are absolutely lots of fun,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cPeople just sort of want to let their hair down and have a good time, and you have this professional partying class that comes into New York City and just keeps things going.\u201d\u201cWe like to do features around the little-known things about creative people \u2014 the little moments that aren\u2019t captured, like someone\u2019s strange obsession or weird collection or an unseen room, and giving a fresh perspective on creative people,\u201d she said.For Ms. Friedman, Fashion Month is like a global tour of modern art galleries.\u201cOften times you see things that are boring, or derivative, or overly conceptual,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you see something that is really great, that makes you think about your subject in a different way; you forget about everything else and get really excited. That happens each season, and you don\u2019t know when it is going to happen \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes it worthwhile.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It seemed as if she\u2019d be home before the curfew the government had imposed in the wake of the storm.Almost a decade ago, on Aug. 28, 2008, Ms. Upp, then a 23-year-old Spanish teacher, left her Hamilton Heights apartment to go jogging along Riverside Drive. About three weeks later, a keen-eyed Staten Island Ferry captain spotted her floating facedown in the waters of New York Harbor.After being pulled to safety, Ms. Upp was diagnosed with dissociative fugue, an extremely rare form of amnesia. Those with the condition, which is characterized in part by sudden and unexpected travel, \u201close awareness for a lot of memory that has to do with their own identity and recent experience,\u201d said Dr. David Spiegel, Willson professor and associate chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. The condition\u2019s most famous, albeit fictional, sufferer is Jason Bourne of the \u201cBourne Identity\u201d franchise.\u201cNormally, we forget things in little pieces,\u201d Dr. Speigel said. \u201cThese people forget things in large pieces that involve what they\u2019ve done for the last year or two years.\u201dWith the help of the police and security camera footage, Ms. Upp was able to retrace some of her journey, which included stops at Starbucks, the Midtown Apple store and several New York Sports Clubs. But she was left with plenty of questions.\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cHow do you feel guilty for something you didn\u2019t even know you did? It\u2019s not your fault, but it\u2019s still somehow you. So it\u2019s definitely made me reconsider everything. Who was I before? Who was I then \u2014 is that part of me? Who am I now?\u201d\u201cWhenever we do a tour for a new family, the first classroom we visit is Hannah Upp\u2019s,\u201d said Michael Bornn, the head of the school. \u201cShe\u2019s one heck of an example; she\u2019s not just a Montessori teacher, she\u2019s a passionate Montessori teacher.\u201dWhile Ms. Upp may be suffering another dissociative fugue episode, it is far from a foregone conclusion. She could be caught up in the chaos following the two storms. Members of her family, who declined to be interviewed, instead released a statement emphasizing the unknown nature of her present condition:\u201cOur beloved Hannah has disappeared. We do not know what has happened and we are hopeful that she will be found alive and well. Our thoughts and prayers are with Hannah and all those who continue to search tirelessly for her. We know our fear and uncertainty is shared by many others, and our hearts go out to all who wait.\u201dWith much of St. Thomas and the surrounding region heavily damaged and many people still missing throughout the Caribbean, Ms. Upp\u2019s disappearance \u201ccouldn\u2019t have happened at a more difficult time,\u201d Mr. Bornn said. Federal searchers and the Coast Guard are preoccupied with hurricane recoveries, he added, and Ms. Upp may not be \u201con the top of their radar.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s one of the frustrating things we haven\u2019t been able to get across to the public,\u201d Mr. Bornn said. \u201cJust because she said \u2018hi\u2019 to you, don\u2019t take her off your radar screen.\u201cWe\u2019re still optimistic,\u201d he added. \u201cWe still have hope.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a teacher with a rare form of amnesia who went missing in the Virgin Islands referred incorrectly to the academic affiliation of Dr. David Spiegel, who commented on the case. He is the associate chairman of Stanford University\u2019s department of psychiatry \u2014 not psychology \u2014 and behavioral sciences.Advertisement"}

But hotel brands aren\u2019t consistent in expressing their policies.Hilton, which includes Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites and Hampton, said that its policy is to not share information with law enforcement unless compelled to, but InterContinental Hotels Group, which includes Candlewood Suites and Holiday Inn Hotels & Resorts, would only say that it abides by all laws, including privacy laws.The announcement by Motel 6 is the second attempt by the company to address the issue. Though G6 released a statement last week apologizing for the practice and said that senior management had not approved it, human rights groups, lawyers, comedians and the general public took to social media to express their outrage.The Houston-based accident lawyer Rogelio Garcia was among those on Twitter who played off the brand\u2019s tag line, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the light on for you.\u201dRummy Pandit, the executive director of the Lloyd D.

Maloney, a lawyer at the New York City law firm Kreindler & Kreindler who specializes in hospitality law.\u201cThere is nothing illegal about a hotel giving out information to law enforcement about its guests, including who is staying there and what they are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s illegal for police to require the hotel for that information without a warrant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But without a real plan and commitment to move away from emitting heat-trapping gases, it is hard for me to think of the new \u201cresilient infrastructure\u201d push providing much more than a false sense of security.During my hospital stay, while my survival itself was in doubt, my parents had to fight on the phone \u2014 on a daily basis \u2014 with insurance companies seeking to deny my medical care during the most terrifying and vulnerable moments of my life. Instead of focusing on my care, my parents had to fight against a cavalcade of nameless insurance company bureaucrats and lackeys who questioned every cost, every charge, every bill.That is not the mark of a great nation. A great nation does not squeeze and harass the sick and the ill at their most vulnerable moments. It does not molest the loved ones of the sick during times of crisis, endlessly seek to extract as much money as possible while denying any treatments it can.This is more than outrageous. No one comes to our defense when our identities are stolen; we\u2019re told we\u2019re on our own, and liable for charges that may be run up in \u2018our\u2019 name, unless, of course, we buy an \u2018insurance policy\u2019 from one of these extortionists.The Dreamers deserve not just protection but legal status and a pathway to citizenship so that the next time Trump changes his mind, they don\u2019t find themselves in the same limbo. Mass deportation is a crime against humanity, and this was always the essence of cruelty, racism and bigotry.As the Supreme Court decision so eloquently stated, we as Americans now have equal dignity in the eyes of the law.Let us hold that victory tight, as it will be challenged, now and in the future.

He was 56.The band\u2019s publicist, Ken Weinstein, said the cause was cancer.H\u00fcsker D\u00fc was formed by Mr. Hart, the guitarist and singer Bob Mould and the bassist Greg Norton in the late 1970s in St. Paul. It soon became known for high-volume blasts of heart-quickening rock that could not quite disguise the hooks buried beneath the noise.An early member of the hardcore movement, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc was a prolific presence in the 1980s, releasing six albums in fewer than six years. The band\u2019s 1984 double album, \u201cZen Arcade,\u201d was lauded by Robert Palmer of The New York Times, who said it might be the best record \u201cto have emerged from the hardcore scene.\u201dChallenging punk orthodoxy with experimental takes on the genre and ambitious narrative elements, \u201cZen Arcade\u201d introduced the band to a wider audience and reimagined the boundaries of hardcore.Mr. Hart and Mr. Mould met in a record store in 1978 and soon began to play together, along with Mr. Norton, whom Mr. Mould had known previously. The group bonded over their love of significant punk bands of the decade, including the Ramones and the Sex Pistols.Though Mr. Hart was bisexual and Mr. Mould was gay, their sexual orientation was not a major part of the band\u2019s identity.Mr. Hart and Mr. Mould, both independent-minded musicians, frequently clashed over the band\u2019s direction \u2014 both were songwriters \u2014 and the group\u2019s contentious breakup, late in 1987, came in the wake of substance-abuse accusations.\u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy playing hardcore,\u201d Mr. Hart said in the A.V. Club interview. \u201cAt the time, while I was drummer for H\u00fcsker D\u00fc even though I played other instruments, it was just such a damn boring job for a drummer.\u201dHe said that even as he began to infuse the band\u2019s albums with more of his ideas, Mr. Mould pushed back in what Mr. Hart characterized as a \u201cshowdown,\u201d saying that the group would never be an even split in terms of their ideas.\u201cWe (almost) always agreed on how to present our collective work to the world,\u201d Mr. Mould wrote. \u201cWhen we fought about the details, it was because we both cared.\u201dMr. Hart wrote two songs released as singles from the band\u2019s major-label debut album, \u201cCandy Apple Grey\u201d (1986) \u2014 \u201cSorry Somehow\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Want to Know If You Are Lonely\u201d \u2014 as well as two of the band\u2019s most beloved tracks on \u201cZen Arcade\u201d: \u201cTurn on the News\u201d and \u201cPink Turns to Blue.\u201dKen Shipley, an owner of the reissue label the Numero Group, which is releasing a boxed set of early H\u00fcsker D\u00fc material in November, remembered Mr. Hart in a statement as \u201cdisarming and masterminding all at once.\u201d\u201cGrant was tortured for sure, but he had a hell of a lot of fun bringing you in on the joke, even if you were part of the punch line,\u201d he wrote.Grantzberg Vernon Hart was born on March 18, 1961, and raised in St. Paul. He started playing music professionally at age 13 and had been in several bands before joining H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. After its breakup, he formed other bands and released his own music intermittently.An accomplished visual artist who designed H\u00fcsker D\u00fc\u2019s album art, Mr. Hart continued to draw and to read poetry in recent years.He is survived by his wife, Brigid McGough, and a son, Karl.Mr. Hart\u2019s fourth and final solo album, \u201cThe Argument\u201d (2013), was a much-praised testament to his ambition, drawing on William S.

A white picnic table strewn with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts cups and magazines like Teen Vogue and The New Yorker doubles as a meeting hub. A box of wine is perched on a kitchenette microwave.The d\u00e9cor fits the mission. Tab, a British import that recently received financing from backers including Rupert Murdoch and the Knight Foundation, is largely unknown to the general public but is gaining currency on college campuses around the country. It relies on a network of unpaid student journalists who write about youth and campus culture. It also has a small cadre of writers commenting, usually snarkily, on issues of interest to young women.\u201cThe mind-set we\u2019re looking for is super hungry, anti-establishment and a little subversive,\u201d said Joshi Herrmann, who, at 28, is both editor in chief and office elder.Ambition is also part of the mix. Since starting in the United States two years ago, Tab has set out to become a touchstone for the 18-to-22-year-old demographic it believes is underserved by other news organizations.Jack Rivlin, who founded Tab Media with two other Cambridge University students in 2009 and now splits his time between New York and London, envisions the enterprise as a generation-defining media brand \u00e0 la MTV.Other publications should beware, said Mr. Rivlin, 28, who jokes that he has only recently begun to grow facial hair: \u201cI want to eat their lunch.\u201dIn Tab\u2019s Williamsburg office \u2014 there\u2019s another in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 story ideas slingshot around the room, from the Pennsylvania State University hazing trial to wedding training programs at high schools to potential Dream Act-related deportations. There was also an idea from one correspondent to report on local sex parties by participating in several.Tab uses traditional journalism tools like Freedom of Information Act filings, door-to-door sleuthing and libel training. But it also digs deep into Reddit, excavates meme chains and cultivates gossip.Tab Media has two parts: The Tab, which publishes the college-centric content, and Babe, a website for young women that specializes in \u201cgood news reporting, trash trends, personal stories\u201d and stories about men with certain unappealing qualities and \u201cthe pettiest celebrity drama.\u201dEach month, 40 million people watch videos that the two outlets post on social media, according to data the company compiled from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. Ten million people a month visit Tab sites, with roughly two-thirds going The Tab and the rest to Babe, according to Tab\u2019s Google Analytics data.In the past year, 2,300 students globally have written for the organization, nearly 1,000 of them regularly. The Tab has outlets at every Ivy League university and plans to expand to more than 100 American campuses.Mr. Rivlin and The Tab\u2019s other founders came up with the idea for company while working for the Cambridge student newspaper, a stuffy publication that none of their friends read, he said.The Tab\u2019s name is a play on \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201cCantab,\u201d a nickname for Cambridge alums. The enterprise initially drew criticism for its \u201cTab Totty\u201d feature, which showcased photos of scantily clad female undergraduates. While that feature was quickly eliminated, two of The Tab\u2019s British outlets still run a \u201cRear of the Year\u201d competition.But the website, which soon spread to other British campuses, also featured exclusive stories about a student who fought for ISIS and a Cambridge student in white tie burning cash in front of a homeless man. In the United States, much larger media organizations made reference to The Tab\u2019s reporting on campus protests, and the publication delivered a scoop last year by reporting on Malia Obama\u2019s decision to attend Harvard.Mr. Herrmann, who first wrote for The Tab at Cambridge and later for The London Evening Standard, said that many of the volunteer writers sign up out of curiosity but eventually pursue media careers.That is partly because The Tab offers its reporters training about sourcing, social media and privacy and sends out regular emails with journalism job listings. Editors at the two headquarters are paid, but few of the reporters are, and only for significant projects.Roughly 70 percent of Tab Media\u2019s revenue \u2014 $600,000 in August, the company said \u2014 comes from sponsored stories commissioned by companies like Spotify and Unilever and written to resemble news articles. The rest comes from display advertising from companies like Netflix and Ikea.The company completed a round of financing this year that brought in $6 million for website improvements, training and special projects. The lead investor was News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.Mr. Rivlin said he and George Marangos-Gilks, one of the other founders, pitched the site to the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, using a 100-page book of printed Tab stories. Mr. Rivlin attended the meeting wearing shoes borrowed from a friend\u2019s father. He still had traces of glitter on his face from a music festival he had recently attended.The Tab is often compared to other youth-focused websites such as The Odyssey Online, launched from Indiana University in 2014, which also uses volunteer writers to cover a range of topics. Spoon University, which was bought in May by Scripps Networks Interactive, compiles articles about food contributed by college students and other young writers.Balderton Capital, a venture capital firm in London, chose to invest in Tab Media. Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner, said he was impressed by company\u2019s high engagement rates and reader loyalty.\u201cIn a world where most new media titles basically push themselves on social media with click-bait headlines and hope for a random click, The Tab was able to write high quality journalism on serious and fun topics and have a community of readers come back loyally every week and sometimes every day,\u201d Mr. Chandratillake wrote in an email.Alumni of The Tab have gone on to work for Vice, The Guardian, Reuters, Huffington Post and many other publications. Several have stayed on to help shape the company as it evolves.\u201cIn five years, what we\u2019re going to be doing might be a bit broader,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep passing this on, kind of recklessly throwing the keys to very young editorial people and see what they come up with.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Terrifying Power of Internet Censors", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last month where a man drove a car into a crowd, killing a counter-demonstrator, the American neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published a long, hate-riddled post mocking the victim.Generally speaking, there are two kinds of corporate players on the internet: companies that build infrastructure through which content flows, and companies that seek to curate content and create a community.Internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast, domain name servers, web hosts and security services providers like Cloudflare are all the former \u2014 or the \u201cpipe.\u201d They typically don\u2019t look at the content their clients and customers are putting up, they just give them the means to do it and let it flow. Social media platforms like Facebook are the latter. They encourage their users to create, share and engage with content \u2014 so they look at content all the time and decide whether they want to allow hateful material like that of neo-Nazis to stay up.While there have long been worries about internet service providers favoring access to some content over others, there has been less concern about companies further along the pipeline holding an internet on/off switch. In large part, this is because at other points in the pipeline, users have choice. Private companies can make their own rules, and consumers can choose among them. If GoDaddy won\u2019t register your domain, you can go to Bluehost or thousands of other companies.But the fewer choices you have for the infrastructure you need to stay online, the more serious the consequences when companies refuse service. This is why Cloudflare\u2019s decision to drop The Daily Stormer is so significant. Denying security service to one Nazi website seems fine now, but what if Cloudflare started suspending service for a political candidate that its chief executive didn\u2019t like?One of the additional difficulties with Cloudflare is that it is not so much a piece of pipe as it is a service. Specifically, it is a paid-for-protection service. Having to hire Cloudflare to protect your website is like having to hire security to protect you from attackers when you speak in the public square. If that security service is the only one in town, and you\u2019ll be silenced if you try to speak without it, maybe that security service shouldn\u2019t pick and choose whom it protects. While regulation should not be done lightly or broadly, there\u2019s a case to be made that we should treat Cloudflare more like the police, who are supposed to equally protect all members of the public.This is the most terrifying realization surrounding Cloudflare\u2019s removal of a site from the internet: There\u2019s a lack of accountability present at every part of the pipeline and on platforms. The people who run these companies are not elected officials, yet we still expect them to safeguard our basic liberties while also meeting our cultural expectations. For the most part they do: both because it\u2019s good business to meet the expectations of their users, and because most have praiseworthy goals of corporate responsibility. Beyond these minor checks on these companies\u2019 power, we as users have no way to ensure they meet our needs \u2014 and we have no idea what site they\u2019ll take down next.Kate Klonick is a lawyer and doctoral candidate at Yale Law School who studies law and technology.Advertisement"}

The accompanying sambal, in a plastic tub, was all chile, and edifying.Another week she offered nasi campur, curry and vegetables crowded round a heap of rice. Here the curry was beautifully sour from tamarind, over a plank of kingfish. It was flanked by ruffles of kale, a substitute for the cassava leaves she used back in Indonesia, stewed in coconut milk but still bringing a residual brightness; and blocks of fried tofu so engorged with sauce \u2014 a flare of long hot peppers, ginger and terasi (shrimp paste) \u2014 that when squeezed between the teeth, they rained it down onto the plate like clouds.Farther up the plate\u2019s circumference were tiny tentacles and curled-up hulls of salted squid, as purple as a bruise, rinsed five times until swollen. The salt was frank, barely tempered by a douse of kecap manis, the Indonesian sweet soy sauce. Last, a hard-boiled egg, peeled and fried, with a whisper-thin golden crust and a green crush of sambal hijau: raw jalape\u00f1o, onion and ground anchovies. Ms. Tjahjadi asked, \u201cAre you all right with spicy?\u201d Yes, but it still made me catch my breath.The food seemed to multiply, as in the parable of the loaves and the fishes; however much I ate, I couldn\u2019t finish it. It cost $10 (cash only, please). Other customers stopped by for lunch to go, or ate from boxes while perched between shelves. As I paid, the woman at the register handed me a branch of longan fruit, the rough shells peeling back to disclose sweet translucent globes, better than any petits fours.12 PhotosMs. Lapadula, the chef and head barista, grew up in Bogor in West Java and studied chemistry and microbiology; when not in the kitchen, she practices environmental and intellectual-property law. Hoping to evangelize for Indonesian cuisine but sensitive to the tastes of the neighborhood, she limits the use of shrimp paste and keeps the food \u201clight,\u201d as she puts it.In a number of dishes, I sensed a missing dimension. But some were no less delicious for it, like mie ayam jamur, a pileup of egg noodles, gingery chicken, straw mushrooms and pangsit (won tons, crisp and bubbled), with a cup of heady broth on the side. \u201cSome people dump it all in,\u201d Ms. Lapadula said. \u201cI like to just once in a while dip a spoon.\u201dRijsttafel, Dutch for \u201crice table,\u201d is a buffet for one, with leftovers for nearly three. The plate spills over with airy fritters, fried tofu, hard-boiled eggs lashed with sambal and your choice of ayam bakar Bali, sweet-hot chicken blackened on the grill, or beef rendang \u2014 saucier than you might find in Indonesia, because \u201cpeople like a lot of sauce over the rice,\u201d Ms. Tjahjadi said. (Guilty: I enjoyed sopping it up.)\u201cIf we make it very Indonesian, the market doesn\u2019t want it,\u201d she went on. \u201cToo spicy, too strong.\u201d For that, you will have to seek her out in Elmhurst.Advertisement"}

He tends to book his airline seats on American Airlines\u2019 site.\u201cI use every tool available online, booking my own travel even though I could use our corporate travel agent,\u201d said Mr. Diederich, 37, who is corporate executive chef of research and development for American Dining Creations of Syracuse.He is among those known in the corporate travel world as \u201crogue travelers\u201d \u2014 those who book on their own. They are used to searching for the best fares, staying in unusual places and collecting reward points.Yet companies want to control travel costs. And his company policy, like others, requires employees to let the corporation know where they are in case of an emergency, a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.Mr. Diederich\u2019s answer to that is simply, \u201cI just forward the confirmation to the corporate travel agent.\u201d That way, he travels how he wants to, he is reimbursed for his expenses and his company knows where he is.Most business travelers still book through the corporate booking tool or corporate travel agent, the study found. More than half said they always did, and a third said they usually did, while the rest may book directly with an airline, hotel or rental car company.\u201cFifty to 60 percent of hotel bookings always existed outside,\u201d said John M. Rose, the chief operating officer of iJet International. \u201cPeople of different generations are traveling who are used to everything being at their fingertips.\u201d Compliance, he added, \u201cis hard to mandate.\u201dTravel management companies believe the direct booking trend is here to stay. \u201cEverybody has a policy, every company. But the traveler says, \u2018I found a lower rate,\u2019\u201d said Greeley Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.Some corporate travel managers require business travelers who make their own arrangements to alert the corporate travel department or the travel management company with an email \u201cso somebody knows where their people are and are they booking in a compliant way from a duty-of-care standpoint,\u201d said Michael Steiner, executive vice president of Ovation Travel Group. \u201cSome companies say if you book direct, you are not going to be reimbursed. If you report it, you will be reimbursed.\u201dBooking patterns vary depending on travelers\u2019 habits and the tech tools they use. Larger corporations typically have more rules than smaller ones.Rebecca Nittolo travels for business a couple of days a week for three of the four weeks each month. An associate director of sales for Education and Training Systems International in Chapel Hill, N.C., she said she mostly booked her flights and hotels through the company travel agent. When she is on business in Chicago, she books directly with a contact at the Deer Path Inn in Lake Forest, Ill.\u201cI work at a small company,\u201d Ms. Nittolo said. \u201cThey always know where I am. I\u2019m always in communication with my team.\u201dSome corporations keep track of their travelers with Concur TripLink, which allows travel managers to capture data from every booking channel \u2014 flights, hotels and ground transportation \u2014 regardless of how business travelers have booked. There are also mobile apps that allow employees to check in with their company when they\u2019ve landed, Mr. Rose, of iJet International, said.The three issues that business travelers are most likely to encounter are petty crime and theft, medical and health situations, and bad weather. Still, travel risk depends on where travelers are headed, the profile of the travelers, and where they are meeting and with whom, said Erin Wilk, global travel safety and security manager for Facebook and chairman of the Global Business Travel Association\u2019s risk committee.Companies are also taking on more of a role in making sure their employees are safe. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see now a shift,\u201d said Mr. Koch, of the corporate travel executives association, \u201can emphasis on duty of care, the corporation\u2019s responsibility to its employees.\u201dIf a corporate traveler is headed to a remote area in Nigeria or the Middle East or other Level 4 or 5 areas (with 5 the highest security risk), Mr. Rose said, a corporate travel manager might be thinking: \u201cWait a second. We didn\u2019t know where you were because you were not following the protocols.\u201dThe safety and security landscape has changed. Since a string of terrorist attacks throughout the world, including some in the United States, senior corporate executives and corporate travel managers are increasingly concerned with tracking their travelers throughout the globe.\u201cSince the November 2015 Paris attacks, we have seen a 30 percent increase in North American clients adding travel tracking to their travel risk mitigation program,\u201d said Matthew Bradley, regional security director in the Americas for International SOS and Control Risks.William Besse, vice president in the consulting, investigations and international division at Andrews International, noted that it had become \u201cmore and more difficult to predict where violence will take place in the world,\u201d adding, \u201cIt can take place anywhere, anyplace, anytime.\u201dIn the event of an emergency, security companies can alert employees to what is happening on their next stop by text message, phone call or email. They can set up two-way communication to employees\u2019 smartphones to ensure they are safe.While the risk of a terrorist or \u201clone wolf\u201d attack is very small, there is growing concern among corporate travelers as well.Business travelers, Ms. Wilk, of Facebook, said, can\u2019t expect the \u201cflexibility and the options they have in their personal travel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThey had lobbied hard for this \u2014 dangling before members of Congress the promise that the repatriated money would add more than 500,000 jobs in the United States over the next two years, as companies paid down debt and engaged in more capital spending, acquisitions, and research and development.The smell of a tax holiday is back in the air. From Apple to Facebook to Starbucks, big business is waiting with bated breath for details on President Trump\u2019s promise to slash the tax rate on profits held abroad to encourage companies to bring the money home.Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration\u2019s shot over a decade ago.Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn\u2019t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)Call me na\u00efve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues \u2014 indeed, many economists \u2014 might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn\u2019t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don\u2019t think it is possible to fully address workers\u2019 demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration \u2014 be it workers\u2019 welfare or even the company\u2019s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses\u2019 balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.\u201cHow you divide the pie is a choice,\u201d said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. \u201cIt is being carved differently.\u201dThe good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company\u2019s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. \u201cCapitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,\u201d he wrote.Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump \u2014 maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roasted Summer Vegetables Tucked Into Tartlets", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteA summer vegetable quandary: My favorite way to eat zucchini, eggplant and peppers is to roast them until their sugars caramelize, their centers collapse and they turn floppy, rich and sweet. But my least favorite thing to do in summer is crank up the oven to achieve this glorious state.September\u2019s arrival, however, with its crisp afternoons and chilly evenings, means I can turn up the heat and never regret it.My roasting method for these juicy vegetables has remained pretty constant over the years. I cube or slice them, then toss them with loads of olive oil and salt, and a few sprigs of whatever branchy herbs are nearby (rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram \u2014 you get the idea). Then I roast everything at somewhere between 400 and 450 degrees, depending on how fast and brown I want them.It\u2019s what happens after they come out of the oven that varies.Often the answer is nothing. I\u2019ll eat the contents of the pan without even bothering to put them on a plate.Here, I\u2019ve taken the vegetables even further, turning them into a filling for elegant individual tartlets.You can use nearly any roasted vegetables for this, but I especially like the combination of zucchini and tomatoes, which can be cooked together on the same pan.After roasting, I toss the vegetables with some hot honey for sweetness and spice, and vinegar for tang. Then I layer them with herbed ricotta in a Cheddar-spiked pastry, each tart tucked into its own muffin cup, where it bakes up golden and very savory.You can make the filling and dough ahead if you like, but these tartlets are best served on the same day as baking, preferably while still warm from the oven when the ricotta is at its creamiest.And if you do choose to make this all in one day, roasting the vegetables and then baking the tarts does mean you\u2019ll have your oven on for quite a while. But as jacket weather approaches, a warm, cozy kitchen isn\u2019t a bad thing.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Honesty Could Make You Happier", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoicesMy plan was to jot down different instances throughout the day where I had to make a choice about honesty and notice how it felt.The day I started the journal, the same 6-year-old daughter asked me during her bath if the cat really went to sleep last year, and if that actually meant that I had killed him. I rinsed her hair and sighed, wondering if I should wait to start this honesty project until my children were grown. But I braved it and told her that yes, I had made the choice for him to die, because he was suffering and I wanted him to be at peace. She lost interest about halfway through my explanation, which was O.K. with me.It struck me that the choice to lie or be honest was often a choice between two equally undesirable things. Telling my daughter the truth did not make me happier, but lying wouldn\u2019t have either.A bigger opportunity arose with my 8-year-old son. Though he didn\u2019t know anything about the journal, after a few weeks, he seemed to open up in a new way, asking me things he was too embarrassed or scared to ask before, like what the word \u201cpimp\u201d meant and why people kill themselves. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways was that we shouldn\u2019t lie to children when they are asking us about grown-up words or ideas \u2014 otherwise, they will just ask Siri. If it\u2019s between YouTube and me to explain prostitution, I pick me.But was brutal truth what I really wanted when it came to my marriage?Over all, I found that I struggled more with the small instances of honesty, rather than the big. So, when a client accidentally paid me twice for a project \u2014 sending a duplicate $1,000 check a week after they\u2019d already paid me \u2014 there was no internal debate. It was $1,000, so obviously, I notified the client. But when the McDonald\u2019s drive-through cashier gave me an extra dollar in change and the line had been SO long and all I wanted was a Diet Coke and my kids were acting crazy in the back seat and why was this stupid McDonald\u2019s always so slow anyway?!\u2026 it was a different story. Even though I gave the dollar back, I almost didn\u2019t, because an extra dollar was such a small thing and seemed somehow justified. Had I not been focused on honesty, I\u2019m not sure I would have given it back.The bottom line is that focusing on honesty is a way to actively engage with the world, versus passively complaining about it. It might even make you feel as if you have gold in your brain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Shkreli Syndrome: Youthful Trouble, Tech Success, Then a Fall", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurs, it turns out, do not just move fast and break things, as Facebook\u2019s longtime credo put it. They are also more likely than others to cross the line.According to research by the economists Ross Levine and Yona Rubinstein, people who become entrepreneurs are not only apt to have had high self-esteem while growing up (and to have been white, male and financially secure). They are also more likely than others to have been intelligent people who engaged in illicit activities in their teenage years and early 20s.And those indiscretions have not been limited to using drugs or skipping school, but have included antisocial acts like taking property by force or stealing goods worth less than $50.In light of the recent troubles of Mr. Shkreli and other scandal-ridden entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, the former Uber chief executive, and Parker Conrad, a founder and ousted chief executive of the multibillion-dollar human resources software firm Zenefits, the question is whether youthful rule-breaking might have foreshadowed not only their rise, but also their fall.The problem is that the psychological forces that drive teenagers to break rules may not be so easily channeled later on.Laurence Steinberg, a Temple University professor and an expert on the psychological development of adolescents, cited a phenomenon known as \u201cmoral disengagement,\u201d in which people rationalize behavior at odds with their own principles. A teenager who steals a pair of sneakers, for example, may tell himself that the manufacturer was overcharging consumers.\u201cYou think the regulations are uncalled-for,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though you might be breaking them, you\u2019re really not doing a bad thing, because they were bad regulations.\u201dSuch behavior is often encouraged in Silicon Valley. For years, many technology investors applauded Uber\u2019s practice of operating without the approval of local regulators, and then exploiting the company\u2019s popularity among riders to bring about changes to the rules.Or consider the early days of the financial technology and payments company Square, which used a credit card account one of its founders set up for one business to handle payments for other businesses that lacked such accounts.While such rule-breaking may be legitimate in certain circumstances \u2014 the major credit card companies eventually altered the restrictions on the use of business credit card accounts, allowing Square to get off the ground \u2014 the financial rewards for operating this way can reinforce a tendency toward shiftiness.There are two factors that make it even more tempting to fudge ethical questions: the relative lack of oversight at start-ups, and the enormous risk of failure.In effect, entrepreneurship takes people who, as a group, are prone to breaking actual rules and putting them in a setting that constantly encourages them to do so.These days, many venture capitalists spend as much time assessing what kind of troublemaker an entrepreneur may be as they do assessing a business\u2019s revolutionary potential.\u201cWe do want them to be rule-breakers,\u201d said David Golden, who helps run the venture capital arm of Revolution, the investment firm of the AOL co-founder Steve Case. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be felons.\u201dMr. Golden admitted, however, that such judgments can be flawed. He cited a software company that Revolution agreed to finance in 2014, only to discover that the founder had misrepresented certain companies as customers. (The firm did not go through with the investment, he said.)To eliminate subjectivity, some people have tried to quantify an optimal willingness to break rules. Before he started his venture capital fund, Switch Ventures, Paul Arnold collected data on roughly 12,000 start-ups with the goal of identifying the profiles of entrepreneurs that were most strongly associated with success.Mr. Arnold\u2019s most striking finding involved start-ups where at least one founder had worked at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.He studied nearly 1,000 such companies and discovered that start-up founders who left McKinsey after about three to four years tended to be extremely successful, but that those who stayed a lot longer were close to average. He concluded that the first group had the platonically ideal capacity for rule-breaking: They were sufficiently fluent in rule-following to hold a job at McKinsey but \u201cdidn\u2019t like the strictures and kind of resisted it.\u201dBut even Mr. Arnold, whose intuition on these questions was honed not just by statistics but by life experience \u2014 he was a two-time high-school dropout who was often in trouble for things like smoking marijuana before eventually finding his way to law school \u2014 admitted that he might have missed the warning signs with Mr. Kalanick.\u201cThe Uber story is that the initial rule-breaking was innovation,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cBut it was a slippery slope. They broke the next one and the next one, and were doing less and less ethical things.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky topic.\u201dLauren Herstik contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet Decibel Bellini, the Booming Soundtrack to Napoli Goals", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "On SoccerA radio D.J.\u2019s thunderous stadium announcements have won over fans and players alike, and made him a global social media sensation.Supported byNAPLES, Italy \u2014 When Dries Mertens scores Napoli\u2019s first goal, Stadio San Paolo\u2019s creaking stands rattle and shudder with the noise. It is not a cheer: a cheer is something joyful and merry and high-pitched. This is different: deeper, more guttural, rooted as much in release and euphoria, caught somewhere between a roar and a howl. It hits you like a wave.In the commotion, Mertens runs to one corner, pursued by his teammates. In another, Daniele Bellini counts to three. Briefly, he clenches his fist in celebration. Then he walks to his iPhone, mounted on a tripod, and turns on the camera. He draws his microphone from his back pocket, pauses for a second, and takes a deep breath.And then he places the microphone to his lips, and his voice cuts through the noise.Bellini repeats the call and response again and again, 10 times in all, building to the finish. He rocks backs on his heels, crouches down, heaves in his breath. He announces the name as he leaps back up, stretching it out to two syllables: \u201cDri-Es!\u201d The fans do the same, a great wave of sound crashing around this crumbling concrete ruin of a stadium. \u201cMer-Tens!\u201dFor the last seven years, Bellini, 36, has been employed as Napoli\u2019s speaker. He inherited the role by chance. The previous incumbent was unable to attend a game in 2010 against the club\u2019s bitter northern rival Juventus. Bellini was working as a D.J. at a local radio station, Radio Marte \u2014 known now as Radio Kiss Kiss \u2014 that covered Napoli\u2019s games.\u201cI was about 10th in line for the job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a couple of people didn\u2019t want to do it, a couple of others couldn\u2019t do it that weekend, so eventually they said to me, \u2018Right, you do it.\u2019 \u201dNapoli won that day, and Bellini was told to return the next week. \u201cYou have to remember that we\u2019re very superstitious people in Naples,\u201d he said. \u201cIt stayed like that for a year, maybe two: it was a game-by-game thing. I was always afraid that we would lose and I would be told that was it, but we won a lot of games that year.\u201dBellini was given no instructions of note when he took the job. At most clubs, the speaker is not a position given a vast amount of thought: They read out safety and security messages \u2014 \u201ctelling people not to use lasers, not to light flares, that sort of thing\u201d \u2014 announce the lineups, confirm substitutions, name goal scorers. \u201cThey are the basics,\u201d Bellini said. \u201cEverything else is just spectacle, just show.\u201dThe show, though, is where Bellini excels.San Paolo has long been one of the most intimidating stadiums in Europe. Though Napoli overhauled the dressing rooms before the visit of Real Madrid in the Champions League last year \u2014 to try to make the stadium seem a little less outdated \u2014 it remains a crumbling, menacing place, its hostility a badge of honor.Maurizio Sarri, the Napoli manager, has described San Paolo as a \u201chell\u201d for visiting teams. Zinedine Zidane found it \u201cbeautiful, but never easy.\u201d Yaya Tour\u00e9, the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder, once said that his visit there was the \u201conly time my legs have shaken before a game.\u201dBellini \u2014 a fan himself \u2014 did not set out to change that. \u201cI am not a protagonist,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fans are the protagonists.\u201d Instead, he said, he did what he could to harness their energy, to encourage it.Most notably, when a player scored, Bellini would announce their first name five times, the fans responding with the surname. (He has a curious blind spot for the names of opposition players: there is a tendency for the occasional Alessandro to be named as Angelo, or a Pietro to become Paolo. Not very convincingly, he says it is not deliberate.)\u201cIt all changed with Edinson Cavani,\u201d he said.Cavani, the Uruguayan striker now with Paris Saint-Germain, spent three prolific years in Naples, scoring 104 goals in 138 games. It was a record that Bellini thought warranted special status. \u201cHe wore No. 7,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I thought one day I would say his name seven times. That was the start.\u201d\u201cI went on holiday to Jamaica a couple of years ago,\u201d Bellini said. \u201cI was in Trenchtown, where Bob Marley was born, with a guide. We looked in a bar, and there were some kids watching a Premier League game. One of them turned around, looked at me, and his face dropped.Bellini brushes off the idea that he is anything but a \u201ctiny\u201d part of what makes the San Paolo special. He is not entirely uncomfortable with being seen as a celebrity: he attends games wearing a hat with his name stenciled on it, and in a Napoli polo shirt; he grins when he is mobbed by fans. But he said that he still gets nervous, still fears making a mistake, still grows quiet as he nears the stadium, a \u201clittle transformation\u201d that allows him to become his public persona.\u201cI do not have time to be emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite often, I will go home and watch the games back on television, because I feel I haven\u2019t really seen them. Just as a photographer sees things differently through the lens of a camera, I see them differently when I have a microphone. I have to work out who scored, if there was a deflection, if it was an own goal, and do it all in three seconds, and I have to get it right.\u201d It is his job, and it is one he takes seriously.Thanks to Higua\u00edn, so do the players. Last summer, Bellini joined Napoli on its preseason retreat in Dimaro, high in the Dolomites. On the plane back, he sat next to Arkadiusz Milik, a Polish striker signed to replace Higua\u00edn. Together with Milik\u2019s agent, they spent an hour working out how best to announce his name when he scored.\u201cThey take an interest,\u201d Bellini said of the players. \u201cThey know their names will be shouted to the stadium, so it is logical they want to make sure it is done the best way. I speak to all the new players to find out how they want me to do it.\u201dHe knows there will always be some who \u201cdo not like what you do,\u201d but he accepts that he is now, both internally and externally, part of the club\u2019s identity: He functions as a social fixer for many of the players, seen by them as a friend, and is \u201ca tradition\u201d for fans on matchday.Indeed, so ingrained is he in the Napoli experience that he performed as a D.J. at the wedding of Jorginho, a Brazilian midfielder, last summer. The year before that, he was in the congregation when Mertens married.\u201cThe whole ceremony was in Flemish, so I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d Bellini said. \u201cBut after they had said, \u2018I do,\u2019 and kissed, Dries turned to me and shouted, \u2018Daniele, Daniele, come here.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really want to, but I went up and took the microphone.\u201dHe took a deep breath, and then shouted in Italian, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, wearing the No. 14: Dries!

{"Headline": "Student Charged in Bronx School Stabbing Felt Bullied, Police Say", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week into his senior year, the 18-year-old student logged onto Amazon and bought a knife: a spring-loaded switchblade, slim enough to stay hidden in his pocket but sturdy enough, at a price of $30, that it could be lethal.The student, Abel Cedeno, told a friend he felt trapped. Classmates were mocking him with racist and homophobic slurs, he said. Under a Facebook video on Sept. 16 in which he popped the knife open, he asked why people thought he was soft. Detectives believe he started taking the knife to school, a five-story brick building on Mohegan Avenue in the Bronx where some parents worried their children were so unprotected that they had, in the past, taken to patrolling the hallways themselves.During a history class, two classmates started pelting Mr. Cedeno from behind with pencil bits and balled-up paper, the police said. It was the first time the three of them had tangled, but two police officials stressed that it may not have seemed that way to Mr. Cedeno, who told detectives that other classmates had been harassing him since the start of school.He got up and went to the bathroom, but when he returned, the tormenting continued, one of the police officials said. So he stood up, turned around and said something. A teacher, an aide and two dozen other students watched.\u201cWhat\u2019d you call me?\u201d one of the classmates, Matthew McCree, 15, answered. He strode up to Mr. Cedeno and punched him, according to one of the police officials.Mr. Cedeno then pulled out his knife and, with two swings to Mr. McCree\u2019s chest and one to his back, killed him, the police official said. Both police officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. The other classmate, Ariane Laboy, who told detectives he did not yet realize his friend was being stabbed, stepped into the fracas, and Mr. Cedeno sliced him in the biceps, drawing so much blood that Mr. Laboy fainted.Investigators are still building a picture of Mr. Cedeno\u2019s life before the fatal confrontation: steady bullying by students he resisted naming in a police interview room; a mother who has been stranded in Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria; enough difficulties in school that he was older than most of his classmates.But the killing also seems to have taken place amid currents of homophobia, escalating fear and chaotic classrooms, which some parents and students said had been converging for weeks without the school gaining control.Mr. Cedeno identified as bisexual to a small circle of people, a longtime family friend, Savannah Hornback, said. He also struggled with mental health issues, she said, though she declined to go into details.She said he was a homebody who liked playing video games and keeping to himself. Neighbors described him as an \u201cin-house kid\u201d who held the door open for them, and said his mother went to Puerto Rico to visit family about a month ago. Ms. Hornback said being Hispanic and being bisexual made Mr. Cedeno a target of nasty slurs from classmates.\u201cHe was constantly taunted at school,\u201d Ms. Hornback said. \u201cI guess he felt his only way out of it was to resort to what he did.\u201dMs. Hornback said Mr. Cedeno\u2019s family was not trying to diminish what he did. But she said Mr. Cedeno\u2019s mother had pleaded with staff members at the school for help protecting her son and had met with a guidance counselor there.\u201cThere was no action from the school,\u201d Ms. Hornback said.At a news conference on Thursday morning, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, Robert K. Boyce, said Mr. Cedeno did not specifically cite his perceived sexual orientation as a reason he was being bullied or make clear why exactly he had bought the knife.Chief Boyce told reporters that there was no indication Mr. Cedeno himself had complained to school officials about the abuse.Toya Holness, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, cited a federal student privacy law in declining to comment on whether the school was aware that Mr. Cedeno was being bullied, but she said the department was conducting an investigation.A student who said he witnessed the stabbing, Frankie Santiago, 16, a junior who was friends with Mr. McCree, said, \u201cThe two teachers standing there did absolutely nothing.\u201d He said Mr. McCree had not been bullying Mr. Cedeno and the encounter only grew violent when Mr. Cedeno challenged Mr. McCree to fight. He said Mr. Cedeno overreacted and appeared intent on hurting his two classmates.Ms. Holness declined to discuss the teachers\u2019 actions. She said there were no signs of \u201cstaff misconduct\u201d in the episode. In a statement, the city\u2019s schools chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a, said, \u201cWe have additional safety measures and grief counselors in place and will continue to support the school community.\u201dAt a court appearance on Thursday morning in which Mr. Cedeno was formally charged with murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, his lawyer, Deborah Rush, asked that her client be placed on suicide watch and receive a psychological evaluation. Mr. Cedeno signed an order of protection agreeing to avoid contact with Mr. Laboy, 16, who remained hospitalized. Mr. Cedeno was ordered jailed without bail.A prosecutor, Nancy Borko, said at the hearing that Mr. Cedeno had confessed to the attack and to buying the knife.City officials, facing an outcry from parents for not having had metal detectors at the school before, scrambled to put them in place on Thursday. But parents still kept their children home in droves: Less than a third of students at Mr. Cedeno\u2019s school, the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, and just under half of students at the elementary school that shares the building, Public School 67, attended school on Thursday.Parents said their fears stemmed from a failure by school officials to deal with complaints of bullying. They described students cursing openly in hallways, taunting teachers and leaving condoms and marijuana blunts in the hallways.Kayesha McIntosh, 32, said she once told school officials that students were pulling her daughter\u2019s hair. They suggested she put her daughter\u2019s hair in a bun.\u201cLike that was going to stop her from being bullied,\u201d Ms. McIntosh said. \u201cThey knew she was getting bullied and they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dFeeling abandoned by teachers, she said she visited the parents of one of the offending students herself.Another mother, Jovana Russell, a former PTA president at P.S. 67, said she pulled her daughter from the elementary school after a high school student exposed himself to her in the stairwell several years ago. After parents\u2019 requests for more security were turned down, she said, they started patrolling the hallways themselves.Students described feeling as though they had to defend themselves. Some parents said that led to cycles of bullying and violence in which students who were bullied became angry at a lack of action by the school and started threatening other students.There is little indication that the Wildlife Conservation school is one of the most dangerous in the city. But so routine was the trouble that another mother, Uneek Valentin, 37, said that she was having a meeting with the principal about bullying only to have the principal dash out of the office because a fight had broken out in the school.Ms. Valentin\u2019s son, Dwhy Hoyt, a senior, said bullies curse at teachers, skip class and slap books out of students\u2019 hands, ruining the learning environment.Mr. Hoyt, 17, said he had learned to defend himself, only to be chided by school officials for fighting, and had stopped reporting some incidents.\u201cI had to fight my own battles and make people into my friend,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Elizabeth A.

{"Headline": "Robert E. Lee Statue\u2019s Removal in Dallas Delayed by Federal Court", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe City of Dallas voted Wednesday to immediately remove a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park, but the work was abruptly stopped by a federal judge.Soon after the vote, workers in hard hats and yellow vests cordoned off the area around the Lee monument, which stands in Robert E. Lee Park, a green space in Dallas that is bounded on one side by Lee Parkway.But their efforts came to a halt when Judge Sidney Fitzwater of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted a temporary restraining order halting the statue\u2019s removal, according to Richard Hill, a spokesman for the city. A hearing on the proposed removal of the monument was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Thursday, according to The Dallas Morning News.Mr. Hill said the city planned to put the statue, which shows the Confederate general riding on horseback alongside an unidentified soldier, in temporary storage. Its eventual resting place had not been decided, he said.\u201cThat will be discussed at some point down the road,\u201d he said.The resolution, which passed by 13 to 1, said the council had recognized that \u201cpublic Confederate monuments and the names of public places, including parks and streets, named for Confederate figures do not promote a welcoming and inclusive city.\u201dMr. Hill said that he did not \u201chave an exact count\u201d of the number of sites in Dallas dedicated to the memory of the Confederacy but that \u201cthere are a number of other monuments in various locations across the city.\u201dThe resolution passed on Wednesday committed the City Council to figuring out what to do with all of them, in consultation with the task force on Confederate monuments assembled by Mayor Mike Rawlings.It also authorized the city manager to use public funds \u201cto remove all public Confederate monuments\u201d and provided for the council \u201cto take further action as needed, including authorizing the renaming of certain public places,\u201d according to text of the resolution provided by the city government.Mr. Brettell urged the city to move slowly on the question of what to do with the Lee monument, which he said was artistically significant because it is \u201cone of the very few equestrian monuments in the history of art in which a leader shares his monument with someone nameless.\u201dMore visceral criticism of the statue\u2019s removal bubbled up online, where supporters of the monument peppered the city\u2019s official Facebook page with angry posts that accused council members of erasing history or caving in to political correctness. But local news reports said a crowd that had gathered at the statue on Wednesday contained few opponents of the move.One critic of the decision could be seen debating the statue with young supporters of its removal in a video posted to Twitter by Tom Fox, a photojournalist at The Dallas Morning News.\u201cYou\u2019re hating,\u201d the opponent, a white woman, said to the young people. \u201cSweetheart, hate means that you\u2019re destroying something and right now you\u2019re destroying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hating anything,\u201d a young black man replied. \u201cI\u2019m standing up for what\u2019s right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suspect in Tennessee Church Shooting Cited Revenge for Charleston Massacre", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe note could help investigators better understand the state of mind of the gunman, identified as Emanuel Kidega Samson, when he fatally shot a woman and left half a dozen wounded as services were ending last Sunday at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in the Nashville area. The note also suggests a possible motive for the attack.Mr. Samson of La Vergne, Tenn., was charged with murder and is being held without bond. The police said they expected additional charges to be filed.The killings by Mr. Roof, who was convicted last year and later sentenced to death, shocked the country. Mr. Roof, then 21 and lacking any direct ties to white supremacist groups, had become radicalized online and carefully planned the assault, which he carried out after participating in the church\u2019s Wednesday night Bible study. Nine people were killed. Mr. Roof never demonstrated any public remorse for the attack.After the Charleston massacre, some political and law enforcement officials worried about possible retaliation. But one former federal prosecutor said on Friday that he had been more concerned about imitators.\u201cI was worried about a lot of things, and that event was so horrific that I really didn\u2019t know what effect it was going to have on the community,\u201d said William N. Nettles, who was the United States attorney for the District of South Carolina when the attack happened. \u201cBut at the time, my hunch was that I needed to be worried about a white nationalist\u2019s copycat crime.\u201dMr. Nettles, recalling the public expressions of forgiveness by some relatives of Mr. Roof\u2019s victims, said he had been less fearful about a black person seeking race-based revenge \u201cbecause of the enormous grace that was shown by the congregation and the community as a whole.\u201dAlthough the church that Mr. Roof targeted was predominantly black, the church in last Sunday\u2019s attack had a mixed congregation.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney\u2019s office in Nashville have opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting in Antioch.The United States attorney\u2019s office and the Nashville police declined to comment on the note.Mr. Samson, a legal resident of the United States who immigrated from Sudan in the 1990s, had attended the church in years past but had not been seen there more recently. Police said that four firearms believed to be Mr. Samson\u2019s had been recovered: two pistols from the church and one pistol and one rifle from his vehicle.Investigators have been trying to figure out what prompted the shooting, exploring the history of any anger or resentments on Mr. Samson\u2019s part, as well as any mental illness.In an entry on his Facebook page from early this year, Mr. Samson, responding to a quip about a photo he posted of himself wearing a green Hulk mask, said, \u201cNaah, rage is my preferred state of mind.\u201dIn June, Mr. Samson sent a text to his father in which he seemed to be threatening suicide. \u201cYour phone is off, I have a gun to my head,\u201d the text, sent shortly after midnight, said, according to a police report made by the father. Using an expletive, he texted his father to \u201chave a nice\u201d life.On the Friday before the shooting, Mr. Samson was one of about 30 students who attended a class for unarmed security officers at the Academy of Personal Protection and Security in Nashville. The class was about eight hours long. According to the owner of the academy, Buford Tune, who is also an instructor, Mr. Samson received his license and was affable and polite during his time there.\u201cIt was \u2018yes sir, no sir\u2019 and he was nothing but very pleasant,\u201d Mr. Tune recalled. \u201cThere was absolutely nothing that seemed odd. This is a real Jekyll and Hyde thing.\u201dMr. Samson was then hired by Crimson Security Service as an unarmed officer. A lawyer for the company, Laural Hemenway, said that he reported to work that Saturday \u201cfor training purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthere was no incident or indication of any problem with Mr. Samson at any time during his shift.\u201dAround 10 a.m. the next day, the company, she said, received a text from Mr. Samson stating that he was not going to return to work there. \u201cCrimson Security Service terminated his employment upon receipt of his message,\u201d Ms. Hemenway said, adding that was the last time Crimson Security communicated with Mr. Samson.Rebecca R.

{"Headline": "The Contradictions of Hajj, Through the Lens of a Smartphone", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs it permissible to take a selfie in front of the Kaaba during hajj? With spotty internet, I was unable to Google the answer. Forced to call an audible fatwa, I decided, \u201cYes, if indeed my intention is pure.\u201dAwe-struck by the privilege of participating in this tradition while often agitated by the contradictions that surround it today, I made sense of the experience by sharing it \u2014 filtering the pilgrimage through the lens of my smartphone.The most painful aspect of hajj wasn\u2019t the physical toll that came with navigating cramped space with my two million diverse fellow pilgrims, or the intense spiritual concentration. It wasn\u2019t the hiking-induced blisters and chafing. It was witnessing the erasure and razing of my religion\u2019s culture, history and narrative by the House of Saud.The Saudi royal family follows the revisionist and extreme ideology of Wahhabism, which preaches an interpretation of strict monotheism that is often at odds with centuries of theological scholarship. They consider veneration and respect of most holy sites and visitations of graves as a form of idolatry.That explains why, in their country, while the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s mosque and courtyard in Medina are spacious, cooled and immaculate, Jannat al-Baqi \u2014 a graveyard directly across from the green dome housing the remains of thousands of Islam\u2019s luminaries \u2014 looks like a set from \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d There are no tombstones, just slabs of rock sticking out like middle fingers from the dirt. If you linger too long to pay respects or offer a prayer, the mutawwa \u2014 religious police \u2014 rush you along. When you ask them who\u2019s buried here, they answer, \u201cAllah knows best,\u201d although they know the truth: the daughter of the prophet, his family members and some of his most loyal companions.My friends and I spent hours at the prophet\u2019s tomb and the rawdah \u2014 a space between his original pulpit and grave considered by Muslims to be some of the hottest spiritual real estate on earth. The moving experience was tempered by the awareness that most Muslims long to offer their \u201csalaams\u201d (prayers of peace) to the prophet, but cannot afford to visit his mosque. Also, women are often unable to properly perform the \u201cziyarat\u201d (religious visitation) there because they\u2019re allowed only limited access.In Mecca, I hiked nearly an hour under the remorseless afternoon sun to visit the Cave of Hira, where the prophet is believed to have received his first revelation: \u201cRecite!\u201d There are no golden signs, air-conditioning, wheelchair ramps or video presentations here. The austere cave used to offer a clear line of sight to the Kaaba, but now the view is now obscured by that monstrous, $15 billion, Saudi-government-funded clock tower and the accompanying world\u2019s tallest hotel.That tableau is a perfect symbol of the strained marriage between the house of God \u2014 the Kaaba, in Mecca \u2014 and the House of Saud, which controls everything related to the sacred mosques. In adherence to the reactionary religious ideology it embraces, the government has allowed the prophet\u2019s house to fall into decrepitude. It has flattened the home of his first wife, Khadija, and installed public toilets where it used to stand. But it has no objection to the construction of extravagant hotels not far away.These government\u2019s conflicting values were on display wherever I looked: While non-Muslims are forbidden from even entering Mecca, everyone is free to eat American Hardee\u2019s hamburgers or KFC fried chicken, or buy a Rolex watch across from the Kaaba. It\u2019s forbidden to excessively venerate the prophet and his companions, but there\u2019s no problem with the giant posters of King Abdulaziz, King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, that are all around town.But whenever I found myself lamenting the ugliness and hypocrisy of these elements of my journey, the people I met reminded me why I was there, with displays of untarnished spirituality. In the prophet\u2019s mosque, local people brought bread, dates and milk to feed fasting pilgrims. Children begged me to eat from the plates they had prepared, hoping to gain some of the blessings. In the desert plain of Arafat, east of Mecca, I walked with nearly two million pilgrims to the Mount of Mercy. Men and women offered whatever they had: water, food, ice cream, a helping hand for a wheelchair-user. They shared the shade under their umbrellas, and sometimes even the clothes off their back with fellow pilgrims. We were united in a shared journey: seeking to find forgiveness, mercy and salvation.It made sense to invite fellow Muslims and friends along for a view of this often-schizophrenic experience, unfiltered through Wahhabi propaganda. While I initially worried it might distract me from my prayer, sharing the photos and Facebook Live videos made hajj a communal experience, in the most modern way possible.In Mecca and Medina, often through my camera\u2019s lens, I looked up at the heavens and at the shiny buildings, but I also looked around me and engaged with a community of believers \u2014 some of them with me on ground, and some of them looking at screens on the other side of the world. That\u2019s where I found God \u2014 and beauty \u2014 in all its glorious contradictions.Wajahat Ali is a playwright, lawyer and contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

I tried to ground myself in what I was feeling. And what I felt was profound disappointment, worry for the path forward, and that I had let people down.\u201d\u201cIt pains me to my core to hear you say that,\u201d Ms. Ferrera said. \u201cBecause for me and the thousands upon thousands of people who emailed, texted, called, who I ran into at the Starbucks with tears in their eyes, we were all so grateful.

You don\u2019t have to compete with a woman for a job. Or with a striving young immigrant.\u201d It\u2019s a falsehood that gave some comfort to people and gave them permission to scapegoat others.There was a well-coordinated campaign to fuel anger. That\u2019s not how I\u2019m made. I wasn\u2019t going to try to compete with that level of vitriol. Remember, Trump was provoking violence at his rallies. I kept thinking: \u201cPeople are going to be shocked by this.\u201d But it had the feel of a Roman circus. \u201cShow me a bigger lion!\u201d But despite my efforts to break through and put forward the plans I had, I never figured out how to contend with the anger or overcome it.Haters are going to hate, but I\u2019m determined to tell my truth and throw it to the future.

His body was weak and under water. Are we going to die, he said over and over again to a colleague hugging the trunk of the tree.For 18 hours starting on Monday afternoon, the two journalists for The Daily Mail and another man gripped the only thing keeping them from being sucked into the raging river. Helicopters circled above and rescue crews were off in the distance, but their screams were not heard.Just before noon Tuesday, three members of the Texas Department of Public Safety in a powerboat spotted the men and pulled them to safety, making them among the lucky few who came face to face with Hurricane Harvey\u2019s wrath and survived. But four other men with them had been swept away and were missing, and their relatives frantically started an effort online to find them.Two of their bodies were later found, and the two other men remain missing. But during a week in which Harvey delivered one devastating blow after another, the harrowing story of survival is among those that have captured people\u2019s attention through news reports and social media. It is among the instances in which people trying to rescue others ended up needing rescuing \u2014 and in which those chronicling the devastation couldn\u2019t help but be swept up in it.Mr. Butterfield and Mr. Connellan, a photographer, were in stable condition on Thursday at Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital in Houston, according to The Daily Mail. Mr. Connellan\u2019s hands were cut as he held onto the tree and his face battered, and Mr. Butterfield broke a toe and cut his knee.Mr. Connellan did not return requests for comment on Thursday, and Mr. Butterfield, reached by phone at the hospital on Thursday afternoon, referred questions to a Daily Mail spokesman, who did not return a request for comment. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not return a request for comment.The other man rescued, identified by relatives as Jose Vizueth, 30, was also at a hospital. The two men who died were identified by the authorities as Jorge Raul Perez and Yahir Rubio-Vizuet.On Thursday, family members and volunteers searched brush along the Green Bayou east of downtown Houston for the missing men, Benjamin Vizueth, 31, and Gustavo Rodriguez-Hernandez, 40.The paths of the seven men intersected Monday afternoon. The two journalists landed in Texas to cover Harvey\u2019s landfall, staking out a part of the Texas Gulf Coast south of Houston bracing for the destructive winds and pummeling rains.By Monday afternoon, the two journalists had made their way into Houston and spotted another possible story off Highway 90 in the eastern part of the city. Water covered streets and nearly topped bridges, submerging homes and neighborhoods in feet of floodwater.The Greens Bayou, which flows under the highway during normal conditions, had swollen into a roaring river, and five men were about to use a small motorboat to try to rescue a relative in a wheelchair stuck in her home. The men invited Mr. Butterfield and Mr. Connellan to tag along and document it.But something went awry a few minutes into the journey. Battling fierce currents, the boat lost control and veered off course \u2014 defenseless as the raging river pushed it toward fallen power lines dangling in the water. Only about 20 feet from the lines, the seven men all jumped into the water.Mr. Butterfield and Mr. Connellan plunged into the bayou, their bodies tingling from the electrical current. When Mr. Butterfield surfaced, he told The Daily Mail, he heard his colleague about 50 feet away screaming his name. The boat had struck the lines and was smoking.As the current pulled the journalists and Mr. Vizueth downstream, Mr. Butterfield said, he yelled for them to try to grab a tree. The men latched onto one, and Mr. Butterfield and Mr. Vizueth took off their shoes so they could grip the tree and climb it, according to The Daily Mail.But Mr. Connellan was out of energy and could not pull himself up out of the water. He held onto a branch in the water, repeatedly asking his colleague if they would make it out alive, the publication said.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell the others, but I thought we might be there until at least Thursday until the water receded,\u201d Mr. Butterfield told The Daily Mail. \u201cI could see from the water mark on the trees that it had hardly gone down in the 18 hours we were there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solving the Puzzle of Eggplant Parmesan", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut at the end of the season \u2014 when the tomatoes are destined for sauce instead of salad, the eggplants are shiny and firm, and the idea of a casserole begins to seem appealing again \u2014 eggplant Parmesan beckons to many cooks. In Italy, the dish is soft and silky, with the eggplant acting as a succulent sponge for the flavors of olive oil and tomato.But I\u2019ve never made an eggplant Parmesan that I didn\u2019t regret.Draining, dredging and frying eggplant slices is a completely worthwhile kitchen project (if one of the messier ones). But according to most American recipes for eggplant Parmesan, I am supposed to bury those crisp slices in a dish with tomato sauce, bake them into mush and still expect deliciousness. This never happens. The breading in the crust always soaks up the liquid, and the whole thing becomes mired in sludge.At some point between Rome and Rochester, the recipe seems to have been lost in translation. In general, Italian recipes call for frying the eggplant in a light dusting of flour, making it brown and tender. American recipes often add an egg wash and bread crumbs to make a thicker, crunchy crust. This is a great development when you are eating plain fried eggplant, but not when that eggplant is destined to end up in a casserole.Still, I believe that eggplant Parmesan is \u2014 or should be \u2014 the perfect crowd-pleasing vegetarian entree, with its familiar flavors and satisfying richness. A main dish of eggplant has heft, unlike an entree based on broccoli or cabbage.I was determined to reformulate the dish so that the eggplant would behave like a cutlet of veal or chicken, standing on its own crusty merits. There are many good recipes, including Mrs. Hazan\u2019s, for eggplant Parmesan \u2014 but none for a crunchy alternative. You can make grilled and roasted, stacked and rolled, muffin-tin and mug-baked versions. But these run the risk of becoming tough or slimy or both.As a boy, he helped his mother in the family\u2019s restaurant kitchen near Lyon, where he watched her make beignets d\u2019aubergines. She\u2019d split the large eggplants of late summer in half, then thinly slice each half while keeping the slices attached at the stem end, and dip them in a light, eggy batter.\u201cIt was a little like tempura, and I don\u2019t know how she knew to do it, but it worked,\u201d he said. (She also addressed zucchini this way.)The slices fan out prettily, and even a fat eggplant becomes flat enough to cook as a cutlet. This way of preparing the vegetable for frying is also traditional in Sicily, where the puffed, golden-brown whole eggplants are called melanzane a quaglia, or eggplant quail-style. The slices curl up and arch as they hit the hot oil, making them look like birds\u2019 wings.Doing this with smaller whole eggplants works beautifully. I salt the eggplants lavishly, not because of any bitterness that needs to be removed but to firm and season the flesh. (Eggplant flesh itself is almost devoid of flavor and consists mainly of fiber. )Pressing the eggplants down as they absorb the salt helps both expel the liquid and force them into a flatter shape, the better for pan-frying. Make sure the batter permeates all the edges and crevices of the eggplant, and then plaster the surface with panko or bread crumbs.Once the eggplant was addressed, I needed hot tomato sauce and melted mozzarella to complete the dish. Borrowing an idea from shakshuka, I dropped spoonfuls of mozzarella into simmering tomato sauce, left them to melt, then spooned them out together. Firm, dry-packed mozzarella melted more neatly and reliably than the soft, fresh, water-packed kind.To keep the eggplant crisp to the very end, I placed the sauce and cheese next to the eggplant on each serving plate, but you might spoon them on top. (You also might put a bed of pasta on the plate for a truly filling meal.)This revised classic is an excellent reminder that new ways with old dishes are always out there \u2014 and sometimes they come from our oldest sources.cookingAdvertisement"}

In the meantime, if you stayed at a Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Four Points, Aloft, Le M\u00e9ridien, Tribute, Design Hotels, Elements or Luxury Collection hotel in the last four years, you may want to assume that you were.Regardless of the type of breach or the company involved, it\u2019s always a safe bet to change passwords for sites that contain sensitive information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites, and do not use your Social Security number as a username or a password.And if you were not doing so already, you will have to treat everything you receive online with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick you out of even more information.These sites create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. Password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode.If you must create your own passwords, try creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters.My favorite number is Green4782#The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%Or, if you\u2019re extra paranoid, consider mimicking this setup.

If a site offers additional security features, like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text or a code through an authenticator app) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Many bank sites and major sites like Google, Facebook and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you are logging in from a new computer.If you get an email containing links or attachments, even if it appears to be from a familiar friend or colleague, do yourself a favor: Check the From Email Address. Often, attackers will tweak email addresses to be recognizable to their target. Only under closer examination does their target see that the domain is misspelled or the attacker has replaced an \"i\" with a 1. Other times, the email will contain obvious misspellings or strange syntax that was obviously created by a foreigner using Google translate or another translation service. If anything seems off, do not click.To help mitigate what malicious attachments can do to your machine, make sure to update your software regularly, particularly your operating system. Frequently, software companies will release updates that patch bugs and software vulnerabilities when they are discovered.Sites will often use common security questions to recover a user\u2019s account if the password is forgotten.These questions are problematic because the internet has made public record searches simple and the answers are usually easy to guess.In a study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat is your favorite food?\u201d (It was pizza.)With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat is your city of birth?\u201d and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.If you're required to answer security questions, lie and jot down your fake answers in pen or paper. (Q. \"Where were you born?\" A. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Q. \"What was your first pet\u2019s name?\" A. Peach.)Remember the old adage: Don\u2019t put anything in an email that you would not want to see on the front page of The New York Times. The same applies to your sensitive information. Never ever send sensitive data like passwords, Social Security numbers or PINs in an email. If you must share this information, do it over the phone or, worst-case scenario, through an encrypted messaging app like Signal, which allows you to scramble messages and time them to disappear.Never allow a retailer or merchant to store your credit card information unnecessarily. If it is offered, use PayPal or Apple Pay for online transactions. Both are safer than most online payment methods.Your phone is incredibly valuable to criminals and spies. Treat it accordingly. Don\u2019t bother with a four-digit passcode, which is easy to guess. Six-digit passcodes are harder to guess. Eight-digit-passcodes are better.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Start-Up Slump Is a Drag on the Economy. Big Business May Be to Blame.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment has fallen, and the stock market has soared. So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?Economists say the answer, to some degree, can be found in a start-up slump \u2014 a decline in the creation of new businesses \u2014 and a growing understanding of what\u2019s behind it.\u201cWe\u2019re still in a start-up funk,\u201d said Robert Litan, an economist and antitrust lawyer who has studied the issue. \u201cObviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you\u2019re left with the conundrum: Why hasn\u2019t there been any recovery?\u201dMany economists say the answer could lie in the rising power of the biggest corporations, which they argue is stifling entrepreneurship by making it easier for incumbent businesses to swat away challengers \u2014 or else to swallow them before they become a serious threat.\u201cYou\u2019ve got rising market power,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn general, that makes it hard for new businesses to compete with incumbents. Market power is the story that explains everything.\u201dThe start-up slump has far-reaching implications. Small businesses in general are often cited as an exemplar of economic dynamism. But it is start-ups \u2014 and particularly the small subset of companies that grow quickly \u2014 that are key drivers of job creation and innovation, and have historically been a ladder into the middle class for less-educated workers and immigrants.Perhaps most significant, start-ups play a critical role in making the economy as a whole more productive, as they invent new products and approaches, forcing existing businesses to compete or fall by the wayside.\u201cAcross the decades, young companies are really the heavy hitters and the consistent hitters in terms of job creation,\u201d said Arnobio Morelix, an economist at the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit in Kansas City, Mo., that studies and promotes entrepreneurship.The start-up decline might defy expectations in the age of Uber and \u201cShark Tank.\u201d But however counterintuitive, the trend is backed by multiple data sources and numerous economic studies.In 1980, according to the Census Bureau data, roughly one in eight companies had been founded in the past year; by 2015, that ratio had fallen to fewer than one in 12. The downward trend cuts across regions and industries and, at least since 2000, includes even the beating heart of American entrepreneurship, high tech.Although the overall slump dates back more than 30 years, economists are most concerned about a more recent trend. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entrepreneurial slowdown was concentrated in sectors such as retail, where corner stores and regional brands were being subsumed by national chains. That trend, though often painful for local communities, wasn\u2019t necessarily a drag on productivity more generally.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of pieces now that say dynamism has gone down a lot since 2000,\u201d said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist who has done much of the pioneering work in the field. \u201cStart-ups have gone down a lot since 2000, especially in the high-tech sectors, and there are increasingly strong links to productivity.\u201dWhat is behind the decline in entrepreneurship is less clear. Economists and other experts have pointed to a range of possible explanations: The aging of the baby-boom generation has left fewer Americans in their prime business-starting years. The decline of community banks and the collapse of the market for home-equity loans may have made it harder for would-be entrepreneurs to get access to capital. Increased regulation, at both the state and federal levels, may be particularly burdensome for new businesses that lack well-staffed compliance departments. Those and other factors could well play a role, but none can fully explain the decline.More recently, economists \u2014 especially but not exclusively on the left \u2014 have begun pointing the finger at big business, and in particular at the handful of companies that increasingly dominate many industries.The evidence is largely circumstantial: The slump in entrepreneurship has coincided with a period of increasing concentration in nearly every major industry. Research from Mr. Haltiwanger and several co-authors has found that the most productive companies are growing more slowly than in the past, a hint that competitive pressures aren\u2019t forcing companies to react as quickly to new innovations.\u201cIf we\u2019re in an era of excessive profits, in competitive markets we would see record firm entry, but we see the opposite,\u201d said Ian Hathaway, an economist who has studied the issue. That, Mr. Hathaway said, suggests that the market is not truly competitive \u2014 that existing companies have found ways to block competitors.Experts also point to anecdotal examples that suggest that the rise of big businesses could be squelching competition. YouTube, Instagram and hundreds of lower-profile start-ups chose to sell out to industry heavyweights like Google and Facebook rather than try to take them on directly. The tech giants have likewise been accused of using the power of their platforms to favor their own offerings over those of competitors.\u201cWe\u2019re saying that it\u2019s O.K. that they shape how a city charges taxes?\u201d Mr. Morelix said. \u201cAnd what kind of regulations they have? That should be terrifying to anyone that wants a free market.\u201d\u201cEverybody loves entrepreneurship, but they\u2019re not aware it\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Mr. Dearie said. \u201cIf new businesses are the engine of net new job creation, and if new businesses are the engine of innovation, and new business creation is at 30-year lows, that\u2019s a national emergency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Are All Jew-ish Now", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAsked what makes them \u201cJewish,\u201d many Jews are, naturally, likely to point to religion \u2014 to rituals and prayers like the ones associated with the High Holy Days.Other Jews, not so much. \u201cReligion doesn\u2019t play any part in my life in terms of how I live my life,\u201d the comedian Larry David has said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gone through a day in my life without hearing someone say the word \u2018Jew\u2019 or saying it myself.\u201dReligion does play a part in my life, but I still know what Mr. David means. For me, too, there\u2019s something about my Jewishness that is completely disconnected from the Torah, Shabbat or the High Holy Days. Such is the modern Jewish condition.Through all of modernity, the \u201cJewish question\u201d hovered menacingly over Jews in the West. Shorthand for a series of suspicious demands \u2014 Who are you really? What is the nature of your identity? What unifies you as a group? Which club do you belong to? What makes you different? \u2014 it would ultimately lead Jews to the horror of the \u201cFinal Solution.\u201d(Jewish jokes give us an inkling of this: Consider Groucho Marx\u2019s famous remark, \u201cI don\u2019t care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.\u201d Or the story about the Jew who is stranded alone on a desert island and builds two synagogues \u2014 the one he goes to, and the one he wouldn\u2019t be seen dead in.)In effect, Bruce was comically \u201canswering\u201d the Jewish question. But though he mimicked categorization, he was really poking fun at such categories. For Bruce, \u201cJewish\u201d doesn\u2019t even necessarily refer to Jews: \u201cIf you live in New York or any other big city, you are Jewish. It doesn\u2019t matter even if you\u2019re Catholic; if you live in New York, you\u2019re Jewish. If you live in Butte, Montana, you\u2019re going to be goyish even if you\u2019re Jewish.\u201dNot unlike Jews themselves, Bruce\u2019s definition of \u201cJewish\u201d seems to have uprooted, wandered and dispersed. It no longer corresponds to anything fixed. It\u2019s not necessarily an identity. Better to call it a sensibility: the sensibility of whoever feels a bit unsure of who they are \u2014 a bit peculiar or out of place, a bit funny.But isn\u2019t that now everyone\u2019s modern condition? While modernity promised Jews and other minorities that they could move from the margins to the center, it\u2019s the reverse that may have actually occurred. In the era of radical globalization and the internet, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are \u2014 even if you\u2019re male, white, straight, middle-class \u2014 you\u2019re probably feeling that your group or identity has been, if not existentially threatened, then at the very least marginalized. These days we\u2019re all mobile and unsettled, even if we stay put. We\u2019re all hyper-connected but insecure. So you\u2019re liable now to be somewhat Jewish even if you do live in Butte, Mont.Who are you really? What is the nature of your identity? Which club do you belong to? In a social media age, everyone must answer these difficult questions \u2014 or at least project answers to them, one status update at a time. The impossible demand of what was once the \u201cJewish question\u201d seems today to have broadened into a \u201cFacebook question.\u201dLenny Bruce could have had a lot of fun with social media, listing his likes and dislikes and offending those with finer tastes. But his sensibility does very little to reassure the one who believes herself distinguished by her preferences. As much as our sensibilities may tell us about our differences, Bruce\u2019s \u201cJewish and goyish\u201d routine also shows us how slippery our differences are.Such uncertainty can be frightening. But it can also be something more. Bruce\u2019s exuberant remarking on our differences is also a high-octane performance of how much we can laugh about our differences. How pleasurable it can be to find oneself unbound by categories. We\u2019re not all Jews, but we\u2019re all becoming Jew-ish. So take a cue from Bruce.

There\u2019s a little more of a wiggliness, of loosey-gooeyness and bubbliness than an adult.\u201dWhile frolicking among the fossils and singing to unsuspecting visitors as she work-shopped the performance, she said, the thing she heard most was, \u201cI don\u2019t speak English.\u201d Most of those she approached were tourists, she added.But it\u2019s not just communicating with foreigners or tiptoeing around priceless artifacts that the production company has had to consider.The production crew had to keep asking the sanitation employees to move the garbage, said the director, Sarah Jane Scaife, \u201cbecause the rats were going back and forth and back and forth in the Beckett play.\u201dWhat did the play\u2019s director, Amir Nizar Zuabi, want to get out of staging it in a kitchen?\u201cIntimacy, of course,\u201d Mr. Zuabi said.It worked for Brooke Shilling, 22, an audience member from Astoria.\u201cDuring the play you\u2019re smelling the story of her culture, you could taste the air,\u201d she said.\u201cIt made me feel like I was right there in the kitchen with her,\u201d she added, \u201cBecause I was.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Adi\u00f3s, Jose.(But Hurricane Maria continues to devastate the Caribbean.)If you\u2019re looking for ways to help the victims of these catastrophes, here are a few suggestions:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Mexico Has a Quake Warning System. Where is California\u2019s?", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.It\u2019s just a matter of time.Some steps have been taken to prepare. After the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes, billions of dollars were spent to fortify structures across the state.But more than a decade after development began on an earthquake early warning system, the project is still years away from full implementation.Here\u2019s a look at the plan in California:How would the warning system work?A network of sensors placed near fault lines detect shaking and alert nearby communities through television, radio, phone and other channels.Modern telecommunications travel faster than seismic waves. So in essence, the warnings are able to outrun the shaking.People could get anywhere from a few seconds to more than a minute of warning, depending on the intensity of the quake and the distance from its epicenter.That poses a crucial caveat: If a big quake kicks off right near a city, the alerts might not do much good.Where does the project stand?Roughly 500 earthquake sensors are already in the ground. Another 500 or so need to be placed.Next year, the plan calls for limited regional rollouts.One critical objective, getting phones into the network, could take another several years.What\u2019s taking so long?Mexico created its warning system after more than 5,000 people died in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. The devastating Kobe earthquake of 1995 prompted Japan to add one as well.\u201cIf we had a major damaging earthquake in California, we too would magically find, not only the capital investment, but the will,\u201d said Ms. Strauss. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t had one of those.\u201dMark Ghilarducci, director of the California\u2019s office of emergency services, said getting the system in place was a major priority for the state.\u201cIt\u2019s a life-saving thing,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cIf you just look at the images from Mexico City, being able to get under cover, cover and hold, get to a safe zone. That\u2019s really phenomenal.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Summer\u2019s just about over.As if to underscore the transition, the Sierra Nevada is now expected to get its first measurable snowfall of the season.\u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning of fall.

{"Headline": "I Can\u2019t Wait to Drive in Saudi Arabia Again", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn May 2011, I drove a car in the city of Khobar, Saudi Arabia, to protest the kingdom\u2019s ban on women driving. As a result, I was arrested, taken from my home in the dark of night and jailed for nine days, during which time I was interrogated, strip-searched and accused of being a traitor and a spy. I was released only after my father begged King Abdullah, the ruler at the time, to pardon me.Women before and after me have also been arrested, lost their jobs and been jailed for the simple act of getting behind the wheel of a car.We protested the ban on driving by women because its effects went far beyond cars and roads. The prohibition meant that we were unable to take our children to school; we could not drive loved ones to a doctor or hospital; we could not commute to a job or go to the grocery store on our own. The ban meant the loss of the most basic form of dignity and control over our lives.This is why for the women of Saudi Arabia, Sept. 26, 2017, the day the monarchy announced that it plans to overturn the driving ban, will be remembered as our Emancipation Day. It is every bit as monumental for us as Aug. 18, 1920, was for American women, the date the 19th Amendment giving them the right to vote was ratified.At last, Saudi women will have freedom of movement \u2014 and their say. Saudi society will never be the same again. From my friends living inside the kingdom, I hear a mixture of disbelief and joy. My email inbox is overflowing with messages of wonder. On my Facebook feed, I see my friends\u2019 excitement. \u201cFinally come true,\u201d one friend wrote. Another dreamed bigger: \u201cI hope all the laws would be reformed until we observe full equality between the sexes.\u201dAmerican women fought for their basic emancipation during the heyday of the bicycle. The great women\u2019s rights pioneer Susan B. Anthony said that bicycling \u201chas done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\u201d The bicycle freed 19th-century women from their homes and from their dependence on men. I hope that in Saudi Arabia, the car will do the same.I am certain that some parts of Saudi society will vehemently oppose women driving. In the last six years, official studies commissioned by the government have declared that women will damage their ovaries from sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and will give birth to children \u201cwith clinical problems.\u201dIn 2011, the year that I drove, an academic report prepared for the Saudi Legislature, the Shura, concluded that allowing women to drive would lead to societal rot, including \u201cpornography, prostitution, homosexuality and divorce.\u201d And just last week, a Saudi cleric, warning against women as drivers, claimed that women have only \u201chalf the brains of men,\u201d adding that the figure drops to one quarter \u201cwhen they go to market.\u201dThis language may be shocking until you consider that 100 years ago, American suffragists peacefully asking for the right to vote were arrested, tortured, beaten, force-fed and locked in mental institutions. But they persisted, and they won. Like their American sisters, Saudi women have persisted, too.We Saudi women have been like birds with clipped wings, full of song, but unable to take flight. That will change. Now we must become the driving force of our own destinies, able to make our own decisions. Our brains are 100 percent strong. We are fully capable of being our own guardians.When I was forced to leave my country and my family, I dreamed of the day when I might return, not in an airplane, but by driving across the border and up through the desert to my home. Today I no longer have to dream. Next June, when the change in policy comes into effect, I plan to make that drive.But for now let us take a moment to appreciate every woman who has done the impossible and gotten behind the wheel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For One Family in Houston, an Overwhelming Start to Recovery", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 She couldn\u2019t sleep. Not now.Kris Ford-Amofa lay next to her husband in a spare bedroom at her sister\u2019s house, thinking once more about the brown water that had slithered under the front door of the first home she had ever owned. The water that swirled around her three children as the family fled, wading up City Green Trail to seek refuge at a neighbor\u2019s house. The water that had buckled their living room floor, rotted the drywall and made them homeless. The floodwater that was not covered by their insurance.Where did she even start? On Thursday, she got up early, set two phones on the kitchen table \u2014 one for Federal Emergency Management Agency, and one to call Enterprise about a rental car \u2014 and started dialing, launching into her third day on the job as a disaster-recovery coordinator for her upended family.With no preparation and few road maps to guide them, tens of thousands of hurricane survivors like the Amofas are now stumbling through their first bewildering days after Harvey. The rains may have passed, but now they are consumed with worry about their children\u2019s futures, precarious family finances and what remains of the homes they fled.They need to find their way out of shelters and relatives\u2019 extra bedrooms. Find new schools for their children. Find hotel rooms when everything is booked, find rental cars when everything is taken and find the time to gut their homes, call contractors and hack through layers of bureaucracy, all while bills pile up and bosses call them back to work.An hour and a half into her morning, Kris, 43, was nowhere. Growing up in rural Louisiana, she knew floods and tropical storms. She had fled Hurricane Rita in 2005. Still, she was not equipped for this.She had filed a claim with FEMA, but was told she needed to send a declaration and release form. She didn\u2019t have her laptop, and she couldn\u2019t find the right paperwork with her phone.\u201cWhere do I find the form?\u201d she asked. \u201cI see the name of the form. There wasn\u2019t a link.\u201dA pause.\u201cI need to speak to someone. I hit option three to speak to someone.\u201dShe listened for a minute, head in hand.\u201cThis is not the help line?\u201d\u201cWe need a boat asap!!!\u201d Kris had written on Facebook. \u201cThe helicopters are not picking up by us!!! Please anybody!!!\u201dHarvey had made landfall on the Central Texas coast late Friday. Now it was Monday, and the waters were still rising across Houston. On the Amofas\u2019 street, the water was topping car windows and reaching the height of small children. And it was flowing inside the beige-brick home on the northeast side of town where Kris and her husband, Yaw Amofa, 47, had lived for less than a year.The family thought they would be safe. Kris had a second floor. The federal government said the area was at \u201cminimal hazard\u201d for flooding. So they bought milk, eggs, loaves of bread, and hunkered down for the weekend, joined by Kris\u2019s younger sister, Miesha Jolly, 36, and Miesha\u2019s three children.It had taken Kris and Yaw six years of work to buy the house. Six years of saving up, fixing their credit, attending personal-finance classes and debating whether they should invest so much money and risk into a single $180,000 purchase.Yaw, an immigrant from Ghana, said it was their American dream. The family moved from southwest Houston to this new subdivision on the edge of the woods, a slice of suburbia so newly built that the family\u2019s address did not yet show up on some online maps.When they moved in, they hung a sign on the living-room wall: \u201cHome \u2014 where life begins.\u201dNow, they needed a way out. Miesha\u2019s husband was trying to return from his job on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. That left three adults and six children in the house \u2014 including Miesha\u2019s 4-month-old daughter, her 2-year-old son, and Kris\u2019s oldest son, Jason, 17, who has autism and walks with difficulty.As the waters rose past car doors and seeped into the home, the family called 911, the Coast Guard, the Cajun Navy volunteers who were zipping around the city in bass boats and Jet Skis. The children waved white T-shirts out the window.Nobody came. The children tried to stanch the water with towels and sweatshirts. Phones blared with tornado warnings. Then, the power went out. The water in the living room started crawling up the stairs toward the bedrooms.At 9:14 p.m. Sunday, Kris posted on Facebook: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to make a move cause the water is coming through the doors and under the base boards like a river!!\u201dAround noon the next day, they threw a few clothes and papers into backpacks. The family, who link hands for grace before meals and attend a Baptist church, tried to gather strength. \u201cJesus remove this fear from me to actually get on it,\u201d Kris wrote to her 378 Facebook friends.And then they set off through the flooded street. Kris\u2019s younger son, Joshua, cried that he didn\u2019t want to leave and clung to the driver\u2019s side-view mirror of their new 2017 Nissan Pathfinder, now swamped with water.They pried his hands away and waded down the driveway. The water was up to the children\u2019s chests.With one arm, Kris guided her older son, Jason. He loves water, and she had to make sure he didn\u2019t stray into the currents bobbing with garbage and portable toilets unmoored from construction sites. With her other hand, Kris helped carry Miesha\u2019s 2-year-old son, Trey, tucked into a plastic garbage can that was padded with backpacks.They strapped Miesha\u2019s 4-month-old daughter, Quinn, into her car seat, set it into a plastic bin and entrusted the baby to the two oldest girls: Kris\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, Raechel, and Miesha\u2019s 11-year-old, Lejla. The girls floated the baby up the street as she smiled at the rain spattering her face.They took shelter in a still-vacant house up the block, but decided the water was rising too fast. They went on, and ended up at the home of a neighbor, who was cooking hot dogs and hamburgers for the makeshift evacuation shelter that was sprouting up in his home and garage.After a few hours, a rickety boat pulled up, and everyone except Kris\u2019s husband climbed aboard. They threaded through the flooded trees toward a Walmart parking lot where a co-worker of Miesha\u2019s picked them up, fixed them rice and quesadillas and rolled out air mattresses for the night.Miesha\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, Lejla, dreamed about floodwaters swallowing her baby sister.Three days later, Kris\u2019s husband, Yaw, felt as if he was behind schedule. Although the waters had receded, the Amofas could not stay in their home. The first floor was soaked, and already smelling of mildew. The families were camped out together at Miesha\u2019s house in northeast Houston, which had stayed dry: four adults, six children and a dog.All morning Yaw and his brother-in-law had tried unsuccessfully to find contractors and drywall experts to inspect the damage. They had received conflicting information about whether they should start tearing up the walls, or wait for a professional to inspect the house.Time, heat and water were Yaw\u2019s enemies now, conspiring beneath the carpets to rot and putrefy. A family down the block was already ripping out their soaked floorboards. His next-door neighbor\u2019s leather couch was already bearded with white mold. When Yaw returned to clean up and inspect the house, he decided he couldn\u2019t wait.\u201cYou can already smell,\u201d he said, standing in a puddle in his living room. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re breathing. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your house.\u201dSo, without masks, he and a neighbor marked a line on the walls and started sawing away with wood-handled kitchen knives. Drywall crumbled like soggy meringue. They yanked out insulation, which dripped like wet wool, and threw it onto the front yard, Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cNatural Mystic\u201d playing in the background.\u201cThings are not the way they used to be,\u201d Yaw sang.Yaw had worked at Home Depot before getting his civilian job in customer services with the Houston Police Department. But he was out of his league here. He had studied philosophy, not construction, years ago as an exchange student living in New Jersey.\u201cIt\u2019s hitting me right now,\u201d he said, \u201cthe depth of the work we have to do. And this is just the beginning.\u201dHe said they needed to pull up the floors, throw away the furniture, tear out the cabinets, inspect the wiring, call contractors, figure out how to pay for it all. Would they be eligible for any federal aid or loans? Could they take on the additional debt?Kris was racked with regret that her family \u2014 like most those who suffered flood damage \u2014 did not have flood insurance. She had always tried to stick to a budget, down to choosing the pancake syrup that gives her the best value. It could be months before she knows Harvey\u2019s toll on their finances.Her boss at the suburban hospital where she posts payments had told her to take as much time as she needed. But Yaw said he had to go back to work on Tuesday and he didn\u2019t know how he would find time to do it all.Yaw\u2019s neighbor walked in with a gift: a dust mask. Yaw snapped it on and turned back to the wall.\u201cWhere did I put my knife?\u201dEverything felt like eternity.When a friend took Kris to Walmart to buy new clothes for the children, they queued up outside in a row of people who shared photos of the damage, recounted boat rescues and National Guard convoys, and short-handed their fortunes: Water just up to the driveway. In the garage. First floor. Lost everything.When Kris and her sister went to the just-reopened H.E.B. for groceries, they waited in a line that stretched around the store\u2019s perimeter.When she checked out, Kris said, the cashier told her that a package of hamburger buns put her over the limit of two bread items per person.When she called around to look for hotel rooms, she learned that there were none nearby. When she called for rental cars, she learned that the companies couldn\u2019t find anything in Houston, but perhaps she could pick up in Dallas?The to-do list went on: Call the mortgage company. Call FEMA. Call work. Call the car lender. Call the car insurance company. Call the utility company. Call FEMA again. Call her friends from church. In one day, she made 22 telephone calls.But amid the frustration, she experienced moments of blessing. Friends paid for two carts full of clothes, food and other supplies at Walmart. Three strangers paid for her groceries one morning. Her sister Miesha, an inseparable companion, said Kris, Yaw and their children could stay with them as long as they needed.Their children were treating their displacement like an extended slumber party. Lejla and Raechel, the oldest girls, sang songs together and looked after the younger ones. Jason, who does not speak, hummed to himself on Miesha\u2019s couch and listened to classical music, his favorite, on YouTube.Thursday was ending, and Kris felt as if she had barely moved forward. She had finally found the FEMA form and sent it in, but was no closer to filling the most pressing need of a rental car so she and her husband could get around and get to work.She had always been fiercely independent. Growing up in a tiny town in central Louisiana, she had to take care of the house and her younger siblings. She had left home and hitched a ride to Houston after she finished high school in 1992. Now, she realized as she sat at the kitchen table, exhaustion washing over her, that Harvey had stolen her self-reliance.\u201cI have no control over anything right now,\u201d she said, her voice rising in frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve never sat waiting for somebody to take care of me. I\u2019ve always done it myself. Now, I have to wait all the time for somebody or something. I have to wait, wait, wait.\u201dHer sister, fresh from styling her hair for the first time in days, sat down at the kitchen table.The women talked about their childhood and their parents, about how the older sister had moved across this sprawling metropolis to be closer to the younger, how they chat on the phone as they drive to work, and about the rainy afternoon that they guided each other out of the flood.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From a Cairo Prison to a Poignant Wedding", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsNot every bride would be thrilled with the idea of being upstaged by a wedding guest. But Habiba Shebita would have welcomed the chance to share the spotlight with Omar Malek, a friend of her fianc\u00e9, Mohamed Soltan.Mr. Malek, 31, and Mr. Soltan, 29, were inmates in a Cairo prison two years ago after being arrested in a widespread government crackdown on political protesters. Mr. Malek, upon being sentenced to death, made a pact with Mr. Soltan.\u201cWhen Mohamed heard my sentence, he was shaking the bars in the prison,\u201d Mr. Malek said in an interview via FaceTime. \u201cI looked into his eyes and they had tears in them. He cried and screamed for me. I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, my friend. I will not die. One day you will be married and I will come to your wedding.\u2019\u201dThat promise never came to fruition. Although Mr. Malek was freed from prison this year and had secured a visa to come to the United States in early August, before Mr. Soltan and Ms. Shebita\u2019s Aug. 19 wedding celebration in Reston, Va., his lawyers ultimately advised him against leaving Egypt. There were concerns that he might be arrested at the airport.Mr. Malek\u2019s absence wasn\u2019t the only one deeply felt by the couple and their families. Mr. Soltan\u2019s father, Salah Soltan, a prominent Islamic scholar who was also arrested in the continuing political crackdown, is still in an Egyptian prison. He is serving a five-year sentence in a maximum-security prison after his death sentence was overturned by an appellate court.The couple remain committed to exposing human-rights injustices. In fact, this shared mission was what brought them together.One day, at an Islamist demonstration against the military takeover, she said, \u201cI came up with this crazy idea to speak on the protest stage, as an Egyptian-American citizen. Mind you, this is very much out of my character. I\u2019m never outspoken like that.\u201dBefore she was cleared to speak by protest organizers, she was required to go backstage and have the content of her message screened for offensive material by another American protester. That screener was Mr. Soltan, then 25. \u201cI like to think it was fate,\u201d Ms. Shebita said.If it was fate, however, it took its time, and some harrowing turns, before uniting them as a couple.In August 2013, as Ms. Shebita was preparing to fly back to New Jersey for her first semester at Rutgers University, chaos descended on Mr. Soltan, an Ohio State University graduate who moved to the United States as a child and was then living in Egypt with family.Police began a violent raid on the protest camp, outside the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque, where he was volunteering. Amid the turmoil, he was shot in the arm, while his family dispersed. Mr. Soltan\u2019s mother and teenage sister fled to the United States, moving in with Hanaa Soltan, an older sister, in Falls Church. His father went into hiding but was apprehended a month later.On the day of Ms. Shebita\u2019s return flight to the United States, Mr. Soltan was arrested on terrorism- and conspiracy-related charges when police raided his family\u2019s Cairo home. He was thrown into a crowded cell with about 20 other political prisoners and left to contemplate a future that was uncertain but likely, he assumed, to involve indefinite imprisonment or execution.\u201cIt was an underground dungeon, with no access to sunlight or anything humane,\u201d Mr. Soltan said. \u201cI had basically no access to the outside world.\u201d Mr. Soltan did, however, have a smuggled cellphone, which he used to let family members know he was still alive, and to hatch a plan to stage a hunger strike.His hunger strike lasted 16 months, during which he lost 160 pounds, and developed a pulmonary embolism in his right lung that nearly killed him. His physical frailty was compounded by psychological distress. Mr. Soltan spent the last five months of his nearly two years in prison in solitary confinement.He said guards encouraged him to kill himself with razors and tortured him with reports of abuse being inflicted on his father. An especially gruesome incident came near the end, when guards abandoned a dying man in his cell and left him with the man\u2019s body for half a day.\u201cI was traumatized over everything that had happened that summer in Egypt, and I didn\u2019t know how to deal with all the emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cMohamed\u2019s family created a Facebook page and I reached out to see what I could do to help.\u201dWithin a week, he was receiving visitors at his sister\u2019s house, including members of the #FreeSoltan movement. \u201cWe had been waiting to celebrate this moment for two years, but basically one of the first things he said to us when we got to Falls Church was, \u2018There are still people languishing in prison in Egypt. We have to help them,\u2019\u201d Ms. Shebita said.Moved by his compassion, she decided to join him in the cause. \u201cOur bond developed from there,\u201d she said. \u201cWithin 10 months of his release, our relationship merged from professional to personal.\u201dIn 2016, during Ms. Shebita\u2019s junior year at Rutgers, Mr. Soltan picked up the phone in Falls Church and asked her if she was \u201ctalking to anyone else\u201d \u2014 meaning other men. She said she wasn\u2019t.\u201cAfter that we were basically engaged,\u201d Ms. Shebita said.\u201cI felt like I clicked with her right away,\u201d Mr. Soltan said. \u201cThere was this level of comfort with her \u2014 I was still recovering, and she knew the depths of all the trauma I had been through, but she was O.K. with it. Her level of dedication is more than one can hope to find in a partner or spouse. Plus, she is really sweet and nice, and extremely independent and reliable.\u201dA few months of long-distance dating ensued, with the couple\u2019s first \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d exchanged on a day trip to the Jersey Shore that spring. In June, Mr. Soltan drove to New Jersey with Ghanim Aljumaily, a friend of his father\u2019s.\u201cHe\u2019s like a surrogate father to me, and I needed to let her family know my intentions were serious,\u201d Mr. Soltan said. With Mr. Aljumaily by his side, he asked Ms. Shebita\u2019s father, Amr Shebita, for permission to marry her. On June 19, with Ms. Shebita\u2019s family\u2019s blessings, they made the engagement public.Before they exchanged vows, though, Ms. Shebita needed to finish her studies. In May, after she received a degree in political science, the couple began planning.As they made their way through the ballroom, loved ones whispered blessings in Arabic. Mr. Soltan\u2019s mother, Asmaa Elnaggar, broke down in tears. \u201cIt\u2019s between sad and happy,\u201d she said through a translator, adding that the sadness was that her husband could not be there to see their son get married.\u201cI saw him in the prison, dying,\u201d Ms. Soltan said of her son. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep his own head up. Now he has a life.\u201dThe family played a recording, more than five minutes long, that Salah Soltan made for the wedding. As it was translated from Arabic to English, the attendees, including some of the hotel staff serving dinner, wiped away tears.\u201cI am with you,\u201d the elder Mr. Soltan said. \u201cLook amongst you and you will see me in your faces and eyes. I am with you as you are with me.\u201dThe recording, Ms. Shebita and Mr. Soltan said later, was the toughest moment in a night of joy. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to know he could be here and he\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Soltan said, his voice catching. \u201cNo son wants to have a wedding without his father.\u201dAnother missing guest, Mr. Malek, sent more warm wishes from Egypt: \u201cI wanted to be there for Mohamed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe deserves the best.\u201dEmily Cochrane contributed reporting from Reston, Va.Advertisement"}

A mother in peril who relied on the kindness of others.Sister Margaret Ann had used a chain saw before, but she was no expert.\u201cI had to Google to see how to start it,\u201d she said in an interview on Friday.She and her fellow sisters rode out the storm at the nearby Archbishop Coleman F. Carroll High School, where she is the principal. The school sustained damage to its air conditioning system, an outdoor pavilion, a set of bleachers and the baseball field, along with widespread water damage throughout the building, she said. There are also about six acres of downed trees, though this time she said she would let the maintenance crews wield the chain saws. In all, she expects to lose eight days of school, but hopes to return on Tuesday.She doesn\u2019t relish the attention, she said, but is happy that the students are thrilled by it. And at least two strangers have sent the school new chain saws, inspired by her deed.Though Sister Margaret Ann said the officer who took the video said the police would have cleared the road themselves, she said it probably would have taken a while and the police had more important tasks.\u201cIf you can do something, do it,\u201d Sister Margaret Ann said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for someone else to do it.\u201dBefore a 12-hour shift on Sunday, three Gainesville police officers stopped for a selfie.Lots of people take selfies, but this one stood out.

To be internationally praised for his looks, he said, is a welcome development.Again, this was a joke. But not everyone treated it as such, including the Pasco Sheriff\u2019s Office, which tweeted some guidance.As his event reached the eyes of more and more people, Mr. Edwards, 22, grew concerned. Not everyone, including some members of the news media, seemed to be in on the gag.\u201cThe attention is a little stressful because I feel that some will misconstrue the meaning of this event and make me look kind of like a moron,\u201d he said on Sunday.If there were any reports of anyone actually shooting their guns at the hurricane, we have not heard them. It seems reason may have prevailed.Not now. Not yet.Late on Sept. 5, the family arrived at Baptist Hospital of Miami. Just after midnight on Sept. 7, Alayna Rae was born, weighing 6 pounds 2 ounces.Three days later, they were discharged. As Hurricane Irma\u2019s final outer bands brought gusts and rain through the Miami suburbs, the streets dark without power and littered with broken branches, they stopped at pharmacies, desperate to fill Ms. Zwally\u2019s prescriptions for Motrin and a painkiller.Just before midnight on Monday, they arrived at the basketball arena at Florida International University, where the Red Cross was housing evacuees from Key West. Ms. Zwally, crippled with pain from the surgery and no medication, grew worried they would be turned away.Jose Tirado, an F.I.U. facilities worker, ran to a nurse in the shelter, asking for advice about how to care for a newborn.

{"Headline": "Why The Times Covers Its Own Industry", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRolling Stone was one of the many magazines that covered my family\u2019s coffee table when I was growing up. Not only was it physically bigger than the others, it also ran weighty articles, about music, entertainment and politics. My dad was a subscriber for 30 years, and I recently asked him how he would describe the magazine in its heyday. \u201cThe bible,\u201d he said.One thing I\u2019ve learned: Covering my own industry can be a tricky business.I am often asked to write about our direct competitors, including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and CNN. Many people at The Times know people at these organizations. Many also used to work at them. But what my colleagues hear over drinks with friends can sometimes be difficult for me to report out. (It\u2019s much easier to talk to friends than reporters!)Because we all work in the same industry and often know the same people \u2014 and because journalists love to grumble \u2014 news and gossip are often intertwined. A question I frequently ask myself (and my editors) is whether a story would interest a general audience. If the answer is no \u2014 for example, if it involves an internal reorganization with little external impact \u2014 then it probably isn\u2019t something I want to cover.And part of my job is reporting on The Times, one of the most influential news organizations in the country. The company happens to pay my salary.Other forms of media, however, are rising in the place of print publications. Platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, which give us information in short, visual chunks, have allowed anyone, not just journalists, to contribute to the news. My colleagues and I can watch live videos on Facebook of protests and rallies from their desks because people are broadcasting the events from their phones, then comb Twitter for reactions around the globe.The constant flow of information has in some ways made our jobs easier. It also means I have to be more discerning. How do I define media? If someone takes a photograph on their iPhone or posts a tweet that then drives a news cycle, do I write about that person? Does anyone?Times of such dramatic transformation underscore why news organizations like The Times cover their own industry: The news media is our window on the world. Chronicling how the news is produced, and how it is consumed, is one way to track history. Rolling Stone influenced a generation. That it can no longer survive on its own suggests that something about our culture has been lost.And I can write about it all with authority because I am experiencing the very things I cover.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Angry Birds Empire: Games, Toys, Movies and Now an I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The digital world is littered with one-hit wonders \u2014 companies that tried to turn a single successful brand into a big-time business only to be eclipsed by changing technology and consumer tastes.The maker of Angry Birds, Rovio Entertainment, hopes to defy that trend.Rovio found success in a smartphone game that pitted a brightly colored feathered flock against an army of green pigs, spawning a series of sequels, a line of toys and clothing, and a feature film. Now, the Finnish company is planning an initial public offering that could value the company at roughly $2 billion, in a test of whether investors will find favor in a single franchise and whether the business can evolve.Rovio helped usher in the rise of smartphone games, building a juggernaut around the Angry Birds brand. In the game, released in 2009, users fling birds at elaborate structures built by pigs that have stolen their eggs.The game\u2019s idiosyncratic concept now has several spinoffs that rank among the most downloaded apps on smartphones and tablets. Rovio\u2019s titles have been downloaded 3.7 billion times, the company said.Rovio has ridden the wave of a rapidly expanding mobile gaming market. The industry\u2019s worldwide revenue was about $16 billion in 2012 and is forecast to top more than $50 billion this year, according to data from SuperData Research, a data provider on the games industry.But Rovio now needs to prove it can profit beyond the success of Angry Birds. Its games business, which includes the original Angry Birds and more than a dozen spinoff titles, accounted for 79 percent of its revenue in the 12 months through June.\u201cThey need to find a way to diversify their brand portfolio in the future,\u201d said Atte Riikola, a research analyst at Inderes in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cThey have had problems in their history when trying to diversify, so it won\u2019t be an easy task to do.\u201dThe company has done a good job creating offshoots of its flagship game, like Bad Piggies and Angry Birds Match. The company has also introduced several non-Angry Birds titles in recent years, including a puzzle game called Fruit Nibblers and a game tied to the pop singer Shakira.\u201cThe hardest part in the app market is to find the users, to get people to download your game,\u201d said Tero Kuittinen, chief strategist at Kuuhubb, a Finnish company focused on lifestyle and mobile video game applications. \u201cIf you have a well-known intellectual property \u2014 you have something that is instantly recognizable, James Bond, \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 any kind of property like that \u2014 it helps you a lot. Why wouldn\u2019t they leverage Angry Birds?\u201dBut it is still unclear whether Rovio has the framework or model to fuel innovation and expand beyond its main brand. The mobile gaming environment is especially competitive.\u201cAt a certain stage, you will need a formula for more efficient innovation success,\u201d said Mark DiMassimo, the chief executive and chief creative officer at the advertising agency DiMassimo Goldstein. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to get to winners faster than other folks, more efficiently than other folks. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be on the losing end of the category.\u201dThe announcement of the public offering marks a turnaround for Rovio, which struggled financially in the years after the initial release of Angry Birds. The company, which started out by selling its games, was caught flat-footed as consumers gravitated to games offered through a so-called freemium model, in which players download the game for free and pay for additional features. Rovio has since switched from paid apps to free downloads of its games.Rovio returned to a profit in 2016 and reported revenue of 191.7 million euros, or about $228 million, last year.Rovio is the latest game maker to turn to the public markets after becoming a cultural phenomenon, following in the footsteps of Zynga and King Digital.The company rose to fame with social games played on Facebook, but it was slow to recognize the move to mobile gaming.

LOUIS \u2014 After hours of mostly peaceful protests over a white former police officer\u2019s acquittal in the fatal shooting of a black man, a crowd of demonstrators gathered in St. Louis Friday night outside the new mayor\u2019s house. Soon, rocks were flying.Four windows broke and red paint was splattered on the outside of the house. Mayor Lyda Krewson was at Police Headquarters watching a protester\u2019s online video of the demonstration, knowing that her family was inside the brick house.No one was hurt, but the episode was a reminder of the immediate and direct challenges Ms. Krewson faces as she leads a city struggling with a high murder rate, diminished by decades of population loss, deeply divided along racial lines and facing day after day of protests.Large groups of protesters have marched repeatedly in the days since the verdict, holding \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs and calling for systemic changes to policing here. Ms. Krewson said she was taking those messages seriously. But she was criticized by some for postponing three town hall meetings that had been scheduled for this week. \u201cIs avoiding personal interactions with her constituents the new definition of \u2018listening\u2019?\u201d one woman wrote on Twitter.Ms. Krewson, who is white and a Democrat, staked her campaign for mayor this year on a promise to curb the violence and heal divisions in St. Louis, a city of 311,000 that has roughly even numbers of black and white residents. She is now engaged in a precarious political balancing act: straining to reassure protesters that she wants to hear and solve their concerns while also condemning lawlessness and standing in support of the police.\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think those two positions are dichotomous,\u201d Ms. Krewson said in an interview at her City Hall office, where in recent days she has watched protesters march on the street below. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to understand what protesters are saying, and also at the same time to support law enforcement.\u201dThat approach, however, has drawn criticism both from police supporters and protesters. Each group sees Ms. Krewson as frustratingly equivocal and insufficiently supportive.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the political capital to bring to a problem like this,\u201d said Mike Jones, a longtime figure in St. Louis politics and a Democrat who serves on the Missouri State Board of Education.Many African-Americans here have said that they feel disrespected and mistreated by the police, and that their opportunities are limited in a region where housing is segregated and where the best jobs and schools are in mostly white neighborhoods. Ms. Krewson has called those issues \u201creal impediments to the success of our city.\u201dStill, some view her as heavy-handed in response to the latest protests and slow to make tangible changes. Tishaura Jones, the city treasurer, who has attended some of the protests in recent days, said Ms. Krewson seemed \u201clike she\u2019s taking the side of the police.\u201dSuch a stance further alienates protesters, said Ms. Jones, who finished second to Ms. Krewson in this year\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary in March.Ms. Krewson, 64, a certified public accountant and the first woman to serve as mayor of St. Louis, took an unlikely path to City Hall. She was elected to the St. Louis board of aldermen in 1997, two years after her husband was killed in an attempted carjacking outside her home.Heather Navarro, who assumed Ms. Krewson\u2019s seat on the board this year, said that the mayor was regarded as a responsive straight-shooter in the ward she represented, a majority-white area west of downtown.\u201cI think, over all, people really, really respect her,\u201d Ms. Navarro said. \u201cShe tends to listen well. She\u2019s really good at dealing with difficult situations and making sure that all sides are heard.\u201dMs. Krewson replaced Francis Slay as mayor, whose 16-year tenure was the longest in city history. \u201cThese are very difficult challenges for any mayor or law enforcement agency,\u201d Mr. Slay said. \u201cThere is no easy way or surefire, textbook approach to addressing them.\u201d He declined to comment further.\u201cTime will tell if we\u2019re able to enact those major policy changes,\u201d said Michael McMillan, chief executive of the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis. \u201cBut I applaud her comments of being measured and trying to bring people together.\u201dMs. Krewson later criticized officers who were reported to have chanted \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!,\u201d a phrase often invoked by protesters, after a night of protests and arrests. But Ms. Krewson also said that, over all, the police had \u201cdone an excellent job.\u201dJeff Roorda, business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association, which endorsed Ms. Krewson and represents rank-and-file officers, said his members were \u201ccolossally disappointed\u201d in the mayor\u2019s rhetoric about the acquittal. \u201cI think she\u2019s been overly sympathetic to a misguided cause,\u201d Mr. Roorda said.Ms. Krewson suggested that her approach \u2014 one embraced neither by protesters nor police officers \u2014 was in fact an asset in these fractious times. \u201cI do understand both sides of this road,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sara Netanyahu, Wife of Israeli Prime Minister, to Face Fraud Charges", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s attorney general said Friday that he intended to bring fraud charges against Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing her of misusing some $100,000 in public funds in her management of the prime minister\u2019s official residence.But the nation\u2019s top prosecutor also closed, citing a lack of evidence, a host of other inquiries into Mrs. Netanyahu. These included allegations that she had used state funds to pay for outdoor furniture and electrical work for the Netanyahus\u2019 private home in Caesarea, had public employees care for her dying father, and improperly redeemed more than $1,000 in bottle deposits for cash.Mrs. Netanyahu, who will have the opportunity to try to block an indictment at a hearing, is accused of conspiring with a member of the prime minister\u2019s staff to conceal the fact that the residence employed a government-paid cook so she could order hundreds of catered meals from expensive restaurants and charge them to the state. Government rules prohibit charging the government for meals when a cook is on the premises.Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he would seek an indictment of Mrs. Netanyahu on charges of aggravated acquisition through fraudulent means, fraud and breach of trust. The most serious charge carries a possible sentence of five years in prison.For an Israeli public that has been riveted by the two-year, consistently leaky corruption investigation of the prime minister, his family and his top aides, the announcement met a fairly muted response. Mrs. Netanyahu has long battled a reputation for cupidity, and she and her husband have frequently turned allegations against them to their political advantage.Mr. Netanyahu posted messages on Facebook calling the accusations against his wife \u201cabsurd.\u201d He assailed the state\u2019s chief witness against her, a former household custodian, as \u201ca serial liar\u201d peddling a \u201cdelusional and mendacious story.\u201d\u201cThe very preoccupation with the food of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who works around the clock on behalf of the state and its security, and the food of his family, is pathetic and obsessive,\u201d he complained. \u201cNo prime minister before was subject to that kind of nosiness, even though the meal expenses of other prime ministers were identical and often far higher.\u201cHow much longer will this obsessive preoccupation with the Netanyahu family go on?\u2019\u201dAnother case involves cutthroat back-room deal making: Mr. Netanyahu was recorded seeking favorable coverage from a newspaper publisher in exchange for curtailing the circulation of a free competitor that is considered supportive of him.\u201cAll the charges that you see now, the fact that Sara is part of the story \u2013 it\u2019s about the gray area between the personal and political, the personal and the national, between the office and the home,\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, a former spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu who leads a right-leaning research group, the Institute for Zionist Strategies. \u201cHis weak point is this gray area. He might find himself out of office only because he thought that it\u2019s not important enough to supervise and take responsibility for what\u2019s happening in those gray areas.\u201dBut Zalman Shoval, a member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party and a former ambassador to the United States, said it would take a weightier case against the prime minister himself to move public opinion. \u201cPeople are beginning to be a bit philosophical about this whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, all will depend at the end of the day on whether there\u2019s something serious in it.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s political opponents were measured in their responses to the attorney general\u2019s announcement.\u201cAs bad as it seems, it doesn\u2019t change the entire picture,\u201d said Nachman Shai, a legislator from the opposition Zionist Union. \u201cHe\u2019s the prime minister. That\u2019s his wife, with all respect. The other cases now have to be investigated. She\u2019s not a political figure, and she doesn\u2019t represent the Likud.\u201dIn a Twitter post, Tzipi Livni, a former justice minister and foreign minister from the Zionist Union, found fault with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Facebook posts, but left the allegations against his wife aside.\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been heard is an appropriate response from a decent prime minister,\u201d she wrote: \u201cI am certain of my wife\u2019s innocence and put my trust in the justice system that the truth will come to light.

Mr. Kiyuna said he plans to take a short break from the industry.Beginning on Oct. 1, Mr. Myint will share the role of chef with Michael Andreatta, who cooked at Commonwealth, a restaurant co-owned by Mr. Myint that donates a portion of its monthly revenue to local nonprofits. The Perennial will continue to promote sustainability through composting and using perennial grains and grass-fed beef.

And he will use other visual puns to make new food that\u2019s playful, communicating his ideas deliciously, without scolding anyone.There will be more of an emphasis on offal, too, Ms. Leibowitz said, because they want to encourage nose-to-tail eating, and lead diners toward a wider range of cuts, served in smaller portions.\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about the reboot of the menu is to think about the potential for food and restaurants to be communicative in the way art is communicative,\u201d Ms. Leibowitz said, \u201cso that people are eating the message more.\u201dBeginning next month, the Perennial will take more inspiration from its owners\u2019 pop-up days, when frequent collaborations with other chefs fueled a series of experimental one-off dinners.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to open a restaurant based on selling only beef tongue, but you could do it for a night,\u201d Mr. Myint said.

{"Headline": "Where Dumplings and Ducks Rule", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City11 PhotosTwo Dungeness crabs face off on the plate, ready to duel. One is battered gold, deep-fried and propped on a rubble of garlic shards; the other has been steamed to a dying-sunset hue and shimmers from a frisk in the wok with ginger, scallions and Shaoxing wine. Only a border of half-moon cucumbers separates them, keeping the peace.A clue here is the people in line for meat at the carving station up front. In the modern, unfussy dining room at the back, nearly every table has a platter of barbecue: glossy ribs whose flesh is swiftly liberated from the bone; duck bathed in spices and hung to dry so that when it\u2019s roasted, the skin turns brittle, translucent and shining, setting off a staccato of pops as it cracks between the teeth.For the lucky ones who call ahead, there is whole suckling pig, wheeled tableside, looking as if it were dipped in bronze. (A waiter told me that another, better-known restaurant in Chinatown buys its suckling pigs from Wu\u2019s and passes them off as its own.)From the fish tanks come the Dungeness crabs and whorls of eel, the flesh fluffy and preening from the heat of the wok. The eel has been tossed with fermented black soybeans \u2014 for salt and an anchoring, earthy bitterness \u2014 and chenpi (dried tangerine peel), a citrus high note at the juncture where bitter shades into sweet.Some of the loveliest dishes are the simplest, like glassine strands of jellyfish, coolly refreshing, with proper crunch and only a hint of chewiness, and a gorgeous mess of creamy scrambled eggs larded with baby shrimp. Snow-pea sprouts, grassy and bright, gain texture and funk from three kinds of eggs: rags of white, broken and set at the last minute; meaty nubs of orange yolk from salted eggs; and black yolks and jellied whites from so-called 1,000-year-old eggs preserved in lye, sulfurous and almost gamy.The menu here, as elsewhere in the neighborhood, is at once encyclopedic in breadth and minimalist in detail \u2014 not particularly helpful, even for the Chinese speakers at my table. Poster-size photographs of dishes hang on the walls, and may guide you to chicken bristling with crispy garlic and shallots, or dried squid in a thatch of chives, with deep-fried silver anchovies showing off frilly little tails that crumble on the tongue.Derek Wu, a native of Guangdong Province in southern China, runs the restaurant with three chefs, one in charge of daytime dim sum, another barbecue, another the rest of the menu. (An older chef, with six decades of experience in Hong Kong, recently retired, but still stops by to check on the kitchen.)Derek suavely handles the floor and the restaurant\u2019s Instagram account, which includes shots of guests like the chefs David Chang and Mario Batali and the occasional menacing Alaskan king crab, with the caption \u201che said: come on buddy.\u201dA spirit of plenty still prevails here. One night, for dessert, we were given mango jelly in which the taste of mango was close to perfume, and pumpkin soup so thick it was practically jelly itself.

This month could determine whether Republicans deliver on any of their big promises before next year\u2019s midterm elections.There is no time to spare: Government funding could run out at the end of September. The debt ceiling could be breached within weeks. And there is that promised rewrite of the tax code.Confidence in the party\u2019s ability to fulfill its ambitions is increasingly shaky.\u201cThere is a big split of private opinion among Republicans about whether you\u2019ll have a tax bill at all,\u201d said Steve Bell, a former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee who now works at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThis will be the messiest September that I\u2019ve seen in the 43 years that I\u2019ve been in Washington.\u201dOne person directing Congress through the mess will be Mr. Ryan, who spent much of August making the case across the country for a tax overhaul. On Thursday, he will shed light on where the effort stands at the inaugural TimesTalks D.C. The public event comes at a pivotal time in the process, as Republicans have promised to release a tax plan this month.Steering the first rewrite of the tax code since 1986 has long been a dream of Mr. Ryan\u2019s, but so far, the process has proved arduous.The health care failure was a major setback to the tax effort, and Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative use of social media has been a distraction for members of his party.During the recess, members of the Trump administration worked with Congress to figure out how deep they can reduce tax rates, which deductions to eliminate and how to make the tax code simpler. Intense battles are expected over state and local tax deductions, possible changes to the mortgage interest deduction, any changes to the tax system that benefit the rich and the treatment of taxes for small \u201cpass through\u201d businesses not subject to the corporate income tax.It remains to be seen whether the eventual tax legislation will be \u201cdeficit neutral\u201d and permanent, or whether Republicans will have to settle for temporary tax cuts that lose revenue. Temporary cuts would be a blow to deficit hawks and a significant scaling back of tax-code overhaul that many business leaders say is needed.Tax-writing committees have been looking at ways to make some parts of the plan temporary and some parts permanent as Republicans continue to assume they will get few, if any, votes from Democrats. For now, they are planning to use the budget reconciliation process, which requires a simple majority in the Senate for passage.But that comes with its own set of complications.The House and Senate have yet to even agree upon a budget resolution, which they must do before they can pass a tax bill. Divisions within the Republican Party make it far from clear that this will be possible.As critical as tax reform is to Republicans, raising the statutory borrowing limit and funding the government are more pressing priorities. At this point, Republicans are considering a three-month continuing resolution to keep the government running and attaching it to a debt ceiling bill. That would buy more time and prevent markets from becoming jittery over the prospect of a shutdown or a default.Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell will probably need the help of some Democrats if fiscal conservatives balk at approving new spending without requisite cuts.With so much to do, Republicans could come under pressure to pass a simple tax cut and declare victory. But with other costs mounting and savings hard to find, that too will be a hard sell for a party that preaches fiscal restraint.\u201cWhile the president and congressional leaders want to turn focus to tax reform, the issues they have to deal with in September will make that more difficult,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\u201cNot just because the time and attention those issues will require will make it harder to focus on tax reform, but they will make it harder to justify tax cuts which increase the deficit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For renters in high-risk areas, or if you know your apartment has flooded in the past, you should consider buying insurance, Ms. Rogan said. (One exception: Apartments below street level are almost never covered by flood insurance for renters.)Where can I buy flood insurance?When looking for a private insurance policy, consider using an independent broker who can get quotes from different companies, Ms. Rogan said.How much does flood insurance cost?It depends on your location.Does my homeowner or renter\u2019s insurance protect me from floods?No. (But always check your individual policy.)\u201cFlooding is one of the most commonly excluded hazards in homeowners insurance policies,\u201d Ms. Rogan said. Water that comes from above (like rain damage to your roof) might be covered, she said, but water that comes from below is typically not covered.Homeowners and renters need to buy separate flood insurance. As a renter, you may be able to buy flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program if you live in an area that participates in the program.Does flood insurance cover water damage from plumbing leaks?Nope.Not under a policy from National Flood Insurance Program, Ms. Rogan said.

{"Headline": "In India, Another Government Critic Is Silenced by Bullets", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Gauri Lankesh, one of India\u2019s most outspoken journalists, was walking into her house on Tuesday night.It was around 8. The night was warm. She was alone.As she stepped through her gate, just feet from her front door, several gunshots rang out.She was killed instantly in what political opposition officials say appears to be yet another assassination of an intellectual who publicly criticized India\u2019s governing party and the Hindu agenda it has pursued. In recent years, at least three other anti-establishment activists have been silenced by bullets.Ms. Lankesh\u2019s death, which monopolized television news coverage on Wednesday, set off protests across India, a country increasingly polarized by supporters of the Hindu nationalist governing party and its detractors.Some of Mrs. Lankesh\u2019s friends say they have no idea who killed her. But among government opponents, the circumstances of the shooting fueled suspicions that governing party backers, emboldened by their leaders to wipe out their enemies, were behind it.Nitin Gadkari, a cabinet minister, said the accusation was \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d The governing party and its affiliates, he said, had \u201cno relation to the murder of Gauri Lankesh.\u201dMs. Lankesh, 55, would rarely back down from a fight, but was also known for her humorous touch.Rana Ayyub, a friend and fellow writer, said that the last time they spoke, about a month ago, Ms. Lankesh was furiously flipping through a dictionary, trying to figure out the proper pronunciation of \u201cnincompoop.\u201d (She planned to use the word against her critics.)\u201cShe was fighting a very unpopular battle with the right wing of India,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Ayyub said, \u201cbut she had this ability to convert everything into satire.\u201dMany people, though, did not find it funny. Ms. Ayyub said Ms. Lankesh had received death threats every day, far too many to count, from different sides of the political equation. Those, too, she did not take seriously, Ms. Ayyub said.\u201cShe didn\u2019t have the faintest idea that somebody could pop bullets into her,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Ayyub said.Ms. Lankesh, who lived by herself in Bengaluru, in southern India, was known as a \u201crationalist\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a term in India for people who stand against superstition and the use of religion in politics.Lately, the rationalists have been pretty busy. Some followers of India\u2019s governing party have attacked Muslims and pushed a hard-line Hindu agenda. But many Indians don\u2019t share this outlook and have tried to fight back, arguing that India is losing its multicultural identity and becoming more of a one-party, Hindu state.S. N. Sinha, president of India\u2019s 28,000-member journalist union and a member of a news oversight council, said the council had gotten many complaints about Ms. Lankesh. \u201cShe used to write very strongly,\u201d Mr. Sinha said. \u201cWe warned her she has to be a little careful in her writing. It wasn\u2019t the content; it was her language.\u201dBut Mr. Sinha was not among Ms. Lankesh\u2019s critics. A free press is taken very seriously in India, especially now, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s getting very stressful,\u201d Mr. Sinha said. \u201cThe followers of the ruling class don\u2019t accept any questioning. They just want you to say what they do is good. If you question them, they don\u2019t accept that.\u201dPolice officials have released little information about Ms. Lankesh\u2019s killing. They say she was shot at point-blank range with a high-caliber pistol as she entered her yard in Bengaluru. Neighbors found her dead from several gunshots to the head and chest, lying on the ground between the front gate and her veranda. Some witnesses reported hearing the sound of a motorcycle or scooter right after the shots.In an interview on television, her brother said the authorities had told him that security cameras had captured images of the killer riding up on a motorcycle and firing. The killer\u2019s face was obscured by a motorcycle helmet.On Wednesday, as Ms. Lankesh was given a state funeral, journalists, activists and students poured into the streets of Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, New Delhi and other cities to express their outrage.Some people shook their fists and chanted slogans. Others marched quietly, with candles, holding up large pictures of Ms. Lankesh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Blocks WhatsApp, Broadening Online Censorship", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has largely blocked the WhatsApp messaging app, the latest move by Beijing to step up surveillance ahead of a big Communist Party gathering next month.The disabling in mainland China of the Facebook-owned app is a setback for the social media giant, whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has been pushing to re-enter the Chinese market, and has been studying the Chinese language intensively. WhatsApp was the last of Facebook products to still be available in mainland China; the company\u2019s main social media service has been blocked in China since 2009, and its Instagram image-sharing app is also unavailable.WhatsApp now appears to have been broadly disrupted in China, even for text messages, Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a Paris-based research start-up, said on Monday. The blocking of WhatsApp text messages suggests that China\u2019s censors may have developed specialized software to interfere with such messages, which rely on an encryption technology that is used by few services other than WhatsApp, he said.\u201cThis is not the typical technical method in which the Chinese government censors something,\u201d Mr. Kobeissi said. He added that his company\u2019s automated monitors had begun detecting disruptions of WhatsApp in China on Wednesday, and that by Monday the blocking efforts were comprehensive.Facebook declined to comment, following past practice when asked about WhatsApp\u2019s difficulties in China.Lokman Tsui, an internet communications specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that WhatsApp seemed to have been severely disrupted starting on Sunday. But he said that some WhatsApp users might still be able to use the service.The Chinese authorities have a history of mostly, but not entirely, blocking internet services, as well as slowing them down so much that they become useless. The censorship has prompted many in China to switch to communications methods that function smoothly and quickly but that are easily monitored by the Chinese authorities, like the WeChat app of the Chinese internet company Tencent, which is based in Shenzhen.\u201cIf you\u2019re only allowed to drive one mile per hour, you\u2019re not going to drive on that road, even if it\u2019s not technically blocked,\u201d Mr. Tsui said.The disruption of WhatsApp comes as Beijing prepares for the Communist Party\u2019s congress, which starts Oct. 18. Held once every five years, the congress chooses the party\u2019s leadership, which in turn runs the country. Next month\u2019s meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinping\u2019s nearly absolute grip on power, but considerable uncertainty remains over who will join him on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the party\u2019s highest-ranking group.Over the past several years, China has not only stepped up censorship but also closed numerous churches and jailed large numbers of human rights activists, lawyers and advocates for ethnic minorities.The shutdown of WhatsApp prompted considerable dismay on Chinese social media.\u201cLosing contact with my clients, forced back to the age of telephone and email for work now,\u201d one user complained on Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging site.\u201cEven WhatsApp is blocked now? I\u2019m going to be out of business soon,\u201d another Chinese social media user said on Weibo.In China, even the use of email is fading as residents embrace the convenience of WeChat. The messaging service, which has 963 million active users, bears some similarities to WhatsApp but has a wider array of features and one crucial difference: close ties to the government. This month, WeChat sent a notice to users reminding them that it complied with official requests for information.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to open online data services and other enhanced telecommunications services to international competition. But it obtained the assent of other W.T.O. members to retain restrictions on the media. Technology multinationals, heavily dependent on the Chinese market, have been reluctant to accuse Beijing of falling short of its W.T.O. commitments.The Office of the United States Trade Representative has opened a formal investigation into whether China is violating the intellectual property of American companies, but it has released few details. The trade office has not said whether the inquiry will include the blocking of products that rely on American intellectual property, or whether it will focus more narrowly on cases in which China has allegedly purloined or otherwise copied it.WhatsApp has a strong reputation among cryptographers for security, which may have been what drew the attention of Chinese censors. The app provides so-called end-to-end encryption, which effectively means that even Facebook does not know what is being said in the text, voice and video conversations passing through its servers.WhatsApp\u2019s video, file sharing and other advanced features rely partly on broadly used internet data transfer protocols, and were disrupted over the summer. But its text messaging function relies on a different, heavily encrypted method for moving data that has seldom been used by companies.The latest disruption of the WhatsApp messaging system suggests that China\u2019s censorship apparatus may have figured out how to target the more uncommon and heavily encrypted data transport protocol as well, Mr. Kobeissi said.Other services provided by American technology companies are available in mainland China. The country tolerates Microsoft\u2019s Skype service for phone calls, which does not provide end-to-end encryption and as a result is easier for governments to monitor. Beijing also allows Apple\u2019s FaceTime service, which has end-to-end encryption but does not have a WhatsApp-like feature allowing users to exchange secret codes \u2014 letting WhatsApp users combat what are known as \u201cman in the middle\u201d attacks.By blocking the heavily encrypted WhatsApp service while making less secure applications like WeChat available to the public, the Chinese government has herded its internet users toward methods of communication that it can reliably monitor.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Loneliness and the College Experience", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Yes, loneliness is a campus scourge. Two Septembers ago, I arrived early outside the class where I was to teach first-year writing at U.C.L.A., only to find my students each standing alone and staring at their phones.I recalled for them my college experience of making friends outside my classes, and I asked how they make friends. One student said, \u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d Later, I learned that another student was eating her meals in her room because she hated being alone in the crowded dining hall.A third student wrote about how social media undermines the very goals it proposes to achieve, linking her library research to her experience of loneliness.Since then, I\u2019ve designed some group assignments. I\u2019ve added an informal meeting space; running into one another there may let them form friendships through proximity.To the Editor:In our world of instant gratification and a head-spinning news cycle, we forget that friendships take time to develop. The first friends you make in college are often friends of convenience \u2014 I\u2019ll be your friend if you\u2019ll be mine so I don\u2019t have to stand here looking like a deer in the headlights. The next set of friends you make are those that develop out of shared interests: classes, clubs, etc. Finally, there are the friends you make and keep who stand the test of time \u2014 you go through the good and the bad with them and still they remain your friends.I have come to this realization having grown up as an immigrant in this country, changing schools with each new phase of life, and, as an adult, moving to new cities with each new job. I developed an inner resilience from each experience that gave me strength to face life\u2019s challenges. So, hang in there, kids!To the Editor:The \u201ccampus scourge\u201d \u2014 loneliness \u2014 described by Frank Bruni would be more aptly described as campus pathos. What else do college freshmen, most of them ostensibly adults, expect?To overcome the discomfort of loneliness, college students might think of their 18-year-old contemporaries on sundry military bases or in battlefields abroad, scolded by their sergeants, who always pretend that these young ones cannot do anything right.After such contemplation the students may take comfort from the fact that they are among the most pampered and highly privileged human beings on the planet. Using loneliness as an excuse for binge drinking is just pathetic.Alas, the most likely response among college boards of trustees and administrators will be to load just one more layer of comfort-providing deans onto the payroll to provide succor to the young people when they are lonely.Before applying to college, every candidate should be required to spend one to two years in a tough job in the real world. They would enter that job as adolescents and emerge from it as adults capable of better appreciating what a privilege a college education is.The writer is a professor of political economy at Princeton.To the Editor:I just sent Frank Bruni\u2019s great column to my nieces and nephews who are just starting college. So many of us judge our internal feelings by the standards of others\u2019 well-curated social media lives. If you looked at my Facebook feed, you would think that I spent every day at the beach this summer. I did not. No one posts about the boring, sad parts of our lives.Going away to college is a very lonely experience. I was very unhappy freshman year, and my parents wanted me to transfer to a college close to home so I could live with them. I am glad I stuck it out. I made lifelong friends in college. I met my husband sophomore year. Equally important, I learned resilience.ELIZABETH WATERS, SAN DIEGOTo the Editor:This \u201ccampus scourge\u201d might reflect the growing number of young people who haven\u2019t had any chance to be lonely, or even rely on their own resources, as they arrive at university from lives filled with activities and little \u201cdown time\u201d without television, social media or other distractions.To the Editor:Thank you, Frank Bruni, for writing that student loneliness on campus is \u201cnormal, survivable and shared by many.\u201dIn my life, I have been especially lonely numerous times, including when I went to college, got my first job, attended graduate school at night, made a career change, moved across the country for my fianc\u00e9e, divorced years later and then moved to try build a new life (twice) to new locations.Each experience presented its own reward, none of which I would have discovered if I had avoided their inherent loneliness.As a society, we\u2019ve coddled ourselves into believing that negative experiences are somehow inferior and should be avoided, when the opposite is true. Learning how to experience negative emotions constructively \u2014 including loneliness \u2014 is essential to anyone planning on having any experiences at all.To the Editor:As Frank Bruni points out, friendship with physically present peers is essential for undergraduate emotional survival and academic success.Chris Takacs and I discovered in research for our book \u201cHow College Works\u201d that face-to-face relationships with other students and caring adults are powerful drivers of engaged learning. Without them, students are all too likely to simply give up and quit.That explains why the best freshman residence halls are the ones often dreaded and reviled by prospective students. They are the ones with shared bathrooms, long, open hallways, centrally located common areas and multistudent rooms, requiring students to meet other students, like it or not.It\u2019s for their own good. The fad at some colleges for \u201capartment-style dorms,\u201d by contrast, lead newcomers to be isolated just when they most need connections. Too often, young people realize too late what may be in their best interest.The writer is a professor of sociology at Hamilton College.To the Editor:My nephew recently began his first year at Purdue University. It has an elaborate orientation program that includes teams of 12 to 15 students. The teams stay together throughout the orientation, including eating meals together. Not all the teams bond, but my nephew\u2019s did. He has instant community. They already had a party together, go rock climbing and swimming together, eat together and watched a movie together. We, his family, are grateful for his connection with new friends.MARY CAPRON, TITUSVILLE, N.J.To the Editor:Having been dropped off at a college 1,800 miles from home, I remember the terror that seized me as I looked around my dorm room. But it was 1965 and you couldn\u2019t even phone home without costing your parents an arm and a leg, let alone FaceTime your best friend from high school.But immersion really worked, and I remember the rush of happiness and confidence I felt as I realized I could overcome my fear and loneliness and make new connections, new loves, new friends. I never thought about how today\u2019s technologies facilitate an unanticipated and involuntary clinging.WROE A. CLARK, DENVERAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Maria Makes Landfall in Dominica as Other Islands Brace for Potential Disaster", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHurricane Maria barreled through the islands that curve through the Caribbean on Monday night as it quickly grew into \u201ca potentially catastrophic Category 5 hurricane\u201d and made landfall in Dominica, the National Weather Service said.With maximum sustained winds of 160 miles per hour, the storm battered the island of 73,000 people. Ham radio operators reported major damage to buildings, according to the hurricane center, and the island\u2019s prime minister said the roof was ripped off his home.Early Tuesday, with Maria\u2019s eye having passed over Dominica, the National Hurricane Center downgraded the storm to Category 4. But its winds had diminished only slightly, and the center warned that it could return to Category 5 as it approached the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.Residents throughout the Caribbean were preparing for yet another potentially disastrous storm.On Monday, she was bracing for Hurricane Maria, which was heading straight for the island that she and hundreds of others had escaped to for sanctuary, Guadeloupe.\u201cThis year we are cursed,\u201d Ms. Guyard, 28, said after a morning of last-minute grocery shopping as the hurricane approached. \u201cWhen will we be able to breathe again? When will all of the hurricanes stop?\u201dReal-time map showing the position and forecast for Hurricane Maria, and the storm\u2019s impact in Puerto Rico.More than two dozen people were killed by Irma, and on Monday emergency shelters were beginning to fill up on Guadeloupe, Dominica and Montserrat, as well as on the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis. Those who chose to stay home were busy boarding up their houses, trimming trees or gathering stockpiles of food and water.Karine Fleury, 47, a psychologist in Martinique, which was also expected to be hit by Maria, said she found out about the storm only on Sunday while shopping for groceries. After that, it was a race to prepare herself \u2014 both physically and mentally \u2014 for the storm\u2019s landing.\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be impressive during the storm,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when we go out for the first time afterward, seeing the fallen trees and the damage, it\u2019s always scary.\u201dBut the already storm-battered islands could be affected in other ways. In addition to being the main sanctuary for those evacuating St. Martin, Guadeloupe has also become the staging ground for the relief effort. If the storm hits hard, it could delay or upend the desperately needed aid going to its neighbor.A string of extreme events has brought new focus to a familiar question: Is climate change to blame?Though the number of hurricanes passing through the Caribbean feels exceptional this year, experts say it is not unheard-of. Ten years ago, Hurricanes Karl, Igor and Julia were all active at the same time. In 1998, four hurricanes \u2014 Georges, Ivan, Jeanne and Karl \u2014 passed through the Atlantic at once, according to the hurricane research division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Still, the number of serious storms this year is higher than average.\u201cNone of this is unusual in terms of the number; we are in the peak week of the peak month in what was forecast to be an active season,\u201d said Dennis Feltgen, an agency spokesman. \u201cWhat is horrific is the succession of Category 4 Harvey, Category 4 and 5 Irma and now\u201d Maria.A typical season has 12 named storms, six of which become hurricanes, with three of those becoming major hurricanes. So far this season, which is more than halfway through, there have been 13 named storms, including seven hurricanes, four which have been major.The constant threat of storms has created a state of agitation among some residents \u2014 and some resistance to making the necessary preparations.\u201cWe\u2019re tired of this,\u201d lamented Stan Musquer, 44, an artist in Guadeloupe who says he has been evacuated three times in his life, forced to move all of his belongings ahead of storms that did not strike as badly as anticipated. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of this. It\u2019s stressful.\u201dLocal authorities across the region have implored residents to take the warnings seriously. Having suffered season after season of hurricanes, they are fearful residents will shrug off yet another storm. Mr. Skerrit, Dominica\u2019s prime minister, addressed the tiny nation Monday morning, asking residents to remain calm but be prepared.\u201cI want to say to Dominicans that this is not a time for heroism,\u201d he said. \u201cThis much water in Dominica is dangerous given our terrain, and therefore persons should not wait for something to happen in order to take action.\u201dPreparation for many Caribbean islanders has, by now, become second nature.\u201cI stocked up as much as possible with fresh water and dried foods,\u201d said Michele Henderson, a musician on Dominica. \u201cI secured my dogs, rabbits and chickens. We boarded up the windows and we are hunkered down in our basement apartment.\u201dOthers said that while they were not worried, they were still taking the proper precautions.\u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of hurricanes and know what to expect,\u201d said Melissa Roberts, 36, on Dominica. \u201cYou stay home, buckle down and wait for it to clear.\u201d\u201cAfter Hugo, my house was full of glass and coconuts,\u201d said Susan Edgecombe, who runs Tradewinds Real Estate on the island and recalled the attitude that existed before that hurricane in 1989. \u201cEveryone said: \u2018There\u2019s not been a hurricane in over 60 years. Don\u2019t stress.\u2019\u201d\u201cYeah right,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get power for over three months, so now I am the prep queen.\u201dOn the island of Antigua, which Hurricane Irma skirted while destroying nearby Barbuda, Dr. Jillia Bird, an optometrist, said she had once again gone through her familiar pre-hurricane motions, closing storm shutters, moving items off the floor in case of flooding, covering beds with shower curtains and towels to prevent soaking, packing up valuables and moving from her wooden house to her mother\u2019s storm-tested 60-year-old concrete house.Dr. Bird also chilled her merlot \u2013 \u201cin case of power loss,\u201d she said \u2013 and found time for an act of generosity toward friends of hers in the British Virgin Islands, which was slammed by Hurricane Irma: She bought credit for their cellphones, \u201cas a kindness gesture as they face another difficult night,\u201d she said.In St. Kitts and Nevis, the storm has particularly cruel timing, landing on the eve of the 34th anniversary of the island\u2019s independence. The good news for residents there, however, was that most of them had already prepared for Irma, and so had less to do to prepare for Maria.\u201cWell, following the recent passage of Hurricane Irma, I still have most things in place, like candles, flashlight with batteries and important items in plastic bags,\u201d said Precious Mills, a resident. \u201cI would say that I have basic measures in place to weather the storm.\u201dWhile the island escaped largely unscathed from Irma, some homes sustained damage. For John Webster, who lives in the affected area of Newton Ground, that means the patchwork fixes he made to his roof after Irma will have to do for now.\u201cI had planned to properly fix it, but I am going to wait until this storm has passed,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Coline Racloz from Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, Guadeloupe; Garvin Richards from Roseau, Dominica; Nerissa Golden from Olveston, Montserrat; Loshaun Dixon from Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis; Carl Joseph from St. John, Antigua and Barbuda; and Matthew Haag from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Bucket Bomb\u2019 Strikes London\u2019s Vulnerable Underground", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBREAKINGLONDON \u2014 Alex Ojeda-Sierra, 13, was on the train to school with a friend when they heard screaming and saw passengers running past.Unknown to the boys, a bomb had exploded in another car.\u201cI dropped my bag and we started running,\u201d Alex, who attends the London Oratory School, said from a wheelchair at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where he was treated for facial bruises and sprains when he tripped in the panicky crush of fleeing commuters.\u201cOne man fell on me and I had my legs bent backwards and my right ankle got twisted, and I started screaming that I had no air,\u201d he said.The bomb, wrapped in a plastic grocery bag concealed in a bucket, exploded at 8:20 a.m. Friday at the height of the morning rush. The explosion and panic left 29 people injured, but none were killed.The Islamic State asserted responsibility for the bucket bomb hours later in a message on its Amaq news site that said a \u201cdetachment\u201d of its disciples had carried out the attack \u2014 language that suggested more than one assailant.Prime Minister Theresa May, calling the blast a \u201ccowardly attack,\u201d said the national threat level had been raised a notch to \u201ccritical,\u201d the highest.The attack revived the specter of mass casualties from terrorism on the London Underground, commonly known as the Tube, the world\u2019s oldest subway system and one of the busiest. Though one would-be attacker tried to bomb an Underground train last year, the device failed to detonate.The most recent attackers in London, and across Europe, have instead used vans and cars as weapons to crush and maim people.The head of security on the Underground at the time of the 2005 attacks, Geoff Dunmore, said it was unsurprising that terrorism had returned to the Underground.\u201cYou can do an awful lot to make it safer but you can never totally secure it because of the very nature of it,\u201d said Mr. Dunlop, who left the Underground in 2013 and now works as a private security consultant. \u201cIt has to be open.\u201dWitnesses on the train described a tremor, a wave of heat and then a barrage of flames that quickly dissipated.\u201cThe train was packed, and I was down the other side of the carriage standing up, looking at my phone and then I heard a big boom and felt this heat on my face,\u201d said Natalie Belford, 42, a hairdresser and beautician who was on the train. \u201cI ran for my life, but there was no way out. The doors were full of people and the carriage was too packed to move down.\u201dLondon\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, a face of resolve following the earlier attacks, issued a defiant statement on Facebook that hinted at how terrorist attacks had become a new normal in the capital.\u201cOur city utterly condemns the hideous individuals who attempt to use terror to harm us and destroy our way of life,\u201d Mr. Khan wrote. \u201cAs London has proven again and again, we will never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism.\u201dThe police were combing through the extensive CCTV footage that blankets all Underground stations, with particular attention to the handful of stations to the west of Parsons Green.It was unclear by Friday night whether any possible suspects had been identified from CCTV surveillance.\u201cThe police will also ask witnesses the age-old question: Did anyone see what happened?\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be investigating what the detonation mechanism was and going through CCTV footage to see who might be behind it.\u201dThe device did not appear to have detonated properly, as the bucket, the bag and a series of wires all remained intact even after the explosion.Many of the victims seemed to have been hurt by the panicked rush to escape, rather than by the explosion itself. Ms. Belford, the hairdresser, said she was knocked over twice, and showed a reporter her ripped tights and bloodied knee.While Londoners are largely hardened to terrorism and determined to defy the threat, Uber use in West London surged to three times its normal rate after the attack, the company said. But it was unclear whether passengers were turning to the ride service out of fear or practicality; part of the Underground system was suspended after the bombing.Lorna Fletcher, a resident of the Parsons Green neighborhood, said she already tried to avoid using the subway precisely because of the possibility of this kind of danger.\u201cAt the weekends I always try and get my friends to come out here \u2014 that way I don\u2019t have to travel far and it\u2019s not playing on the back of mind,\u201d Ms. Fletcher said. \u201cIt was only a matter of a time before the trains would get attacked.\u201dThe suburban setting of the attack, several miles west of downtown London, set off debate about whether the bomb had been mistakenly detonated prematurely \u2014 or was meant to highlight how no part of the city is safe.\u201cParsons Green is not emblematic or symbolic, and I think that will be a puzzlement for investigating officers, who will ask: Was it intended to be detonated or did it go off there by accident?\u201d Mr. Ramm said. \u201cIf you look at a list of target areas in London, Parsons Green would not be in the top 100.\u201dLocal residents echoed Mr. Ramm\u2019s surprise. \u201cMy American friends just moved out here with their children because we told them it was one of the safest parts of London. I feel foolish now,\u201d said Rachel Palmer, 34, a mother of two. \u201cI just never imagined it would happen out here.\u201dTensions were heightened in the neighborhood after the police sealed off several nearby streets and buildings, including Lady Margaret\u2019s school for girls, where students were kept under lockdown for hours.Life nevertheless continued largely as normal across most other parts of London. While the 2005 attacks led to a shutdown of large parts of the subway network, only a small section close to Parsons Green was suspended on Friday. Large crowds of tourists gathered outside Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the queen, Elizabeth II.Hugh Coyne, a doctor at a medical practice near the station, said he went to the scene to offer help to emergency workers, only to be told there were no major injuries to treat.Mrs. May said Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was unhelpful, and the Metropolitan Police said it was \u201cpure speculation.\u201dAfter a terrorist attack in Manchester this summer, American officials angered their British counterparts by leaking information shared with them by the British police.In June, Mr. Trump was also entangled in a separate spat with the London mayor, Mr. Khan, in which he criticized Mr. Khan\u2019s response to an attack on London Bridge that left seven dead.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a transportation security consultant. He is Geoff Dunmore, not Dunlop.Reporting was contributed by David D. Kirkpatrick, Dan Bilefsky, Iliana Magra and Rod Nordland from London, and Rukmini Callimachi from New York.Advertisement"}

How? Tell us in the comments._________BackgroundBorn with several genetic abnormalities, 10-year-old August Pullman, called Auggie, dreams of being \u201cordinary.\u201d Inside, he knows he\u2019s like every other kid, but even after 27 surgeries, the central character of \u201cWonder\u201d bears facial disfigurations so pronounced that people who see him for the first time do \u201cthat look-away thing\u201d \u2014 if they manage to hide their shock and horror.\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s probably worse,\u201d he says of his face as the book begins. He\u2019s used to the stares and mean comments, but he\u2019s still terrified to learn that his parents have gotten him into middle school at Beecher Prep and want him to go there rather than be home-schooled. But they persuade him to give it a try \u2014 and by the time this rich and memorable first novel by R. J. Palacio is over, it\u2019s not just Auggie but everyone around him who has changed.The book, originally marketed as a middle-grade novel, went on to draw the attention of teenage and adult readers as well. \u201cWonder\u201d reminds us that disability is not only about distress. It is about the triumphs, the resilience and the many gifts of love that make life work, no matter our experiences. As Ms. Russo observes in her review, \u201cPerhaps Palacio\u2019s most remarkable trick is leaving us with the impression that Auggie\u2019s problems are surmountable in all the ways that count \u2014 that he is, in fact, in an enviable position.\u201dBut nothing changes a disabled person\u2019s sense of self like another disabled person. I am a painter, and in 1995, I was invited to join a group of artists, writers and performers who were building disability culture. Their work was daring, edgy, funny and dark; it rejected old tropes that defined us as pathetic, frightening and worthless. They insisted that disability was an opportunity for creativity and resistance._________Key Questions\u2022 What assumptions do we make about people who have disabilities?\u2022 To what extent is our personal happiness determined by internal rather than external factors?_________Activity Sheets_________Does August see how other people see him, or has he gotten so good at pretending not to see that it doesn\u2019t bother him? Or does it bother him? When he looks in the mirror, does he see the Auggie Mom and Dad see, or does he see the Auggie everyone else sees? Or is there another August he sees, someone in his dreams behind the misshapen head and face? Sometimes when I looked at Grans, I could see the pretty girl she used to be underneath the wrinkles. I could see the girl from Ipanema inside the old-lady walk. Does August see himself as he might have looked without that single gene that caused the catastrophe of his face?I wish I could ask him this stuff. I wish he would tell me how he feels. He used to be easier to read before the surgeries. You knew that when his eyes squinted, he was happy. When his mouth went straight, he was being mischievous. When his cheeks trembled, he was about to cry. He looks better now, no doubt about that, but the signs we used to gauge his moods are all gone. There are new ones, or course. Mom and Dad can read every single one. But I\u2019m having trouble keeping up. And there\u2019s part of me that doesn\u2019t want to keep trying: why can\u2019t he just say what he\u2019s feeling like everyone else? He doesn\u2019t have a trache tube in his mouth anymore that keeps him from talking. His jaw\u2019s not wired shut. He\u2019s ten years old. He can use his words. But we circle around him like he\u2019s still the baby he used to be. We change plans, go to plan B, interrupt conversations, go back on promises depending on his moods, his whims, his needs. But he needs to grow up now. We need to let him, help him, make him grow up. Here\u2019s what I think: we\u2019ve all spent so much time trying to make August think he\u2019s normal that he actually thinks he\u2019s normal. And the problem is, he\u2019s not._________I was inspired to take matters into my own hands and write a book of my own, starring a girl with a disability. I knew exactly what genre of book I wanted to write. I\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cgreat children\u2019s literature\u201d that was somber or tragic. My friends and I have loved the Cupcake Diaries series, paperbacks with pink covers that described four best friends and their adventures together, making cupcakes. Not exactly heavy stuff, but fun to read. I wanted to write something like the Cupcake Diaries, but starring a middle-school girl with a disability and her filmmaking adventures with her best friends. Instead of making cupcakes, they would make special-effect YouTube videos.My older sister Eva helped me set up a Kickstarter campaign to hire an editor. We wrote the first draft of the book, called \u201cMia Lee Is Wheeling Through Middle School,\u201d and found a literary agent. Using our money from our Kickstarter campaign, we hired someone to help us edit our draft into a polished copy, then sent it out to publishing houses.When the responses started to come in, they were almost all the same: For a girl who was in a wheelchair with a degenerative nerve disease, Mia Lee was just too happy.\u201cI keep expecting more from the plotline than what\u2019s currently here,\u201d one publisher wrote. \u201cWhat if it was about sisters who were twins, and one had Charcot-Marie-Tooth and one didn\u2019t? That would create a more important conflict.\u201d Another said that Mia Lee\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem suited for a lighthearted story. Finally, my agent told me, \u201cI just don\u2019t think people are ready for this type of story for this type of character.\u201dWhat she meant is that Mia Lee, my sassy, YouTube-loving heroine, differed too much from the convention of what a disabled kid is supposed to be like. There are very few stories about kids in wheelchairs, and there are even fewer with a disabled person who is cheerful and happy. Disability is always seen as a misfortune, and disabled characters are simply opportunities to demonstrate the kindness of the able-bodied protagonists._________For Writing and Discussion_________Going Further_________Was I nice? I think somewhere in between nice and not nice is where many people are. It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have told me that they identify with the book not because they have experienced bullying, but because when they were younger they remember that there were times when they could\u2019ve been nicer.Consider your own life. Where do you fall \u201cin between nice and not nice\u201d? Write a journal entry using specific examples from your life to investigate the answer to this question.___________________________It turns out that we are hard-wired to seek and make friends in novel, stressful circumstances. Students naturally assemble themselves into elaborate social networks \u2014 and not just Snapchat, Tumblr, Facebook or Twitter. Our modern technology is merely put into the service of more ancient and powerful impulses.___________________________Here is what we have so far, and the collection is always growing:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Irma\u2019s Fearsome Winds Reach Florida Shores, With Full Strike Yet to Come", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter plowing a path of destruction through the Caribbean and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee in one of the largest evacuations in American history, Hurricane Irma began to maul southern Florida on Saturday and was poised to howl up its west coast Sunday with deadly force and fury.The storm\u2019s eye was on track to hit the Lower Keys early Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 a.m. Eastern advisory.The time to gather supplies was over, and in most of the region, it was getting too late to run. The Florida Keys faced a potentially catastrophic brew of winds reaching 130 miles an hour and a storm surge that threatened to drown whole islands. By Saturday evening, the ocean around Key West was spilling into hotel parking lots and onto roads, while tornadoes rumbled like freight trains through Palm Beach and Broward Counties.On the Gulf Coast, a late westward turn in the forecast had put Naples, Fort Myers and the heavily populated peninsulas of Tampa Bay directly in Irma\u2019s track. Officials who had earlier expected a lighter blow from the storm spent the day frantically turning schools and other fortified buildings into shelters as fast as evacuees could wedge into them. Shelters opened. They filled. More opened. More filled. Long lines outside were bulging with suitcases, light furniture, pet carriers and jitters.By Saturday more than six million Floridians had been ordered to leave or get to shelters, though as in any storm, not everyone was heeding the warning.\u201cIf you have been ordered to evacuate, you need to leave now,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott said at a news conference. \u201cThis is your last chance to make a good decision.\u201dIn Miami, the storm was announcing its soggy might with periods of heavy rain, electricity that wobbled in and out and gusts strong enough to make walking difficult. Around the state, more than 100,000 people had already lost power.Even when the rain and winds quieted down, Irma found another way to make noise: A National Weather Service alert blared from cellphones in parts of Miami-Dade County just after 7:30 p.m., warning of potential tornadoes.But officials emphasized that the greatest danger lay in the water. Mr. Scott said the storm surge could reach 15 feet in places. \u201cDo not think the storm is over when the wind slows down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe storm surge will rush in, and it could kill you.\u201dOver the previous few days, Irma had already reduced a string of Caribbean islands nearly to rubble. It had killed at least 25 people by the time it made landfall in Cuba Friday night as a Category 5, trampling directly through the island\u2019s northern coast.The hurricane was downgraded to Category 3 as it moved away from Cuba on Saturday, but gained strength and was reclassified as Category 4 early Sunday as its eye approached the Florida Keys.With phone lines cut, there was little word yet of how coastal Cuba\u2019s residents or tourist businesses \u2014 a significant economic driver \u2014 had fared. Residents in the central provinces of Camag\u00fcey and Ciego de \u00c1vila awoke Saturday to see whole houses destroyed, roofs ripped off warehouses and downed trees scattered around like so many matchsticks.Elsewhere, the power had gone out, while the coastal town of Caibari\u00e9n was under several feet of water. The post-storm outlook was not encouraging: For one thing, most people in small coastal communities live in one-story buildings.In Florida, unlike the Caribbean, many buildings are constructed to withstand powerful hurricanes. But if the projections for the storm hold, cities all along Florida\u2019s west coast will confront storm surges that could inundate whole neighborhoods.In recent days, the projected path of the storm bounced between Florida\u2019s east and west coasts. By Saturday, however, the models were converging, pointing to the area between Naples and St. Petersburg.For officials and residents up and down the Gulf Coast, it was time to make new plans.In Collier County, which includes Naples, last-minute evacuation orders went out on Friday and Saturday. All of Collier\u2019s more than two dozen shelters had filled by Saturday afternoon, prompting officials to open two more, though they warned arrivals to bring their own supplies and leave pets behind. They were still searching for more shelters in the evening.Space was so tight that in one flood-prone area, county officials told people living in two-story homes to stay put.\u201cWe thought we were safe like 36 hours ago,\u201d said a Naples Police Department official who declined to be identified because the official was not authorized to discuss the situation.More than 390 shelters had opened across the state, receiving more than 72,000 people, and more were opening on Saturday night to try to meet demand. Mr. Scott asked for volunteers to help at special-needs shelters.\u201cAll available nurses, if you\u2019ll please respond,\u201d he said at the news conference.Sherrie Webber, 64, and her husband, who live in nearby Pinellas Park, arrived at the school with a chaise longue to sleep on and the heart medication she has been taking since her open-heart surgery a year ago. It was her first time being forced to evacuate in 46 years of living there.\u201cMy husband retires in May,\u201d she said, frustrated by the timing. \u201cWe\u2019re moving to Washington State. So I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting this to happen now.\u201dAs of Saturday night, 29 hospitals, 239 assisted-living facilities and 56 other health care facilities in the state have been evacuated, according to Jason Mahon, a public information officer at the Florida State Emergency Operations Center.The storm is so vast, stretching more than 300 miles, and so powerful, with winds reaching 130 miles an hour, that virtually no place in southern Florida could be considered completely out of danger.But one of the most imperiled parts of the state was the Keys, the string of pearls dangling for more than 100 miles from the state\u2019s southern tip.Forecasters said hurricane-force winds would begin hitting the Keys by daybreak Sunday. Those who had ignored orders to evacuate could only hunker down and hope for the best behind hurricane-impact windows, metal storm curtains or hastily built plywood barriers.\u201cThis is the big one, the hurricane we have all feared,\u201d said Roman Gastesi, the county administrator for Monroe County, which encompasses the Keys.Even the county\u2019s emergency operations center was forced to flee its Marathon headquarters Saturday. Most of the staff went to the Ocean Reef resort in Key Largo, said the county spokeswoman, Cammy Clark.At the Key West Bed and Breakfast, Jody Carlson and the six people on their way to ride out the storm with her could do little more than trust in the Bahamian shipbuilders who built her three-story wooden guesthouse at least 120 years ago. Up until Saturday morning, she had been convinced Key West would be spared.Then she checked the latest advisory. \u201cI started feeling a little queasy,\u201d said Ms. Carlson, who has lived in Key West for more than 40 years and weathered past hurricanes \u2014 though none this strong. \u201cHad I known it was going to change, and not head north, I would have left. But now there are no gas stations open. There are no hotel rooms, I\u2019m sure. I have a dog and a cat. And my cat screams every time he\u2019s with the dog.\u201dSome Floridians were given no choice but to clear out.About 400 homeless people who live in a community of cabins and tents in a low-lying parcel of land near St. Petersburg, which has a sizable homeless population, had to leave after a mandatory evacuation order.In Miami, the police invoked the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to institutionalize people if they pose a danger to themselves, to force the city\u2019s homeless into shelters.Meanwhile, the preparations drummed on. The mayors of Miami and the city of Miami Beach issued curfews starting Saturday evening. All along Interstate 75, the major north-south artery on the Gulf Coast, workers had lowered the lighting fixtures that normally sit atop high steel poles, so they would offer less resistance to the wind and have a better chance of surviving.Brig. Gen. Ralph Ribas of the Florida National Guard said that more than 7,000 troops were positioned around the state and would be ready to move once the winds died down to tropical storm levels.Because the storm was so vast, the Coast Guard positioned its response force in New Orleans. It also declared \u201cCondition Zulu\u201d at the Tampa, St. Petersburg and other major ports, forcing the suspension of all activity there.The images of Irma\u2019s rampage through the Caribbean, just after Hurricane Harvey swamped Texas, seemed to add to the anxiety.With Hurricane Irma expected to move up the west coast of the Florida and then to Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, it was difficult to judge how many people in the Southeast might be left on their own, and for how long.Officials said people in the direct path of the storm should have two weeks of supplies. But in the days before landfall, there was a run on basic goods, with shelves picked clean of water and many gas stations left with only fumes. By Saturday night, people had to make do with what they had.Once the hurricane moves on, Keys residents who stayed could find themselves cut off from the mainland \u2014 and from food, gas and other supplies \u2014 if any one of their 42 bridges is damaged.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Natasha\u2019s Week in Review: Tech Tackles Trump, Again", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFor weeks, executives from across the business world, including tech, had been pushing the president to renege on his pledge to undo DACA \u2014 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children to remain here legally. This week Trump ignored them and went ahead with his plan to undo DACA anyway, which prompted a lot of impassioned outrage from the tech companies.And yet, there was a kind of kabuki aspect to the whole thing \u2014 a feeling that all this was all going according to what has become a kind of script for Trump-tech relations. Trump does something, the tech industry condemns it, Trump ignores them, then we all move on to the next thing. For some of the most powerful companies in the world, the tech giants sure do seem powerless to get the president to do what they want, don\u2019t they?But I see a related big issue here for the tech industry: trust in the data economy.It seems to me the fate of the DACA database will not only give us clues about whether the Trump administration intends to use data as a weapon to further disenfranchise the already disenfranchised. It could also impact consumers\u2019 trust in the popular online services that are stockpiling their personal data.What this all means is pretty hazy. It could be that these ads were part of a Russian influence campaign aimed at changing votes during the election. Facebook is cooperating with investigators, so we may learn more at some point in the future. But this could all be disconnected from any alleged Russian plan to get Trump elected. For one thing, the ad buy is pretty small, and some of the ads were purchased even before Trump was in the running. Who knows?To me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we\u2019re learning about it 10 months after the election. Facebook was at the center of the postelection controversy over \u201cfake news\u201d and other shenanigans meant to monkey with the vote. So why did it take the company so long to figure this out? And should we take that to mean there\u2019s a lot more icky that happened on Facebook around the election that it still hasn\u2019t found?But back to your question on why it took Facebook so long to figure out that a Kremlin-linked group had bought ads on the social network.Is the latest news on the Russian ad buy indicative of a larger problem of weak Facebook oversight of its advertising system?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Facebook\u2019s Troubles, Message to Advertisers Stays Consistent", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI want to start off with our mission,\u201d Carolyn Everson, the vice president of global marketing solutions at Facebook, said this week as she faced a crowd of marketers from the stage of a theater in Times Square. Ms. Everson was there to extol the potential of video advertising on Facebook site and its apps during the annual industry confab known as Advertising Week New York.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better example of what happens when you have power of community and the combination of scaled global platforms than what happened recently with the hurricane,\u201d Ms. Everson said.Absent from Ms. Everson\u2019s presentation \u2014 and others that Facebook executives used to urge advertisers to spend more on apps like Instagram and Facebook Messenger \u2014 was any discussion of the recent crises the social network has been grappling with: the misuse of its ad tools.\u201cSometimes our industry gets so enamored with new things that we lose sight of unintended consequences,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cData and personalization is one of those things. It can be used for phenomenal targeting of potential consumers to buy cookies, toys and book hotel rooms, but it also can be used to target hate groups and inspire nefarious outcomes.\u201dShe added, \u201cWhether they like it or not, media companies have a tremendous responsibility to protect the public from itself.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any clients question their investments in Facebook in response to the news, and I think the main reason for that is that no brands were directly or indirectly harmed by this activity,\u201d said Aaron Shapiro, chief executive of the digital ad agency Huge. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something the marketing community is monitoring very carefully, because certainly, if it becomes a big enough issue where public association with Facebook starts to become negative, that\u2019s a totally different story where advertisers would have to pay attention.\u201dRaja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer of Mastercard, said that although he was confident that digital platforms would do their best to fix their issues, their unparalleled size made the point essentially moot. \u201cI cannot block them off and say I don\u2019t want to deal with them anymore because they\u2019ve got a huge reach and that reach matters to me and it is very economical reach, too,\u201d he said of Facebook.Still, it is very likely that Facebook \u2014 and Google \u2014 will need to do more to show advertisers that they are policing abuse and that their ads actually deliver.\u201cThe burden of proof that they are effective rises with every misstep on the social or political spectrum,\u201d said Rob Norman, the chief digital officer of GroupM, the media-buying arm of the ad giant WPP.Google and Facebook are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly\u201d within the ad industry; the research firm eMarketer projects that the two companies will collectively take in 63 percent of all digital ad investments in the United States this year.Mr. Norman raised regulation as a possibility that could affect the dominance of the companies. He mused about the possibility of regulators saying \u201cthat targeted advertising of cohorts of let\u2019s say, less than a million people, is now illegal.\u201d A regulator could potentially argue that \u201cthe moment you can get it down to incredibly granular population groups, that\u2019s where the bad actions start to take place,\u201d he said.There are also questions around how Facebook will handle disclosure of ads, for political and nonpolitical causes, going forward.While advertising has \u201cperennially been misused in political campaigns,\u201d the anonymity associated with the Russian ads on Facebook makes it newly dangerous, said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and partner of the agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.\u201cWhat would stop any of our clients from going out and doing this now?\u201d Mr. Goodby said. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility to just go out there and flood social media with things that are anonymous, seemingly innocent expressions of opinion, which is what we\u2019re addicted to. But it\u2019s interesting to think about what happens if we\u2019re being manipulated by that \u2014 the very thing we\u2019re addicted to suddenly becomes like a heroin, it hurts us suddenly, people use it against us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Many Medical Students, the Caribbean Was Warm and Welcoming. Until Now.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs other forms of communication went dark, the Facebook appeals sailed out like messages in a bottle. The school set up a hotline for parents to call, but it was constantly busy.On Tuesday afternoon, Ross\u2019s dean said university officials were still struggling to determine the whereabouts of many students and faculty, and were reaching out to the United States and Canadian governments for help.\u201cI\u2019m a concerned parent waiting on information about my son,\u201d one woman, Marina Agadzi, wrote on the Facebook page on Tuesday. \u201cLast I heard from him was 1645 pm yesterday then lost contact.\u201dAnother parent, Yamirka Machin, said she had been praying for all of the medical students and begged, \u201cWe are desperate without any news.\u201dFor the Caribbean schools\u2019 students, it is often a triumph and a relief to be accepted into any medical school at all \u2014 and a welcome bonus if that school happens to be in a tropical paradise. But in this season of one deadly hurricane after another, for some students that paradise has turned into a version of hell.Maria came days after Hurricane Irma hit St. Martin, causing the military evacuation of hundreds of people from another medical school, the American University of the Caribbean. Both Ross and American are part of Adtalem Global Education, formerly known as DeVry Education Group, a for-profit educational company with headquarters near Chicago.If the hurricane damage prevents the schools from rebuilding quickly or students from graduating on time, it could be devastating both to the universities and to the financial and career prospects of their students, many of whom have taken out huge loans.As Irma\u2019s eye passed over St. Martin last week, Chris Glynn, 32, a student at American, said he opened the door to his apartment to find several classmates huddled in the hall. Their balcony doors and roof had been ripped off.The group waited out the rest of the storm in his back room. Mr. Glynn, who was evacuated by military plane along with his wife and 3-year-old daughter, is now just hoping he will be able to start the semester in time to take the test that will qualify him to be matched for a residency at a United States hospital.\u201cIf not,\u201d he said by phone Tuesday from his in-laws\u2019 home in Pittsburgh, \u201cit would be a lost year.\u201dThere are dozens of medical schools in the Caribbean, and some of the more established ones, like Ross and St. George\u2019s in Grenada, have better reputations than others. Most are for-profit, and they serve their students by pointing them toward high-demand positions like primary care in rural and poor urban areas.Their tuition is comparable to or even higher than at United States schools, and their students often graduate with more debt than their mainland counterparts. Some Caribbean schools have used their cash to pay United States hospitals to reserve clinical training spots for their students during their third and fourth years of medical school.They have faced fierce resistance from American medical schools, who have argued that the Caribbean schools provide inferior education, and have also guarded their turf by trying to block students of offshore schools from the clinical rotations they need to graduate.Dr. William Owen, Ross\u2019s dean and chancellor, said in a statement that the school was providing updates to families as quickly as it could, but was still trying to \u201cconfirm the safety of our people, provide supplies and shelter, and ultimately evacuate our community.\u201dA woman who answered the hurricane hotline for another school in Dominica, All Saints University School of Medicine, said the power and phone lines were down, but that so far, there had been no reports of injuries among people associated with the school.On St. Martin, the American University of the Caribbean suffered only minor damage from Hurricane Irma, Dr. Heidi Chumley, the executive dean, said Tuesday.She said that the university hoped to continue the semester later this month at a temporary location in Britain.Students who were evacuated from the island last week were shocked by the severity of the storm and felt lucky to get away.Daniel-Mario Larco, 25, had left his off-campus apartment to take shelter on campus, and went to sleep in a classroom with fellow students. He was awakened in the early morning and told to go to the auditorium. Through the small windows, he said, \u201call you could see was a white sheet of water.\u201dThey were there for more than six hours, Mr. Larco said.The rest of the island, he knew, had it much worse. On campus, running water was soon restored, and the kitchen was working. But when he ventured out to return to his apartment, he found it flattened.\u201cEveryone kept telling me, hey, it\u2019s completely damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see it, it\u2019s different.\u201dHe gathered a few items of clothing he saw scattered on the ground and headed back to campus. A military plane flew the students to Puerto Rico.It was not the first time that the United States government has had to evacuate Americans from a Caribbean medical school.In 1983, the Reagan administration led an invasion of the island of Grenada, and evacuated students from St. George\u2019s medical school, after a military coup ousted government leaders.Grenada has not received the brunt of this year\u2019s hurricanes but Charles Modica, St. George\u2019s chancellor, said that when Hurricane Ivan hit in 2004, the school relocated to an osteopathic medical college in New York, among other places, and that students were able to complete the semester.But on Tuesday, many families of Ross students were left in limbo.\u201cI have not slept, and cry frequently,\u201d Robin Doyle, of Hanover, Minn., said in a text message to a reporter. Her son Jesse is in his final semester at Ross.Lillianna Tisheh of Port St. Lucie, Fla., last spoke to her daughter, Leilah, 24, at 5 p.m. on Monday.\u201cThe wind was hitting really really fast so they were staying in the little hallway in the apartment,\u201d she said. \u201cI called her back and didn\u2019t get anything.\u201dAt 7:37 p.m., her daughter sent a text message to her parents saying the electricity was gone and she was using the university\u2019s Wi-Fi.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019ll be safe.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "20 Wines for Under $20: Weeknight Pleasures for Relaxed Evenings", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe requirements for weeknight cooking are easy to understand, but weeknight wine? It\u2019s a bit more conceptual.The last thing anyone wants after a long day of work is to put in another few hours over a cutting board and stove. But where is the labor in opening a bottle? It is the wine inside that matters.Weeknight wines ought to be undemanding, like easygoing comedies rather than Ingmar Bergman films. They need not require rapt attention, but they should be delicious and refreshing. And if you do choose to focus on them, you should be rewarded with something of interest, a touch of nuance or complexity that would repay the gift of your attention.Did I mention price? They should be relatively inexpensive and great values, which are not necessarily the same thing. You can find plenty of innocuous wines for $10. Most will be sound but boring \u2014 paint-by-numbers facsimiles of more interesting bottles. They are cheap, but where is the value?In the range of $15 to $20, however, the level of interest and excitement rises exponentially over $10 wines. These 20 bottles I\u2019ve selected, all under $20, are great weeknight wines, easygoing and friendly. And if you wish to engage with them, they will be worth your while.The bottles on those earlier lists are still worth seeking out, even if what you find are from more recent vintages. Sometimes prices may have increased a few dollars as well. Partisans of Spain or California will find more to choose from on those lists. Spain offers great values, even if I didn\u2019t turn up any on my recent shopping trips. California? Not so many.The majority of the wines on this list come from France and Italy. These cradles of modern wine production are the greatest sources of excellent values today because of their diversity and their traditions. You simply have many more types of interesting wines from which to choose.Not that I want to rile anybody up. Weeknight wines are intended to relax, not to antagonize. But if you feel strongly that in the yearslong body of 20 Under $20 lists, I am neglecting areas of value and interest, I welcome your suggestions.This fine producer in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy specializes in Barbaresco, and its wines are generally excellent values. The Langhe nebbiolo is made largely from young Barbaresco vines. It\u2019s earthy and lightly tannic with firm, long flavors that are more fruit than mineral, perhaps, but it\u2019s well balanced and exceptional. (Rosenthal Wine Merchant, New York)This delicious, gulpable wine comes from one of my favorite Finger Lakes producers. Edelzwicker is a term used in Alsace for a simple, blended quaffing wine. In keeping with that theme, gew\u00fcrztraminer is in the blend, but so is Cayuga white, an aromatic, hybrid grape common in the Finger Lakes. The result is dry, pure and thirst-quenching, an excellent aperitif.The world seems finally to have discovered the incredible values to be found in good cru Beaujolais, which sadly has sent prices soaring. Yet here is a fine value from C\u00f4te de Brouilly, not one of the most esteemed crus, like Moulin-\u00e0-Vent or Morgon, but one of my favorites. It is pure and precise, with earthy, lingering flavors of red fruits and pressed flowers. (Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant, Berkeley, Calif.)20 PhotosYou\u2019ve probably read about wretched examples of retsina, the traditional Greek wine flavored with pine resin. This, on the other hand, is a great, updated version, made with care and attention. Gai\u2019a makes this wine with roditis, a fine grape, rather then the usual dull savatiano, and the result is a revelation: bright, vibrant and refreshing, and wonderful with Greek appetizers and even lamb roasted on a spit. (Athenee Importers, Hempstead, N.Y.)Passetoutgrain (pronounced pahss-too-GRAHN) is the Burgundy region\u2019s easygoing simple red, kind of a counterpart to the white aligot\u00e9, generally without as high an upside. It\u2019s not a single grape, but a blend of at least one-third pinot noir and no more than two-thirds gamay, fermented together. Nonetheless, St\u00e9phane Magnien\u2019s Cuv\u00e9e Densit\u00e9 is juicy, thirst-quenching and delicious, and it makes me very happy. (Fruit of the Vines, Long Island City, N.Y.)Bairrada is a sort of forgotten region in Portugal south of the Douro and not far from the Atlantic, which, along with its clay-and-limestone soils, gives its wines a freshness and energy that I love. Baga is the best red grape, but this fascinating red is a blend of the little known alfrocheiro (90 percent) and a white grape, bical (10 percent). It\u2019s fresh, earthy and almost stony, with flavors of red fruits and flowers. (Savio Soares Selections, Brooklyn, N.Y.)For anybody put off by German wine labels or terminology, here is a great counterexample. The packaging of this dry German riesling from Knebel, a top Mosel producer, is simple, clean and easy to understand, with no jargon or indecipherable fonts. The same is true of the wine. It\u2019s dry, stony and pure with compelling minerality, a great value. (Schatzi Wines, Milan, N.Y.)Like riesling, Loire reds and sherry, white Bordeaux is one of those wine-writer favorites (or maybe one of this wine writer\u2019s favorites) that never manages to capture the imagination of the public. That can make it a very good value, like this savory, saline wine from Graville-Lacoste, made of 75 percent s\u00e9millon, 20 percent sauvignon blanc and 5 percent muscadelle. It is rich but floral, and the longer it\u2019s exposed to air, the better it gets. (Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant)Barbera, along with dolcetto and nebbiolo, is part of the trinity of major red grapes in the Piedmont region of Italy. Good barbera offers ripsaw acidity that refreshes and cleans the mouth, making it a great choice with Italian sausages and fatty meats, pizza and stews. This one from Barale, an excellent Barolo producer, is fresh, balanced and shows great precision. (T. Elenteny Imports, New York)I love sangiovese, the red grape of Chianti and of Montalcino, among other less renowned strongholds in Tuscany. This Rosso di Montalcino doesn\u2019t have the depth or complexity of good Brunello di Montalcino, but it is rich, pure and precise, and far less expensive. Try it with grilled skirt steak. (Vineyard Brands, Birmingham, Ala.)Lagrein is yet another obscure red grape from Italy. Yet this one has so much going for it. Forget the romance of its production site, an ancient Benedictine monastery in the mountainous Alto Adige in the Tyrolean northeast. It is savory and spicy, chunky yet supple with delicious floral and dark fruit flavors. Perfect for when vespers are over. (Polaner Selections, Mt. Kisco, N.Y.)The Santa Ynez Valley, especially the Santa Rita Hills on the western end, is best known for pinot noir and chardonnay. But the east end, which goes by the name Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara, is better suited for warmer-climate grapes like cabernet sauvignon. This bottle from Ground Effect is not a small wine. It\u2019s spicy and herbal, yet not at all sweet or thick, a reminder of what can be great about California cabernet. Bring on the steaks and burgers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hunger and Desire, Stripped of Window Dressing, at Prune", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I haven\u2019t seen her in the five and a half years I\u2019ve been reviewing restaurants, though, even when I\u2019ve eaten at Prune, in the East Village. And, against our personal history, one has to balance the simmering resentment I feel each time I remember that writing is only a sideline for Ms. Hamilton, and yet she\u2019s better at it than most people who do it for a living, including me.Any new Prune customer who isn\u2019t already aware that Ms. Hamilton is a very good writer will realize it when the menus arrive. They are put together by somebody who understands how words work. Although these days she drafts them with Ashley Merriman, whom she married last year and with whom she shares the title of chef, their tone has not changed in the 18 years Prune has been open.They do not follow the current fad of forcing nouns into shotgun weddings to which no prepositions, participles or conjunctions were invited (\u201ccod, radish, yogurt, nasturtium\u201d). Instead you see phrases that could be in the first sentence of a short story you wouldn\u2019t be able to put down.Often, the phrases are more direct. One of the vegetables recently was \u201cCorn on the cob with butter and salt.\u201d You might see corn on the cob anywhere, but the butter and salt are the kind of concrete details that could make this a line from a poem about summer. Here\u2019s another line: \u201cplain boiled zucchini drowned in olive oil.\u201d There were four delicious little squashes, cooked whole with their bright firm stems on, and there was indeed enough clean, grassy oil to drown them.What\u2019s that I hear? Is that an objection from someone who boils zucchini at home? Go ahead, knock yourself out. Just don\u2019t try to tell me that I\u2019ve been scammed. The whole objective of Prune is and always has been to cook the food of hunger and desire, strip it of the usual restaurant window dressing, and put it in front of you.This is why the menu reads so well. Good writing comes from clear thinking, and Ms. Hamilton\u2019s thoughts on what makes a satisfying dinner have always been extremely clear. What more could you ask from the start of a meal than saut\u00e9ed chanterelles shedding mushroom juice and butter into a thick slice of toasted white bread? And what could you add to improve a main course of swordfish, grilled gently enough that a ros\u00e9 blush is left in its flesh, with melted anchovy butter that runs into the tiny boiled potatoes?Well, there is a garnish: a lemon wedge and a parsley sprig. This I suppose counts as restaurant window dressing, but because it comes from another era it also evokes a specific sense memory that gives meaning to the whole dish.Not everything sparkles; a ragout of artichokes and shell beans tasted about as gray as it looked. But for the most part Ms. Merriman has managed to nest her style inside her wife\u2019s while, I think, expanding the boundaries of both.Braised rabbit leg is a very Prune thing to cook, but I doubt that in 1999 it would have been presented, as it was earlier this summer, over yellow hexagons of carrot mixed with Calabrian chiles, mint leaves and pine nuts, with a handful of fried bread crumbs thrown over the top. That Mediterranean tilt could be Ms. Merriman\u2019s work, but the dish still has a Hamiltonian directness.The grilled branzino on the menu, on the other hand, is a classic Hamilton dish. The simplicity \u2014 a whole fish on a plate \u2014 has her name all over it, and the application of fennel oil is the sort of nuance \u2014 invisible, politely insistent \u2014 she prefers to screamingly interventionist moves.The two women run a kitchen that is capable of intricate footwork, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s known for. What they and their cooks do, you can too, generally. This was true back when Prune still served canned sardines loaded onto a plate with Triscuits, pickles and a bloop of mustard, a dish that didn\u2019t take any cooking but did require enough nerve to fill a punch bowl.The sardines are not on the menu, but cans are kept on hand for sentimental customers. The nerve is still there, although a less fraught word for it is confidence. It is confidence that allows Prune to place a scrupulously made martini on the cocktail list next to a Long Island Iced Tea that has been purged of its scuzzier ingredients but is still pretty louche.It is confidence that gets you unshowy desserts like slices of black plums tossed with sugar, lemon zest and cardamom and spread out on buttered toast, or a bunch of Concord grapes lounging on a plate of chipped ice.It is confidence that lets some servers wear pale pink crew-neck T-shirts and others V-necks of a riper, fleshier pink. Confidence that helps them thread through tables that are by anybody\u2019s standards too close together; confidence that allows them to treat every customer, the ones who look like actors and the ones who look like retired semiotics professors, with the same attention and care.It is confidence that lets this French-looking bistro with its much-put-upon marble bar and fuzzed-up mirrors play Yo La Tengo one night and Whitney Houston\u2019s greatest hits on another and still believe that somehow it will all mean something.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "His Dream in Reach, an Immigrant Chef Is Suddenly Unsettled", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiming and luck were on Mr. Santana\u2019s side: The boss, Aaron Chamberlin, told him he could keep the job if he found a way to legalize his status. Months later, in 2012, the Obama administration began the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, giving young immigrants like Mr. Santana temporary permission to live and work in the United States.This time, though, the timing is not so good.\u201cI thought, this is it, the end of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201dFor Mr. Santana, that apprenticeship happened in reverse. Mr. Chamberlin, a restaurateur born to a Mormon family in suburban Phoenix, showed him the ropes and took the legal risk of helping a young man without immigration papers.Mr. Santana had provided a friend\u2019s name and Social Security number, which were not flagged when the restaurant ran them through E-Verify, an online database that checks the work eligibility of new hires. But as time went by, Mr. Santana felt badly about lying, and told Mr. Chamberlin that he was not who he claimed to be.\u201c\u2018Just be honest with me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chamberlin recalled asking him. \u201c\u2018Do you have papers?\u2019\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Santana said, \u201cbut I want to be able to work.\u201dBy then, Mr. Santana had put in weeks of hard work, and slashed the prep time for the green chili in half. Mr. Chamberlin learned that he had done the type of jobs that Mexican immigrants often do: building homes, installing roof shingles, cleaning pools and landscaping yards.As a teenager, Mr. Santana had sold plastic bottles and aluminum cans he plucked from Dumpsters so he didn\u2019t have to ask his parents for money. At 18, he had graduated from high school and enrolled in the culinary program at a community college, but couldn\u2019t pay the out-of-state tuition that Arizona required of undocumented immigrants at the time.\u201cThe kid had done everything right,\u201d Mr. Chamberlin said. \u201cHe was worth fighting for.\u201dMr. Chamberlin says he briefly considered adopting him, but was unable because Mr. Santana was an adult. When the Obama administration started the DACA program in June 2012, he pushed Mr. Santana to fill out his application.Since then, Mr. Santana has done a little bit of everything in the kitchen, perfecting the rough skills he learned cooking menudo, posole and picadillo norte\u00f1o at home with his mother in Phoenix. He has cleaned and washed, chopped, sliced and diced. He has cooked and tweaked recipes, invented some dishes and scrapped others.He has taken his share of yelling and criticism, and done some yelling and criticizing of his own. \u201cI tell the guys in the kitchen, you\u2019re here to learn, but we\u2019re all here to make money,\u201d said Mr. Santana, who is currently the chef de cuisine at St. Francis.Last winter, Mr. Chamberlin asked him what he wanted to do next. \u201cI want to have a taqueria,\u201d Mr. Santana replied. Maybe he\u2019d open it with his father, he said, or raise the money and do it on his own.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose him,\u201d Mr. Chamberlin recalled, \u201cand I honestly didn\u2019t want to have him as my competition.\u201d So he offered to create a taqueria if Mr. Santana would agree to be his partner.The new restaurant\u2019s name is a tribute to Mr. Santana\u2019s mother, Consuelo Santana, whose nickname is Chelo. She was raised on a ranch in El Pinal Alto, in the mountains of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico, where she learned to soak and cook wheat in limewater, and then drain, rinse, hull and grind it in a hand-cranked stone mill to make masa. It is an ancient, time-consuming process known as nixtamalization, and it is how Mr. Santana plans to make the tortillas at Taco Chelo.In Mexico, his father, Jos\u00e9 Martinez, had earned a degree in mechanical engineering. But in Monterrey, the northeastern Mexico city where the family lived, the parents felt there was little future for their three children. They all entered the United States in 2003 using tourist visas, and stayed.Mr. Santana doesn\u2019t take all the credit for his success in America. \u201cGod was watching over me,\u201d he said.Intensely religious, he often starts his days with morning prayers at Iglesia La Luz del Mundo (Light of the World Church), a Christian congregation that is part of one of Mexico\u2019s largest homegrown religious sects. He sings in the choir and cooks for church events.In May, he married an American citizen, Stephany Delgado; he has been talking to a lawyer about obtaining a green card and eventually becoming a citizen. His DACA permit expires in February, but he plans to apply for a two-year renewal before an Oct. 5 deadline. He knows, however, that there is no guarantee that he will secure one, or that the program will still exist.Last Tuesday, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the end of the program, Mr. Chamberlin sat down with Mr. Santana and four other employees who are also protected by it.\u201cHaving to fight every day just to be here, to prove yourself, that mind-set is really going to help you become successful in your lives,\u201d Mr. Chamberlin told them. \u201cLet\u2019s all look at it as another challenge and hope we can fix it, or someone else can. Until then, we\u2019ll put our heads down and stay focused.\u201dMr. Santana is trying to concentrate on the opening of Taco Chelo, in a corner storefront in Roosevelt Row, a downtown area of art galleries and mom-and-pop stores that has been rapidly gentrifying.Mr. Santana carries a notebook where he writes the questions he needs answered, and the answers that need remembering. These days, it is full of ideas for his menu and observations about the quality of the service he gets at other restaurants.He said he wants to make sure that everyone who works and eats at Taco Chelo is treated the same way, \u201cregardless of their accent\u201d or the color of their skin. Often, he said, \u201cI go to restaurants and I notice that I\u2019m not treated the same as other people are.\u201dNow, at least in his restaurant, \u201cI have a chance to fix it,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. If you\u2019re a client, if you\u2019re eating my food, you\u2019ll have my respect.\u201dAn earlier version of this article was unclear about the deadline for renewing DACA work permits.

{"Headline": "German Election Mystery: Why No Russian Meddling?", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on the eve of Sunday\u2019s elections, the Russians have done something few expected: they have largely disappeared. The trolls who spread distorted and falsified information before earlier elections have failed to make much of a splash here. The websites of the campaigns and major news media outlets are operating like normal.Germans, according to Sandro Gaycken, the director of the Digital Society Institute in Berlin, which has been monitoring for Russian meddling, are \u201calmost disappointed that nothing is happening.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t see any verified attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really expecting any Russian interference.\u201dIn some respects, experts say, German elections are insulated from outside interference in ways those in the United States are not. The country\u2019s politics are not as polarized as they are in the United States, where partisan enmity provided fertile ground for Russian efforts to sow confusion with distorted and falsified information amplified by Russian-controlled Twitter bots and Facebook accounts.In a move that would seem unimaginable in the United States, the campaigns for the major political parties entered into a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d this year not to exploit any information that might be leaked as a result of a cyberattack.Germans also still largely trust their mainstream, traditional news media sources and, unlike Americans, tend to be wary of information disseminated on Facebook and Twitter.In January, someone registered two websites, btleaks.info and btleaks.org, which reminiscent of the DCLeaks website that served as a repository for documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee last year. Staffers from Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency have been assigned to check those websites hourly.But few think the information if leaked would make much difference at this point. The latest polls show Ms. Merkel in a comfortable lead ahead of her chief rivals, making it likely that she will secure a fourth term as chancellor.So why has Russia held back?After failing to defeat Mr. Macron or so far obtain any positive dividends from its support of the Trump campaign, it is possible, experts say, that the Kremlin has decided to rethink its approach.Weeks after the election of President Trump, Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the BND, warned of cyberattacks aimed at \u201cdelegitimizing the democratic process\u201d in Germany. Ms. Merkel herself has issued similar warnings.\u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to conduct cyber-ops because everyone is waiting for it,\u201d Dr. Gaycken said. \u201cIt would almost make more sense for the C.I.A. to leak fake news to make it seem like the Russians did it.\u201d\u201cIt is a very blunt tool that I would assess has very little impact on the world,\u201d said David Balson, Ripjar\u2019s director of intelligence.Perhaps Germany\u2019s greatest protection is not some 21st century innovation but old-fashioned paper ballots, counted by hand, that are essentially hack proof.It would be a mistake to think the aggressive Russian interference in elections last year represented some kind of new norm, said Thomas Rid, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who is writing a book on Russian active measures. These types of operations, he said, are extremely difficult to pull off and, as the world has seen, can backfire. In many ways, he said, the Russians just got lucky.\u201cI think one of the risks of the 2016 operation is that we all overestimate how much you can achieve from it and how easy it is,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t replicate this in the country every time.\u201dNevertheless, Germans prepared well in advance for any hint of Russian interference.The Federal Office for Information Security ran penetration tests looking for vulnerabilities in computer systems and software of the federal election authority. The Bundestag and the individual campaigns consulted with experts about strengthening their computer security. And major news media outlets established teams of fact checkers to protect against fake news.German officials are now looking beyond the elections at ways to bolster the country\u2019s cyberdefenses even further.At the Federal Security Council meeting, which was held in March, officials hammered out what has become known as the \u201chack-back\u201d strategy. The plan is to try to turn the tables on the hackers, launching offensive cyberattacks against them and destroying their online infrastructure before any real damage can be done.While the German military can now legally launch a cyber-offensive following hacker attacks on military resources, there is no provision in German law allowing for the country\u2019s cyber forces to respond to attacks on civilian infrastructure like the power grid, hospitals or servers that process election results.\u201cOur cyber-defenses are Swiss cheese,\u201d said Jacob Schrot, a Bundestag staffer responsible for intelligence oversight and cybersecurity matters.Though a precise plan of action has yet to be implemented, that federal authorities would even consider taking offensive action against an enemy is a measure of how seriously the country has come to view the cyber threat.Marian Wendt, a member of Parliament from Ms. Merkel\u2019s party, the Christian Democratic Union, who oversees cybersecurity issues, said in an interview that Germany would prefer cooperation with Mr. Putin and Russia. But he said Germany also had a responsibility to protect itself.\u201cAt some point you have to attack your attackers,\u201d he said.Germany\u2019s talk of offensive cyber actions could also escalate tensions with the Kremlin, said Mr. Rid, from Johns Hopkins University. And with Russia quiet at the moment, many question the wisdom of provoking it.\u201cLoose German talk of hack-back,\u201d Mr. Rid said, \u201ccould translate into Russian as \u2018bring it on.\u2019\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the German elections will be held.

{"Headline": "Israeli Orthodox Lawmaker in Trouble Over Gay Nephew\u2019s Wedding", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli lawmaker had gone on the radio to promote a new single by his daughter, a singer, and to show a more liberal and hipper face of his party, the ultra-Orthodox Shas.But after the lawmaker, Yigal Guetta, revealed in the radio interview that he had attended the wedding of a gay nephew, his chatty appeal to a broader audience of potential Shas voters appeared to backfire. Rabbis and party activists revolted and demanded that he resign.Under pressure from the critics, Mr. Guetta, 51, told Aryeh Deri, the party leader, this week that he was resigning, and Mr. Deri agreed. But many Israelis have since expressed outrage that the rabbis and the party would put strict adherence to Jewish law and prejudice above family unity.Mr. Guetta is now in negotiations with the Shas Party\u2019s council of sages, who are said to be less upset about his attendance at the wedding than his disclosure of that information in the radio interview.A compromise appears to be emerging in which Mr. Guetta would apologize for giving the interview, though not for attending the wedding, and would retain his place in the party and his seat in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s Parliament.To formally resign he would have to write to the Knesset chairman, a step he has not taken yet.Mr. Guetta did not answer his cellphone or respond to text messages on Thursday, and the Shas Party was not commenting on the episode publicly. But Shas officials said privately that they hoped the compromise would happen and put an end to the story.The wedding took place two years ago, before Mr. Guetta had entered Parliament.So it came as a bit of a bombshell when Mr. Guetta told Army Radio on Aug. 29, \u201cHere\u2019s a scoop, hold on tight.\u201d He went on to relate that he had declined his gay nephew\u2019s request for a blessing under the huppah, or marriage canopy, but continued, \u201cWe all went to the wedding, me, my wife and all my children.\u201d He told his children their attendance was mandatory, he said, though he also emphasized to them that such a wedding was forbidden under Jewish law.The uproar has engendered a debate among Shas supporters over whether strict adherence to the letter of Jewish law should supersede other traditional Jewish values, including the sanctity of the family. Many Shas voters are traditional Mizrahi, eastern Jews whose families came from Arab countries, and who are not as strictly Orthodox as their party leaders. They have voted Shas over the years for social and economic reasons, believing that the party best represents the interests of the Mizrahi portion of Israel\u2019s Jewish population against the old-guard Ashkenazi elite from Europe.Others pointed to what they called the hypocrisy of the Shas leadership, given that Mr. Deri, the party leader, and Mr. Benizri, who no longer sits in Parliament but who criticized Mr. Guetta, have both served prison terms for financial corruption.\u201cThey were in prison and got out and all of a sudden they are OK?\u201d Suzy Ben Zvi, Mr. Guetta\u2019s sister and the mother of the groom, told Maariv. She said Mr. Guetta had arrived after the ceremony and stayed an hour, out of respect for the family.\u201cGod will repay all the Shas saints for what they did to him,\u201d Mrs. Ben Zvi continued. Describing her brother as a wise man who did something noble, she added, \u201cThe tradition of family is the holiest tradition in Judaism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Even today, I still can\u2019t listen to \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d without crying.) But when we stood to listen to the Eli Young Band, everything went wrong. They got the second verse wrong, and then got it wrong again when they did it over.\u201cGet off the field, you\u2019re drunk!\u201d yelled a woman behind us who sported red-and-yellow face paint and seemed drunk herself.Once the band finally reached the end of the song, instead of singing \u201chome of the brave,\u201d the entire stadium screamed \u201chome of the Chiefs!\u201d They had replaced \u201cbrave\u201d \u2014 a word that, to me, represented my father, a man who spent 24 years in the military and gave his life for the country \u2014 with a mascot. My blood boiled.\u201cThey do it at every game,\u201d my boyfriend at the time whispered to me. Like it was no big deal. Just a football thing.When it comes to \u201cdisrespecting the national anthem,\u201d people have been doing it for a long time. They do it because they\u2019re drunk or because it\u2019s tradition or because they just spent $200 on tickets and they are pumped to be in a stadium alongside tens of thousands of other fans. I worked in both professional and collegiate athletics for five years, and in both venues, I never felt like \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d got the respect it deserved. To the average fan, I observed, it was just something to get through before the main event.So, I\u2019m surprised at the number of white people on my Facebook feed who are offended because black football players are kneeling for the national anthem. As a Gold Star daughter \u2014 and, to be clear, I am not speaking for all Gold Star families \u2014 I\u2019m not offended by what is happening in the N.F.L. right now. At least these players are \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the national anthem for a cause.Not once during these peaceful protests have I gotten the sense that the players\u2019 intention is to disrespect the military. Not once did I feel that they were taking my father\u2019s ultimate sacrifice for granted. Rather, they were exercising the exact freedoms my father gave his life for.Protests are not supposed to be comfortable. They are supposed to incite change \u2014 and what these players are doing is working. Everywhere you look someone is talking about racism in the United States, all because a group of athletes have taken a stand. Whether it offends you or not, this is what a successful protest looks like.Someone I know on Facebook wrote this:So many better ways they could be helping their \u201ccause\u201d they could use their time and money to make their point or make a difference, but oh wait \u2026 that would require some sort of effort or sacrifice on their part. Does this get attention? Sure. But probably not the right kind. And it\u2019s certainly not going to create any change.Sure these \u201cspoiled babies\u201d (words I pulled from a different Facebook post) could do other things to make statements, like donate money to causes or maybe make a statement in a news conference. (By the way, they\u2019ve been doing these things for a long time already.) But the audience they are targeting by kneeling will never see those other efforts. The family sitting next to me at a restaurant, this Facebook friend of mine, the president of the United States of America \u2014 perhaps none of them would be talking about it without those protests.To those who criticize Mr. Kaepernick: Before posting your rant, consider why these football players are kneeling. Try to understand their side. Read James Baldwin or Toni Morrison or Margo Jefferson; I guarantee you will look at things differently.And consider this: The president of the United States is more outraged by the actions of football players than by the actions of white supremacists. Let that sink in. Is there anything more offensive to the United States military than flying the American flag next to the Nazi flag? Talk about spitting on my father\u2019s grave. President Trump gave white supremacists a pat on the hand, while black N.F.L. players get called \u201csons of bitches.\u201d If that\u2019s not proof of racial inequality in America, I\u2019m not sure what is.I will always respect my country\u2019s flag and national anthem. To me they are the symbols of freedom, of my dad\u2019s sacrifice. But my father did not die for symbols. He died for people. He died for the rights of all Americans, regardless of their race or religion. Right now, some Americans still face inequality. So they protest and create change. And I applaud them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Big Media Set to Get Bigger, With Help From Lawmakers", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Most of Australia\u2019s newspapers, radio stations and television broadcasters are controlled by only a handful of owners, like Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, making it one of the most concentrated media markets in the developed world.Soon, even more Australian media properties could be in fewer hands.New legislation backed by Australia\u2019s governing Liberal party would eliminate restrictions separating broadcast media from print and would allow media companies to own more outlets in a city. The legislation, which has cleared Australia\u2019s Senate and could come before the lower house of Parliament as soon as next month, is widely expected to pass.Media owners say the rules are relics of a less digital era. Like media companies around the world, Australia\u2019s newspaper and television station owners are contending with the rise of internet companies like Facebook and Google, which are drawing away advertising dollars, eyeballs and eardrums.But in an echo of debates raging in other countries, opponents say the changes would lead to a less diverse media market, with Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company among those likely to benefit the most. They also contend the legislation\u2019s backers are simply helping their political allies.\u201cWhat will happen is there will be consolidation of media and a progressive diminution of voices in the Australian media market,\u201d said Tim Dwyer, a professor specializing in media and communications at the University of Sydney.Australia\u2019s current media rules draw some limits. They forbid an owner from controlling a television station, radio broadcaster and newspaper in a single market. They also prevent a television network from broadcasting to more than three-quarters of the country\u2019s population.The rules date to the 1980s, when they were pushed by Paul Keating, then Australia\u2019s treasurer and later the prime minister, who famously said that a media owner could be the prince of print or queen of the screen, but not both.Today, Australia\u2019s princes and queens enjoy strong holds on their respective platforms.Properties of News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company, account for nearly two-thirds of newspaper circulation here and include major names like The Daily Telegraph and The Australian. Fairfax Media, an Australian company that owns The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review, accounts for nearly a quarter.In broadcast, Australia\u2019s main television network owners include Nine Network, Ten Network Holdings and Seven West Media, as well as two publicly funded television networks, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and SBS.But the digital era has eaten away at their strengths.Global media companies are also presenting tougher competition. In a move that surprised many Australians, the CBS Corporation, the American broadcaster, reached an agreement this month to buy Ten. It beat out a group that included Lachlan Murdoch, co-chairman of News Corp. and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s son.Australia\u2019s media companies argue that easing ownership limits will give them greater heft to compete with bigger, better-funded internet companies from abroad. The rule against broadcasters\u2019 reaching more than three-quarters of the population, for example, makes little sense in an era of streaming videos and online movies on demand, some argue.\u201cThese reforms are important,\u201d said Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp.\u2019s Asian and Australian operations, in a statement. \u201cThis finally addresses the restrictions that have held back the competitiveness of media companies in Australia for far too long.\u201dThat argument has won support from Malcolm Turnbull, Australia\u2019s prime minister, and his Liberal party. After the legislation passed the Senate, Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said in a statement, \u201cAustralian media companies will now be better placed to compete with the big online media companies from overseas.\u201dA number of experts said the legislation would do little to help media companies compete with the likes of Google. Instead, they said, it would help homegrown companies winnow out other local competitors.\u201cIt will lead to a greater concentration of power,\u201d said Denis Muller, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Center for Advancing Journalism.Opponents of the bill, many of them in the opposition Labor Party, consider it a favor to media owners like Mr. Murdoch, widely considered sympathetic to the conservative Liberal party.News Corp. newspapers offered \u201cunrelenting support and uncritical support\u201d for the Liberal party in last year\u2019s elections, Mr. Muller said.The critics also point to the government\u2019s recent decision to grant 30 million Australian dollars (about $23.6 million) to Fox Sports, a cable broadcaster owned by News Corp. Government officials \u2014 who said the grant was tied to the effort to overhaul media rules \u2014 said the money was intended to support women\u2019s sports, like Australia\u2019s women\u2019s national soccer team, which broadcasts its matches on Fox Sports.Asked about helping News Corp, Mr. Turnbull\u2019s communications officials said in a statement that the pending legislation is \u201cunabashedly pro-Australian voices and pro-Australian jobs.\u201d It added, \u201cThe Labor Party was and remains completely indifferent to a strong Australian media.\u201dThe Liberal party struck a number of deals to get the legislation passed. One senator, Nick Xenophon, successfully demanded additional initiatives, including a package of 60 million Australian dollars, or $47.2 million, to help small and regional publishers, allowing them, he said, to \u201chave a fighting chance to flourish.\u201dThe package has been criticized by Labor politicians as merely providing smaller outlets with equipment and doing nothing to sustain jobs.At Mr. Xenophon\u2019s urging under an additional initiative, the government has pledged to conduct an inquiry into the impact of Facebook and Google on advertising revenue.The Liberal party also struck a deal with the One Nation Party, a right-leaning party led by Pauline Hanson, who has long criticized coverage by Australia\u2019s public broadcasters. Under that agreement, government officials will put the content and practices of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation under greater scrutiny.\u201cWe\u2019re looking after the public\u2019s interest,\u201d Ms. Hanson said, \u201cin ensuring that they get a fair deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senator Berates Twitter Over \u2018Inadequate\u2019 Inquiry Into Russian Meddling", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A key senator investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election sharply criticized Twitter on Thursday for failing to aggressively investigate the Russian misuse of its platform after the company said it had largely limited its own inquiry to accounts linked to fraudulent profiles already identified by Facebook.The senator, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Twitter\u2019s briefing for congressional investigators \u201cvery disappointing,\u201d and accused company officials of ignoring extensive evidence of nefarious Russian activity.The company\u2019s presentation \u201cshowed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered,\u201d Mr. Warner said, adding, \u201cTheir response was frankly inadequate on every level.\u201dThe creators of the Facebook pages posed as American activists to spread disinformation and sow discord during the election season.Twitter identified only 22 accounts on its platform that were directly tied to the Russian Facebook pages and then discovered another 179 accounts that were \u201crelated or linked\u201d to the Facebook accounts. None were registered on the site as advertisers, the company said.Twitter did not immediately respond to Mr. Warner\u2019s criticism.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was more diplomatic about Twitter\u2019s briefing for House investigators, calling it \u201cgood, but preliminary.\u201d\u201cI think there is a great deal more that we need to know, a great deal more that Twitter needs to find out,\u201d he said. Mr. Schiff said Twitter faced greater difficulty in tracing accounts because its users provide less information than Facebook users when they sign up.\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think we have more than scratched the surface of our understanding of how the Russians may have used that platform,\u201d he said.Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s Republican chairman, would not answer questions about the briefing on Thursday, and his spokeswoman declined to comment. Mr. Warner said that he and Mr. Burr would hold a news conference as soon as next week to update the public on their investigation and try to draw attention to the continuing threat by foreign entities to the American political system.The cybersecurity company FireEye found hundreds of automated accounts linked to Russian hacking groups, which sent out messages critical of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats last year.Nor did Twitter address a web \u201cdashboard\u201d set up last month by researchers to track and compile statistics on 600 Twitter accounts that the researchers believe to be linked to the Russian government or to have a longstanding pattern of repeating its propaganda. The company\u2019s statement said nothing about still-functioning Twitter accounts of DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, which American intelligence officials identified last year as created by Russian agents to distribute emails and documents obtained by hacking.Mr. Warner said he was \u201cmore than a bit surprised in light of all of the public interest in this subject over the last few weeks that anyone from the Twitter team would think that the presentation they made to Senate staff today even began to answer the kinds of questions that we\u2019d asked.\u201dHe said the company had much more work to do.\u201cThis raises at an even greater level the necessity that the American public has the ability to know when they are seeing a political ad, who\u2019s behind it \u2014 particularly if it is being sponsored by foreign agents,\u201d he said.In its briefings for congressional investigators and its public statement, Twitter did not identify any of the suspect accounts by name. The company said it had suspended accounts that violated its terms of service, suggesting that it had allowed some of the Russia-linked accounts to continue to function.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has tracked suspected Russian activity on Twitter for several years, said the platform had proved especially vulnerable to abuse, in part because the company demands little information from users. Twitter was used for years by the Islamic State for propaganda and recruiting, though much of that activity has now been shut down.\u201cBad people can do what they want on this platform,\u201d said Mr. Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. \u201cI think they have real problems trying to trace the Russian activity.\u201dFacebook briefed the two intelligence committees on Sept. 6 and revealed that it had connected 470 profiles and pages to a shadowy Russian company with Kremlin links called the Internet Research Agency. It said the pages had placed 3,000 ads on Facebook costing about $100,000. It found another $50,000 in ads that it believed might have a Russian source.Mr. Warner said on Thursday that the committee was still waiting for Facebook to deliver a set of ads that it had identified. He said he expected the material to be delivered by early next week.The Senate committee has asked Google officials to come for a private briefing in the coming weeks, according to a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The committee has invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify on Nov. 1.The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it intended to hold its own public hearing with tech companies next month, but it has yet to announce a date.Advertisement"}

Bannon helped shape President Trump\u2019s nationalistic rhetoric that blamed China for economic woes in the United States.Now, less than a month after leaving the government, Mr. Bannon, the former chief strategist to Mr. Trump, has come to Hong Kong, at the invitation of a company controlled by the Chinese government, where he called President Xi Jinping of China a wise leader.Mr. Bannon dined on Tuesday with a small group of hedge fund managers and investors, and later gave a keynote address at a major investor conference, where he spoke about the rise of populism in places like the United States and the Philippines.CLSA would not say whether it had paid Mr. Bannon for his appearance. \u201cCLSA does not discuss any agreements that we might have with speakers,\u201d said Simone Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the firm.Over lunch in a private room at the Grissini restaurant in the Grand Hyatt hotel, overlooking Victoria Harbour, Mr. Bannon shared his insights on a range of topics \u2014 including the United States electoral system, immigration and the escalating conflict over North Korea \u2014 with a small group of investors, according to two people who were in attendance.The event was organized by CLSA for important clients of its brokerage business.During the lunch, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Bannon told the group that Mr. Trump had great respect for Mr. Xi and felt that the two leaders could find a solution to the North Korea crisis, according to the two investors in attendance, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.In his keynote address, in a crowded Grand Hyatt ballroom, Mr. Bannon discussed economic nationalism in the United States and its spread across the globe, including in Britain. He called the U.K. Independence Party, which pushed successfully last year for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, a professional version of the Tea Party movement in the United States, according to one audience member. The address was closed to the news media.Some people in the audience left with the impression that Mr. Bannon, though no longer in the White House, still had direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. At one point, he joked that there were White House officials who felt, as he did, that Facebook and Google should be public utilities. Several attendees expressed surprise that Mr. Bannon was so articulate.Mr. Bannon has not been shy about his views on China. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that was broadcast on Sunday, Mr. Bannon said that the United States needed to take a tougher stance against Beijing. He said that China was \u201cat economic war with the U.S.\u201d and that it was Washington\u2019s turn to respond.During Tuesday\u2019s events, Mr. Bannon seemed more subdued about the purported Chinese threat, talking more broadly about global trade imbalance, according to people in attendance.While it was Mr. Bannon\u2019s first trip to Hong Kong since leaving the White House, it was not his first time in the city.A former Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Bannon in 2005 helped secure $60 million in funding for Internet Gaming Entertainment, a company based in Hong Kong, from investors including Goldman Sachs, according to a new book by Joshua Green, a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter.According to Mr. Green\u2019s book, the company got its start by hiring Chinese workers at low wages to play World of Warcraft, the online multiplayer fantasy game, earning points that could be traded for virtual goods, which would then be resold to players for real money.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Canned Tomato Season. Here\u2019s What You Need to Know.", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW HAVEN \u2014 At last: Canned tomatoes are back in season.Summer tomatoes are glorious, of course, and tomato salad is something I could eat every day. But I also feel compelled to use them in cooking, where (let\u2019s be honest) the skins are irritating, the taste is unpredictable and the liquid content can get out of control. So in the fall, it is with some relief that I turn back to the canned variety for all kinds of everyday cooking like pastas, stews, curries and enchiladas.Because pizza has just three basic elements \u2014 crust, sauce and cheese \u2014 each one must be reliably perfect and perfectly reliable. To accomplish this, every fall two grandsons of Mr. Pepe conduct a blind tasting of new-harvest tomatoes from the area around Naples, Italy, that is known for producing (and canning) the best tomatoes.\u201cWe\u2019re looking not only for taste but for the density of the fruit, whether the texture is fibrous or weak, how the flavor changes from the beginning to the end,\u201d said Francis Rosselli, 65, who began working at the pizzeria alongside the founder at age 14.The Pepe sauce is not cooked, or even seasoned; the tomatoes are simply pur\u00e9ed with their juices before going onto the crust and into the oven. So it\u2019s urgent that the unembellished tomatoes and juice are just right.Last week, I sat in (but didn\u2019t vote) at the annual tasting. First, we tried seven kinds right out of the can. Four were rejected (too weak, too strong, bland at the end), and the remaining three were carried off to the kitchen to be ground into sauce and tested immediately on an unembellished pie \u2014 no cheese or toppings, just tomato and olive oil. All three made good pizza, but we agreed that only one retained its clear, fresh tomato flavor after a turn in the 550-degree oven.Now a trained taster, I had to replicate the experiment at home.I blind-tested 10 widely available brands of American and Italian canned tomatoes, mixing imported and domestic, organic and not, salted and salt-free, in pur\u00e9e and in juice. I tasted only whole tomatoes because whole ingredients tend to be less processed, and it\u2019s easy to dice or crush them as needed. (I use a potato masher for the best texture in tomato sauce.)I did not miss them.Among the supermarket brands, most canned tomatoes had the balance of tang, saltiness and sweetness that is the hallmark of good tomato flavor. But four of them were especially high-performing.Here\u2019s how I found them:First I carved and tasted each brand right out of the can. Out of 10, I chose four top candidates.Carried away with success, I invented a final, grueling test: The two freshest-tasting specimens were drained, filleted and stuffed into a BLT.Here were some larger patterns I detected:In this sampling, the organic tomatoes tasted distinctly riper and more like fresh tomatoes \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear why or whether organic tomatoes consistently taste better than conventionally grown ones. (There are many good reasons to buy organic food, but better taste is not necessarily one of them.)Tomatoes packed without salt or calcium chloride tasted and felt more like fresh tomatoes. Calcium chloride is a naturally derived additive that prevents the flesh from breaking down in the can. But using too much of it produces an unnatural crunchy texture and prevents the flesh from breaking down when cooked into sauce.Whether the tomatoes were packed in juice or pur\u00e9e did not affect the taste. Whether the tomatoes were produced in Italy or the United States did not predict their taste. Whether or not the tomatoes were called San Marzano did not predict their quality.This is why: Although many modern recipes call for canned San Marzano tomatoes, labeling is a murky business. San Marzano is not a brand, or even a breed, of tomato. Within the European Union, \u201cSan Marzano\u201d is a term that can be applied only to tomatoes grown in a particular area around Naples, Italy, and only approved farmers can use the name and the union-approved stamp on their label.Here, anyone is free to employ the term, and many do. My can of Cento brand San Marzano tomatoes announced \u201ccertified\u201d on the label, but without a seal from the European Union (or any other official body), the term is largely meaningless. (The small print says \u201ccertified by an independent third-party agency.\u201d)The label on the Simpson San Marzanos looks authentically European, and uses the Italian term for peeled tomatoes on the label, but the tomatoes are entirely produced in the United States. (They are excellent, nonetheless.)Usually, the term does tells you this much: that the can is filled with plum or Roma tomatoes, which are in roughly the same botanical family as the archetypal San Marzano.\u201cIt\u2019s a breed with thicker walls, fewer seeds and a sweeter profile\u201d than the typical American canned tomato like Redpack, said Brady Erickson, who works on developing new tomato products for Muir Glen, an all-organic producer in the Sacramento Valley that is owned by General Mills.The company\u2019s new, accurately labeled \u201cSan Marzano style\u201d tomatoes performed the most like fresh tomatoes in my tests, and won best in show in the BLT. The Cento tomatoes made the best sauce.Whatever the breed, tomatoes do not always hold up well in the canning process. Some end up tasting metallic, or acquire the flavors of the additives used to preserve them. So finding lively, fresh tomato flavor in a can is a gift, and worth staging your own test.For Frank Pepe\u2019s descendants, the annual tasting ritual is more than a business necessity.\u201cIt takes us back to the roots,\u201d said Gary Bimonte, 57, the other grandson. \u201cTomatoes were a big part of our grandfather\u2019s life.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

As our publisher recently put it, we are an American institution that is \u201cglobal first.\u201d As a result, our Australia stories are aimed at a wide readership that includes all Australians in the country, but also Australians treveling or living in other countries.The readership for our Australia stories also includes New York Times readers all over the world, from Americans in Sydney and Santa Monica to Brits, Brazilians and Chinese immigrants in London and Melbourne and Auckland.But it\u2019s also worth pointing out that these readers come to us for the full scale and scope of The New York Times report.Are the journalists in the Australia bureau American or Australian?I\u2019m American.

That includes some recent additions.Here\u2019s the team as of now:We also have world-class photographers and contributors we rely on regularly, and we work closely with editors, developers and business colleagues in Hong Kong and New York.Then why do you report money in U.S. dollars, instead of Australian? Why miles, not kilometers or kilometres? Why French fries, instead of chips?The New York Times is a U.S.-based publication with a global readership. Articles about Australian topics are also read by people in the United States and around the world, so we follow New York Times style for consistency.That said, we\u2019ve made an effort to include kilometers and local currency for Australian articles when possible.We\u2019ve successfully lobbied for a change to The New York Times style guide to make sure Indigenous and Aboriginal are capitalized when referring to Australia\u2019s First Peoples. And we are working with our technology team on a geo-targeted solution that would seamlessly integrate currency, measurement and date formats that are sensitive to cultural differences around the world.How\u2019s it going?Do you accept pitches or submissions from freelancers?While we mostly use in-house staff and an established base of freelancers, we do consider pitches from new writers and visual journalists.\u2022 What is your story idea and what does it reveal about Australia in the context of the world? Why does it matter to a global audience?\u2022 How will you take the reader through the story? Which characters do you plan to talk to?\u2022 Why are you the best person to write this story? Have you had previous experience with this topic?Please also send samples of your best work. We appreciate pitches that show evidence of in-depth reporting and sharp analysis.Can I work with The New York Times in Australia?Who do I email if I have a news tip?Advertisement"}

It Made Selfies a Thing.", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementIt wasn\u2019t the first smartphone, the first mobile computer, or the first anything, really.But when I got my hands on the first iPhone in 2007, I knew it was unlike any machine I\u2019d ever used before, and it would forever alter my tech-addled life. It turns out it probably altered yours, too.In the early days, it was the simple things that were magical.The internet in your pocket. Connectivity at all times \u2014 news, baseball scores, recipes. (How innocent we were.)These sound like little things. But the collective weight of these tiny conveniences added up to something I almost couldn\u2019t live without.Almost. I returned the first iPhone three weeks after buying it.Its camera wasn\u2019t great. It didn\u2019t have the App Store. It worked on just one carrier. It cost $599. It was slow \u2014 very, very slow.Still, in those long moments it took to load a web page, you could see the whole future laid out before you: If they could get this right, if they could turn this into a general-purpose everywhere computer, it could change everything.The speed of the internet was vastly improved in the second one. The connected-everywhere promise was becoming something of a reality.And, despite Steve Jobs\u2019 early objections, Apple created its App Store.And apps could do things no other gadgets could do. Before the App Store, a song could come on the radio and you\u2019d have no way of figuring out what it was. Now you Shazam\u2019d it.Today, a lot of what you use on the iPhone is made by other people.These phones also knew where you were in the world, thanks to GPS. You could use maps in real time to get around. But GPS would eventually lead to so much more: Uber, Tinder, a scrapbook of photos on a map.The price was also right.AT&T, the only carrier offering it at the time, sold the new phone with a subsidy.$199. Almost too good to pass up if you could afford it.It created a dynamic that would turn the iPhone into the world\u2019s most profitable product \u2014 a luxury device at a mainstream price.The iPhone 4 changed that. The first iPhone with a camera on its front, it let you take good-looking pictures of yourself.The phenomenon became agonizing to parents, and irresistible to everyone else.Snapchat was released a year later, in 2011. So was iCloud, Apple\u2019s backup storage service.The collection of these technologies \u2014 selfie cameras, photo chatting, hackable online backups \u2014 would rock people\u2019s lives.And remember Anthony Weiner?She didn\u2019t sound like Rosie from \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d She was personable, and even tried to make jokes.She was Siri, the first robotic assistant that most of us encountered.But she quickly disappointed. She didn\u2019t seem very smart. She wasn\u2019t very useful. She was slow and unreliable. She misheard you.In time, she was eclipsed. Now there\u2019s Alexa and Google Now. Siri has felt stuck in the past.The iPhone 5 carried a bigger screen stuffed into a brushed aluminum enclosure. There was often no purer joy than simply holding it in your hand.Design-wise, the iPhone has gone downhill ever since.But the iPhone 5 wasn\u2019t just about design. It\u2019s when the iPhone grew up.And the iPhone got fast. Really fast. Carriers began handling more and more data. Everyone underestimated how all this would change the world.Then we started to see it: Our social media feeds, which have become the main way we encountered news, filled up with photos, videos and live broadcasts snapped on phones.By the end of 2013, Apple had sold nearly 500 million iPhones. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the time that people were sending two billion messages a day on iPhones and other devices running its mobile operating system.A few years earlier, Samsung created a laughably huge phone, the Galaxy Note. It turned out to be a huge seller.So Apple did something radical, and obvious: It made bigger phones. They sold sold amazingly well, and Apple\u2019s stock shot up.But its decision to copy its rivals on size felt like a new turn in its history. It marked a stepping back from the vanguard.Apple\u2019s phones are still the best you can buy. They still pack some of the most innovative features on the market. But they\u2019re not all that much better. Which phone you buy now feels like a matter of personal taste, rather than a judgment on product quality alone.For the iPhone to continue to be the iPhone, the trend-setting device of a generation, Apple has to do something big.It does away with the Home button, it unlocks with facial recognition and it can animate your facial gestures onto piles of poo.But is it the next big thing? Check back in a decade.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silent Film Returns \u2014 on Social Media", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookThe videos are curated from disparate sources, filmed on smartphones and GoPros around the world, but they all have one thing in common: They\u2019re best watched silently. If they even have sound, it\u2019s completely beside the point.We are living in the golden age of the silent video. Though we may still pop headphones in to watch a YouTube rant, social media has cultivated its own mute visual culture. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are designed to encourage endless scrolling, and that boosts videos that are made to catch the viewer\u2019s eye without offending her ear with grating bursts of noise.The clips that spread the furthest online are the ones that can be consumed anywhere without disruption: on the subway, the sidewalk or in the doctor\u2019s office; next to a partner in bed, behind the counter at work or under the desk in class. They\u2019re the ones that allow for private experiences in the most public of places. And in the internet\u2019s global marketplace, they\u2019re the ones that transcend language barriers, instantly legible to viewers in Peoria or Paris.Created by early filmmakers like the French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re and the American inventor Thomas Edison, these early movies took cues from the circus and the vaudeville circuit, featuring performers from that world, and were then played at vaudeville shows. Taken together, they formed what Gunning has called an \u201cillogical succession of performances.\u201dIn the absence of dialogue and involved narratives, early films focused on \u201cactualities,\u201d or setups that would appear instantly recognizable to audiences. Often, on both social media and in early film, textual clues are provided to viewers outside of the filmed image \u2014 in film titles presented to early-20th-century audiences, or in Facebook captions that guide modern viewers. A series of Edison actualities with titles like \u201cWhat Happened When A Hot Picture Was Taken\u201d and \u201cWhat Happened In the Tunnel\u201d parallel the modern meme format of pairing a short video with a brief emotional cue: \u201cThat feeling when \u2026\u201dOr consider \u201cWhat happened on 23rd street in New York City,\u201d which shows a pair of actors, a man and a woman, strolling down the sidewalk when a gust from a grate blows up the woman\u2019s skirt, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of petticoat. You can find modern equivalents of that video everywhere on social media, evidence of actors filming themselves making unexpected moves in crowds of real people. (In both eras, it\u2019s often hard to discern who\u2019s acting and who\u2019s just being.) A recent specimen making the rounds on Facebook, \u201cWhen The Splits Are Life,\u201d shows a woman appearing in various everyday settings \u2014 the grocery store, the street corner, the auto repair shop \u2014 and spontaneously breaking into feats of flexibility.One of the most striking parallels of early silent film and modern social video is the foregrounding of animals and babies. They make natural silent stars because they are largely speechless; they communicate largely through gesture, movement and expression. But they also suit cinematic forms that are focused on realistic spectacles as opposed to masterful narratives. The old truism \u2014 don\u2019t work with children or animals \u2014 speaks exactly to why they are the ideal stars of both early actualities and of contemporary Facebook videos. They can\u2019t be tamed, so it seems as if what they are doing is somehow natural and true.It\u2019s striking that with all of the technological advances that have allowed us to shoot and share video instantly, we\u2019ve returned to some of film\u2019s most original instincts. It wasn\u2019t long after the rise of Kinetoscope, actualities and the cinema of attraction that new technologies upended those early forms, giving way to feature-length narratives, talkies and Technicolor. It\u2019s unclear where social video innovation will take the form next, but if anything, modern video is moving in the opposite direction of cinema\u2019s rise: We keep cramming more spectacle and information into smaller and faster bits of entertainment, even discarding whole experiential possibilities \u2014 like audio tracks \u2014 if they seem to slow it down.As the online media industry continues along its much-discussed \u201cpivot to video,\u201d we\u2019ll see more and more of our online experiences churned into those hypervisual micro forms, as every inch of screen space gets recast as a flashing billboard. We can expect it all to come faster, brighter and flashier in the future \u2014 just maybe not louder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Undercover With the Alt-Right", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast September, Patrik Hermansson, a 25-year-old graduate student from Sweden, went undercover in the world of the extreme right. Posing as a student writing a thesis about the suppression of right-wing speech, he traveled from London to New York to Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 and into the heart of a dangerous movement that is experiencing a profound rejuvenation.As a result of the growing influence of the far-right social-media ecosystem, once-moribund hate groups in both the United States and Europe \u2014 groups that mostly existed long before \u201calt-right\u201d entered the vernacular \u2014 are enjoying a striking uptick in recruitment.This latest wave of potential members is young \u2014 teenage and 20-something men (they\u2019re mostly men) appear to be exhibiting interest in far-right ideas in numbers that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. These young men are being radicalized largely through the work of a popular group of new far-right internet personalities whose videos, blog posts and tweets have been consistently nudging the boundaries of acceptable conversation to the right \u2014 one of the explicit goals of racist extremists everywhere.And while \u201cglobalist\u201d may be one of the alt-right\u2019s favorite slurs, Hope Not Hate conclusively shows that the alt-right is itself now a global movement with regular interaction among far-right figures from Scotland to Sweden to Seattle.In Britain, Mr. Hermansson attended a private dinner of extremists where Greg Johnson, a reclusive leading American far-right figure who is editor in chief of Counter-Currents Publishing, explained the need to \u201cmainstream this stuff \u2014 or, more precisely, we need to bring the mainstream towards us.\u201dMr. Johnson later expressed confidence that this process is working. \u201cI see the upward curve in web traffic, and the upward trend in quality and quantity of younger people getting involved,\u201d he told Mr. Hermansson in conversation captured on hidden-camera footage. (During that same chat, he said he believed in ethnic homelands and favored telling Jews, \u201cYou need to go to Israel or we\u2019re going to freeze you out of our society.\u201d)This goal of mainstreaming is an abiding fixation of the far right, whose members are well aware of the problems their movement has had with attracting young people in recent decades. At one point in Mr. Hermansson\u2019s footage, Colin Robertson, a far-right YouTube personality who goes by the name Millennial Woes, explained to an older extremist the importance of putting forward a friendly, accessible face: \u201cIf we don\u2019t appear like angry misfits, then we will end up making friendships with people who don\u2019t agree with us,\u201d he said.Some of Mr. Hermansson\u2019s most arresting footage comes from a June meeting with Jason Reza Jorjani, a founder, along with the American white nationalist Richard Spencer and others, of the AltRight Corporation, an organization established to foster cooperation and coordination among alt-right groups in Europe and North America.Mr. Hermansson and Mr. Jorjani met at an Irish pub near the Empire State Building, where the baby-faced Mr. Jorjani imagined a near future in which, thanks to liberal complacency over the migration crisis, Europe re-embraces fascism: \u201cWe will have a Europe, in 2050, where the bank notes have Adolf Hitler, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great. And Hitler will be seen like that: like Napoleon, like Alexander, not like some weird monster who is unique in his own category \u2014 no, he is just going to be seen as a great European leader.\u201dMore shockingly, Mr. Jorjani bragged about his contacts in the American government. \u201cWe had connections in the Trump administration \u2014 we were going to do things!\u201d he said at one point. \u201cI had contacts with the Trump administration,\u201d he said at another.\u201cOur original vision was the alt-right would become like a policy group for the Trump administration,\u201d he explained, and the administration figure \u201cwho was the interface was Steve Bannon.\u201d Unfortunately, he told Mr. Hermansson, the political establishment was \u201cdisconnecting us from the Trump administration, almost completely.\u201d (In June, Mr. Bannon hadn\u2019t yet left the White House and returned to Breitbart, the popular and ardently pro-Trump far-right outlet he had led before his time working for Mr. Trump.)When I called Mr. Jorjani, he was cagier about his \u201cconnections\u201d and \u201ccontacts\u201d in the White House. All he meant, he said, was that he had been in touch with people who had a direct line to President Trump, though he wouldn\u2019t say who. Asked to comment, a White House spokeswoman said, \u201cWe have no knowledge of any conversations or contact with this person.\u201dEither way, Mr. Jorjani said, with the ousters of Michael Flynn in February and then Mr. Bannon in August, he now views the alt-right\u2019s efforts to carve out a place in the White House as having failed. (Mr. Jorjani resigned from the AltRight Corporation in August.)If Mr. Jorjani wasn\u2019t exaggerating to Mr. Hermansson, and he did have a relationship with White House officials, that would certainly be alarming. But even if he was exaggerating, it\u2019s still important to understand how messages like his could travel from the far reaches of the right-wing internet and all the way into \u2014 or close to, at least \u2014 the White House.The extreme alt-right are benefiting immensely from the energy being produced by a more moderate \u2014 but still far-right \u2014 faction known as the \u201calt-light.\u201dThe alt-light promotes a slightly softer set of messages. Its figures \u2014 such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson and Mike Cernovich \u2014 generally frame their work as part of an effort to defend \u201cthe West\u201d or \u201cWestern culture\u201d against supposed left-liberal dominance, rather than making explicitly racist appeals. Many of them, in fact, have renounced explicit racism and anti-Semitism, though they will creep up to the line of explicitly racist speech, especially when Islam and immigration are concerned.This apparent moderation partly explains why they tend to have much bigger online audiences than even the most important alt-right figures \u2014 and why Hope Not Hate describes them as \u201cless extreme, more dangerous.\u201d Alt-light sites like Breitbart, formerly home to Mr. Yiannopoulos, as well as Prison Planet, where Mr. Watson is editor at large, draw millions of readers and are key nodes in a hyperkinetic network that is endlessly broadcasting viral-friendly far-right news, rumors and incitement.Fluent in the language of online irony and absurdism, and adept at producing successful memes, alt-lighters have pulled off something remarkable: They\u2019ve made far-right ideas hip to a subset of young people, and framed themselves as society\u2019s forgotten underdogs. The alt-light provides its audience easy scapegoats for their social, economic and sexual frustrations: liberals and feminists and migrants and, of course, globalists.According to researchers, the key to hooking new recruits into any movement, and to getting them increasingly involved over time, is to simply give them activities to participate in. This often precedes any deep ideological commitment on the recruits\u2019 part and, especially early on, is more about offering them a sense of meaning and community than anything else.Intentionally or not, the far right has deftly applied these insights to the online world. Viewed through the filters of alt-light outlets like Breitbart and Prison Planet, or through Twitter feeds like Mr. Watson\u2019s, the world is a horror show of crimes by migrants, leftist censorship and attacks on common sense. And the best, easiest way to fight back is through social media.The newly initiated are offered many opportunities to participate directly. A teenager in a suburban basement can join a coordinated global effort to spread misinformation about Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s centrist president, in the hopes of helping far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Anyone who wants to do so can help spread the word about supposed mainstream media censorship of the Muslim \u201ccrime wave\u201d the far right says is ravaging Europe.These efforts \u2014 a click, a retweet, a YouTube comment \u2014 come to feel like important parts of an epochal struggle. The far right, once hemmed in by its own parochialism, has manufactured a worldwide online battlefield anyone with internet access can step into.And if you\u2019re one of those newcomers happily playing the part of infantryman in the \u201cmeme wars\u201d that rage daily, maybe, along the way, one of your new online Twitter buddies will say to you, \u201cMilo\u2019s O.K., but have you checked out this guy Greg Johnson?\u201d Or maybe they\u2019ll invite you to a closed online forum where ideas about how to protect Europe from Muslim migrants are discussed a bit more, well, frankly. Maybe, if you\u2019re really lucky, you\u2019ll eventually discover a whole new political movement to join.All of which can explain why members of the hard-core alt-right are watching the explosive success of their more moderate counterparts with open glee, unable to believe their good luck. \u201cI\u2019m just fighting less and less opposition to our sorts of ideas when they\u2019re spoken,\u201d Mr. Johnson, the Counter-Currents editor, told Mr. Hermansson. His optimism, unfortunately, appears to be well founded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Prepares to Brief Congress on Its Role in Election", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has become the latest Silicon Valley giant to become entangled in a widening investigation into how online social networks and technology products may have played a role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.On Friday evening, Google said it would cooperate with congressional inquiries into the election, days after Facebook and Twitter provided evidence to investigators of accounts on their networks that were linked to Russian groups. Google was called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Google has also begun an internal investigation into whether its advertising products and services were used as part of a Russia-linked influence campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the issue. Exactly when the inquiry began is not known, but it has been discussed inside Google over recent weeks, the person said.Google\u2019s search engine, with about a 90 percent market share, is an inescapable part of the internet, so it was no surprise that congressional investigators turned toward the company. Google is the only company that sells more digital advertising than Facebook, and its YouTube service is the go-to place for videos on the internet.On Thursday, Twitter said in a closed-door briefing for the Senate and House intelligence panels that it had found about 200 accounts \u2014 a fraction of the number of potentially compromised accounts found by outside researchers \u2014 that appeared to be linked to a Russian campaign to influence the election.What direction the congressional investigation into Google will take is not clear. Google is much larger than Facebook or Twitter, and it has a wide range of services that played a role in the dissemination of so-called fake news during the campaign.But it is not a social network like Facebook or Twitter, making it harder for blatantly untrue stories to catch on, or for public sentiment to be stirred up through carefully targeted posts.Google has, however, long dealt with people trying to game its search engine to highlight misleading information or use its AdSense advertising network to finance eye-catching but false news stories. YouTube is also fertile ground for offensive videos and misleading news stories.\u201cWe will of course cooperate with inquiries; we\u2019re looking into how we can help with any relevant information,\u201d Google said in a statement late Friday.Similar to the way content that receives more attention is often more heavily promoted on Facebook and Twitter, Google\u2019s search engine gives more weight to results that are more frequently clicked on. It is one of hundreds of factors that go into ranking links.The company has also been working on shutting access to AdSense for sites that spread misinformation. Google\u2019s ad network is widely used by other websites and is often their only source of revenue. AdSense allows marketers to target users by different criteria, but it does not offer the same detail as Facebook, which can slice and dice its audience by their interests, including political leanings.In late January, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from AdSense \u2014 a tiny number compared to the more than two million publishers registered on AdSense.At the time, Google said it reviewed 550 sites \u201csuspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations\u201d in November and December and took action against 340 of them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambodia\u2019s Opposition Chief Loses Immunity in Treason Case", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 Lawmakers voted on Monday to approve the prosecution of Cambodia\u2019s opposition leader on charges he committed treason in collusion with the United States.In a speech, the country\u2019s authoritarian premier, Hun Sen, said the treason evidence was so obvious that immunity did not apply. The main evidence prosecutors presented was an old video in which Kem Sokha described having received advice from American advisers on building a political movement.Mr. Kem Sokha has said he is innocent.The move against him came amid a growing crackdown on dissent that has focused on people and organizations linked to the United States, which the government has accused of trying to undermine its authority by fomenting revolution.In his speech, Mr. Hun Sen warned that the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party could be dissolved if it continued to stand behind Mr. Kem Sokha.Although Cambodia is nominally a democracy, Mr. Hun Sen, 65, has held power for 32 years and announced last week that he intended to continue as leader for at least another decade.The United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, told the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday that he was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d over the sudden arrest of Mr. Kem Sokha on Sept. 3 without a warrant, apparently in contravention of his constitutionally guaranteed parliamentary immunity.Monday\u2019s parliamentary vote was boycotted by opposition party lawmakers, some of whom have gone into hiding after being named as co-conspirators in pro-government media. Others spent the day traveling to visit Mr. Kem Sokha in the maximum-security prison near the Vietnamese border where he is being held.Their visit was blocked, said his daughter, Kem Monovithya, who added that his lawyers had also been prevented from seeing him.Phay Siphan, a government spokesman, said foreign powers, particularly the United States, needed to stop interfering in Cambodia and investigate their own actions, while critics of Mr. Kem Sokha\u2019s arrest should respect the rule of law.\u201cWe don\u2019t want any superpower or anyone to get involved in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cLet it go.\u201d\u201cIf Kem Sokha is involved with foreign agents, a foreign government, to topple the Cambodian government, that is treason,\u201d he added. \u201cDuring the 1960s they killed those people involved with the U.S., they shot them.\u201dA spokesman for the embassy declined to comment.Since mid-August, 32 FM broadcasters in 20 Cambodian provinces have been shut down, many of which carried programs by the United States-funded broadcasters Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, whose Phnom Penh offices are under investigation for tax violations.The Cambodia Daily, a respected English-language newspaper owned by an American family, was shut down last week after the government announced it owed $6.3 million in taxes. The Daily\u2019s owners say that the tax bill was spurious, and that they had not been properly audited.In response to their refusal to pay, they were sued by the government last week for tax evasion, an offense punishable by jail. One of them, Deborah Krisher-Steele, who lives in Tokyo, was also accused of defamation for criticizing the government\u2019s tax department. Her husband, Douglas Steele, lives in Cambodia and has been barred from leaving the country.The family also runs a charitable organization that runs education and health care projects, with a focus on building schools in rural Cambodia. On Sunday, they said their charity\u2019s bank accounts had been frozen by the Cambodian government, leaving them unable to pay 100 staff members and forcing them to suspend operations in 90 schools.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maybe Colin Kaepernick Is Just Not That Good", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingWhether or not Colin Kaepernick plays another down in the N.F.L., I\u2019m going to say that he can achieve more off a football field than he \u2014 or anyone else in the sport \u2014 can achieve on one.Football, in the larger scheme of things, is not that important. Kaepernick, meanwhile, has a message about crucial aspects of our frayed but hopefully repairable nation that will continue to grow. If he has the devotion to work for change, he could outclass Tom Brady, or any player you might name, as someone who did something that truly matters for future generations.But I thought it might be useful to at least consider something. The conventional wisdom is that Kaepernick, who opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers after last season and has yet to be signed by another team, does not have an N.F.L. job on account of his politics. In protest against racism and police brutality, he won\u2019t stand for the national anthem, and he\u2019s increasingly outspoken on social issues. Earlier this summer in a tweet he likened the police to members of the fugitive slave patrol. N.F.L. owners, the thinking goes, must be racists who don\u2019t like his politics \u2014 or cynical pragmatists who don\u2019t like that their racist fans don\u2019t like his politics.What seems to me more problematic than Kaepernick\u2019s not having a job is the general unwillingness to consider that this situation might be justified on the merits, given Kaepernick\u2019s current attributes, or lack thereof, as a quarterback, rather than assuming, as part of a kneejerk gospel of victimhood, that persecution must be the cause.It\u2019s not hard to make a statistical case for why Kaepernick is not playing now. He threw for a mere 187 yards a game last season, which was good enough for 30th (in a league of 32 teams). For his career, he has completed fewer than 60 percent of his passes. Last season, 24 passers completed more than 60 percent. Kaepernick, at 59.2 percent, was ranked 26th. If you\u2019re below 60 percent, you\u2019re a fringe guy.More damning, Kaepernick was not asked to make difficult throws; he\u2019s not a Matt Ryan-type quarterback, slinging the ball far down the field on deep crosses or challenging out routes. In the current iteration of the N.F.L., offense rules the day, with quarterbacks tasked to put up crooked numbers on the scoreboard. Kaepernick\u2019s job was to be a game manager, making the easiest, high-percentage throws. And he still struggled. What are you supposed to do with a guy like this? What can he do for you? Can he help you win?If Kaepernick deserves a spot in the league, it\u2019s only as a backup quarterback. And he will eventually get a job as one, I bet, once quarterbacks start getting hurt. But the fact that he doesn\u2019t have a job right now isn\u2019t shocking, and it doesn\u2019t have to be because N.F.L. owners are racists who are blackballing him.The older I get, the less I care about football, but I do care about merit, and things being seen for what they are. \u201cLife is,\u201d as Dostoyevsky wrote, and it is our job to figure out what the \u201cis\u201d is. I believe that\u2019s one of the core responsibilities of being human.We don\u2019t do this enough anymore. We don\u2019t ask the tough questions. We seek to align ourselves with what I think of as the \u201ccontrol voice\u201d \u2014 whatever piped-in monotone is dictating a given narrative at the moment. It\u2019s easy to feel good about yourself when you\u2019re patting yourself on the back for your inability to never fail to take the moral high ground, which everyone who agrees with you reinforces and enables, one Facebook \u201clike\u201d at a time. But there is nothing real about that.It doesn\u2019t matter that Kaepernick doesn\u2019t have a job; it matters that so few people even wonder if there might be a non-disgraceful explanation. We have become the anti-meritocracy. We resent those who outperform us, outwork us, outproduce us. And the person who has been perceived to have been slighted? He is whom we now adore.I\u2019d like to see Kaepernick get a job, because I find him interesting, and I\u2019d like to see if he can solve the flaws in his game as he nears 30. But I\u2019d like even more to see all of us challenge ourselves more, in ways that are more important to the world, and to ourselves, than whether or not someone gets a job taking an ill-advised sack, or throwing the ball out of bounds so he can live to play another down.Colin Fleming has written for Harper\u2019s, Rolling Stone and The Atlantic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "St. Louis Protests: Police Say They \u2018Owned\u2019 the Night After 80 Arrests", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. LOUIS \u2014 After a third night of protests following the acquittal of a white former St. Louis police officer in the fatal shooting of a black man, city officials early Monday were striking a more aggressive tone, with the acting police chief telling reporters that the police had \u201cowned\u201d the night.The police said they had arrested 80 people overnight after demonstrators knocked over concrete flower pots, trash cans and newspaper stands and threw rocks through windows of downtown businesses.\u201cI\u2019m proud to tell you the City of St. Louis is safe, and the police owned tonight,\u201d Lawrence O\u2019Toole, the acting chief, told reporters, adding later: \u201cWe\u2019re in control. This is our city, and we\u2019re going to protect it.\u201dThe demonstrations \u2014 largely peaceful during the days, then more volatile at night \u2014 continued Monday morning as a group of protesters marched through downtown. A day earlier, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the city\u2019s police headquarters and stood silent for six minutes \u2014 one for every year that has passed since the death of Anthony Lamar Smith, who was fatally shot in 2011 by Jason Stockley, then a St. Louis police officer.The shooting has been a matter of intense debate in St. Louis, but before this weekend it had drawn little attention elsewhere and the details of the case are not widely known outside the St. Louis region.Here are answers to some essential questions about the case, which was conducted without a jury.Prosecutors charged Mr. Stockley with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. They pointed to a remark Mr. Stockley made to his partner on the day of the shooting as evidence of premeditation. The officers\u2019s police sport-utility vehicle was racing after Mr. Smith\u2019s silver Buick, which had hit the police vehicle twice and fled at high speed, when a recording device inside the officers\u2019 vehicle captured Mr. Stockley saying he was \u201cgoing to kill\u201d the driver, \u201cdon\u2019t you know it.\u201dProsecutors also suggested that Mr. Stockley had planted a gun inside Mr. Smith\u2019s car after the chase ended and Mr. Smith lay dead, shot five times. Video showed that Mr. Stockley returned to his own police S.U.V. immediately after shooting Mr. Smith, and only later found a handgun tucked inside Mr. Smith\u2019s car. Mr. Stockley\u2019s DNA was later found on that gun, but Mr. Smith\u2019s DNA was not.The defense team said Mr. Stockley had plenty of reasons to know that Mr. Smith had a gun. Mr. Stockley testified that he had seen a gun in Mr. Smith\u2019s hand inside the Buick after he initially approached Mr. Smith over a suspected drug deal in a parking lot, before the high-speed chase began. Mr. Stockley said that his partner also had yelled \u201cGun!\u201d to signal that Mr. Smith had a weapon.When the fatal confrontation occurred a short time later, after the high-speed chase, Mr. Stockley said, Mr. Smith was reaching for something as the officers stood at his driver\u2019s side window, and he assumed it was a gun.The defense rejected suggestions that the officer had planted anything. After the shooting, Mr. Stockley went back to the police vehicle to get a medical dressing that slows bleeding, they said, not to get an extra gun. An expert testified that someone can hold a gun and not leave DNA on it, so the absence of Mr. Smith\u2019s DNA on the gun was not proof that he had not held it.In the end, Judge Timothy Wilson of the St. Louis Circuit acquitted Mr. Stockley on Friday morning, saying he was \u201csimply not firmly convinced of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201dProtesters gathered within minutes of the verdict, and they have marched each day since then, in downtown streets, entertainment districts and a suburban mall. The marchers have included people of a wide range of ages and of different races, and their numbers and makeup have shifted significantly at various points during the weekend.Most demonstrators have been peaceful, but there have been violent incidents after dark each night. At least 11 law enforcement officers have been injured, the mayor\u2019s house was vandalized and windows were broken at several businesses and a public library.The rock band U2 and the singer Ed Sheeran canceled concerts that were scheduled for downtown St. Louis, citing security concerns, and many school districts in the region canceled weekend activities.Elected leaders, protesters and other residents of this region are deeply aware of the area\u2019s early role in the current national debate over how police officers treat black people. The region became the focal point of that debate in 2014 following the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man who was shot by police in Ferguson, one of the many small municipalities that surround St. Louis.The region\u2019s top elected offices \u2014 governor of Missouri and mayor of St. Louis \u2014 have both changed hands since the events in Ferguson.Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican who took office this year, has repeatedly criticized his Democratic predecessor\u2019s approach to the protests that followed the Ferguson shooting, saying that while peaceful marchers should be respected, if \u201cyou break a window, you\u2019re going to be behind bars.\u201dThe mayor of St. Louis, Lyda Krewson, a Democrat, has taken a less confrontational approach, even though her own house was vandalized during the demonstrations on Friday.She seemed to try to convey a sense of normalcy in the city, while also promising to address protesters\u2019 concerns. Before the protests on Saturday night, she said that \u201cI think it\u2019s quite safe right now,\u201d and that the weekend\u2019s events showed the need for \u201ccoming together to have a better St. Louis for all of us.\u201dEarly Monday, she told reporters she had seen that \u201cthe vast majority of protesters are nonviolent. But for the third day in a row, the days have been calm and the nights have been destructive.\u201d She added later: \u201cA group of agitators stayed behind, apparently intent on breaking windows and destroying property. This is not acceptable. We have work to do here in the city. We need more and better opportunities for all of our citizens. But destruction cannot be tolerated.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about protests in St. Louis following the acquittal of a former police officer in a murder case misidentified the defendant at one point. He is Jason Stockley, not Anthony Lamar Smith. (Mr. Smith was the victim).Tim O\u2019Neil reported from St. Louis, and Monica Davey from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Slovak Village Prospers in Partnership With Roma Residents It Once Shunned", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPISSKY HRHOV, Slovakia \u2014 In a part of eastern Slovakia where other villages are withering, Spissky Hrhov shows signs of surprising prosperity. The houses are solid and well-tended. There is running water and electricity. A former distillery has been turned into an art space, its facade decorated with a colorful mosaic.\u201cTwenty years ago, this village nearly disappeared,\u201d said Vladimir Ledecky, 51, who has been mayor for 18 of those years.\u201cWe were down to 700 residents, half of them Roma,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe problem for Slovak villages is that when the population becomes half Roma, the other half tends to move out.\u201dThat is when Mr. Ledecky decided to take what is still a novel and controversial approach to the Roma in his country \u2014 working to better integrate them with the community.When Mr. Ledecky and a few young residents took over the village council in 1998, the Roma lived in shacks without electricity, almost all were unemployed and a fifth of the children were in so-called special schools that taught them little and segregated them.Now, unemployment among the Roma is down to 20 percent, no children are sent to separate schools and three Roma residents are in college.The situation for Roma has improved vastly in the village, said Petronela Kacova, 27, who lives in one of the Roma neighborhood\u2019s newest apartment blocks with her husband and two young children. Until she got this new home, the family had to share one room in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. Now, she said, relations are cordial between Roma and non-Roma residents, unlike in other nearby villages.\u201cThe children know each other in school, so they play together,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we sometimes sit together, Slovaks and Roma, when we are at the pub together.\u201dSlovakia, a country of about five million people, officially has 150,000 Roma citizens, though Mr. Ravasz said the real number was closer to 450,000.There are 1,100 officially recognized Roma communities in Slovakia, most of them in the central and eastern parts of the country, which are more rural and impoverished.Of those, Mr. Ravasz said, only about 10 or 20 have mayors like Mr. Ledecky.\u201cIn Hrhov, the Roma start their lives in a brick house, with running water,\u201d Mr. Ravasz said. \u201cThey go to kindergarten. As they grow up, they see their parents working.\u201dMany Roma elsewhere have few, if any, of those advantages.\u201cThey are born into segregated communities, far from civilization,\u201d Mr. Ravasz said. \u201cThey are the fifth of eight children, living in a shanty with no running water. Their parents don\u2019t work. They are sent to special classes almost automatically.\u201dMr. Ledecky said that when he and his friends \u2014 many of whom still serve as town officials \u2014 took control of the local council they knew they would have to work with the Roma if they wanted to stop the village from vanishing.\u201cThere was nothing to do if people had no jobs,\u201d said the mayor, who is a former software engineer. \u201cSo, the only thing to do was to set up a village company, the only aim of which was to provide Roma with jobs. We didn\u2019t want to have any profit.\u201d\u201cWe grew so fast and started making a profit, so we kept expanding,\u201d Mr. Ledecky said.A shop selling local cheese and sausage was opened on the highway at the edge of town. Herbal teas and apples were grown, dried and sold. An old lumber mill was leased out with the condition that the village gets all the sawdust, which it turns into biofuel pellets.One by one, the former illegal Roma shanties were turned into legal brick homes and apartment blocks that the Roma either owned or rented. A new town hall was built. Wooden sculptures and colorful mosaics decorated the new town center. A village swimming pool was built with the profits from the businesses, and a new park is underway.Residents from nearby cities and villages began to move into Spissky Hrhov, drawn by its growing reputation and land prices kept low to encourage newcomers.Even foreign buyers showed up. A man from London built a vacation villa. A Dutch family moved to the village. Land discounts were no longer required.\u201cThe village has become so trendy, people are just coming,\u201d Mr. Ledecky said.For one thing, the village\u2019s own Roma residents have proved vigilant about keeping out illegal shanties, eager to protect their own neighborhood and steady jobs.\u201cWe discourage them,\u201d said Ivan Kacur, 36, a Roma who has worked for the village company for two years, cutting grass. \u201cThey have their own culture and habits. We wouldn\u2019t want that here. I\u2019ve got a mortgage and a new home, a real home.\u201dThe contrast to Spissky Hrhov\u2019s success can be seen just a few miles away in Roskovce, an illegal settlement of about 500 Roma spread along a narrow ravine.Two outdoor water pumps serve all of Roskovce\u2019s residents. Homes are falling down, half-finished, with gaping holes for windows and crumbling roofs. Mr. Ledecky, who is building a new school for the settlement, has hired a few of its residents, but many more are eager to join the village\u2019s work force.\u201cThis has really changed our community,\u201d Mr. Ledecky said. \u201cThe majority no longer have any problem with the Roma from our village. At the same time, they do not feel the same about Roma from other villages. I can\u2019t understand why this racism persists.\u201dIndeed, the success of villages like Spissky Hrhov is not welcome by everyone. As the number of Muslim refugees passing through Central Europe has dwindled, nationalists and neo-fascists have again made the Roma a target.\u201cThey have redirected their anger against the Roma again,\u201d said Irena Bihariova, chairwoman of People Against Racism, a human-rights group based in Bratislava, the capital. \u201cThings neo-Nazis wouldn\u2019t dare say in public are now being said all over the place, on Facebook, without fear.\u201dShe pointed to a series of marches against \u201csocial parasites,\u201d as the right-wing describes the Roma, organized by Marian Kotleba, the neo-fascist governor of the Banska Bystrica region not far from Spissky Hrhov.\u201cThe Roma here are better, of course, more tidy,\u201d said Milan Dzurnak, 52, as he worked on a fence outside his home. \u201cBut they are still different. I never mingle with them.\u201dMiroslava Germanova contributed reporting from Bratislava.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brevity Is the Soul of Twit", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBack in Twitter\u2019s early days, there was a lot of parodying what would come next. My favorite was Flutter, 26 characters \u2014 one for each letter of the alphabet \u2014 marking the brave, new world of nanoblogging.Compared to other social media platforms, Twitter\u2019s flirtation with 280 characters is hardly indulgent. The character limit for a Facebook status is 63,206. That number was difficult to type, let alone fathom. It\u2019s no wonder that Facebook posts end up being fully unhinged rants, diatribes, soapboxes, pleas, meltdowns and valedictorian speeches. We all have those people in our newsfeed who can\u2019t express a thought without multiple paragraphs and a subtext, even if that subtext is just \u201cI don\u2019t care that much about keeping this administrative temp job.\u201dEven though Instagram chiefly trades in photos and videos, it allows for 2,200 characters on posts. Somewhere, the New Yorker cartoon caption contest just shuddered. Even the oft-mocked LinkedIn allows for a bounteous 600 characters to provide alluring professional updates that beckon like sirens to potential networking contacts.When you post a rant on Twitter, it\u2019s pre-masticated into pull quotes, and fed to you, the reader, baby bird-style. It\u2019s almost as if the person\u2019s argument is buffering, until you get to the next installment. The medium forces one to stick to the point.According to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey (@jack), the original 140-character-limit was arbitrary \u2014 a slight shortening of the 160-character SMS limit. But the reason so many of us loved the app was that it was, from its inception, a celebration of something people on the internet generally do very poorly: self-editing.Sure, it was met with derision at first by English professors and \u201cinfluencers.\u201d We were told it marked the demise of the written word, that in a generation we\u2019d all devolve into illiterate cave men. What are you even supposed to share in 140 characters? What you had for lunch? For some reason, this example frequently came up when people justified why they refused to join Twitter at first. \u201cOh, Twitter\u2019s not for me. I don\u2019t get it. What do I write? That I\u2019m eating a sandwich?\u201d Well, if that\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you decide what to share with the world, then yeah, sure, maybe hold off.At a fundamental level, humans love short bursts of repetition, at least going by the popularity of the GIF, and similarly, the hallmark of a solid tweet is something that can be read over and over, yet maintain the inherent gravity, beauty, or humor of its initial transmission.At the risk of comparing yet another thing to jazz, Twitter has always been the jazz of the internet. It\u2019s just as much about what you can\u2019t fit as what you can.In a world where people can\u2019t stop railing about free speech while simultaneously, indirectly undermining their own arguments, there is a certain value in enforcing limits. If anything, Twitter has erred on the side of giving abuse and vitriol an overly generous sounding board. Imagine if all those trolls had 280 characters.One-hundred-and-forty characters is all a person needs. Well, that and the mute button.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Explore a City Like a Local Using Your Smartphone", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTest RunIt\u2019s now easier than ever to get travel advice from locals, and you don\u2019t even have to talk to them in person.Sure, you can still ask a stranger where to find some good sushi, but there is no guarantee they will be interested in, or qualified to, help you.Thankfully, there are several smartphone apps that cut out those potentially awkward moments but still provide valuable recommendations from those in the know.The three I tested out recently while roaming the streets of New York all had something to offer \u2014 though some were more useful than others.This app costs $3.99 per city (67 major cities are available worldwide), while the others are, for the most part, free. But you get what you pay for: this was the most well-rounded of the three I tried. One of its many perks is that it runs entirely offline, so you do not need to stress about data usage.I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.The advice for each location is the perfect length \u2014 detailed but not overwhelming, and the \u201cNearby\u201d tab on the map makes it easy to scope out places wherever you are.This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don\u2019t have any cool cousins of their own.The app seems geared toward younger travelers \u2014 it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare \u2014 and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what\u2019s nearby.The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually \u2014 think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a \u201cspecial tip\u201d for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: \u201cCome early because the restaurant\u2019s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore \u2014 though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.There\u2019s also an option to \u201cask locals,\u201d which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did. These are not underappreciated landmarks, but not necessarily bad places to check out if you\u2019ve never been.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brutal Competition, Island to Island, in Sweden", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt dawn on Monday, 300 athletes from 24 countries donned wetsuits, swim caps, goggles, hand paddles and running shoes, and dove into the surf off Sandhamn Island, Sweden. (Yes, in their shoes, too.)Like many a grand adventure race, the original \u00d6till\u00f6 (Swedish for island to island) was hatched as a bar bet among four friends in 2002. They covered the distance in 28 hours.In 2006, Michael Lemmel, a veteran adventure racer, took over and turned it into a formal event, but it was still the only race of its kind, an adventurous version of the typical aquathlon, featuring frigid swims, multiple transitions and cross-country running terrain covering much longer distances.Today\u2019s version, the pinnacle of a rapidly growing sport with 450 Swimrun races worldwide, follows most of the original route, through forests, villages and farmland, not to mention one particularly tumultuous stretch of the Baltic Sea.There are 52 swim-run transitions. Athletes race in pairs (Roll raced with his longtime coach, Chris Hauth), swimming a total of 10 kilometers (six miles) and running 65 (40 miles), including a half-marathon deep into the race. The course record is just under eight hours.Despite frigid water temperatures in the high 50s, the swims were easy for Roll, a member of two national title teams as a Stanford swimmer in the mid 1980s, and they were mesmerizing, the water often teeming with undulating jellyfish. He\u2019s also a veteran distance runner, but he had never dealt with the kind of terrain he found on Monday, made more complicated by slanting rain.\u201cWhen you finish a swim you land on these giant rock slabs, which are incredibly slippery,\u201d Roll said by phone after the race. Most of the shoreline amounted to slick boulders and loose rocks, he said. One athlete bashed his knee; another split his chin. Both had to quit early, among several who bowed out as the day wore on. \u201cThe whole thing is an obstacle course.\u201dCompetitors scrambled up sloped, granite cliffs that led to tangled forests, thick with brush camouflaging fallen trees, or muddy bogs with head-high reeds. About 90 minutes into the race, Roll\u2019s legs were cramping, and when the terrain finally evened out onto gravel roads and tarmac, he could barely move. Roll, 5-feet-11 and 165 pounds, is a two-time Ultraman (an endurance race in which athletes swim, bike and run 320 miles over three days) finisher but, in Sweden, nature had humbled him.\u201cI thought I was in danger of not finishing,\u201d he said.The finish line, on the isle of Ut\u00f6, is on the doorstep of the bar where this caper was imagined, which is poetic because, like the race itself, Roll\u2019s story also has a boozy beginning.His 2012 memoir, \u201cFinding Ultra,\u201d is an intimate account of his three-act metamorphosis from alcoholic entertainment lawyer with two arrests for drunken driving, to a 208-pound sober couch potato, to vegan ultra-athlete.The athletic turn occurred when, after his 40th birthday, he picked up cycling and running, then started swimming again, and stopped eating animal products.\u201cThe pounds melted off,\u201d he said, \u201cand I began thinking, if I could turn things around so quickly, how far can I take this? That\u2019s what set in motion this domino effect.\u201dIncluded in his \u201cdomino effect\u201d was the EPIC 5, one of the most difficult endurance events. In 2010, he and fellow Ultraman, Jason Patrick Lester, completed five Ironman distance triathlons (swim 2.4 miles, bike 112 miles, run 26 miles) in just seven days.In 2012 he started the Rich Roll Podcast to share what he had learned and to discuss wellness, training and risk with a wide range of guests. He has interviewed the Hall of Fame basketball coach and civil rights activist George Raveling; the Olympic gold medalist and volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings; and the musician Travis Barker, along with humanitarian aid innovators, yoga gurus, best-selling authors, football players and more than a few endurance athletes and adventurers. His most downloaded episode features David Goggins, a former Navy SEAL who overcame poverty, racism and obesity to become an endurance racing champion.\u201cThat conversation was mind-blowing,\u201d said Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, among the boldface names who follow Roll\u2019s podcast. \u201cIt was so inspiring and so raw, unlike anything I\u2019d ever heard.\u201dBut it is not just the size of the audience that\u2019s notable, it is the people he has reached.\u201cHe\u2019s had a huge influence on me,\u201d said Shaka Smart, the head basketball coach at the University of Texas. After tuning into Roll\u2019s podcast at the suggestion of a friend. Smart became vegetarian. \u201cWhat\u2019s intriguing about him, beyond the physical part of it, is it seems like he\u2019s having a ton of success doing what so many of us coaches are trying to do, and that\u2019s helping others become the best version of themselves, and at the same time trying to become the best version of ourselves.\u201d\u201cI think his power lies in his authenticity,\u201d Walsh Jennings said. \u201cHe\u2019s a total story of triumph through adversity. It\u2019s really empowering.\u201d At 39, after missing out on the gold in Rio, some were surprised that Walsh Jennings didn\u2019t retire, and instead set her sights on Tokyo. \u201cRich is part of my inspiration when I hear people say, \u2018You\u2019re 39 years old, what are you doing competing against 20-year-olds?\u2019\u201dStill, despite the following from luminaries, he says that what motivates him is everyday fans. \u201cI get messages from people who feel alone, and live in places where these ideas are not part of the local culture,\u201d he said.Those are the people Roll was thinking of when he decided to get back in race shape last November after a five-year hiatus. Hauth helped him ramp up training, and by summer Roll was running 35 miles at a clip, and hammering collegiate-level 6,000-yard pool workouts the day after running a marathon. He kept his audience updated by discussing his training on his podcast, Facebook Live streams and Instagram posts and stories.Roll said he pushed through pain and discomfort again on Monday, and in the final two miles of the race, which ended with a steep, quad-busting 600-meter (1,968 feet) trek on Ut\u00f6, he finally found his rhythm. He and Hauth, 47, finished as the top American team, in just under 11 hours (10:44:46), nearly three hours behind the champions, Jesper Svensson and Daniel Hansson, who competed for the Swedish Armed Forces and broke the course record despite the poor conditions.Though it took longer than expected, Roll was proud to have finished what he called, \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d And he said the race confirmed something he often talks about when it comes to training, racing and life.\u201cThe main thing is realizing that even if you feel terrible for a while, that\u2019s not how you\u2019re going to feel the whole time,\u201d he said. \u201cThings change if you just keep moving.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Push for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say It\u2019s Gone Too Far", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "After revelations of harassment and bias in Silicon Valley, a backlash is growing against the women in tech movement.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Their complaints flow on Reddit forums, on video game message boards, on private Facebook pages and across Twitter. They argue for everything from male separatism to an end to gender diversity efforts.Silicon Valley has for years accommodated a fringe element of men who say women are ruining the tech world.One of those who said there had been a change is James Altizer, an engineer at the chip maker Nvidia. Mr. Altizer, 52, said he had realized a few years ago that feminists in Silicon Valley had formed a cabal whose goal was to subjugate men. At the time, he said, he was one of the few with that view.Now Mr. Altizer said he was less alone. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few people going through that in Silicon Valley right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploding. It\u2019s mostly young men, younger than me.\u201dMr. Altizer said that a gathering he hosts in person and online to discuss men\u2019s issues had grown by a few dozen members this year to more than 200, that the private Facebook pages he frequents on men\u2019s rights were gaining new members and that a radical subculture calling for total male separatism was emerging.\u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d he said in a phone interview, contending men are being fired by \u201cdangerous\u201d human resources departments. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a soundproof booth right now because I\u2019m afraid someone will hear me. When you\u2019re discussing gender issues, it\u2019s almost religious, the response. It\u2019s almost zealotry.\u201dMr. Altizer is part of a backlash against the women in technology movement. While many in the tech industry had previously dismissed the fringe men\u2019s rights arguments, some investors, executives and engineers are now listening. Though studies and surveys show there is no denying the travails women face in the male-dominated industry, some said that the line for what counted as harassment had become too easy to cross and that the push for gender parity was too extreme a goal. Few were willing to talk openly about their thinking, for fear of standing out in largely progressive Silicon Valley.Even so, \u201cwitch hunt\u201d is the new whispered meme. Some in tech have started identifying as \u201ccontrarians,\u201d to indicate subtly that they do not follow the \u201cdiversity dogma.\u201d And self-described men\u2019s rights activists in Silicon Valley said their numbers at meetings were rising.Others are playing down the women-in-tech issue. Onstage at a recent event, the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said harassment in Silicon Valley was \u201crarer than in most other businesses.\u201dMany men now feel like \u201cthere\u2019s a gun to the head\u201d to be better about gender issues, said Rebecca Lynn, a venture capitalist at Canvas Ventures, and while \u201cthere\u2019s a high awareness right now, which is positive, at the same time there\u2019s a fear.\u201d\u201cIn just the last 48 hours, I\u2019ve spoken to a female tech executive who was grabbed by a male C.E.O. at a large event and another female executive who was asked to interview at a venture fund because they \u2018feel like they need to hire a woman,\u2019\u201d said Dick Costolo, the former chief of Twitter, who now runs the fitness start-up Chorus. \u201cWe should worry about whether the women-in-tech movement has gone too far sometime after a couple of these aren\u2019t regularly happening anymore.\u201dAfter months of apologizing by Silicon Valley for bad behavior, here was a young man whom some in tech\u2019s leadership could potentially get behind.Paul Graham, who founded an influential start-up incubator, Y Combinator, posted two articles about how the science behind Mr. Damore\u2019s memo was accurate. Another start-up investor, John Durant, wrote that \u201cCharles Darwin himself would be fired from Google for his views on the sexes.\u201dAnd the investor Peter Thiel\u2019s business partner, Eric Weinstein, tweeted, \u201cDear @Google, Stop teaching my girl that her path to financial freedom lies not in coding but in complaining to HR.\u201dMr. Durant declined to comment. Mr. Graham said in an email that there needed to be more distinction between fact and policy, and Mr. Weinstein said there was \u201ca sea of brilliant women\u201d and that more needed to be done to \u201cfigure out how to more fully empower them.\u201dNow men\u2019s rights advocates in Silicon Valley have galvanized.\u201cWhat Google did was wake up sectors of society that weren\u2019t into these issues before,\u201d said Paul Elam, who runs A Voice for Men, a men\u2019s rights group. He said his organization had seen more interest from people in Silicon Valley.Silicon Valley has always been a men\u2019s space, others said. Warren Farrell, who lives in Marin County, Calif., and whose 1993 book, \u201cThe Myth of Male Power,\u201d birthed the modern men\u2019s rights movement, said, \u201cThe less safe the environment is for men, the more they will seek little pods of safety like the tech world.\u201dThis turn in the gender conversation is good news for Mr. Damore. \u201cThe emperor is naked,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSince someone said it, now it\u2019s become sort of acceptable.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe whole idea that diversity improves workplace output, it\u2019s not scientifically decided that that\u2019s true.\u201dMr. Damore filed a labor complaint against Google in August and said more than 20 people had reached out about joining together for a class-action suit about systemic discrimination against men. He is represented by Harmeet Dhillon, a local firebrand lawyer.\u201cIt\u2019s become fashionable in Silicon Valley for people like James, a white man, to be put into a category of less desirable for promotion and advancement,\u201d Ms. Dhillon said. \u201cSome companies have hiring goals like \u2018We\u2019ll give you a bonus if you\u2019re a hiring manager and you hire 70 percent women to this organization.\u2019 That\u2019s illegal.\u201dGoogle declined to comment.\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a mission from God to set the world straight, it\u2019s easy to go too far,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cThere was no control over women hiring women.\u201dHe said that his clients, Greg Anderson and Scott Ard, had faced gender discrimination in Yahoo\u2019s media teams and that other teams like cars were headed by women, which to Mr. Parsons was a sign of problems.\u201cNo eyebrows are going to rise if a woman heads up fashion,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cBut we\u2019re talking about women staffing positions \u2014 things like autos \u2014 where it cannot be explained other than manipulation.\u201dThose leading Silicon Valley\u2019s gender equality push said they were astonished that just as the movement was having an impact, it opened up an even more radical men\u2019s rights perspective.\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Joelle Emerson, who runs Paradigm, a company that designs diversity strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s created divides that I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201dCassie Jaye, who lives in Marin County and made a documentary about the men\u2019s rights movement called \u201cThe Red Pill,\u201d said that the tech world and the men\u2019s rights community had \u201csnowballed\u201d together and that the rise in the number of people in Mgtow is new.On the Mgtow message boards, members discuss work (\u201cEver work for a woman? Roll up your sleeves and share your horror story\u201d), technology (\u201cThe stuff girlfriends and wives can\u2019t stand \u2014 computers, games, consoles\u201d) and dating (mostly best practices to avoid commitment).\u201cI think there are a lot of guys living this lifestyle without naming it, and then they find Mgtow,\u201d said Ms. Jaye, who calls herself a former feminist.Mr. Altizer leads Bay Area Fathers\u2019 Rights, a monthly support group for men to talk about the issues they uniquely face. He became interested in the community after a divorce and said his eyes were opened to how few rights men have. As for the numbers of women in tech, the effort for parity is absurd, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve been on the hiring side for years,\u201d Mr. Altizer said, adding that he is not currently hiring people. \u201cIt would be nice to have women, but you cannot find applicants.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There\u2019s no professional sports.\u201dThe California State University, Fresno campus is situated more than 150 miles from both of California\u2019s main professional sports hubs, Los Angeles and the Bay Area.As a result, residents tend to adhere to a patchwork of allegiances to the Raiders, Giants, Dodgers and other teams.\u201cBut those are all kind of secondary,\u201d said Paul Loeffler, a sports broadcaster in Fresno.The Bulldogs, he said, \u201creally are the focal point not just for the Fresno community, but this whole San Joaquin Valley region.\u201dSupporters have had plenty to cheer about in the past as the relatively small program in the Mountain West Conference managed to attract outsize talent.Lately, however, the Bulldogs football squad has been slumping. Last year, it won just one game, prompting the coach to be fired and the attendance at home games to thin out.Even so, it\u2019s a new season, and excitement was in no short supply at the opener last Saturday.Fresno\u2019s biggest star, Mr. Carr, now an Oakland Raider, was on hand to see his No. 4 jersey retired in a halftime ceremony.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The California Highway Patrol\u2019s Oakland office is clearly having fun on Twitter.Interspersed between posts about investigations and public safety, are others that are firmly tongue-in-cheek.\u201cThis morning our officers stopped a doe for toll evasion, on the Bay Bridge. She said she usually pays it, but today she was a buck short.\u201dThe tweet was favorited more than 100,000 times.The man behind the account is Officer Matthew Hamer, 32, who took the public information officer job in Oakland, along with Twitter duties, in July.In an interview, he said his superiors gave him the green light to inject his own personality into his tweets.For Officer Hamer, that\u2019s meant a lot of so-called \u201cdad jokes,\u201d the pun-heavy sort that makes children\u2019s eyes roll.\u201cEspecially with what we do, not everything is going to be happy-go-lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a little bit of humor that I can add to a post, best case it makes someone\u2019s day better, worst case they don\u2019t feel any different about it.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "World Leaders Urge Big Tech to Police Terrorist Content", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The establishment was challenging the disrupters: Get your algorithms to stop terrorists from using the internet.At an unusual session on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, leaders of one powerful government after another told the leaders of some of the most powerful internet companies to intensify their efforts to take down terrorist propaganda.Sometimes the government officials displayed na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how technology works. Other times, they sidestepped the more difficult questions, like how to distinguish between free expression and incitement to violence. They ignored the impassioned debates over what constitutes a terrorist. And they said little about how to address other kinds of hate speech \u2013 including posts that could incite racist or sexist violence. Both prevail on the internet.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, one of the hosts of the event late Wednesday afternoon, pressed internet companies to put their army of bots to work to take down terrorist content. \u201cIndustry needs to go further and faster in automating the detection and removal of terrorist content online, and developing technological solutions which prevent it being uploaded in the first place,\u201d she said.Mrs. May said \u201chomegrown perpetrators\u201d had been radicalized online. And she took aim at encrypted messaging apps, which she said terrorist groups had used to \u201cplan, direct and coordinate\u201d their attacks, including in Britain in recent months.A joint statement, endorsed by Britain, France and Italy, said international leaders had \u201cchallenged\u201d Silicon Valley to build technology aimed at ensuring that internet users \u201ctempted by violent extremism are not exposed to content that reinforces their extremist inclination \u2013 so-called algorithmic confinement.\u201dThe prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, urged big companies to help small companies, especially those that offer users ways to communicate anonymously.Julie Bishop, the foreign minister of Australia, said she valued free expression. But the internet, she said, \u201ccannot be an ungoverned space where terrorists operate.\u201dBut the success of terrorist groups in exploiting social media platforms to promote their agendas is now putting internet brands in an uncomfortable position, and the industry has been forced to address the problem.At Wednesday\u2019s event, called the Leaders Meeting on Preventing Terrorist Use of the Internet, representatives of the world\u2019s most prominent technology companies described how they have been responding. They rushed to demonstrate what they were doing to take down terrorist propaganda from their platforms and pledged to do more.Facebook said that it was using artificial intelligence to identify when \u201cterrorist imagery\u201d was uploaded to the site, and that it had established a special team to assist with law enforcement requests for information about terrorist attacks.Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook, said the company had 150 people, including engineers and language specialists, \u201cworking primarily to counter terrorism.\u201d\u201cWe maintain a specialized terrorist threat team that responds within minutes to emergency requests from law enforcement,\u201d said Ms. Bickert, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cAnd if we become aware of a credible threat of real world harm, we proactively reach out to authorities and inform them.\u201dTwitter\u2019s annual transparency report took pains to say that Twitter had taken down more than 935,000 accounts in roughly the last two years, and that most of those had been detected by the company\u2019s own tools, before anyone flagged them.Google said it was targeting messages intended to change the minds of those who searching for what the company identifiesas terrorist content.But the companies also cautioned that technology alone was insufficient for the task. Machines cannot always distinguish between what is dangerous and what has social value, they said. Videos uploaded to YouTube by human rights groups to show atrocities, for example, were once taken down mistakenly, said Kent Walker, general counsel at Google, which owns YouTube.\u201cMachines,\u201d he said, \u201care not yet at the stage where they can replace human judgment.\u201d And Mr. Walker offered a sobering note of caution. \u201cThere is no magic computer program,\u201d he told the room of foreign dignitaries, \u201cto eliminate terrorist content.\u201dThe joint statement by Britain, France and Italy implicitly acknowledged how vexing the problem is.\u201cNo individual nation state can respond to this threat alone,\u201d they said. \u201cThe response must be global, and it must be collaborative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Portrait of the Artist in Putin\u2019s Russia", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe official version in the indictment raises many questions. One of the accusations prosecutors made during early hearings has to do with Mr. Serebrennikov\u2019s staging of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d for which his theater received state culture funds. The prosecution contends that Mr. Serebrennikov failed to mount the production. When publicity posters for the show and newspaper reviews of it were presented as evidence in court, one of the prosecutors said that he does not believe what he reads in the papers.Mr. Serebrennikov\u2019s arrest seems less bizarre when put into context. In recent years, Russian officials have said that if an artist receives state funding, then he must do only what is in the state\u2019s interest. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, put it plainly last year: \u201cIf the state gives money for a production, the state has the right to determine its theme.\u201d The Russian state\u2019s taste runs toward films, performances and exhibitions dedicated to the heroic past of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. Mr. Serebrennikov, as one of the leaders of the theatrical avant-garde, is like a fifth wheel in the new official cultural value system of Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia.In recent years, arrests in Russia have often given the impression of being politically motivated. But until now, cultural figures have been spared. Before Mr. Serebrennikov, the most famous theater director to be imprisoned was Vsevolod Meyerhold, who was arrested under orders from Stalin and shot in 1940 and to whom Mr. Serebrennikov is now being compared.This might seem like an exaggeration \u2014 after all, Mr. Serebrennikov was put under house arrest, which is not quite the same as being shot to death. But the comparison seems apt if you take note that both Meyerhold and Mr. Serebrennikov were not necessarily dissidents or standard-bearers of artistic freedom.This is the most unpleasant conclusion to draw from Mr. Serebrennikov\u2019s situation. Even now, with the regime speaking to artists for the first time in the language of arrests and trials, there is practically no one in the Russian cultural community willing to stand up to the government. These artists have no desire for confrontation; they want to play a loyalist role that allows them relative freedom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Belated Awakening", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChastened by criticism that Facebook had turned a blind eye to Russia\u2019s manipulation of the social network to interfere in the 2016 election, the company\u2019s executives now acknowledge a need to do better and have promised to be more transparent about who is paying for political ads. That\u2019s a good start, but more is required \u2014 of Facebook, of social media giants generally and of Congress.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s concern about democracy is commendable, and some of the changes he announced could have a positive impact. But they apply only to his company and can be easily evaded. Disclosing the name of Facebook business accounts placing political ads, for instance, will be of little value if purchasers can disguise their real identity \u2014 calling themselves, say, Americans for Motherhood and Apple Pie. Further, even if Facebook succeeds in driving away foreign propaganda, the same material could pop up on Twitter or other social media sites.More comprehensive safeguards will need intervention from Congress, which could begin by passing a law requiring online political ads \u2014 those that mention candidates seeking office or that advocate for certain political outcomes \u2014 to disclose who paid for them. Congress should also require internet companies to preserve the ads, and data about the groups the ads were targeted against, to help investigators looking into illicit activities. Two Democratic senators \u2014 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia \u2014 are planning to introduce a bill with some of these ideas.Of course, legislation cannot completely protect American elections from outside interference. It was already illegal for foreigners to purchase political ads when Russian agents started their Facebook campaign. Stronger enforcement of those rules would help, but that would require broader reforms, like replacing the Federal Election Commission, a toothless watchdog often paralyzed by partisan gridlock, with a new agency that has an odd number of members, including a nonpartisan election law expert.An educational effort by government, schools, civil society groups and the media to help people distinguish facts from fakery might help. Regrettably, President Trump has elevated \u201calternative facts\u201d to a high political art, and many members of his party and its talking-head cheerleaders seem perfectly happy to follow his lead. The willingness of social media to serve as a theater for obvious propaganda doesn\u2019t help advance the cause of truth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drew Nieporent May Be the Last Old-School Restaurateur Standing", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as a kid, he didn\u2019t eat like one. For sure, at 5 or 6 he\u2019d kick his older brother, Tracy, under the table whenever his parents took the family to restaurants, but mostly he was paying attention, learning about the food of a time in Manhattan when the top restaurants served German, Swiss or other cuisines that are infrequently celebrated these days.Drew Nieporent was born in 1955 and was obsessed with food by the early 1960s, before New York diners and newspaper critics became infatuated with everything French. \u201cI had amazing exposure to restaurants of the \u201860s that nobody around today visited except my brother and me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had to parlay it into something.\u201dIn an age when marquee restaurants are often defined by their celebrity chefs, he may be the last of the great meet-and-greet men, a breed of owners who reigned over their personal dominions, the seemingly insignificant space between dining room and front door.He never hired a public relations firm, preferring personal contact. He remains the best resource for those who know him, have his phone number and need a last-minute reservation at any restaurant in town.\u201cIf you\u2019re a friend of Drew, you get in any door,\u201d said the comedian and actor Paul Reiser, who took a photography class with Mr. Nieporent at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. \u201cThe whole point of getting famous is to hope for a good table, but you can end that heartache with a shortcut, just by knowing Drew. I once wanted to go to Rubicon in San Francisco while he was in Japan. He got me in. He\u2019s hospitable from 5,000 miles away.\u201dWherever Mr. Nieporent (NEE-pour-rent) appears \u2014 and he seems to be everywhere \u2014 he is a commanding figure, never content to hover in the background. He lights up a room like a bottle rocket on a birthday cake. He greets everyone he knows (and he knows everyone) in a voice that booms like a bugle call at sunrise or a ram\u2019s horn on the Jewish High Holy Days.\u201cTaking care of people separates him,\u201d said Marty Shapiro, a Myriad partner. \u201cOthers feel that way, but it\u2019s in his soul.\u201dAs everyone knows, attention from Mr. Nieporent can come at a price. \u201cHe will say anything that comes to mind,\u201d his daughter, Gabrielle, pointed out. \u201cHe has no filter.\u201dHe does it for love of a punch line, and perhaps from a certain cantankerousness that comes from knowing that what he set out to become \u2014 the Manhattan restaurateur as arbiter of everything culinary \u2014 has diminished drastically with the rise of the superstar chef.He was always going to become a restaurateur, even before he knew what the word meant. Mr. Reiser wrote in Mr. Nieporent\u2019s high school yearbook, \u201cGood luck with your restaurant.\u201d As Mr. Reiser explained recently, \u201cHe was the only guy our age who knew exactly what he wanted to be when he was 17 or 18.\u201dMr. Nieporent said he remembers every restaurant he visited and everything he learned.\u201cEating out in the \u201960s was for the privileged and the wealthy,\u201d Mr. Nieporent said. \u201cWe were neither, but we were treated so well that I wanted to be a part of it. We\u2019d sit at the table with the old-school guys who ran the restaurants. They\u2019d ask my father, \u2018What does he want to be?\u2019 He\u2019d say, \u2018He wants to be in the restaurant business.\u2019 They\u2019d reply, \u2018It\u2019s getting terrible.\u2019 They\u2019d moan and bellyache. They were always crabby, always in a bad mood. But I would feel the aura.\u201dMr. Nieporent eventually caught the eye of Mr. Baum, the man he calls his idol. Mr. Baum brought him in for a job interview and remarked, not speaking of himself, \u201cThere are two people in this room, and one of them thinks he\u2019s Jesus Christ.\u201d They never did work together, but Mr. Nieporent loved the compliment. (Yes, he considered it that.)\u201cI wanted roast chicken on the menu,\u201d Mr. Nieporent recalled. \u201cHe experimented. After a week, he brought me roast chicken ice cream.\u201d\u201cBack then, the chef was anonymous unless he had named the restaurant for himself,\u201d Mr. Nieporent said. \u201cToday, chefs are all Clint Eastwoods. They consider themselves directors/restaurateurs. They don\u2019t want to take direction from people like me.\u201dMontrachet eliminated stuffiness and initiated casual elegance. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need the bowing and the tuxedos,\u201d he said. The location below Canal Street was considered so remote by some diners that Mr. Nieporent recalled \u201chaving to run out of the restaurant and up to Broadway to find customers when they got lost.\u201d And while he is known these days for his girth, he could really run back then, having completed the New York City Marathon in 1983.Most surprising at Montrachet were the prices. The year before, he had eaten lunch at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s Jamin in Paris, where the prix fixe was 185 francs at a time when the exchange rate was about 10 francs to a dollar. \u201cI said if Robuchon can do it for $18.50, I can do it for $16,\u201d Mr. Nieporent recalled.The partners were shocked. \u201cAt the time it was a risky venture,\u201d recalled one, Michael Chin. \u201cWe were all about 30, and we put all the money we had into the restaurant.\u201dMr. Nieporent\u2019s resentment endured for decades, even as Montrachet thrived with a series of other chefs. His wife, Ann, said, \u201cIn the old days, there was such bad blood between them that if both were working the same food event, the organizer would have to put them on opposite sides of the kitchen.\u201dThe feud ended in the aftermath of 9/11, Mr. Nieporent said, when both men worked separately to feed rescue workers and help save the neighborhood.Mr. Nieporent has opened more than 40 restaurants in 32 years, not an enormous quantity in this era of branding and franchising, but he was never interested in multiple variations on the same theme. He now says that was a financial mistake.\u201cI never wanted to make the same movie over and over, Nobu being the exception,\u201d he said. \u201cI approached restaurants with new things, new people. I didn\u2019t realize until much later the power of the brand.\u201dHis restaurant menus have been Middle Eastern (Layla), Italian (Zeppole), American (Tribeca Grill), Japanese (Nobu), heart-healthy (Heartbeat), seafood (the Coach House, on Martha\u2019s Vineyard), Mexican (Centrico) and Californian (the seminal Rubicon). He regrets not opening a Chinese restaurant, a passion obvious when he showed up for a recent interview carrying a shopping bag of dim sum.He is currently a partner in five restaurants: B\u00e2tard (in the former Montrachet and Corton space), Tribeca Grill and three Nobus (Nobu Downtown, Nobu Fifty Seven and Nobu London). Among his partners in all but the first is Robert De Niro, who introduced Mr. Nieporent to the chef Nobu Matsuhisa.\u201cBob used to come to Montrachet,\u201d Mr. Nieporent said. \u201cHe always sat at the last table, his back to the room. One day Toukie Smith, then his girlfriend, came over and said to me, \u2018Want to open another restaurant in TriBeCa?\u2019 Bob knew Nobu from Matsuhisa in L.A., and he wanted him to be the chef. Nobu came and saw the space that would become Tribeca Grill and said, \u2018Maybe I can do a small sushi restaurant with you.\u2019\u201dThe relationship between the two men seesawed over the years, especially after the replication of Nobu across the globe proceeded without Mr. Nieporent. He says there was a \u201cstrong disagreement\u201d between him and the other three partners over expansion and control; he continued overseeing the Nobus in New York and London, and the brand kept growing without him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really break up, and we continue to work together today,\u201d he said.Montrachet, the original Nobu and Tribeca Grill were the foundations for the development of TriBeCa as one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan. While Mr. De Niro could rightfully take credit, the actor demurred, saying, \u201cIt would have created itself.\u201dAsked about his relationship with Mr. Nieporent, Mr. De Niro laughed and said: \u201cDrew is a character. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs.\u201dMr. Nieporent said: \u201cHe\u2019s too busy to have a lot of fights with. I am sensitive to who he is. I\u2019m careful. I understand the relationship, and I give him credit for what he proposed.\u201dThe marriage of Ann and Drew Nieporent has lasted 31 years. \u201cFew in the business can say that,\u201d she said.It has endured a separation of a few months (\u201cShe threw me out,\u201d he said) and his apparent inability to turn down endless invitations to festivals, restaurant openings and culinary events. \u201cMy wife still reminds me I never changed a diaper, but she\u2019s wrong, I did it once. My son\u2019s.\u201dMs. Nieporent claims she was fooled decades ago by her husband-to-be during a brief but magical time when he was not working restaurant hours, in the months before Montrachet opened.By all accounts, Mr. Nieporent has remained in character as father and husband. Which means that the marriage and the raising of children have been about food \u2014 although his wife points out that he is also besotted by their cocker spaniels. She said she was in the kitchen one day and overheard her husband in the next room. \u201cHe was talking to Chloe, sweetly saying to her: \u2018You just had your hair done.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t notice when I\u2019ve had my hair done.\u201dMr. Nieporent is the family cook, a position he rightfully earned after decades in the kitchens of the restaurants he owns or oversees. \u201cHe is an excellent cook, his food perfect,\u201d his wife said. \u201cI suspect he drove all his chefs crazy over the years because he has strong opinions how dishes should be made.\u201dThe Nieporents and their children \u2014 Andrew, 29, and Gabrielle, 25 \u2014 seem to have never missed a meal.\u201cIt was nonstop,\u201d Gabrielle said. \u201cOn weekends, we\u2019d talk about food. When we went on family vacation, we\u2019d plan lunch, we\u2019d plan dinners, we\u2019d roll home at the end of the trip.\u201d Andrew said his father still likes to sit next to him at family gatherings. \u201cHe takes a small percentage of my meal and a large percentage of everything else on the table. He\u2019s very systematic.\u201dMr. Nieporent said he has one more restaurant in him, perhaps his last, considering that New York rents have become exorbitant and New York chefs uncollaborative. It will be Chinese.He vividly recalls the meal he ate the night the Beatles played the Ed Sullivan Theater, and the scene outside was pandemonium. His most treasured memory of that historic New York evening? The egg rolls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anthony Weiner\u2019s Lawyers Question Motivation of Sexting Victim", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen lawyers for Anthony Weiner, the former Democratic congressman who faces sentencing in a sexting case that involved a 15-year-old girl, wrote to the judge this week seeking probation for their client, they made it clear that he had no excuse for his conduct.But they also raised questions about the credibility and motivation of the teenage victim. They said that she not only had a profit motive for making contact with Mr. Weiner and exchanging lewd texts and images with him, but that she also said she had sought to influence the presidential election.In their submission to the judge, the lawyers made it clear that such information could have an impact on the judge\u2019s assessment of the nature and circumstances of Mr. Weiner\u2019s crime, and of course on the ultimate sentence.It was shortly after that article was published that reports surfaced of a federal investigation into Mr. Weiner\u2019s conduct. The F.B.I. found on Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop a trove of emails that belonged to Mr. Weiner\u2019s now-estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton.They also sought any evidence of \u201cdisclosures made to the Trump campaign or its surrogates\u201d before the publication of the DailyMail.com article.It is not known if or how prosecutors responded to Mr. Weiner\u2019s lawyers, but the defense memo cites statements by the girl to investigators who interviewed her.The memo says that the girl told the investigators that she \u201choped somehow to influence the U.S. presidential election, in addition to securing personal profit.\u201dShe also said she began communicating with Mr. Weiner because she was \u201clooking for material for a book \u2014 one she has now written and is shopping to publishers,\u201d Mr. Weiner\u2019s lawyers wrote.The memo says that the teenager told investigators that to generate material for her book, she \u201cneeded Anthony to act out \u2014 behavior she tried to elicit during their first exchange.\u201d She suggested that they do a video chat, \u201cimmediately after volunteering to \u2018prove\u2019 that \u2018I have a vagina,\u2019\u201d the memo says.They began chatting online, with the girl \u201cselectively taking screenshots of her phone to document the exchanges before they disappeared,\u201d the memo says.\u201cShe\u2019s talking about potentially messing with Hillary\u2019s campaign,\u201d Ms. Leathers told Mr. Weiner.According to the New Yorker article, Ms. Leathers put the teenager in touch with DailyMail.com, which published her story in late September.Mr. Weiner is to be sentenced by Judge Denise Cote on Sept. 25. Mr. Devlin-Brown, his lawyer, declined to comment.A lawyer for Ms. Abedin declined to comment on Mr. Weiner\u2019s sentencing submission. On Wednesday, she and Mr. Weiner appeared before a Manhattan judge who was hearing their divorce case.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyer also declined to comment. In her new book, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d Mrs. Clinton described learning about Mr. Comey\u2019s new inquiry, and how it stemmed from the unrelated investigation into Mr. Weiner.\u201cWhen we heard this, Huma looked stricken,\u201d Mrs. Clinton writes. \u201cAnthony had already caused so much heartache. And now this.\u201d She recalls that Ms. Abedin burst into tears and said, \u201cThis man is going to be the death of me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fake Russian Facebook Accounts Bought $100,000 in Political Ads", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProviding new evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Facebook disclosed on Wednesday that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on hot-button issues purchased by a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin.The disclosure adds to the evidence of the broad scope of the Russian influence campaign, which American intelligence agencies concluded was designed to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Donald J. Trump during the election. Multiple investigations of the Russian meddling, and the possibility that the Trump campaign somehow colluded with Russia, have cast a shadow over the first eight months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.Facebook staff members on Wednesday briefed the Senate and House intelligence committees, which are investigating the Russian intervention in the American election. Mr. Stamos indicated that Facebook is also cooperating with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, writing that \u201cwe have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary.\u201dMr. Stamos wrote that while some of the ads specifically mentioned the two candidates, most focused instead on issues that were polarizing the electorate: \u201cdivisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dFacebook did not make public any of the ads, nor did it say how many people saw them. But Mr. Trump regularly offered outspoken comments on those issues during the campaign, denouncing \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and rallying his supporters on the right.In its review of election-related advertising, Facebook said it had also found an additional 2,200 ads, costing $50,000, that had less certain indications of a Russian connection. Some of those ads, for instance, were purchased by Facebook accounts with internet protocol addresses that appeared to be in the United States but with the language set to Russian.In a January report, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency concluded that the Russian government, on direct orders from President Vladimir V. Putin, was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and leaking thousands of emails and other documents in an attempt to hurt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and mar her reputation.The report also found that hundreds of Russian \u201ctrolls,\u201d or paid social media users, had posted anti-Clinton messages. But it did not name Facebook or address the question of advertising.The revelations can only add to the political skirmishing in Washington over Russia\u2019s role in the election. Mr. Trump has often dismissed the Russian hacking story as \u201cfake news\u201d and bristled at any implication that Mr. Putin had helped him win. To date, while news reports have uncovered many meetings and contacts between Trump associates and Russians, there has been no evidence proving collusion in the hacking or other Russian activities.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a telephone interview that the Facebook disclosure \u201ccertainly quantifies the Russian use of at least one social media platform with a level of granularity that we did not have before.\u201d He said the committee has been in touch with Facebook for some time, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the last word on the matter by Facebook or in terms of our investigation on the social media issue.\u201dMr. Schiff said he has more questions for Facebook, including when the company first become aware of the problem, what warning signs it found, how sophisticated the Russian operation was and what steps Facebook was taking to guard against such activity in the future.\u201cClearly Facebook doesn\u2019t want to become the arbiter of what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not true,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut they do have a civil responsibility to do the best they can to inform their users of when they\u2019re being manipulated by a foreign actor.\u201dMr. Stamos\u2019s post on Wednesday was more forthright, saying that the fake Facebook accounts connected to the ads \u201clikely operated out of Russia.\u201dAfter initially denying that fake news on the service had any influence on the election, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has gradually come around to the notion that the company must do more. Facebook has implemented a series of steps to combat fake content, including recruiting outside reviewers to check out and flag dubious articles.But the new measures do not directly affect Facebook ads. Advertisers pay to have particular Facebook posts displayed high in the news feeds of whatever group of people is targeted.The audience for an ad can be chosen using broad factors, such as middle-aged American men, or very specific ones, such as mothers who live in Minneapolis and like churches and the Minnesota Twins.That ability to target is valuable to political campaigns, and the company actively reaches out to candidates around the world to teach them how to use Facebook to get their messages out, including through paid advertising.One question underlying the investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is whether Russia-sponsored operators would have needed any guidance from American political experts. Facebook said that some of the ads linked to Russian accounts had targeted particular geographic areas, which may raise questions about whether anyone had helped direct such targeting.Under federal law, foreign governments, companies and citizens are prohibited from spending money to influence American elections. Facebook\u2019s disclosure could add an additional element to the possible crimes under investigation by Mr. Mueller.A picture initially paired with this article was posted in error. The three unidentified people shown looking at their cell phones were not connected to the issue of ads on Facebook purchased through fake Russian accounts.Vindu Goel reported from San Francisco, and Scott Shane from Baltimore.

{"Headline": "\u2018Dreamers\u2019 Put Their Trust in DACA. What Now?", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionPast the Ferris wheel, a line of young immigrants snaked into the crowded hallways of an event space on Chicago\u2019s Navy Pier. It was August 2012. I overheard two women wondering whether they should have showed up and gotten in the line, to apply for a new program that would let some undocumented people who had come to this country as children get a work permit.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we should trust the government,\u201d one of the women said.\u201cI don\u2019t know, either,\u201d the other replied. \u201cBut I really want to work and help my mom pay rent.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t your choice to come to America. But once you realize you\u2019re here illegally, it becomes your choice to figure out who gets to know that.Can you tell your classmates that you can\u2019t join the overseas choir trip because you don\u2019t have a valid passport? Can you tell your coach that you have to stay in the area and can\u2019t be recruited by an out-of-state college? Can you tell a human resources manager that you can\u2019t get a driver\u2019s license because you don\u2019t have a Social Security number?How will your work be affected by the president\u2019s decision?When you exist in a legal maze shrouded in doubts, every decision is a gut check.In 2002, Pat Foote, a recruiter at The Seattle Times, told me that she couldn\u2019t offer me a summer internship because I am in the United States illegally. I later made my way to Seattle just so that I could look her in the eye and ask that she not share my secret. She was a stranger, the first potential employer I\u2019d ever told, and I asked for her trust.The scariest stranger of all is the United States government. It could deport you from the place you call home. That\u2019s a fear I live with.The landscape of trust shifted dramatically in 2012, when President Barack Obama issued a directive to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In addition to protecting immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age of 16 from deportation for a renewable two-year period, it granted a work permit to qualified immigrants who were under age 31 on June 15, 2012, the date of its announcement. Applicants paid a $465 fee for processing and gave all their contact information (name, address, phone number) to the government they had grown up fearing. In effect, the Obama administration said, \u201cTrust us.\u201dI did not qualify for DACA \u2014 I turned 31 four months before the policy was announced \u2014 but was thrilled for my younger undocumented friends who did qualify. I carried that thrill with me to Chicago on the first day that people could apply. Since then, an estimated 800,000 undocumented Americans across the country have received this deferred action.As soon as news started leaking that President Trump, who campaigned on ending the program, would deliver on his promise, the questions came flooding in. Friends whose lives and livelihoods depended on this promise the government had made needed to know: Will my boss still keep me on when DACA expires? Will my scholarship continue? How can I pay my mortgage? Who can we trust now?Can we trust President Trump, whose conflicting messages illustrate his ignorance of how DACA works?Can we trust Congress, especially given that some Democrats and Republicans have historically used so-called Dreamers, named after the long-stalled Dream Act, as bargaining chips?We can\u2019t know what President Trump and Congress will do. But we do know who to trust now \u2014 the people we had to trust before. To me, that means the teachers who see up close the injustice of life as an undocumented immigrant in this country.After she announced to our class that we were going to Japan for spring break, I pulled her aside and said that I couldn\u2019t go. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right passport,\u201d I said. Confused, Mrs. Denny replied: \u201cOh, it\u2019s O.K., Jose. We\u2019ll get you the right passport.\u201d I told her it was more complicated than that, that I didn\u2019t have any piece of legal document that I could show, that I wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Her eyes widened, her lips pursed, and she didn\u2019t say another thing. A couple of days later, to my surprise, she told the class that we were going to Hawaii instead. Years later, she told me: \u201cYou were my kid. I wasn\u2019t going to leave any of my kids behind.\u201dHow many more Mrs. Dennys have made and will continue to make that decision?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. to Collect Social Media Data on All Immigrants Entering Country", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security.Green card holders and naturalized citizens will also have their social media information collected, with the data becoming part of their immigration file. It was unclear whether the monitoring would take place only in the application process or could continue afterward.The data collection has alarmed privacy groups and lawyers, who expressed concerns on about how the department would use the information. Advocates say they also worry that the monitoring could suck in information on American citizens who communicate over social media with immigrants.\u201cThis would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the free speech that\u2019s expressed every day on social media,\u201d Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. \u201cThis collect-it-all approach is ineffective to protect national security and is one more example of the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda.\u201dEfforts to collect social media information are not unique to the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, the department had begun asking visitors to voluntarily provide social media information, and had four pilot screening programs.Many members of Congress, mainly Republicans, began urging the Department of Homeland Security to use data gleaned from visa applicants\u2019 or asylum seekers\u2019 social media accounts as part of the immigration process.Congressional Democrats also supported the effort to collect social media data on visa applicants.Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University, said although it was true that the Obama administration collected social media information, the new monitoring put in place by the Trump administration represented an escalation.\u201cWhat is different here is that it appears that they are monitoring people who are already in the United States \u2014 green card holders, for example,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there is a lack of transparency of how they are using this data, which does heighten the concerns for this group of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Won\u2019t Find This Runway on the Fashion Week Calendar", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the first official night of New York Fashion Week, a show put on by homeless youth demonstrated the power of design.A bracing alternative to the stoic runways at Skylight Clarkson Sq, the show was also a burst of joy from an increasingly vulnerable population. \u201cFor young adults and teens, there are so many barriers to stable permanent housing,\u201d Liz Roberts, the deputy C.E.O. of Safe Horizon, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have experience living on their own. They don\u2019t have the life skills to navigate a lease and a landlord. They typically have limited work experience. They\u2019re homeless because of a history of abuse and neglect from their families, and they need a lot of support. There\u2019s a need for housing options that are different.\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s plan to expand New York\u2019s homeless shelter program, Ms. Roberts added, has improved their odds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to move more of our clients into supportive housing than in the past,\u201d she said, referring to housing initiatives for people with mental health and substance abuse issues, and vouchers that offset rent costs at privately owned buildings. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve added beds to the youth shelter program, which is very welcome. We work with 1,000 young people every year, and on any given night we can only shelter 24.\u201dThe fashion show allowed some of those very people to express their creativity. PVH provided sewing machines, fabric and art supplies, and guided the first-time designers from inspiration boards to execution.At first the designer-models walked cautiously, with downcast eyes. After a few steps, they looked up, to applause and cheers. And after a few more, they smiled. Blue and white crinoline bounced from shoulders and waists, a lime green hat twinkled with rhinestones, and a hoop skirt lifted a train of binder-clipped Bubble Wrap. At least half the looks were winged.\u201cI\u2019m kind of a goth, so the first thing I thought was: Angel of Darkness?\u201d said Delonte, 21, wearing a black-and-white outfit of his own design with bicolor wings. \u201cThen, let\u2019s mix it. Half good, half evil.\u201d He kicked his feet to show off his cropped, billowing pants. \u201cAnd I wanted to form it with a genie/ninja look.\u201dDelonte\u2019s family, who moved to Connecticut from Jamaica last December, did not welcome his coming out. \u201cThey told me I was a disgrace, that I should kill myself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m going to give you people what you want,\u2019 and I did something that I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201dAfter two days in the hospital, he moved to New York, and for the last seven months he has been homeless. Streetwork helped him secure housing at Marsha\u2019s Place, an L.G.B.T. shelter in the Bronx.\u201cEvery day when I wake up, I go straight to Streetwork,\u201d he said. \u201cThe food there is amazing. I\u2019m a foodie, trust me. I get to watch TV, play games and be creative. They treat us like they\u2019re a parent. They\u2019re the nicest people on this earth.\u201dGimella, 22, landed at Streetwork when she was 18, after fleeing abuse at home.

But being around good people, it helped me be more comfortable, to be proud of who I am today. Good things like this, they don\u2019t come a lot, so you have to take advantage.\u201dFor Joean Villarin, an assistant director of the program, Project Streetwork is also a positive shared experience. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be in an environment where the focus isn\u2019t on problems, or on fixing something,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s on creating something.\u201dDaniel Armosilla, a designer and Project Streetwork mentor, said, \u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a great idea, here are the tools and supplies, let\u2019s band together and help you realize this,\u2019 all that\u2019s happened to them washes away. They feel peace and elation \u2014 surprised by what they\u2019re capable of.\u201dThe runway show was followed by a mini-ball featuring members of the Harlem Ballroom community, a vibrant safe haven for queer youth of color chronicled in the documentaries \u201cParis Is Burning\u201d and \u201cKiki,\u201d with competitive vogue-off categories and cash prizes donated by the Callen Lorde Health Center.\u201cThe runway saves lives,\u201d the M.C. said, near the end, to cheers.\u201cTonight meant a lot to me,\u201d Delonte said. \u201cI feel like a star.

At the same time, decades ago, it petitioned the authorities for a better, paved road to connect to the rest of the world.Since 1967, the villagers have conducted an annual exercise in collective self-analysis, self-absorption and self-motivation, turning their inner struggles, doubts, hopes and fears into art.Every summer, they have staged a theater performance in which they act out \u2014 what else? \u2014 the story of their own lives.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at our possible future, imagine what we don\u2019t yet have, or is there but it\u2019s crumbling,\u201d said one young actor, Roberto Giani, 23, on a stage that had been set up alongside a church.\u201cThese little hamlets have a long history, but once upon a time they were bound to a difficult but friendly destiny,\u201d he continued, staring sadly at a star-speckled sky.The same actors have been performing various roles throughout their lives. They have seen one another change and grow, succeed and fail.In the winter, the planning begins. The residents meet in the evenings to analyze their collective problems and construct a plot around them. Then, in the summer, they perform their script on a stage in a local piazza.Mr. Giani, the actor, grew up in Monticchiello. Like most of the residents, he started playing parts at an early age.This year, he is a young, unemployed father-to-be, grappling with a radical question \u2014 the existence of his village \u2014 and how to keep the community together.While Monticchiello may seem a paradise, some residents feel as cut off as their predecessors did in the 1960s, when farmers left their fields to work in the cities. The village declined in appeal and population.Italy\u2019s birthrate is the lowest in Europe, and unemployment among young adults is about 35 percent. New national legislation is compelling villages to merge their services in an effort to save money.But residents here fear a loss of local power, autonomy and identity. The village actors asked on stage: How will this community still exist in the future?\u201cIt is only a firm belief and the courage to dare, a common goal that unites people instead of dividing them,\u201d a voice-over suggested to Mr. Giani in a recent night\u2019s performance.In real life, Mr. Giani left Monticchiello after working low-paying jobs for years and moved north to Bologna to study liberal arts.\u201cHow low have we come?\u201d asked Arturo Vignai, 83, speaking a line in the drama, in which he played Mr. Giani\u2019s forlorn father, worried about his son\u2019s future without a job.Mr. Vignai, who acted in the Teatro Povero for the first time when he was 32, is versed in military roles.In 1967, he played the commander of the troops from the Republic of Siena that in the 16th century warded off the Florentines in Monticchiello.He can confidently recount the glorious episodes of this Tuscan community\u2019s past: its resistance to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, in the 1500s; to French invaders a few hundred years later; and finally to German soldiers during World War II.Yet this year, Mr. Vignai forsook his military role on stage to play a more pedestrian but poignant part.The generational handoff is the hardest thing for the theater, and the village, the actors say.\u201cThis is a great place when you are a child and a retiree, but living here requires giving up on a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Giani said.In this year\u2019s performance, Valeria Cardini, a red-haired 11-year-old, played a schoolgirl \u2014 but one attending the same class as her older and younger brothers because the village didn\u2019t have enough children to organize more than one class.She has been acting for three years and going to theater classes during the winter \u201cmany more years.\u201d\u201cI like the theater because so many people come to Monticchiello for this,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd it helps me express myself,\u201d she explained. \u201cI am on Facebook, but I don\u2019t really use it.\u201dSocial media doesn\u2019t seem to have substituted for real life in isolated Monticchiello. \u201cThat\u2019s also because phones don\u2019t have great signal in medieval walls anyway,\u201d Mr. Giani explained.During the show\u2019s three-week run, Monticchiello plays host to 4,000 spectators. A tavern inside a vaulted medieval crypt springs to life, and tourists crowd the streets at sunset, awaiting the show.But the magic fades after the Teatro Povero is over. \u201cWhen I am here, I sometimes don\u2019t check my phone for an entire day,\u201d Mr. Giani said. \u201cBut once the theater is over, it\u2019s just empty.\u201dIn the off-season, residents have one A.T.M., a post office open three days a week, and a public space, once the farm\u2019s granary, where older residents can leave their medical prescriptions and collect their drugs later, or buy daily papers.\u201cA little like this community, the theater has always been on the verge of extinction,\u201d said Andrea Cresti, 79, the director, sitting on a bench in the village\u2019s cobblestone square, where children played and cats rested in the shadows.\u201cFor 51 years, we have been doing it uncertain whether we\u2019d do it the following year,\u201d he said.For many here, the theater has substituted for other forms of collective engagement.\u201cIt is a powerful aggregation tool,\u201d said Riccardo Severini, a 47-year-old farmer who serves as the sound engineer for the three weeks of the show. \u201cIt used to be soccer, but everyone left and so we were not enough to play.\u201dThis longtime exercise gives purpose beyond the daily routine.\u201cThe idea of building a drama on themselves is unique in Italy,\u201d said Pietro Clemente, an anthropologist at Florence University who has followed the Teatro Povero for decades. \u201cThat\u2019s why over the years even Federico Fellini came to watch them acting.\u201d\u201cWe saw it evolving,\u201d said Susan Fisher, a 77-year-old San Franciscan who has lived in Siena for more than 40 years. She has come to Monticchiello for the theater since the 1990s.\u201cYou can recognize people and see them growing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The More We Connect, the Better It Gets \u2014 for Facebook", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs Facebook expands its global reach, it\u2019s looking to the developing world to increase its two-billion-strong user base. One pillar of its strategy is a mobile application called Free Basics, a portal that offers access to a limited number of websites at no charge.Facebook promotes Free Basics as a program for social good. The company describes Free Basics as an \u201con ramp\u201d that introduces the internet to people in the developing world. The goal, Facebook says in its promotional materials, is to \u201cbring more people online and help improve their lives.\u201d The three-year-old app is available to hundreds of millions of mobile phone users in more than 60 countries.Bringing more people online is a noble goal. About 50 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 mainly people in developing countries, women in particular \u2014 is still not online. Internet affordability remains staggeringly unequal across the globe: In Africa in 2015, one gigabyte of data cost more than 17 percent of the average person\u2019s income, while in the Europe and United States, it cost less than 1 percent.The head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has responded to these criticisms by saying, \u201cIt is always better to have some access than none at all.\u201dA study by the Alliance for Affordable Internet found that most Free Basics customers had used the internet before they began using Free Basics. This and other studies suggest that a large proportion of Free Basics users see the app as a way to get extra free time on Facebook \u2014 a way to stay connected with their Facebook friends without using up their data plans \u2014 and not as an \u201con ramp\u201d to the web. Facebook does not appear to be introducing people to the open internet, but it is making it easy for people who can afford smartphones and data plans to spend unlimited time in the company\u2019s closed, for-profit environment.One reason Free Basics may be missing the mark is that a mobile phone app isn\u2019t a good way to get poor people online. In rural areas, people are often disconnected because their region lacks cables, towers or a signal, rendering a mobile app useless. And the world\u2019s poorest people are typically left offline, regardless of where they live, because they cannot afford a smartphone.For the people who are getting a taste of the web through Free Basics, what does the app look like? The offerings differ in each region. Researchers testing the app in six countries found that more than half of the websites on the app\u2019s main screen belong to big companies like ESPN, Johnson & Johnson and Disney. Free Basics typically features some news sites (usually BBC and one or two national daily newspapers) and sites dedicated to things like finance and health care. But, at best, a user can see only about 150 websites, all of which are selected either by Facebook or by site operators.Free Basics users cannot see video. Many photos are removed. And if they want to click a link to explore an issue further, they can rarely do so.The unclickable links, unloadable videos and paltry supply of websites all appear to be part of an effort to minimize the cost of data traveling through the network. Perhaps those limitations do keep costs down \u2014 and make it possible for the service to be free \u2014 but this technical design also helps benefit Facebook\u2019s bottom line. It keeps users in a confined space, where the company can monitor and analyze their habits for profit.Whenever users click a website in Free Basics, that click sends packets of data to Facebook\u2019s servers. The company collects information about the websites that users visit, and other data like their phone numbers.This is no small matter. The likes and sharing habits of Facebook\u2019s billions of users provide a trove of data to sell to advertisers, eliminating the guesswork of figuring out what consumers care about or want to buy. For any advertiser, from the hyperlocal to the multinational, this is empirical gold.What the company has done instead cuts against the power of the open internet, where people can follow their curiosity, build new knowledge from scratch and participate in civic and economic life at local and even global levels.Facebook portrays itself as a benevolent entity that is introducing people to the web for the simple reason, cited in Free Basics promotional materials, that \u201cthe more we connect, the better it gets.\u201d The question is: better for whom?Advertisement"}

It\u2019s About Gender.", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 25______What\u2019s been quite striking in all of this is the degree to which the opponents of same-sex marriage have sought to shift the focus from marriage to kids and male and female identity.This slippery slope argument is familiar; it\u2019s what opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States also relied on.But there are larger debates about gender and identity going on as well.\u201cI really love kicking the footy, netball and doing handstands at recess and lunch,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is annoying doing these things in a skirt.\u201dVictoria quickly followed suit, announcing that the state\u2019s public schools would be required to provide nonskirt options for female students by the start of next year.But these uniform restrictions are still the norm in public and private schools across much of Australia, with some defending them as a way to prepare girls for the workplace, where they\u2019ll be expected to wear dresses.Many argue that this feeds into a larger problem of inequality. At a forum I attended this week at Deakin University in Melbourne about diversity in media, several academics and journalists said that despite its \u201cfair go\u201d ethos, Australia is still a country in which the power structures do not reflect the diversity of the population, in terms of race, sexual identity, or gender.\u201cWe need unconscious bias training for everyone,\u201d said Tracey Spicer, the well-known TV anchor, after recounting a litany of sexist encounters. \u201cWe need more female leaders.\u201dJane de Hollander, the vice chancellor of Deakin University, put it more simply: \u201cAustralians are not as egalitarian as we think,\u201d she said.And to emphasize the mental blind spots that can develop as a result, she ended her lecture with a question: \u201cDoes anyone in the room know who is Australia\u2019s only female Nobel Prize winner?\u201dThere were more than 100 people there, most of them journalists or Ph.D.-holding professors. Not a single hand was raised.\u201cShe is one of the most significant thought leaders in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know who she is.\u201dDo you have a story of being overlooked?

Even Mr. Cuomo acknowledged the criticism: \u201cThere is a strong argument to be made that standing in a storm is not a smart thing to do.\u201dMr. Weir was one of many television journalists facing potentially unsafe conditions in covering the hurricane. Hours later, over at MSNBC, the correspondent Mariana Atencio stood on a boulevard in Miami and pointed to a large tree that had fallen across the street, as other trees bowed in the wind alongside her, raising the question of whether her team was in danger. And around noon, Kyung Lah, a reporter for CNN, said on the air from Miami Beach, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have this steel railing, I\u2019d be flying.\u201dThe tradition of television crews standing in the middle of a dangerous storm goes back decades, reflecting the hunger to be on the scene for a nationally significant event. But the news value of dangerous stand-ups \u2014 in which a correspondent is seen in the field talking to the camera \u2014 is increasingly being questioned, particularly with the rise of social media. Some critics wondered whether they are unnecessary and overly sensational spectacles, especially in cases where correspondents are struggling to deliver information.But those same field reporters insist that the visuals from the storms are essential in persuading people to take hurricane threats seriously and getting them to leave the area. At the same time, veteran reporters say they take every precaution to stay out of life-threatening situations. On CNN, John Berman, in Miami, described flying debris nearby and took pains to say that he didn\u2019t believe he was in serious danger.\u201cIt\u2019s blowing in the other direction, just so you know,\u201d he said.One MSNBC studio anchor, Ali Velshi, addressed the issue directly, saying before 10 a.m. that he wanted to pause the coverage: \u201cI want to take a quick break. I want to reset. I want to find out that our reporters are safe.\u201dThe custom of reporters broadcasting live from hurricanes began with Dan Rather, the former CBS News anchor, in 1961. Working for KHOU in Houston, he broadcast the first live radar image of a hurricane \u2014 Hurricane Carla \u2014 on television and took to the streets to show the conditions firsthand. CBS took the broadcast live, giving viewers around the country their first look at the threat posed by such a storm. Pictures of Mr. Rather wading through waist-high water propelled his rise to network anchor.Today, this kind of reporting seems routine. And as it has become more common, reporters have become more aware of the criticism and have tried to justify this approach, as Sam Champion, a weather contributor for MSNBC, did on the air on Sunday.\u201cEveryone says, \u2018Well, look, if you\u2019re standing out in the storm, Sam, then how come I can\u2019t stand out in the storm?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Champion said. \u201cAnd what I\u2019m going to tell you is we do this so you can see what it\u2019s like outside.\u201dReporters, at both the national and local level, echoed that reasoning.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fair question: Why would you have reporters standing potentially in harm\u2019s way who are telling people to do exactly the opposite?\u201d Mark Strassmann, a CBS News correspondent who has covered hurricanes for 25 years, said in an interview shortly after taking part in a live special from Miami.\u201cPart of that is that television is all about visual proof,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to persuade people that what they\u2019re seeing is real and matters to them. And if they can see me standing out there getting knocked around, it\u2019ll convince them that they should not do the same thing.\u201dLocal reporters have fewer resources than network correspondents and this could lead them to brave some particularly unsafe conditions. In a Facebook post on Aug. 25, Jacque Masse, a reporter for 12News in Beaumont, Tex., said she covered Hurricane Harvey by herself, acting as an \u201cM.M.J.\u201d \u2014 industry jargon for \u201cmultimedia journalist,\u201d or a solo television news reporter. She was her own camerawoman, producer and editor. The station came under withering criticism from industry watchers.In those cases, reporters said, they have to know when to say no to their bosses.\u201cSomewhere it\u2019s been ingrained in our minds that there\u2019s a million people that would love to have your job, so if you won\u2019t do it, someone else will,\u201d said Hayley Minogue, a reporter for WKRG, a CBS affiliate in Mobile, Ala., who was covering her first major hurricane from Jacksonville, Fla. \u201cSo you get pressured into doing stuff for that, but that\u2019s not really my attitude.\u201d Ms. Minogue added that her own station had never pressured her in that way.Whitney Burbank, a reporter for WPBF, the ABC affiliate in West Palm Beach, Fla., said that she had not been pressured, either.\u201cI\u2019m looking at a tree that\u2019s fallen through a concrete wall that\u2019s covering half of a major road,\u201d Ms. Burbank said after her 10th live appearance of the day. She described harrowing conditions that at times forced her crew to huddle inside their satellite truck. But, she said, her bosses place a premium on her team\u2019s safety.\u201cMy employers are pretty careful if something is unsafe,\u201d Ms. Burbank said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you to do it. They don\u2019t want you to do a crazy live shot in the middle of a tornado. If it\u2019s too windy to go out, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the CBS News correspondent who has covered hurricanes for 25 years.

{"Headline": "To Transform Your Weeknight Cooking, Turn On the Instant Pot", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteThe hardest ingredient to find for any weeknight recipe is time. Tuesdays after work just don\u2019t have a lot of it, and it\u2019s not as if you can order it online.A slow cooker can help by doing the cooking while you\u2019re at the office. Just load it up in the morning and come home after work to a fragrant, hearty meal.The big thing missing here is spontaneity. If you\u2019re not the kind of cook who can commit to and then start prepping your dinner before you\u2019re fully caffeinated \u2014 or if you just can\u2019t get yourself organized to start cooking in advance at all \u2014 a slow cooker won\u2019t do you much good.But a multicooker like the Instant Pot just might.A multicooker is dinnertime convenience in stainless steel form, an appliance that combines an electric pressure cooker with a slow cooker, electric steamer and rice cooker. Several manufacturers make multicookers, including Breville and Fagor, but Instant Pot has become the best known in the United States. (Note that while most multicookers include a pressure-cooking function, there are some models that only slow cook, so check before you buy.)There\u2019s no other single gadget that can make weeknight cooking easier. It can cook food either quickly or slowly, and it does both consistently, evenly and automatically. Get one, and you can get rid of your slow cooker.What I especially love about the multicooker is its inherent flexibility, pleasing cooks of all temperaments.If you\u2019re an organized, plan-ahead type of person, you can use your multicooker exactly like a slow cooker. Just use the slow-cook setting with any of your old favorite slow-cooker recipes without even having to adjust them.Culinary procrastinators, on the other hand, can take full advantage of the pressure setting, which cooks food in minutes instead of hours.I\u2019m in the latter camp, and so this is my routine: On the way home from work, I stop at the store for some beans or grains or a package of chicken thighs. I throw them into the pot with a mix of interesting seasonings. Then I make a salad while the pot does its thing.That\u2019s it. A satisfying dish that would normally take an hour or more is on the table in 20 to 30 minutes.Now earthy soups, supple stews and luscious braises are within reach for winter weeknights, instead of being relegated to weekends when I have hours to let them simmer. In the summer I can quickly cook beans and grains for salads without heating up the kitchen, or steam artichokes without having to stare at a pot on the stove. I don\u2019t even have to be home.No matter the season, my basic strategy for using my multicooker on weeknights remains constant: I estimate how many minutes I have before I want dinner to be on the table, and work backward from there.You can apply the same method for dense root vegetables like beets and potatoes. While whole roots usually need about 20 to 30 minutes to cook, slices or cubes take 5 to 10 minutes.Because I rarely plan ahead, one of my favorite multicooker tricks is to cook dried beans on a weeknight without soaking them first. Of course, you can\u2019t cut them up to make them cook more quickly, but you can select smaller beans. When time is tight, buy lentils, split peas or adzuki beans, which cook from their dried, unsoaked state in under 20 minutes. Save the chickpeas, kidney beans and cannellinis for when you\u2019ve got close to an hour.As for those chicken thighs, my go-to method is to buy them boneless, cut them into pieces and then throw them in the pot with pretty much any combination of spices, aromatics and condiments, to cook in under 10 minutes. Add barbecue sauce and you\u2019ll get barbecued chicken.Coconut milk, a can of tomatoes and garam masala result in a creamy, currylike dish. A squirt each of sriracha, lime juice, soy sauce and honey, along with a grated garlic clove, gives you something far tastier than it should for the amount of work you put in. If you use breasts instead of thighs, they\u2019ll cook even more quickly, though be careful not to overdo it because they\u2019ll dry out.After using the machine consistently for nearly a year, I can say that if you stick to what it does best \u2014 stewing, braising, simmering, steaming \u2014 you\u2019ll be amply rewarded. Just don\u2019t attempt to cook anything crunchy or golden, because it probably won\u2019t end well. No matter how many multicooker roast chicken recipes you may stumble across on the internet, don\u2019t believe them. I\u2019ve tried it several times: The skin ends up soft and flabby instead of crisp and salty, and the meat turns stringy.If you play to the multicooker\u2019s many strengths and remain aware of its weaknesses, you won\u2019t be disappointed. You\u2019ll also eat better \u2014 even at the last minute.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "And This Year, the Emmy Goes to \u2026 Politics", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In any other year, big-hearted dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d or \u201cThis Is Us\u201d or a period drama like \u201cThe Crown\u201d would dominate the Emmys.But this was no normal year.This is a moment in which the partisan chasm has widened and political discourse has taken on a greater sense of urgency. Bright lines are dividing those supporting President Trump and those vilifying him, and Hollywood has never been shy about signaling where it stands.And so Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards, as much as they were a celebration of artistic accomplishment, were also a statement that, eight months into a Trump presidency, topical and decidedly progressive shows rule the day in television \u2014 at least among the industry insiders who dole out the accolades.\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which revived its fortunes last season with a weekly skewering of Mr. Trump, claimed the most awards of any show Sunday. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a dystopian drama that tapped into fears about authoritarianism in America, nabbed best drama and several other awards. And individual winners like Alec Baldwin, Donald Glover and John Oliver took the stage to spoof Mr. Trump and give voice to the liberal worldview that prevails in much of the entertainment industry.A few hours after the ceremony, the former Emmy winner Jon Hamm described it as \u201cthe most diverse, most different, most interesting Emmy show I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dWhen his former co-star on \u201cMad Men,\u201d Elisabeth Moss, was asked if she had seen an Emmys quite this political, she was emphatic.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, holding an Emmy in each hand, including the one she won for best actress for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve also never seen anything like where our country is right now.\u201dAll year, late night shows with an anti-Trump bent and left-leaning cable news shows like Rachel Maddow\u2019s on MSNBC have seen their ratings soar, and now that political posture has received the seal of approval from Emmys voters.But it also means that the Emmys, and all awards shows, for that matter, are part of a broader cultural divide. And to its critics, Hollywood may be proving yet again that it lives in an elite, self-congratulatory bubble, showering awards on shows that reflect its worldview while ignoring the millions of people who prefer \u201cNCIS\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\u201cRemember, it\u2019s California,\u201d said Margaret Atwood, the author of the novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d on which the Hulu show was based, as she glided into her first Emmys party at age 77. \u201cThis would not happen in a lot of other states. This would, in fact, be a lot different. This is its own world here.\u201dThe show did not draw a big audience. The ceremony, hosted by Stephen Colbert, attracted just 11.38 million viewers, Nielsen said, in line with last year\u2019s total, which was a record low.On Fox News on Monday morning, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said viewers were \u201ctuning out\u201d because of how politicized the Emmys have become, and suggested that Hollywood\u2019s anti-Trump posturing had become tiresome.\u201cThey got plucked and polished and waxed, and some of them didn\u2019t eat for two months, and all for what?\u201d she said. \u201cTo sound the same?\u201dStill, the heated political climate produced some startling changes for the Emmys.\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has never appealed much to Emmy voters, and they had not given it a top show award in more than two decades. But just two years removed from inviting Mr. Trump to host \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d the NBC late night show excoriated him this past season, and reaped the rewards: Mr. Baldwin won an Emmy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who portrayed both Ms. Conway and Hillary Clinton, won an Emmy as well.\u201c\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 had a career year,\u201d said Warren Littlefield, a longtime Emmy voter who is a former NBC executive and a producer of \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cYou had to watch \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 to get an appreciation of the world we\u2019re living in, and it helped us endure what we\u2019re all living with.\u201dOther shows benefited as well, including Mr. Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d which won the prize for best variety talk show for the second consecutive year. Mr. Oliver delights in using Mr. Trump as a punching bag on his show.Mr. Glover of \u201cAtlanta\u201d and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of \u201cVeep\u201d were among the many winners who mocked President Trump on stage. And after Mr. Baldwin won, he alluded to the fact that Mr. Trump had long coveted an Emmy but never won one. \u201cI suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,\u201d Mr. Baldwin quipped.What benefited those shows, however, appeared to have hurt dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d both of which were decidedly retro and unpolitical.\u201cStranger Things\u201d was a sci-fi homage to movies like \u201cStand by Me\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d was a heart-on-your-sleeve family drama that took inspiration from the 1983 tear-jerker \u201cTerms of Endearment.\u201dStill, Hulu\u2019s success was a shock in its own right. Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, Comcast, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, has a smaller programming budget compared with those of streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon.But \u201cHandmaid\u2019s,\u201d which was in development long before the Trump administration, struck a chord with viewers concerned about women\u2019s rights, and its creators proudly embraced the fact that some regarded their show as eerily timely.\u201cPolitics is at the front of everybody\u2019s head, not in the back of everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d said Bruce Miller, an executive producer for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI think all of the media, including the fictional and nonfictional media, are benefiting from taking that head-on. I have been told that you don\u2019t talk about religion and politics in kind company. Well, there\u2019s no company now where you don\u2019t talk about politics these days.\u201d\u201cPeople are talking about and thinking about some serious things and things that are uncomfortable,\u201d he added. \u201cShows that directly address difficult topics are having their day in the sun.\u201dEarly reviews for the series, which had its premiere three months after the inauguration, were positive, and it has been the show of the year for many TV critics.Hulu\u2019s marketing department took no chances. The streaming service bought its first-ever Super Bowl ad for an original series, even though the event was months before the premiere. And throughout the year, Hulu hired actresses to don red capes like characters in the show, and circulate in cities like Austin (during the South by Southwest Festival), New York, Los Angeles and Washington to create word-of-mouth buzz.Because Hulu does not release viewership data, it is impossible to know how popular \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d was, but it was far more successful than its previous iteration. In 1990, the novel was adapted into a feature film that was a flop at the box office and did not receive warm reviews.\u201cWe got a Trump bump!\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a producer behind both the movie and the TV show. \u201cTiming is everything. If we didn\u2019t have the president we have now, I don\u2019t know if it would have been this successful.\u201dMs. Atwood underscored that point as well.\u201cI wrote it in 1985,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some incredulity then: \u2018Margaret, you\u2019re way over the top! it could never happen here.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t hear any of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Frankenstein Moment", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Shift\u201cWe never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way \u2014 and that is on us,\u201d Ms. Sandberg wrote.It was a candid admission that reminded me of a moment in Mary Shelley\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d after the scientist Victor Frankenstein realizes that his cobbled-together creature has gone rogue.\u201cI had been the author of unalterable evils,\u201d he says, \u201cand I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.\u201dIf I were a Facebook executive, I might feel a Frankensteinian sense of unease these days. The company has been hit with a series of scandals that have bruised its image, enraged its critics and opened up the possibility that in its quest for global dominance, Facebook may have created something it can\u2019t fully control.Few of these issues stem from willful malice on the company\u2019s part. It\u2019s not as if a Facebook engineer in Menlo Park personally greenlighted Russian propaganda, for example. On Thursday, the company said it would release political advertisements bought by Russians for the 2016 election, as well as some information related to the ads, to congressional investigators.But the troubles do make it clear that Facebook was simply not built to handle problems of this magnitude. It\u2019s a technology company, not an intelligence agency or an international diplomatic corps. Its engineers are in the business of building apps and selling advertising, not determining what constitutes hate speech in Myanmar. And with two billion users, including 1.3 billion who use it every day, moving ever greater amounts of their social and political activity onto Facebook, it\u2019s possible that the company is simply too big to understand all of the harmful ways people might use its products.\u201cThe reality is that if you\u2019re at the helm of a machine that has two billion screaming, whiny humans, it\u2019s basically impossible to predict each and every possible nefarious use case,\u201d said Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, author of the book \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d and a former Facebook advertising executive. \u201cIt\u2019s a Whac-a-Mole problem.\u201dElliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy, said in a statement: \u201cWe work very hard to support our millions of advertisers worldwide, but sometimes \u2014 rarely \u2014 bad actors win. We invest a lot of time, energy and resources to make these rare events extinct, and we\u2019re grateful to our community for calling out where we can do better.\u201dWhen Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, nobody could have imagined its becoming a censorship tool for repressive regimes, an arbiter of global speech standards or a vehicle for foreign propagandists.But as Facebook has grown into the global town square, it has had to adapt to its own influence. Many of its users view the social network as an essential utility, and the company\u2019s decisions \u2014 which posts to take down, which ads to allow, which videos to show \u2014 can have real life-or-death consequences around the world. The company has outsourced some decisions to complex algorithms, which carries its own risks, but many of the toughest choices Facebook faces are still made by humans.\u201cThey still see themselves as a technology middleman,\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez. \u201cFacebook is not supposed to be an element of a propaganda war. They\u2019re completely not equipped to deal with that.\u201dEven if Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg don\u2019t have personal political aspirations, as has been rumored, they are already leaders of an organization that influences politics all over the world. And there are signs that Facebook is starting to understand its responsibilities. It has hired a slew of counterterrorism experts and is expanding teams of moderators around the world to look for and remove harmful content.On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a video posted on Facebook that the company would take several steps to help protect the integrity of elections, like making political ads more transparent and expanding partnerships with election commissions.\u201cWe will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere,\u201d he said.In addition to challenges of size, Facebook\u2019s corporate culture is one of cheery optimism. That may have suited the company when it was an upstart, but it could hamper its ability to accurately predict risk now that it\u2019s a setting for large-scale global conflicts.Several current and former employees described Facebook to me as a place where engineers and executives generally assume the best of users, rather than preparing for the worst. Even the company\u2019s mission statement \u2014 \u201cGive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together\u201d \u2014 implies that people who are given powerful tools will use those tools for socially constructive purposes. Clearly, that is not always the case.Hiring people with darker views of the world could help Facebook anticipate conflicts and misuse. But pessimism alone won\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s issues. It will need to keep investing heavily in defensive tools, including artificial intelligence and teams of human moderators, to shut down bad actors. It would also be wise to deepen its knowledge of the countries where it operates, hiring more regional experts who understand the nuances of the local political and cultural environment.Facebook could even take a page from Wall Street\u2019s book, and create a risk department that would watch over its engineering teams, assessing new products and features for potential misuse before launching them to the world.Now that Facebook is aware of its own influence, the company can\u2019t dodge responsibility for the world it has helped to build. In the future, blaming the monster won\u2019t be enough.A picture caption on Friday with The Shift column, about scandals plaguing Facebook, which, like Victor Frankenstein, may have created something it cannot fully control, misidentified the actor shown playing the scientist in the movie \u201cThe Curse of Frankenstein.\u201d He was Peter Cushing, not Christopher Lee.Follow Kevin Roose on Twitter @kevinroose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Work From Home", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHurricane Sandy hit the East Coast in October 2012 while I lived in New York and juggled three jobs. Along with working at a restaurant and a news agency on nights and weekends, I spent my weekdays commuting from Brooklyn to a media company in Manhattan. When the hurricane made landfall, it crippled the city\u2019s public transportation system for weeks, leaving me all but severed from office headquarters.More than 8.1 million people in the region were without electricity in the days that followed. Yet in my Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment we had power, internet, and plumbing. This fortune came with another price: Those of us who were able to work remotely.Then things soured. I began to loathe working remotely. I felt unkempt and dirty, lonely and disconnected, malnourished and unhealthy. Turns out in my hasty jump into remote work, I had fallen for the most common pitfalls. More than five years later, I\u2019m now a regular from-afar employee \u2014 whether it be from an apartment in Brooklyn, a cabin in upstate New York, or my tiny home in Maine \u2014 and I can comfortably and productively contribute a solid day\u2019s work from almost anywhere.There are many things that contribute to becoming a successful work-from-home employee. As more companies across nearly every industry accommodate an increasing number of employees wishing to forego the morning commute and office pantry footfall, remote work has become an increasingly easy and breathlessly viable option for many who seek it.Here is a modest guide to becoming a successful remote employee, a culmination of what I\u2019ve learned along the way.Don\u2019t wake up to the blue hue of your smartphone and immediately start working. Place it across the room, or better yet, in an adjacent one, and force yourself up and out of bed to turn off your alarm each morning. When the alarm does go off, get up and prepare for your day as you would for an office job: take a shower, and get dressed.Business attire is (obviously) not required, but act as though you will be interacting with colleagues in person. After all, you never know when they may want to video chat, and you don\u2019t want to beg off because you look unkempt or aren\u2019t wearing a shirt.Before divorcing completely from the office, check with your corporate IT department and your manager to see if you are equipped with the programs and applications necessary to work remotely. Security first: If you connect to your company\u2019s internal systems or email through a Virtual Private Network or other secure tunnel, make sure you\u2019ve tested it and that it functions from where you plan to work. Also, have a backup plan in the event your connection experiences disruptions.The same advice applies to internet connectivity. I make sure that if the wireless internet in my home office fails, I can still connect seamlessly through my smartphone, set up as a Wi-Fi hot spot. To do this, make sure you have the right wireless plan, especially if you handle large files. You don\u2019t want to get hit with hefty overage fees on your cell bill just because you worked from home. Similarly, your company may provide special equipment for remote employees or pay for their mobile phone or internet service. Check with your IT or human resources department to see how they can help.Find out which of those platforms are the most convenient for the people with whom you frequently communicate. If you\u2019re not working and are out on a walk or a lunch date, don\u2019t ignore that message from a co-worker seeking clarification or assistance. Follow up, and be sure that while you are on the clock, you remain as available as if you were seated right beside them, even if it\u2019s just to say \u201cI\u2019m away from my desk, but I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I\u2019m back.\u201dSet goals. Make a list of things that need to be tackled today, this week, and this month.Block out disturbances. Set (and enforce) boundaries if you\u2019re working at home by explaining to family members or children that your work area is off limits, and they should avoid interrupting unless it\u2019s important. Set aside time and breaks to spend with them, so they don\u2019t feel entitled to your working time.There are similar tools available for other web browsers and even mobile devices; just don\u2019t spend more time installing and updating apps to keep you focused than you spend on focused work.\u201cHave a regularly scheduled social meeting: pre-work coffee, lunch with a friend or group of friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps you feel like you have a regular schedule, gives you some outside inspiration, and if nothing else, it enforces the Wear Pants rule at least once or twice a week.\u201dIt\u2019s important to socialize to combat the inherent loneliness and isolation you\u2019ll feel while out of a traditional office setting. I\u2019ve found that chatting with the owner of my corner store or other local establishment gives my days a light, communal routine, similar to what I would get in an office environment.If you are more secluded, brisk bike rides or short hikes elevate endorphins and sharpen focus the same as a quick tour of your neighborhood. Worst case, make plans to get out of the house with family or friends when the workday is over.Separating your technology from the place where you come to recharge and disconnect at the end of the day is invaluable to the discipline needed for working remotely. Just as you should wake up in a room absent of technology, you should return to one once you\u2019ve completed a day\u2019s work. When you log off for the day, log off. Close your work chat programs and emails and consider yourself \u201cout for the day,\u201d and \u201chome now.\u201dPlay with your dog or cat or goldfish and relish the fact that you work from home! Not everyone can. After all, if you get tired of it or dislike it, you can always go back to the office.Advertisement"}

Which means, in theory, your kid can talk to strangers through the app\u2019s messaging system. Another potential issue: The videos are easily deleted. So if your teenager was sexually harassed or bullied through Marco Polo, chances are the user will delete the video and you won\u2019t have proof.\u201cIf for some reason someone was bullying someone,\u201d said Vlada Bortnik, the creator of Marco Polo, \u201cwe would take the steps to make sure our platform stays safe and probably remove them from the platform.\u201d (Blocking someone is also an option.)Flipping through Yellow is like watching an MTV beach party from the 1990s, with countless photos of shirtless teenagers looking to \u201cmake new friends.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to wreak havoc with a false profile using a real schoolmate\u2019s name.In an email, Marc-Antoine Durand, the head of community and safety at Yellow, wrote that the company is addressing parents\u2019 concerns by prioritizing emails that are sent through the settings feature of the app. Yellow also has a team of \u201chuman moderators\u201d who look at potentially fake content and impostor accounts. \u201cUsers who do create fake profiles or share inappropriate content are blocked and removed from Yellow,\u201d Mr. Durand wrote.The company deletes abusive content if reported, Hanna Talving, its chief executive, wrote in an email. \u201cWe also protect our site users from negative content by flagging it to them before they see it.\u201dIn early May, Dawn Dunscombe, who lives in a small New Jersey suburb, learned that an Instagram account with the handle \u201cI Have A Crush.1\u201d was devised to impersonate her 10-year-old daughter.Ms. Dunscombe\u2019s daughter does not have an Instagram account.

{"Headline": "What I Care About Is Important. What You Care About Is a \u2018Distraction.\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsI recently stumbled across a quote, rendered in friendly block lettering and posted, naturally, on the internet: \u201cPerhaps figuring out what matters most matters most.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if it was meant to be inspirational or a joke. Funny as it sounds, it is a widespread, fervid belief that we are failing to concentrate on the things that actually matter. If only we could pay attention where attention must be paid! Instead, we fritter away our energy on frivolous distractions! Our inability to focus is framed as weakness, moral failure, neuropathology; as the byproduct of sugar, artificial colors, video games, loopy brain chemistry, social media. Distraction, we say, will be the death of us. This is the way the world ends \u2014 not with a bang but a ding. From your iPhone.Until recently, these distractions were easy to spot; you knew one when you saw one, and we all basically agreed on what mattered and what did not. Distractions were assumed to be external threats, random and dumb and always nagging at us: device notifications, blaring advertisements, pointless meetings, small talk. Without them, we assumed, we\u2019d exist in an Arcadian state of natural concentration and absorption in the task at hand. Free us from our constant diversions, and we\u2019d be forging, sowing, cobbling, real-estate-developing, brand-extending or whatever else, all in a state of blissful creative flow and perfect economic efficiency. We\u2019d enjoy quality time with children; we\u2019d bask in the power of now, mindfully present and presently mindful. Every conversation would be deep, every interaction meaningful.But sometime around the 2016 election \u2014 as political discourse grew ever more heated and chaotic and factional \u2014 we found ourselves no longer able to agree on what, precisely, was distracting us from what. Groups began to predicate entire political identities on what was \u201cimportant\u201d versus what was a \u201cdistraction,\u201d and \u201cdistraction\u201d became a euphemism for everything outside the speaker\u2019s own most fervent aims. For one person, following the Russia investigation is a distraction from the disabling of the E.P.A.; for the next, watching the E.P.A. is a distraction from legislation brewing in the House. Arguing about Confederate monuments is a distraction from health care; Trump\u2019s tweets are a distraction from Trump\u2019s executive orders.But psychological misdirection is subtler and more effective, its effects on behavior more insidious. \u201cThe false solution,\u201d for instance, encourages people to believe they\u2019ve figured out how a trick is done, at which point they stop considering any alternative solutions. Other tricks use cognitive illusions like \u201cchoice blindness\u201d (in which someone is steered to defend a choice they didn\u2019t actually make) and \u201cforcing\u201d (in which people believe that they have free choice in a decision that\u2019s been carefully managed all along).Decades later, shortly after 9/11, Berger wrote about the hazards of mistaking that ideology for reality. \u201cBeing a unique superpower,\u201d he wrote, \u201cundermines the military intelligence of strategy. To think strategically, one has to imagine oneself in the enemy\u2019s place. If one cannot do this, it is impossible to foresee, to take by surprise, to outflank. Misinterpreting an enemy can lead to defeat. This is how empires fall.\u201d What he was recommending was empathy, sincerity and curiosity \u2014 the ability to step into somebody else\u2019s shoes, even if it\u2019s only in the service of defeating them. But in order to do this, we must first agree that the shoes exist, and that they are indeed shoes. He was talking about engaging in good faith with reality.It\u2019s no longer a given that we do. It\u2019s a sign of the times that we can hardly agree on what constitutes a distraction and what constitutes stuff-that-matters. It\u2019s an even bigger, more garish sign of the times that the debate itself is being conducted in bad faith. The way we use the word \u201cdistraction\u201d now seems like the mirror image of the problem it wants to name. It\u2019s a word we use to dismiss everything besides what we want to focus on, a habit that leaves us even more blinkered and blinded than the distracted person, who is at least open to chance. Our tug of war over what is important and what is irrelevant reveals something unsettling: a bent toward totalizing ideologies and a seismic struggle over which one gets to lay claim \u2014 in our minds, at least \u2014 to the center of the universe.Advertisement"}

But he said that the government had noted the arrest \u201cwith grave concern,\u201d adding that the charges \u201cappear to be politically motivated.\u201dFounded in 2012, the Cambodia National Rescue Party poses the first genuine challenge in years to Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s rule. In an interview with The New York Times in June, Mr. Kem Sokha said he hoped his party could win parliamentary elections next year and effect a peaceful transfer of power.\u201cThe bottom line is that the people have already decided for change,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is, they have already made up their mind, and if the ruling party is in some way preventing that change through free and fair elections, the international community needs to use all the leverage they have to counter that in order to avoid violence.\u201dDavid Chandler, a professor emeritus at Monash University in Australia who worked as a United States Embassy official in Phnom Penh in the 1960s, said that the situation in Cambodia had become \u201cgenuinely scary\u201d in recent months.He said that Mr. Hun Sen has long been suspicious of Washington\u2019s intentions and believes that a strong element of United States policy is regime change.\u201cI can\u2019t see why or how Hun Sen will turn back from where he seems to be headed,\u201d Mr. Chandler said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think he wants to.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s government has cracked down on independent news outlets and democracy advocates, after local elections in June in which the opposition party made unprecedented gains.It has become common in recent months for Cambodian officials to accuse the United States of hypocrisy and interference in Cambodian affairs. A government spokesman, Phay Siphan, denied any tensions with the United States, however, describing the recent developments as \u201ca coincidence\u201d and proof of the government\u2019s commitment to rule of law.Mr. Kem Sokha\u2019s arrest was quickly condemned by opposition leaders and international human rights activists.\u201cThe arrest of Kem Sokha is a disastrous setback for Cambodia\u2019s human rights situation,\u201d said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.He urged other nations to put pressure on Mr. Hun Sen. \u201cThe international community, which provides a major percentage of the Cambodian government\u2019s annual budget, should put Hun Sen on notice that if he doesn\u2019t reverse course, it will be impossible to consider next year\u2019s elections free and fair,\u201d he said.The arrest also drew fire from Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, an association of members of Parliament from Southeast Asian nations.Charles Santiago, a member of the Malaysian Parliament and chairman of the organization, said the arrest violated the immunity protection that should be afforded Mr. Kem Sokha as a member of Cambodia\u2019s Parliament.\u201cWith national elections on the horizon, it is clear that this is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to crush the opposition before the campaign even starts,\u201d Mr. Santiago said. \u201cFor months, we have been witnessing the escalation of government attempts to cripple the opposition, but it appears now that Prime Minister Hun Sen is so afraid of what might happen in a genuine vote, he won\u2019t allow for competition at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A woman in Texas, for example, told us that the company that manages her drug benefits, OptumRx, was going to start asking her to pay more out of pocket for Butrans, a painkilling patch that contains the drug buprenorphine. As a \u201clower cost alternative,\u201d OptumRx, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group, suggested she try painkillers like OxyContin, according to a letter she shared with us, even though they carry a higher risk of abuse and dependence.\u201cThe whole point of pain management is to take the least amount of medication possible to manage your pain, so that you always have somewhere to go when the pain increases or changes,\u201d she wrote to us. \u201cThis is irresponsible and scary \u2018cost management.\u2019 \u201d She did not want us to use her name, saying her employer prohibited her from identifying herself, but she allowed us to share OptumRx\u2019s redacted letter.Her pharmacy benefit manager, she wrote, is \u201ceffectively contributing to the \u2018opioid crisis\u2019 with its own policies.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from people about their experiences paying for prescription drugs.Then we asked for documents: billing statements from insurers, denial letters, call logs and doctors\u2019 records. In the case of our lead example, a woman named Alisa Erkes, she also agreed to sign a privacy waiver allowing her insurer, UnitedHealthcare, to comment on her case.Charles enlisted ProPublica\u2019s deputy data editor, Ryann Grochowski Jones, to analyze data from Medicare prescription drug plans. The results showed that insurers were indeed placing more barriers to drugs like Butrans and lidocaine patches than to cheaper generic opioids.But their behavior has infuriated many patients, who say they want to avoid taking opioids if possible. They argue that insurers are too focused on a drug\u2019s cost, since many of the painkillers with a lower risk of addiction are more expensive.Our project examining high drug costs is not over. We are already digging into other corners of the prescription drug world, hoping to shed light on more of the hidden forces that are keeping drug costs high.

{"Headline": "In Alaska\u2019s Far-Flung Villages, Happiness Is a Cake Mix", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAMBELL, Alaska \u2014 In a modest boardinghouse on an Alaskan island just 30 miles across the sea from Russia, a handwritten order form hangs on the refrigerator. There are photos of cakes a few women in this village can make for you: rectangles of yellow cake and devil\u2019s food enrobed in buttercream, with local nicknames piped out in pink.\u201cHappy Birthday Bop-Bop,\u201d one reads. Another, \u201cHappy Birthday Siti-Girl.\u201dTraveling out here, where huge bones from bowhead whales litter the beach, takes a 90-minute jet ride north from Anchorage and another hour by small plane over the Bering Sea. In this vast, wild part of America, accessible only by water or air, there may not be plumbing or potable water, the local store may not carry perishables and people may have to rely on caribou or salmon or bearded seal meat to stay fed.But no matter where you go, you will always find a cake-mix cake.Elsewhere, the American appetite for packaged baking mixes is waning, according to the market research firm Mintel, as consumers move away from packaged foods with artificial ingredients and buy more from in-store bakeries and specialty pastry shops. Yet in the small, mostly indigenous communities that dot rural Alaska, box cake is a stalwart staple, the star of every community dessert table and a potent fund-raising tool.\u201cCake mixes are the center of our little universe,\u201d said Cynthia Erickson, who owns the only grocery store in Tanana, an Athabascan village of 300 along the Yukon River in central Alaska. \u201cI have four damn shelves full.\u201dEating in rural Alaska is all about managing the expense and scarcity of store-bought food while trying to take advantage of seasonally abundant wild foods. Cash economies are weak, utilities and fuel are expensive and many families live below the federal poverty line.To offset the cost of living, Alaska Natives here rely on traditional practices of hunting, fishing and gathering, known as \u201csubsistence.\u201d In a good year, they fill freezers with moose, berries, caribou, salmon or marine mammals, depending on where they live. In a bad year, they have to buy more from the store.The offerings in village stores often resemble those in the mini-marts or bodegas of America\u2019s urban food deserts, at two and three times the price. Food journeys in via jet, small plane and barge. Milk and eggs spoil fast. Produce gets roughed up. Among the Hostess doughnuts, Spam and soda, cake mix is one of the few items on shelves everywhere that require actual cooking.As a result, tricking out mixes has become a cottage industry, and many villages have a \u201ccake lady\u201d with her signature twist. Some bake as a hobby, while others do a brisk business selling cakes in places where getting to a bakery requires a plane ticket.In the far north, bakers make cake with fondant photo prints of Inupiat whaling crews and serve it with mikigaq, fermented whale meat. On the western coast, mixes may be prepared with sea gull eggs. In the interior, pineapple upside-down cake is eaten with a salad made of lard, sugar, berries and whitefish. Fund-raisers known as cake walks \u2014 a variation on musical chairs \u2014 pay for coffins, support people through chemotherapy and send whole basketball teams to the Lower 48.\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t have a lot of the stuff to make a regular cake,\u201d said Ms. Erickson, who frequently bakes for St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Church. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have butter or you don\u2019t have milk.\u201dBut with one substitution or another, you can always make a mix cake. Mayonnaise can take the place of an egg. Some recipes call for nothing but a mix and a bottle of Sprite. The Whole Foods crowd may judge it, she said, but where she lives it makes sense.In Unalakleet, 300 miles west of Tanana on Norton Sound, Donna Erickson (no relation to Cynthia) is a noted cake lady. Her most famous creation was born in a rush to get to a community potluck. She made a white cake and poured it into a sheet pan because she knew it would bake quickly.\u201cI mixed orange Jell-O with two cups of bright orange salmonberries. I poured it on top of that cake and I threw it in the fridge,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were just like, \u2018Wow, can you make that again for me?\u2019 \u201dRural Alaska has some of the highest rates of accidental death and suicide in the country. When there is tragedy in Unalakleet, bakers bring cakes to the school multipurpose room and lay them on a big table with corresponding numbers. Popular flavors include salmonberry, tundra blueberry and low-bush cranberry.Then the cake walk begins: People buy a ticket, then circle the table while music plays. When it stops, somebody draws a number out of an old coffee can. The person standing by the corresponding cake wins that one and the money goes toward healing someone\u2019s family, Donna Erickson said.\u201cIt\u2019s a festive environment even though it\u2019s a sad time,\u201d she added. \u201cYou should see the cakes; they are so beautiful. Village bakers are so brilliant.\u201dIn America\u2019s northernmost town, Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), the baker Mary Patkotak is an expert at gaming cake economics. She uses Betty Crocker triple chocolate fudge mix for her famous cherry-chocolate cake. In the village store, it costs $4.59 a box. On Amazon, where Ms. Patkotak orders it, it\u2019s $1.29. Alaska\u2019s many weather delays mean the mix never shows up on time, but she doesn\u2019t care because it qualifies her for partial refunds on her annual Prime membership.\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I paid the Amazon Prime fee,\u201d she said.She bakes when she knows a payday is coming around. She ships cakes and cupcakes to out-of-town customers who order from her Facebook page, freezing them and tucking them into the cargo hold of a small plane. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any bakeries. We have very few restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople really crave the fresh cake.\u201dLast winter, Cynthia Erickson snowmobiled an old propane stove to her summer hunting camp, 50 miles northwest of Tanana on the Tozitna River. It fell apart on the way, but her husband wired it back together. She fired it up and slid in a chocolate cake.It\u2019s a simple thing, making a cake from a box, but when you\u2019re doing it at 30 degrees below zero in Alaska, you feel rich, she said.\u201cI was, like, the camp queen!\u201d she said. \u201cMiddle of nowhere, eating cake.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

In many of the most popular clips, these whippersnappers engage in adultlike conversations, amusingly given their babyish voices. The videos can be incredibly popular. And marketers have noticed.Mila and Emma have done advertising work for Amazon, Nest, Dollar Rental Car, Macy\u2019s and Walmart, among other companies. They\u2019re flying to New York in October to shoot video spoofs of movies including \u201cClueless\u201d and \u201cMean Girls\u201d for Harper\u2019s Bazaar.\u201cIt is really lucrative,\u201d said Katie Stauffer, their mother. \u201cBut I wish people knew that this is my job now.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t detail exactly how much money the children are bringing in, but she said she was recently able to leave her position as an escrow officer after 12 years, much to the relief of herself and her husband, a doctor. With her working outside the home, \u201cmy kids weren\u2019t getting what they needed,\u201d she said.Still, Ms. Stauffer often gets criticized in the comments of her Instagram feed, where people frequently remark on the food she lets her children eat and the brands she takes money from. After a sponsored post for a brand of chicken, \u201cwe got a lot of flak,\u201d she said.And the talent can be difficult. Emma doesn\u2019t love making videos, and Mila wants to make them only when she wants. Ms. Stauffer has stopped cutting deals with companies that insist on giving her deadlines. \u201cYou can\u2019t make 2-year-olds do anything,\u201d she said.Instead she stages photo shoots many times a week, during which the girls do relaxed toddler things: make princess cakes; drag dolls dressed like the twins; or sit in wagons while having staring contests in front of the family\u2019s stately red-doored home.Kaitlin often cues the children their more sophisticated lines. In one recent video, Mila addresses a date with her friend Sawyer that went boringly wrong when he paid more attention to his sports league than to her.\u201cFantasy football?\u201d Mila said, while raising her palm talk-to-the-hand style. \u201cSo basic.\u201d\u201cKids are the new social influencer,\u201d he said. He is not a parent himself, but he understands the instinct to seize on corporate offers when they arise. \u201cKids grow up and become less relevant. The sweet spot is between 2 and 4,\u201d after which, Mr. Smith said, \u201cthey\u2019re not that cute.\u201dHe has also teamed up with Korbin Jackson, a 3-year-old from Dothan, Ala., who is best known for his soccer and Ping-Pong ball trick shot videos.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to work with kids, but it\u2019s fun,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Ten of Korbin\u2019s videos have been featured on ESPN, and he has been interviewed by news stations in Japan and Romania. His Instagram feed has nearly 65,000 followers.Born with a disability, Korbin spent two and a half years doing physical therapy. \u201cHe finds so much joy and happiness in life, and we are so proud to share his good energy,\u201d said his mother, Stephanie Jackson.She said when Korbin arrives at school with his father, the older children surround him and ask to take selfies with the local celebrity. \u201cWhen Korbin gets to high school, his following will be huge,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Instagram just set him up for greatness.\u201dKorbin receives a lot of free stuff in the mail, and his parents often tag the brands in posts. Unsolicited, Ms. Jackson said, GoPro sent about $2,000 worth of camera equipment. Many sportswear companies send packages. Korbin\u2019s feed frequently promotes Under Armour. \u201cThey send him boxes once a month,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paper deal, it\u2019s not a contract, they are inspired by him.\u201dAware of the existence of online predators, she tries to limit the number of people who know the family\u2019s home address. \u201cWe do get weird emails and DMs like \u2018We will meet him no matter what you say,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Laws that regulate children\u2019s rights to money earned by parents using their images on social media aren\u2019t clear, lawyers say. In California, the so-called Coogan Law \u2014 named for the child star Jackie Coogan, who worked with Charlie Chaplin in \u201cThe Kid\u201d \u2014 mandates that a portion of money earned by child actors be placed in trust for the children.There are plenty of parents eager to jump in. Destiny Bennett and her husband, Devonte, moved to Los Angeles earlier this year and decided that acting would be a good career for their son Caidyn, 4.But when he didn\u2019t get the audition callbacks that his parents had hoped for, they decided to try marketing his talents through videos posted to Instagram and YouTube. \u201cWe told him, \u2018We can do our own auditions, and you can talk about anything you want.\u2019\u201dMs. Bennett says Caidyn is not yet sure if he will continue to focus on making viral videos, or the clothing line that she says he is preparing with his brother, who is 1.\u201cWe are a family of entrepreneurs,\u201d she said.Josh Gaines, known on social media as \u201cJosh Darnit,\u201d previously used the six-second video loop platform Vine, which was introduced on Twitter in 2013, to post videos of his children, most successfully his young son Evan smacking his dad. Making Vine videos was easy, he said, and he could repackage them on YouTube to generate revenue in addition to sponsorships.When Vine shut down in 2016, Mr. Gaines recalibrated his focus on videos for Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. These videos require more production resources. Evan, now 7, has grown bored. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like about doing them is they take a superlong time, and sometimes Dad tells me to say hard words. Like \u2018subscribe,\u2019\u201d Evan said.Fortunately, his older sister, Johnna, 11, has stepped up. \u201cOnce we got to that age that Evan resisted a lot, I shifted more to my daughter,\u201d Mr. Gaines said. \u201cShe is a little workhorse.\u201dImprovised videos are easier. \u201cI like to be in the spotlight,\u201d Johnna said. \u201cIf we have to do a script and Dad is telling us what to say, like an ad for a toy, or when we were doing the ones for the drones that had a script, that felt more like work.\u201dFor a deal he cut with Best Buy, Mr. Gaines enticed Evan and Johnna to spend their last week of summer vacation taking a road trip to a Nintendo World Championship qualifiers, which were taking place at a few Best Buy stores.On the trip, Mr. Gaines would post pictures and videos to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Each of the children got a new Nintendo Switch game system, he said.He and his wife, Sarah, said they don\u2019t pay the children or split revenue with them. The family\u2019s standard of living is improved when the social media business is going well, and all members benefit, they said.Best Buy wanted to team with the \u201cDarnit Family\u201d because they have broad reach across many digital platforms and are known for family fun. \u201cThey are on a road trip as a family and are having fun through Best Buy, and that\u2019s exactly the message we want people to get excited about,\u201d said Shane Kitzman, a Best Buy spokesman. He would not disclose any financial details about the partnership.Ms. Ryan didn\u2019t realize that Ava\u2019s proclivity to create characters and do deadpan impersonations of them would attract a wider audience.Thanks to the ad revenue she earns via YouTube, Ms. Ryan said she is able to be a stay-at-home mother.The video has been viewed 35 million times across various Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine Facebook pages, according to Anne Sachs, W\u2019s executive digital director.Though Ava writes her ideas for video in a journal and will ask to do them regularly, \u201csometimes I tell her, \u2018Let\u2019s just got to the park instead of doing a video right now,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ryan said. \u201cThis is like her little side project in life.

A promo video for the Apple Watch as a fitness tool was so heartwarming and inspirational I think the Apple Watch may be running for president.Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for retail, said new Apple stores would be rebranded Town Squares, places for community gathering, education \u2014 and buying the occasional thousand-dollar phone. (\u201cApple retail,\u201d Mr. Cook said, \u201chas always been about more than selling. It\u2019s about learning, inspiring and connecting with people.\u201d)You will do such fantastic things with this technology, the presentation said. You\u2019ll get healthy! You\u2019ll learn! You\u2019ll play ennobling games!Though Mr. Jobs is gone, his minimalist aesthetic lives on in Cupertino, in the products and on the stage. Everything was set off against a black screen, like diamond necklaces in a velvet case. The show opened with footage of the sun rising (or setting? Surely it was rising) over the curvilinear new Steve Jobs Theater, where the event took place.Mr. Cook is an amiable presenter, but he doesn\u2019t pretend to have Mr. Jobs\u2019s magnetism. Wearing a zippered fleece \u2014 rich-guy casualwear as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s aesthete\u2019s turtlenecks \u2014 he passed the spotlight around to associates. Among them was the designer Jonathan Ive, speaking from a white room in tandem with an animated monkey emoji.I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m immune to this allure. I watched the Apple keynote on my Apple iMac after getting a reminder on my Apple iPad and being unable to start a stream through the Apple events app on my Apple TV. A 1989 Mac Plus that I can\u2019t bear to part with still sits in my basement. I will almost certainly buy one of the new phones.What will I do with it? What does anyone? I will Instagram photos of my cooking that I think look more appetizing than they are. I will see another tweet from the president. I will Google song lyrics. I will read Facebook posts and get mad on the internet.And another year from now, I\u2019ll set another reminder to watch another Apple event, believing somewhere deep down that with one more upgrade, I might be perfected.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the Apple presentation Steve Jobs gave 10 years ago. He introduced the iPhone; it was not his first Apple keynote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teenager Who Says Police Coerced Witnesses Faces Trial", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs New York City crimes go, the shooting in September 2015 outside a CTown supermarket in the Bronx ranked as a minor event, yet another flash of violence between warring crews of neighborhood youths: The 15-year-old victim, Shaun Nardoni, was hit in the left ankle by a slug that ricocheted off the pavement. He survived, and, as often happens in street conflicts, told the police he did not see who pulled the trigger.Ten months later, another teenager, Pedro Hernandez, was arrested in connection with the shooting and jailed for a year on Rikers Island on a high bail of $250,000. Then the case took an unusual turn: Mr. Hernandez refused to accept a plea bargain that would have kept him out of prison. Instead, his family hired a private investigator, who has found evidence he says proves that investigators in the 42nd Precinct and a Bronx prosecutor coerced other young men to sign false complaints against Mr. Hernandez.Mr. Hernandez, 17, has sued the two detectives and the city, alleging he was the victim of a campaign of false arrests. One of the detectives, David Terrell, has been put on desk duty by the Police Department in connection with an unrelated domestic violence accusation. A spokeswoman for the Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, said prosecutors were investigating Detective Terrell\u2019s role in several criminal cases.To his defenders, Mr. Hernandez is an innocent teenager who has been harassed and jailed by detectives from the 42nd Precinct. His lawyers maintain that the police were determined to connect him to the shooting of Mr. Nardoni and other crimes on him even if it meant coercing false testimony from other young men in the area.But the police and Bronx prosecutors say they have evidence Mr. Hernandez is an active member of the Hilltop Boys, a violent gang operating around East 168th Street and Boston Road in the Morrisania neighborhood. They say he orchestrated the shooting of Mr. Nardoni through Facebook, calling on his crew to go after a rival gang, the B-Road crew.In just a few short years, investigators say, Mr. Hernandez, 17, has turned up at the center of several investigations of violence in the neighborhood. Seven times since 2014, he has been arrested on felony charges, including gun possession, attempted murder and armed robbery. Four of those cases later fell apart for a lack of evidence, and the charges were dismissed.On Wednesday, Mr. Hernandez is scheduled to go to trial on gun possession and assault charges in the shooting of Mr. Nardoni. But that case also appears to be unraveling. The private investigator for the defense, Manuel Gomez, has found at least five witnesses who say another man pulled the trigger. One of them has spoken to the Bronx District Attorney\u2019s office, a prosecutor said in court.At the same time, another young man from the neighborhood, William Stevens, has made explosive allegations that Detective Terrell repeatedly beat him and coerced him to swear out false accusations against Mr. Hernandez. Specifically, he said, he was forced to identify Mr. Hernandez as the man who shot Mr. Nardoni.Mr. Stevens also claimed to have been forced by Detective Terrell to make similarly false accusations against a score of other defendants, raising questions about other prosecutions in the Bronx.James M. Moschella, a lawyer for Detective Terrell, said the suits were baseless vendettas by people he had arrested and their parents, built on lies. Detective Terrell was removed from active duty a year ago, after being accused of domestic violence, not because of the lawsuits, he said.\u201cThey capitalized on an unfortunate incident in Detective Terrell\u2019s personal life that somehow paints a picture that he was a quote-unquote monster detective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201dIt is unclear if prosecutors ever intended to rely on Mr. Stevens as a witness at trial. The lead prosecutor, David A. Slott, said in court last year that the state has come to believe that Mr. Hernandez was not the gunman, but instead handed the gun to a second man, who pulled the trigger.So far, though, the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office has said it still intends to prosecute Mr. Hernandez. Investigators say he has been a focus in a continuing investigation into the Hilltop Boys.At a bail hearing, Mr. Slott said prosecutors are also investigating Mr. Hernandez as a suspect in a check-cashing scam. He has posted pictures of himself with stacks of hundred dollar bills on Facebook, Mr. Slott said.In court, prosecutors have revealed little about the evidence they have, except to say an eyewitness identified Mr. Hernandez as a culprit. Defense lawyers concede a security camera at the grocery store filmed Mr. Hernandez just before the shooting, around 9:30 p.m., but did not record the shooting itself. They deny Mr. Hernandez had a gun.Mr. Gomez, a former city police officer who has become a crusader for young people he believes are wrongly accused, said the witnesses he had discovered identified the gunman as another well-known figure in the neighborhood. A 22-year-old mother who was coming out of the grocery store with her baby and a container of milk, said to Mr. Gomez in a videotaped statement that she saw a tall, skinny man she knows as \u201cCJ\u201d fire a handgun into the crowd. A second witness confirmed her account on tape, also naming \u201cCJ.\u201d\u201cIt was a perfect example of what is wrong with the money bail system,\u201d said Wade McMullen, the managing attorney for the Kennedy human rights group. \u201cThis is a child who posed no risk of flight \u2014 he had never missed a court date and was committed to clearing his name at trial \u2014 but who was being held on $250,000 bail.\u201dIn addition, his lawsuit has painted an ugly portrait of police misconduct. It accuses Detective Terrell and another detective, Daniel Brady, of systematically arresting young men on bogus charges, then using violence and threats to force them to make false statements about crimes they did not witness.A dozen other young men have filed similar lawsuits or notices of claim against Detective Terrell, alleging they too were beaten and pressured to sign fictitious complaints against Mr. Hernandez and others. One of them is Tyrese Revels, who was shot in June 2015. Mr. Hernandez was arrested in connection with that shooting but never indicted. Three of the suits also accuse Mr. Slott of witness coercion.Even Mr. Nardoni, the shooting victim, has accused Detective Terrell of misconduct. In a lawsuit, Mr. Nardoni said the detective interrogated him for more than three hours at the station house, threatening to punch him in the head in a failed attempt to make him name Mr. Hernandez as the gunman.Asked about the allegations against Detective Brady and Detective Terrell, Meryl Holt, a spokeswoman for the city Law Department, declined to comment on the lawsuits. Patrice O\u2019Shaughnessy, the spokeswoman for the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office, said: \u201cWe do not comment on allegations made in a civil suit.\u201d Mr. Slott did not respond to a call and an email from a reporter.An earlier version of this article misstated when the shooting that Pedro Hernandez is charged in occurred. It was in September 2015, not July 2015.Advertisement"}

The officer, Jeff L. Payne, handcuffed her in response, accusing her of impeding an investigation.Ms. Wubbels was not charged with any crimes. Mr. Payne and an unnamed officer were put on administrative leave as the department conducts a criminal investigation into the episode.On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Payne was also fired from his part-time job as a paramedic with Gold Cross Ambulance because of remarks he made that the company\u2019s president said were \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201dNurses at the hospital will no longer deal directly with law enforcement officers, according to the new policy. Instead, officers will check in at the front desk and will interact with a supervisor who is trained in law and hospital policy, said Margaret Pearce, the chief nursing officer at the University of Utah hospital system.The change in policy will allow nurses to focus on caring for patients, Ms. Pearce said.\u201cIf there is a discussion or an issue, it needs to occur outside the patient care environment,\u201d she said.The patient, identified as William Gray, was a truck driver and reserve police officer for the Rigby Police Department in Idaho. He was not suspected of wrongdoing; a driver fleeing the police crashed into Mr. Gray\u2019s truck, severely injuring Mr. Gray and killing himself.\u201cThe Rigby Police Department would like to thank the nurse involved and hospital staff for standing firm, and protecting Officer Gray\u2019s rights as a patient and victim,\u201d the statement read. \u201cProtecting the rights of others is truly a heroic act.\u201dMs. Wubbels has said in interviews that she hoped the episode would create a productive discussion.Matt Stevens contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
