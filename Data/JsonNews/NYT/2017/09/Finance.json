{"Headline": "Is Trump Really Pro-Worker?", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionEven though Donald Trump is a flamboyant billionaire, many blue-collar voters embraced him as the presidential candidate who would lift them out of their economic rut. \u201cI will bring jobs back and get wages up,\u201d Mr. Trump said last summer, vowing to get tough on trade, Mexico and China.But this Labor Day, his first while in office, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives have done much to help workers, whether blue-collar or any other collar. It is clear, however, that he has taken several steps that will hurt workers, most notably his decisions to delay, weaken or erase Obama-era workplace regulations. For instance, his administration has postponed rules that protect workers from dangerous silica dust and beryllium.Mr. Trump has repeatedly trumpeted actions he has taken to help workers. He has withdrawn from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact that he said would clobber American factory workers, he has moved to crack down on imported steel and aluminum, and he has boasted that coal mines are reopening and factories expanding thanks to him. In one of his proudest moments, he flew to Indianapolis to announce that he had persuaded the Carrier Corporation not to ship 1,100 factory jobs to Mexico.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s moves to help workers have come with a serious downside. He has given green lights to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which will help create a few thousand construction jobs \u2014 although environmentalists protest that the pipelines will hasten global warming by increasing America\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. His threats to place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports might restore some jobs in those industries, but they could spur Chinese or European retaliation against other American industries, costing jobs. Moreover, any tariffs on steel and aluminum could harm industries \u2014 like automobiles and appliances \u2014 that use these metals, reducing employment there as well.Mr. Trump has made reviving the coal industry his crusade. \u201cI happen to love the coal miners,\u201d he said in June. To that end, he has pulled out of the Paris climate accord, is seeking to scrap rules against coal-fired power plants and allowed the dumping of coal waste in streams.Environmentalists warn that these moves will accelerate global warming and despoil coal country, and many economists predict that these moves will add few coal jobs. Coal-mining employment peaked at more than 800,000 in the 1920s and has slid to around 50,000 \u2014 one-eighth the number of Home Depot jobs \u2014 largely because of more efficient mining technologies and the increased use of cleaner energy substitutes like natural gas, solar and wind.Mr. Trump also claimed credit for the opening of the Corsa coal mine in Pennsylvania, even though the company began digging that mine two months before the election. Statements like that form a pattern for Mr. Trump. Last January he said he was responsible for Ford\u2019s decision to cancel construction of a Ford Focus factory in Mexico and expand jobs in Michigan (to build electric and self-driving cars). Ford said those moves were made because of market conditions, and undercutting Mr. Trump, the company announced in June that it would build the Focus in China.Carrier workers are grateful to Mr. Trump, but many note that fewer jobs are being saved than he said. In exchange for Indiana\u2019s providing $7 million in tax breaks, Carrier promised to keep 800 of 1,200 jobs it had planned to move to Mexico. But the Indianapolis plant has announced plans to lay off 600 workers, whose jobs are still moving to Mexico. And even though it was the target of Mr. Trump\u2019s angry tweets, Rexnord, a ball-bearing manufacturer, is still moving 300 jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico.Mr. Trump repeatedly derided the levels of job creation under President Barack Obama, vowing to increase them by eliminating \u201cjob-killing regulations.\u201d But the pace of job creation under Mr. Trump \u2014 170,000 a month \u2014 is slightly less than during Mr. Obama\u2019s last six months in office.Business has enthusiastically applauded Mr. Trump for taking a hatchet to Obama-era regulations. Mr. Trump has signed legislation scrapping a rule requiring federal contractors to disclose wage, safety and workplace discrimination violations \u2014 a regulation based on the notion that sunlight acts as a deterrent. His administration has indicated it will dilute an Obama regulation that would make four million more workers qualify for overtime pay. His Labor Department has also signaled it will weaken or kill the \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which requires Wall Street to act in the best interests of workers and retirees in managing retirement funds.Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce for labor issues, praised Mr. Trump for rolling back workplace regulations, saying they would have cost businesses billions of dollars. Saying it\u2019s not unusual for a new president to rethink his predecessor\u2019s rules, Mr. Johnson said, \u201cThese initiatives are going to allow employers to spend money on more productive investments, and that\u2019s going to benefit workers.\u201dBoth business and labor approve of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta\u2019s push to expand apprenticeships \u2014 important job-training routes \u2014 to increase mobility and wages for those who don\u2019t go to college. Meanwhile, labor groups are criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to chop Labor Department spending by 20 percent, including cuts to its job-training programs.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget would hurt coal miners in numerous ways. It would cut money for mine safety enforcement and eliminate funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission, which has aided hundreds of coal counties by financing job retraining and social services, helping to cut Appalachia\u2019s poverty rates nearly in half.Mr. Trump promised to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure, a move that unions liked because it would create hundreds of thousands of middle-class jobs. But labor leaders are disappointed that the president\u2019s infrastructure plans have stalled. They also complain that Mr. Trump has shown no interest in raising the minimum wage and has appointed numerous anti-union officials. And they\u2019re waiting to see what he does on Nafta, beyond talking tough.Janice Bellace, an industrial relations expert at the Wharton School, voiced alarm that the Trump administration seems far more concerned about the loss of several thousand coal jobs than what she sees as a far bigger threat: the prospect that automation, artificial intelligence and robots, such as self-driving cars and trucks, will wipe out millions of jobs.Steven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is writing a book about the history and future of labor unions and worker advocacy in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Beijing and Abu Dhabi, Signs of Bannon\u2019s Continued Influence", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon met privately with a top Chinese government official and a key leader in the Persian Gulf during a recent trip to Asia and the Middle East, demonstrating that President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist is still viewed as an influential figure abroad.In Beijing, Mr. Bannon spent 90 minutes with Wang Qishan, a powerful member of the standing committee of the Chinese Politburo who is leading President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-corruption campaign. In the United Arab Emirates, he met the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who arguably has more sway over American policy in the region than any other Arab leader.He met with two other Chinese officials while in Beijing, one of whom selects articles from the People\u2019s Daily for the Chinese leadership, according to two people briefed on the meetings. The purpose, these people said, was to discuss the rise of economic nationalism and populism.\u201cTo avoid a trade war,\u201d Mr. Bannon told his audience, \u201cChina must cease its economic war against America.\u201dHis meeting with Prince bin Zayed came at a sensitive moment, days after Mr. Trump failed to broker a resolution to a bitter dispute pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar\u2019s neighbors cut off diplomatic ties and imposed a blockade after accusing Doha of a multitude of sins, from financing militant groups to currying favor with Iran.Mr. Bannon got to know Prince bin Zayed during the presidential transition when the Emirates royal met him at Trump Tower, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Michael T. Flynn, who was to become Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser.Mr. Bannon declined to discuss the details of his meetings. But it is not hard, given his views and recent proximity to Mr. Trump, to guess why foreign leaders would seek him out. He still talks to the president from time to time, even if the White House plays down the frequency of those contacts.For Mr. Bannon, getting time with Mr. Wang put him as close as he could get to President Xi himself. A former mayor of Beijing and executive vice governor of Guangdong Province, Mr. Wang, 69, is the president\u2019s right-hand man, particularly in carrying out his crackdown on corruption in the Communist Party.Mr. Wang meets regularly with prominent Americans, including Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Henry M. Paulson, the former Treasury secretary. People who know Mr. Wang describe him as well-read, intellectually curious and unafraid to engage in fierce debates with his visitors.\u201cWang met with Bannon for two reasons,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s top adviser on China. \u201cHe was persuaded that Bannon still has influence with the administration. He\u2019s also a guy who likes to think on a big scale, and likes to talk to other people who think on a big scale.\u201dMr. Bannon, who once lived in Shanghai, has said he views China as the greatest long-term threat to the United States. \u201cA hundred years from now, this is what they\u2019ll remember,\u201d he declared in a recent interview. \u201cWhat we did to confront China on its rise to world domination.\u201d\u201cChina right now is Germany in 1930,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the cusp.

{"Headline": "SoFi Board Says C.E.O. Is Out Immediately Amid Sexual Harassment Scandal", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Finance, a privately held online lender and technology start-up, said on Friday that Mike Cagney would step down immediately as chief executive, accelerating a departure announced this week amid a sexual harassment scandal.The board of the company, which is based in San Francisco and known as SoFi, said that Tom Hutton, the executive chairman, would be the interim chief executive and would take over day-to-day management responsibilities. Mr. Hutton, an initial SoFi investor, has been on the SoFi board since 2012.\u201cThe business is strong, stable and well-positioned,\u201d Mr. Hutton said in a statement. \u201cFor now, there is no more important work than paving the way for future success by building a transparent, respectful and accountable culture.\u201dHe did not respond to a request for comment.SoFi was founded in 2011 and bundles money from Wall Street investors into loans for students, home buyers and others. The company is valued at more than $4 billion and has raised $1.9 billion from venture investors, including Baseline Ventures, Discovery Capital and SoftBank. It recently began the process of applying for a banking license.Mr. Cagney said in the letter he sent to SoFi employees on Monday that \u201cthe combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company\u2019s core mission.\u201dThe article included details of a $75,000 settlement that SoFi reached with a former executive assistant at the company, Laura Munoz, who some people said had received sexually explicit text messages from Mr. Cagney. He was also seen holding hands and talking intimately with another female employee, which made employees uncomfortable.In addition, the article reported on a SoFi loan product that was sold to investors without being properly funded. The product was ultimately phased out, with investors being offered their money back or an opportunity to invest in a new product. They were not told about the funding shortfall.A SoFi spokesman told The Times for the article that the company had not taken on too much risk and that the board had investigated the dispute with Ms. Munoz in 2012 and had found no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship. He declined to comment on other personal relationships involving Mr. Cagney and other employees, saying the company did not comment on personnel matters. The spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Friday.With Mr. Cagney\u2019s abrupt departure, SoFi joins the ranks of technology start-ups that have had to contend with serious issues related to workplace culture. Other companies in that category include the blood testing start-up Theranos, the insurance start-up Zenefits and, perhaps most prominently, the ride-hailing company Uber, whose chief executive, Travis Kalanick, stepped down amid a spate of scandals.Like some of those companies, SoFi continues to grow quickly. The company said in a statement on Monday that it had funded $3.1 billion in loans in the second quarter of 2017, generating more than $134 million in revenue. It said it had lent more than $20 billion to more than 350,000 borrowers over the course of its history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Qatari Network beIN Sports, Political Feud Spills Into Stadiums", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 One of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of sports rights has a problem: It\u2019s Qatari.The broadcaster, beIN Sports, has poured billions of dollars into securing rights to major events, notably in soccer, in recent years. But over the last three months, it has become entangled in a bitter diplomatic crisis in which several Arabic-speaking countries, led by Saudi Arabia, severed relations with Qatar, the tiny gas-rich emirate that will host the 2022 World Cup.For beIN, which is financed by the Qatari government, the fallout is starting to affect business across the Middle East and Africa, where it has millions of sports-loving subscribers. Viewers in the United Arab Emirates had their signals blocked for six weeks before the authorities there recently reinstated the channel. BeIN reporters have been harassed at stadiums, or removed from them to face stern questioning by the police. And in Saudi Arabia, vendors selling beIN Sports have been shut down, and marketing activities promoting the company are no longer allowed.\u201cThere are so many different levels to this issue,\u201d Sophie Jordan, the general counsel of the broadcaster\u2019s parent company, beIN Media Group, said on Thursday. \u201cThis is unprecedented.\u201dMore recently, the obstacles have become so contentious that a sports rights agency, Lagard\u00e8re Sports, was forced to step in to ensure crucial World Cup qualification games and Asian Champions League matches could be broadcast in countries in which beIN owns their rights.\u201cEvery single obstacle to prevent the commercialization of beIN channels has been put in place by the Saudi authorities,\u201d Jordan said.\u201cThe demands are so big that it\u2019s politically impossible for Qatar to accept them,\u201d said Jane Kinninmont, the deputy head of the Middle East and North Africa program at the international-affairs think tank Chatham House.But live sporting events, especially soccer matches, form the lifeline of beIN\u2019s business, and they are where some expensive confrontations are taking place. As the sole rights owner for the final round of Asian World Cup qualifiers in the Middle East, the network \u2014 with production help from Lagard\u00e8re \u2014 last Tuesday broadcast the biggest soccer game in recent Saudi Arabian history: a 1-0 win over Japan that guaranteed the Saudis a place at next summer\u2019s World Cup in Russia.BeIN\u2019s reporter at the game, an Omani national, was removed from the venue hosting it, King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, and questioned by the authorities before being allowed into the stadium minutes before the match kicked off, according to the broadcaster. The reporter, Hasan al-Hashimi, also reported having had some of his equipment taken, while at other venues, players and coaches have boycotted interviews with the channel, and reporters have been told to remove cubes bearing the beIN logo from their microphones.\u201cThe accumulation of all the incidents when there is a Saudi, U.A.E. or Egyptian team playing is starting to have a significant impact,\u201d beIN\u2019s Jordan said. \u201cI have been working in sports for 20 years and have never seen anything like this.\u201dThe Saudi soccer federation did not reply to a request for a comment.BeIN has grown to become a major plank of Qatar\u2019s efforts to use sports to brand itself as a global and regional power, and the company has committed billions of dollars to buy rights to the most popular soccer competitions, including the UEFA Champions League, Spain\u2019s La Liga and England\u2019s Premier League. That buying spree came after Qatar in 2010 was named as the host of the sport\u2019s biggest event, the World Cup.In its successful pitch for that tournament, Qatari officials had promoted regional unity. The day before FIFA\u2019s final vote, Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the wife of the Qatari emir at the time, said just that. Dressed from head to toe in maroon, Qatar\u2019s national color, Sheikha Mozah said a World Cup in Qatar would bring the entire Middle East together, \u201cfrom Doha to Damascus.\u201dCurrent developments suggest the opposite. A land, air and sea blockade by Qatar\u2019s neighbors has affected the country\u2019s $200 billion pre-World Cup infrastructure program.\u201cNo doubt that the blockade has caused an inconvenience,\u201d Hassan al-Thawadi, head of the 2022 World Cup organizing committee, said in an interview recently broadcast by Al Jazeera. He said Qatar could no longer work with some companies that had been contracted as suppliers or service providers for World Cup projects. \u201cWe have very quickly moved on to Plan B, found alternative sources of supply \u2014 alternative routes of supply as well,\u201d he said.For beIN, the difficulties have been felt on a weekly basis. A beIN reporter was forced to remove the company\u2019s logos from his microphone at the first leg of a two-game Asian Champions League series between the U.A.E.\u2019s Al Ain and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia, and it was unclear if the same would occur at the return match on Monday. The Saudi and U.A.E. soccer federations did not respond to emails requesting comment on the dispute.BeIN is the sole authorized Middle East broadcaster for that game, part of a four-year agreement worth roughly $100 million. Yet since the political dispute began, a pirated version of the channel has been streamed illegally in Saudi Arabia. The bootleg operation broadcasts as Be-outQ, a play on the Qatari channel\u2019s name. BeIN is pursuing legal action, Jordan said.England\u2019s Premier League and UEFA, the Champions League organizer, are among the partners that have lent support to beIN.\u201cWe have said many times that the protection of our copyright, and the investment made by our broadcast partners, is critically important to the Premier League and the future health of English football,\u201d said Richard Molnar, the Premier League\u2019s director of broadcasting. But it is unclear what influence the leagues can bring to bear.BeIN\u2019s complaints prompted the African confederation to issue a directive to its members in June, urging teams and federations to set aside their differences with beIN and allow \u201creason to prevail.\u201d But two months later, the problems persist.\u201cWhat we are asking from the football authorities are significant measures that are dissuasive,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done much, and the proof of that is the incidents are growing.\u201dA spokesman for the African confederation did not respond to a request for comment.Complicating matters, Asian soccer\u2019s governing body, the Asian Football Confederation, is led by Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, a member of the royal family of Bahrain, which is among the countries backing the blockade. Sheikh Salman has said he has recused himself from any conversations or decisions involving the dispute, and the Asian confederation has told beIN that the issue will be handled by its disciplinary committee, according to three people familiar with the matter, but has otherwise not taken a public position.In a statement, a senior vice president for the Asian confederation, Praful Patel, said: \u201cIntegrity stretches beyond the action on the field to also protecting the rights of our broadcast and commercial partners, and enforcing the A.F.C. rules and regulations which govern matches played under its jurisdiction. I have been asked by the president to adjudicate in these matters which affect the West Asia Zone during the present challenging times and I will carry out those duties by ensuring this is a most comprehensive investigation.\u201dWhen the Asian confederation\u2019s contract with beIN ends, the network has the right to match any rival bid and renew it. BeIN has no plans to discontinue its aggressive push to accumulate sports rights in the region, Jordan said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebuilding Your Home After a Disaster", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCatastrophe can arrive at your doorstep in any number of ways: A century-old tree could hit the roof, faulty wiring could spark a fire or a storm like Hurricane Harvey could unleash its fury and yours could be one of countless homes in its path.For Ta-Kuang Chang, a 62-year-old lawyer from Pelham, N.Y., life came undone during a windstorm on a Sunday morning in January 2016. He was lying in bed texting his daughter when a 125-year-old tree from his yard crashed through his roof, landing just inches away. Trapped in his room, he waited for the fire department to free him.Twenty months later, Mr. Chang is still waiting, mired in a protracted dispute with his insurance carrier over repair costs. The disagreement, partly of Mr. Chang\u2019s own making, could leave him on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars and illustrates some challenges homeowners face in the wake of disaster. \u201cI am so worried that I will, in the end, be screwed,\u201d he said.\u201cThe bigger the claim, the more likely you\u2019re going to run into more resistance from the company,\u201d said Jeff Blyskal, a senior editor at Consumer Reports.For homeowners facing what is often the biggest crisis of their lives, navigating a complex and sometimes resistant bureaucracy can be bewildering and exhausting.In hindsight, the smell of burning toast should have tipped off Suzanne Kaufman. But September 27, 2010, was a busy morning in the Kaufman home, a 100-year-old bungalow in Glen Rock, N.J. Ms. Kaufman, a medical social worker who is now 43, rushed out the door to take her 3-year-old to preschool while the babysitter fed the 18-month-old baby. \u201cLooking back on it, there was nothing toasting,\u201d she said.In the few minutes it took to dash from her car to the classroom, Ms. Kaufman missed five calls from the babysitter. The baby was O.K. The house was on fire. Ms. Kaufman heard sirens in the distance and knew they were for her.She returned home to watch the house that she and her husband, Matthew Kaufman, a lawyer who is now 44, had owned for 20 months burn. By late afternoon, the adjuster from the insurance company charged with assessing the damages was surveying the smoldering property. The loss was total.\u201cIt was like, boom, your house is boarded up,\u201d Ms. Kaufman said.Vendors, like contractors and companies that remediate smoke, descended on the property. \u201cPeople are slipping cards under your door, and you just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are just freaking out.\u201dAmong the business cards being pressed into your hands will be those of some public adjusters, independent insurance experts who can navigate the process for you, albeit for a hefty fee. In New York State, public adjusters can charge as much as 12.5 percent of your settlement. Ms. Kaufman did not see a need for one because at the time she wasn\u2019t working, and she planned to dedicate her waking hours to the task of rebuilding her home. But some homeowners, particularly those with limited time, view a public adjuster as an advocate well worth the fee.USAA, the family\u2019s insurance carrier, had a list of preferred vendors. But were they the best ones? In the end, the Kaufmans decided to go with a contractor recommended by a family member.The policy would rebuild the house to its original condition, but the Kaufmans thought maybe they should use this rebuilding to expand. Insurance, however, is intended to make you whole again, not bankroll a new addition. So how would they finance improvements? Contractors advised them to tear the house down to the foundation. USAA initially objected, but eventually relented, and the Kaufmans eventually moved into a much larger home. There was \u201ca lot of negotiating every step of the way,\u201d Ms. Kaufman said. \u201cNone of this just happens.\u201dOn the night of October 29, 2012, as Hurricane Sandy bore down on New Jersey as a tropical storm, Casey Kait and Stephen Weiss struggled to convey the gravity of their situation to their insurance carrier, USAA. They had been putting their two young children to bed when a 100-year-old pin oak tree fell onto their four-bedroom home in South Orange. The family fled to a neighbor\u2019s house, where they called 911 and USAA.\u201cIt was Sandy, so they were getting calls from everywhere,\u201d Ms. Kait, 41, a hiring manager, said of USAA. \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019ll send somebody in a week.\u2019\u201d (Mr. Weiss, 42, works in marketing.)Days passed, and the family still had not seen an insurance adjuster. \u201cI remember getting Mama Bear,\u201d Ms. Kait said about one pivotal phone conversation with an agent. \u201cI was like, \u2018I have two young children and no house.\u2019 \u201d That got the agent\u2019s attention. Within an hour, an adjuster called, telling Ms. Kait that he would be at her door by 10 a.m. the next morning.There was no small measure of haggling with insurance adjusters during the process, but nine months after the storm, Ms. Kait and her family moved back into a fully restored house.In 2015, water damage accounted for 45 percent of all property damage, according to the insurance institute, yet insurance policies often limit or exclude coverage for water-related damage from mold, a sump pump failure or a sewage backup.\u201cPeople worry about fires, which obviously make sense, but the reality is that water losses are 13 times more likely to occur,\u201d said Annmarie Camp, an executive vice president at Chubb Personal Risk Services. \u201cI know we\u2019re in the middle of a hurricane, but it\u2019s a very strong likelihood that homeowners will suffer an internal water leak.\u201dUnless your policy covers the replacement cost of your belongings, you might receive only a fraction of the money needed to buy a new sofa. About 60 percent of homes are underinsured, according to Consumer Reports.You might also have to fight for payment even for losses that are covered. Ms. Kait and Mr. Weiss of South Orange argued with an adjuster about the extent of damage to some of their possessions. The adjuster thought furniture in the children\u2019s rooms that had been covered in debris could be cleaned and reused. The couple disagreed. Overwhelmed by the tasks ahead, Mr. Weiss and Ms. Kait didn\u2019t fight every battle. \u201cTo be honest, we let a lot of things go,\u201d Ms. Kait said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to go over every item in your life and fight about it when you\u2019re trying to get your life back.\u201dSome battles can drag on for months.More than a year and a half after a fallen tree made his Pelham home uninhabitable, Mr. Chang is still sparring with Travelers, his insurance carrier. The dispute hinges on competing estimates for repairs. Travelers estimated it would cost $224,000 to repair the home. An engineer that Mr. Chang hired estimated the work could cost as much as $808,000. The roof, chimney, second story and parts of the first floor needed to be rebuilt.Typically, when the estimates don\u2019t line up, the homeowner\u2019s contractor hammers out a compromise with the insurance adjuster. But Mr. Chang instead invoked a formal resolution process known as appraisal, where both sides hire an independent appraiser and a mediator may be appointed to break an impasse. This process, however, can lengthen and complicate matters.The case lingered, in part because Mr. Chang traveled frequently for work and was not able to monitor the appraisal process closely. After eight months of living in temporary housing paid for by Travelers, Mr. Chang withdrew his appraisal demand and tried to restart direct negotiations with Travelers, but Travelers opted to stick with the appraisal process.To keep a dispute from escalating, consumer advocates suggest that homeowners navigate the insurance process with caution from the very first call until the final check is cut. \u201cStart by trusting the company,\u201d said Mr. Hunter, of the Consumer Federation. \u201cBut you do it warily, and you do it professionally.\u201d Keep notes of conversations and copies of correspondence and receipts. If you run into trouble with the claims department, contact the public relations department. Hit enough roadblocks and you may need a lawyer.Last October, Mr. Chang began rebuilding his house, despite having no resolution on the total amount that Travelers would pay. He paid for some of the $425,000 of work with a partial payment of around $185,000 from Travelers, and the rest with savings. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be unjustly rich, I just want to make up what I\u2019ve lost,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cI just want to be made whole.\u201dTravelers estimates that it has paid nearly $500,000 to repair Mr. Chang\u2019s home, replace damaged property and cover additional living expenses for his family, according to a statement from Matt Bordonaro, a Travelers spokesman. The case now is before a mediator whose decision will be binding.Even if your insurance carrier agrees to pay for home repairs, you may not see the money right away. If your home has a mortgage, checks for repairs to the dwelling will likely be made to both you and your lender. Your bank will often hold onto the money, dispensing it as the work is done, adding another layer of bureaucracy and, often, delay.Nearly a year after fire destroyed his Glen Rock home, Mr. Kaufman marched into his mortgage lender\u2019s office in Hoboken, N.J., demanding his insurance money. The bank would not release an $80,000 payment from the insurance company, for reasons that have not been made clear to Mr. Kaufman. But the work was nearly done and bills needed to be paid. \u201cI had a large blowout with the bank president,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said.Rather than continue to fight with the bank, the Kaufmans borrowed $80,000 from Mr. Kaufman\u2019s parents. Eventually, the bank released the money.Sixteen months after the fire, the Kaufman family moved back home. At 3,000 square feet, the new house is twice as large as the previous one, with an open floor plan, large kitchen and four large bedrooms. Mr. and Ms. Kaufman paid for the addition, about a third of the rebuilding cost, separately. \u201cEveryone says, \u2018Your house is amazing,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kaufman said. \u201cBut I really wouldn\u2019t recommend going through this to anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She moves in with an old friend (Anna Vlads) and her two roommates, not realizing that when they bring her to a party, they expect her to have sex with the rich hosts. When she goes to work for a nightclub owner (Grisha Reydler) who has helped with her search, she is slow to realize that the job involves more than serving champagne.Although the internet and cellphones exist in the movie, there\u2019s a dated quality to the premise. Even if Alina\u2019s only clue is an old photograph of a man who may be her father, tracking down the owners of the building in the photo \u2014 which has a visible address \u2014 seems like a task for search engines. And if you were to go the route of simply finding someone who knows someone, repeatedly, as Alina does, it would probably involve less coincidence.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated.

{"Headline": "After More Than 20 Years, Newark to Regain Control of Its Schools", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than 20 years, local administrators have had little leverage over the finances or operations of the state\u2019s largest school district. Choices about curriculum and programs were made mostly by a state-appointed superintendent, often an outsider. The city could not override personnel decisions.But the decision to give authority back to the city is in many ways a recognition that state control is an idea whose time has passed. Around the country, 28 other states enacted similar policies, fueled by a desire to hold districts more accountable. Many of the districts taken over were in heavily minority low-income cities. At present, around 60 districts are under some form of state management, said Kenneth Wong, chairman of the department of education at Brown University.In 2015, Governor Christie tapped Christopher D. Cerf, a hard-charging former state education commissioner and yet another disciple of Mr. Klein\u2019s, as the next superintendent. In an interview at City Hall, Mr. Baraka said that he had expected the latest outsider to be \u201cvery rigid\u201d and \u201ccarry the governor\u2019s water.\u201dIn the interview Mr. Baraka credited Mr. Cerf for being open-minded. \u201cSometimes you go to a church to infiltrate, and become a deacon,\u201d he said.And Mr. Cerf, in news conference on the first day of school, praised Mr. Baraka as \u201ca truly great educator, in my judgment, a truly great man.\u201dYet chronic absenteeism \u2014 defined as students missing more than 18 school days a year \u2014 remains \u201cfar too high\u201d at 22 percent. And while school suspensions and reports of violence and vandalism have fallen over the last few years, \u201cmany students still report feeling unsafe at school,\u201d the report said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t like you flip a switch,\u201d Mr. Cerf said in an interview, noting the gradual pace of progress.Barring any unexpected snags, the district and the state will now develop a formal transition plan. Sometime next year, a public referendum will determine whether voters want an elected school board, or one appointed by the mayor. The board will then have the power to hire and fire its own superintendent; Mr. Cerf\u2019s contract ends in June.But Mr. Fulop gives little credit to the state. \u201cThose things converging have helped the school system gradually get better; it has nothing to do with the State of New Jersey\u2019s policies,\u201d Mr. Fulop said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t find anybody who points to state control and says, thankfully the state was here.\u201dMr. Baraka, among others, is hopeful that when the transition is complete, the city will have learned its lesson.\u201cLocal control means that you\u2019re in charge now \u2014 you can\u2019t cuss out people now unless you\u2019re cussing yourself out,\u201d he said. \u201cStop thinking about us versus them, because us is the them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "RT, Sputnik and Russia\u2019s New Theory of War", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "FeatureHow the Kremlin built one of the most powerful information weapons of the 21st century \u2014 and why it may be impossible to stop.Supported byBut even Steltner found the phone calls he received that morning confounding. They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. \u201cThey are demonstrating \u2014 \u2018Save our children,\u2019 \u2018No attacks from immigrants on our children\u2019 and some things like that,\u201d Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently.The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office\u2019s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin\u2019s tight-knit Russian-German community.Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three \u201cSouthern-looking men\u201d \u2014 by which she meant Arab migrants \u2014 had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her.But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened.An official in the Merkel government told me that the administration was completely perplexed, at first. Then, a few days later, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, held a news conference in Moscow. Bringing up Lisa\u2019s story, he cast doubt on the official version of events. There was no way, he argued, that Lisa left home voluntarily. Germany, he suggested, was \u201ccovering up reality in a politically correct manner for the sake of domestic politics.\u201d Two days later, RT ran a segment reporting that despite all the official denials, the case was \u201cnot so simple.\u201d The Russian Embassy called Steltner and asked to meet, he told me. The German foreign ministry informed him that this was now a diplomatic issue.The whole affair suddenly appeared a lot less mystifying. A realization took hold in the foreign ministry, the intelligence services and the Chancellery: Germany had been hit.The intelligence assessment detailed some cloak-and-dagger activities, like the murky web of Russian (if not directly government-affiliated or -financed) hackers who infiltrated voting systems and stole gigabytes\u2019 worth of email and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But most of the assessment concerned machinations that were plainly visible to anyone with a cable subscription or an internet connection: the coordinated activities of the TV and online-media properties and social-media accounts that made up, in the report\u2019s words, \u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine.\u201dThis makes RT and Sputnik harder for the West to combat than shadowy hackers. You can tighten your internet security protocols to protect against data breaches, run counterhacking operations to take out infiltrators, sanction countries with proven links to such activities. But RT and Sputnik operate on the stated terms of Western liberal democracy; they count themselves as news organizations, protected by the First Amendment and the libertarian ethos of the internet.But the ratings are almost beside the point. RT might not have amassed an audience that remotely rivals CNN\u2019s in conventional terms, but in the new, \u201cdemocratized\u201d media landscape, it doesn\u2019t need to. Over the past several years, the network has come to form the hub of a new kind of state media operation: one that travels through the same diffuse online channels, chasing the same viral hits and memes, as the rest of the Twitter-and-Facebook-age media. In the process, Russia has built the most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far, one that thrives in the feverish political climates that have descended on many Western publics.Something like the dissemination of Ford\u2019s conveyor belt, he said, was now happening in media; the sort of global news networks the West built were being replicated by Russia, to great effect. What was making \u201cthe whole story successful,\u201d he said, \u201cis a tectonic change of the global system that all of a sudden started to develop 10 years ago.\u201dThe transformation and acceleration of information technology, Peskov said, had unmoored the global economy from real value. Perception alone could move markets or crash them. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen bubbles like we\u2019ve seen in the greatest economy in the world, the United States,\u201d he said. The same free flow of information had produced \u201ca new clash of interests,\u201d and so began \u201can informational disaster \u2014 an informational war.\u201dPeskov argued that this was not an information war of Russia\u2019s choosing; it was a \u201ccounteraction.\u201d He brought up the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which led to the ousters of Russian-friendly governments in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in the mid-2000s. Russia blamed American nongovernmental organizations for fomenting the upheavals. But now, Peskov argued, all you might need to shake up the geopolitical order was a Twitter account. \u201cNow you can reach hundreds of millions in a minute,\u201d he said.By way of example, he pointed to \u201cthis girl, from show business, Kim Kardashian.\u201d Kardashian is among the most popular people in all of social media, with 55 million Twitter followers, nearly 18 million more than President Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine that one day she says, \u2018My supporters \u2014 do this,\u2019\u2009\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThis will be a signal that will be accepted by millions and millions of people. And she\u2019s got no intelligence, no interior ministry, no defense ministry, no K.G.B.\u201d This, he said, was the new reality: the global proliferation of the kinds of reach and influence that were once reserved for the great powers and, more recently, great media conglomerates. Even Peskov sounded slightly amazed considering the possibilities. \u201cThe new reality creates a perfect opportunity for mass disturbances,\u201d he said, \u201cor for initiating mass support or mass disapproval.\u201dOne way of looking at the activities of Russia\u2019s information machine is as a resumption of the propaganda fight between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that began immediately following the Second World War. In the late 1940s, the Marshall Plan, the herculean development project helmed by Secretary of State George Marshall, flooded postwar Europe with money and advisers to help rebuild cities, advance democracy and form an integrated economic zone. Joseph Stalin immediately saw it as a threat \u2014 and saw propaganda as one of his best weapons to contain it.For the counterinformation campaign, the U.S. government enlisted journalists, including the Washington Post Pulitzer winner Alfred Friendly and the Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Roscoe Drummond; Hollywood filmmakers; and the top marketers of Madison Avenue, including McCann-Erickson and Young and Rubicam. The new effort \u2014 which eventually fell under a new United States Information Agency \u2014 produced upbeat posters with slogans like \u201cWhatever the weather, we only reach welfare together,\u201d which offered a bright contrast to the Communists\u2019 anti-Marshall Plan messaging. Operating on the theory that local voices would have more credibility than American ones, it fed news to foreign reporters about how well the Marshall Plan was progressing in their countries and recruited top European directors to produce hundreds of news features and documentaries that promoted \u201cWestern values\u201d like free trade and representative democracy.America went into the propaganda war with distinct advantages. At the time, the Marshall Plan was pumping $13 billion into Europe, while the Soviets were taking $14 billion out in the form of reparations and resource seizures; America\u2019s image abroad was as squeaky clean as it would ever be. \u201cThis was the time when finally the United States came of age as an international power \u2014 when it still had its virginity, as it were,\u201d David Reynolds, a Cambridge University history professor, told me.And unlike the Soviets, the United States benefited from the existence of a vast ecosystem of nongovernment media that, even when it crossed swords with the American government, still reflected an American outlook and implicitly promoted American cultural values. The first international, 24-hour networks to come online in the 1980s, like CNN, were American, and they provided their audience \u2014 which eventually included many behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 an unsparing view of the last days of Communism: student protesters staring down tanks in Tiananmen Square, protests and strikes in Poland, East Germans exulting on the ruins of the Berlin Wall. When Mikhail Gorbachev signed his resignation, ceding power to the new presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the last official act of Soviet Communism, he invited CNN to capture the moment in his Kremlin office suite. Finding his own pen out of ink, Gorbachev turned to the CNN president at the time, Tom Johnson, who lent Gorbachev the Mont Blanc he had in his breast pocket. After making sure the pen wasn\u2019t American-made, the last Soviet leader used it to sign one of the most important documents in Russian history. \u201cYou have built your empire better than I built mine,\u201d he told Johnson.Lesin was a sharp-witted hard drinker who was concerned about Russia\u2019s image in the world. He had a vision for an international network that would familiarize Russia in the same way that CNN familiarized America. But the chaos of the later Yeltsin years, in which the ruble collapsed and Yeltsin\u2019s government foundered, made such a thing impossible.Lesin found a more receptive patron in Putin, who succeeded Yeltsin in 1999. Putin \u2014 who, as a deputy in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office half a decade earlier, once chauffeured Ted Turner around the city \u2014 was an attentive student of the power of television. At times, he could not contain his frustration with the way the foreign media covered Russia. \u201cAll they can talk about is crisis and breakdown,\u201d he complained to a nationalist youth group in 2005.That year, with the Russian economy rebounding thanks to strong oil prices, Lesin and Alexei Gromov, Putin\u2019s press strategist, secured the approval and financing to start the network, which they called Russia Today. To run the new operation, they hired a 25-year-old TV reporter named Margarita Simonyan.When she heard she got the job, \u201cI almost fainted,\u201d Simonyan told me recently. We were sitting on plush couches on an exclusive, dimly lit floor of Voronezh, a fashionable restaurant in the Khamovniki district in central Moscow. \u201cDr. No,\u201d the James Bond film about a plan to disrupt the American space program, was on a TV screen opposite us. Before us was a spread of venison, oysters and shrimp, themselves an unsubtle statement: They were imported from Russia\u2019s far east, a menu adjustment in response to the sanctions and countersanctions that had cut off Western food imports.Simonyan grew up poor in Krasnodar, a southern Russia river town, and was 11 when the Soviet Union collapsed. \u201cWe adored the fact that we are now going to be like America and taught like America and to be even patronized by America and be America\u2019s little brother,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel in any way humiliating or contradictory to the Russian pride.\u201d Her infatuation with the United States led her to apply for a slot in a new State Department \u201cfuture leaders\u201d exchange program, which placed top students from the former Soviet Union in United States high schools to \u201censure long-lasting peace and understanding between the U.S. and the countries of Eurasia.\u201dFor one academic year, she attended a public high school in Bristol, N.H. \u201cShe was fascinated with news,\u201d Patricia Albert, whose parents hosted Simonyan, and who remains close with her, told me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d as the family still calls her, would sit transfixed every night when she joined them on the couch to watch the local news, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cCBS Evening News With Dan Rather.\u201d But she also came to resent some of her American classmates for what she viewed as their sheltered na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you have dogs?\u2019 I remember that,\u201d she told me. \u201cI still have a letter I wrote to my parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they are seriously asking me whether we have dogs.\u2019 They were grown-ups \u2014 18-year-olds \u2014 in a normal high school in New Hampshire, which is supposed to be a sophisticated place.\u201dBack home in Krasnodar, her view of the United States, like many Russians\u2019, started to curdle after the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia, with which Russian had strong ethnic, cultural and political ties: \u201cOur Slavic brothers and sisters,\u201d she told me, leaning forward for emphasis. \u201cYou bombed them with no permission, with no reason,\u201d she said, \u201cand in one day you lost Russia.\u201dWhen she took the helm of Russia Today the following year, Simonyan modeled the new network on CNN and the BBC, and she hired TV consultants from Britain to help give Russia Today a modern cable-news look and feel. (The RT studios in Moscow, when I visited them this spring, were as state-of-the-art as any I\u2019d seen in the United States.) \u201cNobody in Russia had experience of that kind,\u201d Simonyan told me. \u201cTwenty-four-hour news had not been established yet.\u201d One of her employees, Andrey Kiyashko, who started at RT in his late teens, told me: \u201cCNN, BBC \u2014 we were watching it and taking notes on how to be broadcast journalists.\u201dRussia Today \u2014 incorporated as an independent company with state financing \u2014 was getting into hotels and even American cable systems. But three years into its existence, the network still had not gained much notice or had much discernible impact abroad. Simonyan says she concluded that the network\u2019s mission of solely focusing on Russia needed revising. \u201cWe had basically too much Russian news,\u201d she told me.So in 2008, Russia Today began to reposition itself. The network was reintroduced with a new name, RT, and hired McCann \u2014 the same American advertising firm that once helped the United States sell the Marshall Plan. It soon debuted a new satellite channel in the United States, RT America. Instead of celebrating Russia, Simonyan\u2019s network would turn a critical eye to the rest of the world, particularly the United States. As Peskov sees it, the idea was: \u201cWhy are you criticizing us in Chechnya and all this stuff? Look at what you are doing there in the United States with your relationship with white and black.\u201d He went on: \u201cRT said: \u2018Stop. Don\u2019t criticize us. We\u2019ll tell you about yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dWith that, he said, \u201call of the sudden, Anglo-Saxons saw that there is an army from the opposite side.\u201d RT\u2019s new slogan, dreamed up by McCann, was \u201cQuestion More.\u201dAt the time, state journalism back in Russia was enjoying a kind of renaissance under Dmitri Medvedev, who was elected president in 2008. (Russian presidents are limited to two consecutive terms; Putin endorsed Medvedev as his successor and served as his prime minister before returning to the presidency.) The main Russian international news service, RIA Novosti, hired journalists from The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse and Reuters, following the philosophy that Russia served its interests best by providing traditional warts-and-all news, with a Russian voice and perspective. \u201cThere was no talk about censorship,\u201d Nabi Abdullaev, a former Moscow Times deputy chief editor who oversaw RIA Novosti\u2019s foreign-language news service, told me. \u201cAll they wanted from me was quality professional standards in reporting; that was it.\u201d\u201cObjectivity is a myth,\u201d Kiselyov said. \u201cJust imagine a young man who puts an arm around the shoulder of a girl,\u201d he went on, \u201cand tells the girl, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time that I treat you objectively.\u2019 Is this what she\u2019s waiting for? Probably not. So in the same way, our country, Russia, needs our love. If we speak about the editorial policy, of course, I would certainly want it to be associated with love for Russia.\u201d Journalism, he said, was an instrument of the country.Military officials in America and Europe have come to refer to this idea alternatively as the \u201cGerasimov doctrine\u201d and \u201chybrid war,\u201d which they accuse Russia of engaging in now. When I asked Peskov about those charges, he shrugged. Everyone was doing it, he said. \u201cIf you call what\u2019s going on now a hybrid war, let it be hybrid war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter: It\u2019s war.\u201dShortly after the election, academic and corporate clients hired him to track the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 that is, unequivocally false content. He confined his search to social accounts that shared fake news at least 10 times during the last month of the campaign. This September, in his airy, loft-style office suite on the West Side of Manhattan, he called up the results of the study on a laptop screen. They were visualized as a black sphere on which each of the 14,000 fake-news-spreading accounts appeared as a dot, grouped and color-coded according to ideological affiliation. The sphere was alive with bursts of purple (\u201cU.S. Conservative\u201d), green (\u201cU.S. Far Left\u201d), pink (\u201cPro-Russia/WikiLeaks\u201d), orange (\u201cInternational Right\u201d) and blue (\u201cTrump Core\u201d).Within the fake-news network, Kelly explained, RT was high on the list of most-followed accounts, but it was not the highest \u2014 it ranked No. 117 out of roughly 12,000 accounts he was tracking. Its website was the 12th-most-cited by the fake-news consumers and purveyors \u2014 ahead of The New York Times and The Washington Post but behind Breitbart and Infowars.What was more interesting was who followed RT. It drew substantially from all quadrants of Kelly\u2019s fake-news universe \u2014 Trump supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters, Occupy Wall Streeters and libertarians \u2014 which made it something of a rarity. \u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t just pumping up the right wing in America,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re also pumping up left-wing stuff \u2014 they\u2019re basically trying to pump up the fringe at the expense of the middle.\u201dNearly 20 percent of the fake-news-spreading accounts, Kelly\u2019s analysis determined, were automated bot accounts, of the sort the American intelligence assessment claimed were working in tandem with RT and Sputnik. But who was operating them was unclear \u2014 and regardless, they were far outnumbered by accounts that appeared to belong to real human beings, reading and circulating content that appealed to them. In this paranoid, polarized and ill-informed subset of American news consumers, RT\u2019s audience crossed all ideological boundaries.RT flew in several members of its leadership team from Moscow for a ceremony and held a cocktail party in the lobby of the General Assembly building, with hot plates and canap\u00e9s of shrimp dumplings and meatballs and ham. Giant banners proclaimed \u201cRT: Member Broadcaster of the United Nations In-House Network.\u201dHis speech was about his mother, who grew up under Stalin. She was orphaned at 3, \u201cwhen she was thrown out of her apartment in the middle of Moscow winter together with her brother, when their parents were arrested by the N.K.V.D., the Stalin secret police,\u201d he said, speaking haltingly. \u201cMy grandfather, her father, as she only found out many years later, was tortured and executed. And my grandmother, her mother, died in a labor camp. And similar stories happened to millions of my compatriots back in the 1930s.\u201dHe was building toward something. \u201cWhat I see today is more and more frequently people produce the highfalutin talk about using the word \u2018propaganda\u2019 that eerily echoes those dark days of the Soviet era, when even thinking their own thoughts, not to mention speaking or printing them, was a crime.\u201d People, he declared, \u201cmust have the right to know different news, coming from different sources, and then make their own judgment.\u201dWhen I asked Simonyan recently what she made of the proliferating attempts to map RT\u2019s influence in the Russian information network that United States intelligence agencies describe as a hybrid-war machine, she replied by email: \u201cThese projects simply blacklist all reporting, including by American media, as some pro-Russian campaign if any facts or views in them don\u2019t support the right kind of narrative.\u201d At the moment, she said, that narrative was: \u201cAll world problems are Putin\u2019s fault.\u201d In her view, \u201cit\u2019s the sad history of McCarthyism repeating itself.\u201d (These were arguments that echoed Trump\u2019s own.)It also reflected the genius of \u201cQuestion More\u201d: Every attempt to contain or counteract the Russian state-backed media\u2019s influence simply validated it. Churkin, the ambassador, acknowledged as much at RT\u2019s U.N. ceremony. As he stood to speak, he seemed to be almost bouncing on the soles of his feet, delighted at RT\u2019s newfound prominence. \u201cEverybody watches them,\u201d he said. \u201cDiplomats do it, ambassadors do it, foreign ministers do it, heads of state and government do it.\u201d In an oblique allusion to the recent American intelligence report, he noted that some people had been criticizing the network, but perhaps this was not such a bad thing. Grinning, he said: \u201cThey sound as if they are P.R. representatives of RT.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Bill Appears Dead as Pivotal G.O.P. Senator Declares Opposition", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A last-ditch attempt by President Trump and Senate Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act appeared to collapse on Monday as a pivotal senator announced her firm opposition to the latest repeal plan, virtually ensuring that Republicans would not have the votes they need for passage.The announcement by the senator, Susan Collins of Maine, effectively dooms what had been a long-shot effort by Republicans in the Senate to make one more attempt at repealing the health law after failing in dramatic fashion in July.The demise of the latest repeal push means that Republicans are now all but certain to conclude Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office without fulfilling one of their central promises, which the president and lawmakers had hoped to deliver on quickly after Mr. Trump took office.For seven years, Republicans have said they would repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement and replace it with a new health care system more palatable to conservatives. But they were never able to formulate a replacement that was both politically and substantively viable.Ms. Collins, one of three Republican senators who opposed the last repeal attempt in July, described the latest plan as \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d She expressed concerns about cuts to Medicaid as well as the rolling back of protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\u201cHealth care is a deeply personal, complex issue that affects every single one of us and one-sixth of the American economy,\u201d Ms. Collins said in a statement, lamenting the rushed process and the content of legislation that has shifted as Republican leaders scrambled for votes. \u201cSweeping reforms to our health care system and to Medicaid can\u2019t be done well in a compressed time frame, especially when the actual bill is a moving target.\u201dThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday released its findings on the latest Republican health care bill.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, now faces the unpalatable choice of admitting defeat or moving ahead with a vote that appears certain to fail.Republican leaders in the Senate can afford to lose only two of their members, and they now have three firm opponents within their ranks: Rand Paul of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona and Ms. Collins. Additionally, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has withheld his support and requested changes to the bill.Time is not on their side: Republicans have only until the end of the month to pass the bill through the Senate while being protected from a Democratic filibuster.Beginning in October, Republicans would need Democratic votes in order to pass a repeal bill, a seeming impossibility given that Democratic senators have been unified in opposition to the repeal push.Some Republican senators have suggested starting over, with parliamentary language in a new budget blueprint that once again would shield repeal legislation from a filibuster. But that could terribly complicate Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, a risk the leadership may not want to take.Thirteen lawmakers from 12 states have opposed at least one of the Senate\u2019s five major repeal efforts in recent months.\u201cWe\u2019re going to press on,\u201d Mr. Graham said hours later, during a Monday night CNN debate on health care. He raised the possibility of still holding a vote, even as he acknowledged it might fail: \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to vote. It\u2019s O.K. to fall short, if you do, for an idea you believe in.\u201dThe senators released a revised version of their bill on Monday morning, hoping to win over holdout Republicans in part by shifting more funds to states like Alaska and Maine. The bill would take money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and send it to states, with vast new discretion over how to use it for health care or coverage.But writing a repeal bill that could win over at least 50 of the 52 Republican senators has proved extraordinarily difficult, and putting together a complicated bill against the backdrop of a ticking clock only added to the challenge. Insurers, hospitals, doctors and patient advocacy groups assailed the proposal, as did the late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.The Capitol complex looked at times like a hospital ward on Monday as patients swarmed through the corridors, pleading with senators not to take away their health insurance. Some wore T-shirts that said, \u201cI Am a Pre-Existing Condition.\u201dThe Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the repeal bill on Monday, and it was immediately disrupted by people in the audience shouting opposition to the proposal. \u201cNo cuts to Medicaid,\u201d they chanted. \u201cSave our liberty!\u201d Capitol police officers removed the protesters, some of whom were in wheelchairs.As Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Graham revised their bill to try to build support, critics asserted that their last-minute changes further weakened protections for patients, including those with cancer and other pre-existing conditions.Dick Woodruff, senior vice president at the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society, said that under the bill, patient protections provided by the Affordable Care Act would be up to each state to decide.\u201cSome states could decide not to cover even preventive services, like cancer screenings, routine mammography or colonoscopy,\u201d Mr. Woodruff said.Republican senators had to make up their minds with little information about the measure\u2019s implications.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Monday that \u201cmillions of additional people would be uninsured\u201d under the Graham-Cassidy bill, compared with the number of people expected to lack coverage under current law.\u201cEnrollment in Medicaid would be substantially lower because of large reductions in federal funding for that program,\u201d the budget office said.But the budget office said it did not have time to produce a more complete assessment, leaving senators without specifics on how the bill would affect coverage and health insurance premiums.A comparison of the Cassidy-Graham measure with four other bills that failed in Congress.The rushed process contributed to the bill\u2019s demise.Mr. Paul had previously said he would oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill because it did not go far enough in repealing the health law. On Monday, he continued to denounce it as a \u201cfake repeal.\u201dMr. Paul presented himself as open to compromise, voicing support for a narrower measure. But he rejected the Graham-Cassidy bill\u2019s core concept of providing block grants to the states to use for health care \u2014 leaving little room for Republican leaders to win his vote unless they radically altered the legislation.\u201cI think if you vote for this bill, you put your stamp of approval on a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of Obamacare spending,\u201d he said.Mr. Paul was not the only conservative with reservations. Mr. Cruz said on Sunday that he had not yet been won over and was seeking changes to the repeal plan, though he said he wanted to ultimately wind up in favor of the bill. An aide to Mr. Cruz said on Monday that he still wanted to see changes.Before Ms. Collins\u2019s announcement on Monday, Mr. Trump expressed frustration that Republicans had talked for years about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act but failed to deliver now that a Republican was in the White House.On the \u201cRick & Bubba Show,\u201d a radio program, Mr. Trump singled out Mr. McCain, calling his vote in July \u201ca tremendous slap in the face of the Republican Party.\u201d And the president seemed resigned to defeat in the latest attempt at repeal.\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose two or three votes,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s the end of that.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michigan Gambled on Charter Schools. Its Children Lost.", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "The Education IssueFree-market boosters, including Betsy DeVos, promised that a radical expansion of charter schools would fix the stark inequalities in the state\u2019s education system. The results in the classrooms are far more complicated.Supported bySylvia Brown lives in the suburbs now, but she still proudly calls herself a Parker, the local term for a Highland Park native. When Brown was a kid, she\u2019d tell people she lived in the capital of Detroit. Her father worked for the city, and her mother taught at the public elementary school. In high school, Brown played on the volleyball and tennis teams and won a scholarship her junior year to study abroad in Japan. She fretted about traveling such a long distance \u2014 she never expected the judges to pick a black girl from Highland Park \u2014 but her guidance counselor encouraged her not to be afraid to cross 8 Mile Road, the famous divide between city and suburbs.So when the offer came last summer to take a job as the superintendent of George Washington Carver Academy, a pre-K-8 charter school in Highland Park, Brown thrilled at the chance to come home. She also had no illusions about what she was signing up for. In 1992, Brown\u2019s sophomore year at Highland Park High, Chrysler\u2019s corporate headquarters decamped to exurban Auburn Hills, a departure that cost Highland Park a quarter of its tax base and 50 percent of its annual budget. Today the city is staring down the same problems as much of Detroit: crime, abandonment, disinvestment. (A local pastor once described Highland Park to me as \u201cDetroit writ small.\u201d) The public library closed in 2002. In 2011, the local power utility dug up two-thirds of the city\u2019s streetlights in response to $4 million of unpaid bills; the mayor-elect advised citizens to leave on their porch lights instead.A major victim of the city\u2019s borderline insolvency was its public-school system, which had been under state control since 2012. (Six different state-appointed emergency managers have run the district since then.) Plummeting enrollment, legacy costs and financial mismanagement had left the school system with a projected deficit of $10 million. The state\u2019s solution that year was to \u201ccharterize\u201d the entire district: void the teacher\u2019s union contract, fire all employees and turn over control of the schools to a private, for-profit charter operator. But enrollment at Highland Park High continued to decline, so the state closed the school in 2015. Highland Park now has no high school, either public or charter. Families send their children to high schools in Detroit or the suburbs, where they have no electoral influence over local officials or school boards.The Carver Academy sits a block from the defunct Model T plant, now used primarily as a storage facility. The school building is an old Farmer Jack grocery store that has been converted into classrooms, with an added wing and a handful of trailers. On my first visit, in January, I met with Brown in her office. She had curly hair and a casually stylish work look: black skirt, matching sweater, pearls on her wrists and neck. Brown had been having a rough couple of weeks. Only a few days earlier, Michigan\u2019s Department of Education released its annual Top-to-Bottom List of every school in the state, and Carver wound up in the lowest fifth percentile. Brown wasn\u2019t surprised by the ranking: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was hoodwinked and thought I was coming into a top-performing school,\u201d she said. But she also bristled at the \u201cscarlet letter\u201d Carver, and by extension its students, had been branded with. The Top-to-Bottom List, she pointed out, largely reflects the results of a single standardized test, the Michigan Student Test of Educational Progress (M-STEP), and the latest rankings are based on testing data from the two years before she arrived.Even setting aside standardized test scores, which are debatable as measures of \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure,\u201d Carver probably isn\u2019t the sort of institution where most school-choice proponents would send their own children. In past years, headlines involving Carver included a 2008 cheating scandal (in which teachers were caught improperly coaching fourth and fifth graders on the answers to standardized tests) and a 2011 felony embezzlement conviction (of the school\u2019s treasurer, who used $25,000 earmarked for textbooks to buy herself a house). Today, the school still lacks needed funds. The roof leaks: On rainy days, buckets are placed in classrooms and teachers cover their electronic blackboards with garbage bags so they don\u2019t short-circuit. At various points during the winter, children had to be moved to different wings of the building when the heat in their homerooms died. Security doors and cameras need replacing. The neighborhood isn\u2019t safe: After a man in an overgrown lot tried to grab a student on her way to school one morning, parents began their own patrols, flashing headlights at kids to let them know everything was O.K.Charter proponents will point out, correctly, that you could work up a similar indictment of any number of public schools in struggling cities like Detroit. But in theory, at least, public-school districts have superintendents tasked with evaluating teachers and facilities. Carver, on the other hand, is accountable to more ambiguous entities \u2014 like, for example, Oak Ridge Financial, the Minnesota-based financial-services firm that sent a team of former educators to visit the school. They had come not in service of the children but on behalf of shareholders expecting a thorough vetting of a long-term investment: Brown was in negotiations with Oak Ridge about refinancing the school\u2019s debt in order to make much-needed repairs, and the firm was performing the sort of oversight normally handled by a school district. Michigan schools remaining in the bottom fifth percentile for three years running must close, which, in the case of Carver, would leave Oak Ridge on the hook for a 13-year loan.The crisis at Carver Academy was not unfolding in isolation. Michigan\u2019s aggressively free-market approach to schools has resulted in one of the most deregulated educational environments in the country, a laboratory in which consumer choice and a shifting landscape of supply and demand (and profit motive, in the case of many charters) were pitched as ways to improve life in the classroom for the state\u2019s 1.5 million public-school students. But a Brookings Institution analysis done this year of national test scores ranked Michigan last among all states when it came to improvements in student proficiency. And a 2016 analysis by the Education Trust-Midwest, a nonpartisan education policy and research organization, found that 70 percent of Michigan charters were in the bottom half of the state\u2019s rankings. Michigan has the most for-profit charter schools in the country and some of the least state oversight. Even staunch charter advocates have blanched at the Michigan model.The story of Carver is the story of Michigan\u2019s grand educational experiment writ small. It spans more than two decades, three governors and, now, the United States Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, whose relentless advocacy for unchecked \u201cschool choice\u201d in her home state might soon, her critics fear, be going national. But it\u2019s important to understand that what happened to Michigan\u2019s schools isn\u2019t solely, or even primarily, an education story: It\u2019s a business story. Today in Michigan, hundreds of nonprofit public charters have become potential financial assets to outside entities, inevitably complicating their broader social missions. In the case of Carver, interested parties have included a for-profit educational management organization, or E.M.O., in Georgia; an Indian tribe in a remote section of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula; and a financial firm in Minnesota. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is now \u2014 it\u2019s moneymaking,\u201d Darrel Redrick, a charter-school proponent and an administrator at Carver at the time I visited, told me.Redrick can pinpoint the precise moment he experienced this revelation: \u201cOne of my former principals \u2014 this is like 10 years ago, at another school \u2014 he said: \u2018Redrick, I can tell you why we don\u2019t kick kids out. This child right here represents $6,700.\u2019\u2009\u201d The principal was referring to the per-pupil state funding at the time. \u201cAnd if you put out 10 kids, Red,\u201d the principal went on, \u201cthat\u2019s about $70,000. And where are we going to get that money?\u201dTo understand Michigan\u2019s educational system, it\u2019s crucial to consider the decades-long ideological battle waged by groups like the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. In 2013, the Michigan-based conservative think tank released a celebratory analysis of the privatization of the Highland Park school system, noting that charterizing an entire district was \u201cunprecedented at the time.\u201d A 13-minute video released with the report, titled \u201cThe Highland Park Transformation,\u201d opened with slow-panning, verit\u00e9-horror-film footage of derelict public school buildings, including a shot of a filthy toilet. Bill Coats, chief executive of Leona Group, the for-profit charter operator that took over the district, told the filmmakers that Highland Park\u2019s public schools \u201chad the resources, all right? They just blew them.\u201dOver the last 30 years, the Mackinac Center, which was founded in 1987 by, among others, John Engler, a Republican state senator, has become a model for state-level conservative policy shops around the country. When Engler was elected governor in 1990, the intellectual foundation of his signature policy issue \u2014 education reform \u2014 came via a Mackinac Center white paper that pushed school choice as a means of breaking up the \u201cbureaucratic monopoly\u201d of a public-education system smothering risk-taking and entrepreneurial moxie. The author of the study, Lawrence W. Reed \u2014 then the center\u2019s president \u2014 argued that it was time \u201cto put our faith in the virtues that made America great in all areas where they have been tried: competition, private initiative and, of course, consumer choice.\u201d He cited private-school vouchers as a possible model and also gave a nod to an experiment taking place in Minnesota, where they were testing \u201cindependently run public schools, known as \u2018chartered schools.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Minnesota charter experiment, which began with two schools in 1992, quickly spread to other states \u2014 first California and then, in 1994, to Michigan, at Engler\u2019s behest. The Soviet Union had just collapsed, and a triumphalist faith in the free market was bleeding into spheres like education. Engler referred to Michigan\u2019s public-school system as an \u201ceducational gulag,\u201d and during a 1993 speech in which he pitched state legislators on the idea of charters, he hoisted a sawed-off 20-gauge shotgun as a prop. (The weapon, he said, had been confiscated from a student.) A year later, in his State of the State address, Engler celebrated the passage of \u201cthe nation\u2019s most far-reaching charter-school legislation,\u201d predicting a \u201crenaissance.\u201dBetsy DeVos, a wealthy, deeply religious conservative willing to spend millions of dollars lobbying for a radical redefinition of public education, and her husband, Dick, the heir to the Amway fortune, provided significant financial backing to the Mackinac Center, as well as to pro-charter lobbying groups like Teach Michigan and their own Great Lakes Education Project. To further set the stage for school choice, Engler backed a 1994 ballot measure described that year by The New York Times as \u201cthe nation\u2019s most dramatic shift in a century in the way public schools are financed\u201d: Rather than funding local schools based on property taxes, Michigan would shift to a per-pupil funding model, in which the money would come from state sales taxes. Each district would receive a baseline amount of $4,200 per student, which would rise over time; districts already spending more money per student \u2014 like the wealthy Detroit suburb Bloomfield Hills, which spent $10,400 per student \u2014 would not be subject to cuts, and municipalities could still supplement the state money with bonds and local taxes.In theory, poorer districts with lower property-tax bases would ultimately benefit, but per-pupil spending increases, bound to the economy of a state facing its own fiscal challenges, were lagging and inconsistent, and the gap between rich and poor districts never closed. A 2016 review commissioned by the National Education Policy Center found that Michigan\u2019s per-pupil spending, compared with that of neighboring Midwestern states, had fallen \u201cfrom the middle of the pack to near the bottom.\u201d To Gary Miron, a professor in the College of Education and Human Development at Western Michigan University who has long studied the state\u2019s charter movement, per-pupil funding represented a \u201clong game,\u201d a means of paying lip service to greater equality while creating \u201ca more efficient, market-oriented system where money follows students.\u201dThe lack of regulation had the desired effect: Michigan became a boom state for a growing new education sector. By 2000, Michigan had 184 charter schools, by Miron\u2019s count, more than any state but Arizona and California. In a 2002 book that Miron wrote with Christopher Nelson called \u201cWhat\u2019s Public About Charter Schools?\u201d the authors consider two different charter models deployed by states: competitive and collaborative. While the collaborative approach encouraged the public and private sectors to \u201cshare innovations,\u201d Michigan favored the other approach: \u201cEngler wanted to lift public schools,\u201d Miron told me, \u201cbut he believed in getting as much competition as quickly as possible. It became the Wild West state: Push, push, push.\u201d While other states \u2014 Miron cited Ohio, Texas and Arizona \u2014 also emerged as exemplars of the \u201ccompetitive\u201d model, most have since reintroduced some regulation. \u201cMichigan is still an outlier,\u201d Miron said. \u201cNo state comes near us when it comes to privatization.\u201dThe results have been stark. The 2016 report by the Education Trust-Midwest noted:Michigan\u2019s K-12 system is among the weakest in the country and getting worse. In little more than a decade, Michigan has gone from being a fairly average state in elementary reading and math achievement to the bottom 10 states. It\u2019s a devastating fall. Indeed, new national assessment data suggest Michigan is witnessing systemic decline across the K-12 spectrum. White, black, brown, higher-income, low-income \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter who they are or where they live. ...Charters continue to be sold in Michigan as a means of unwinding the inequality of a public-school system in which districts across the state, overwhelmingly African-American \u2014 Detroit, Highland Park, Benton Harbor, Muskegon Heights, Flint \u2014 grapple with steep population declines, towering financial obligations, deindustrialization and the legacy of segregation. By allowing experimentation, proponents argue, and by breaking the power of teachers\u2019 unions, districts will somehow be able to innovate their way past the crushing underfunding that afflicts majority-minority school districts all around the country. In reality, however, a 2017 Stanford University analysis found that increasing charter-school enrollment in a school district does little to improve achievement gaps. And in unregulated educational sectors like Michigan\u2019s, there\u2019s evidence that charters have actually increased inequality: A 2015 working paper by the Education Policy Center determined that Michigan\u2019s school-choice policies \u201cpowerfully exacerbate the financial pressures of declining-enrollment districts\u201d \u2014 and districts with high levels of charter-school penetration, the authors found, have fared worst of all. Today, all but seven states have some version of a charter law, though few have adopted a model as extreme as Michigan\u2019s. Twenty-one states have a charter cap, 31 require charters to submit annual reports and 33 have statewide authorizing bodies. Michigan, abiding by none of those rules, has allowed 80 percent of its own charters to be operated by for-profit E.M.Os. Only 16 percent of charters nationwide are run by for-profit companies.Nationally, the pro-charter tent is large and unwieldy enough to include education-reform wonks, hedge-fund managers, billionaire philanthropists and politicians from both parties, and Trump\u2019s tapping of DeVos has placed the movement in a complex situation. Despite the policy ignorance displayed in her confirmation hearing, she\u2019s an ally, and one whose influence on the 2018 Trump administration budget is already evident: Amid huge cuts to overall education spending, there\u2019s a $517 million increase in funding for charters and private-school vouchers and an additional $1 billion worth of grants set aside for local districts willing to implement \u201copen enrollment\u201d programs (allowing students to attend any area public schools, charters included, and take allotted state and federal funds with them). Eighteen Republican governors sent the Senate\u2019s education committee a letter in strong support of DeVos and what they called her promise to \u201cstreamline the federal education bureaucracy\u201d and \u201creturn authority back to state and local school boards.\u201dBut even many charter proponents are troubled by the Michigan model that DeVos had such a crucial role in creating. In a column in Education Week published in March, Greg Richmond, the president of the National Association of Charter School Authorizers, corrected \u201cfriends and neighbors\u201d who assumed he must be happy about the new education secretary, explaining that he rejected a \u201cfree-market approach to charter schooling\u201d that \u201cembraces the principles of choice and autonomy while gutting accountability\u201d and insisting that \u201ctrue supporters of charter schools will not abide by this co-optation of what it means to be a charter school.\u201d With DeVos and her ideas ascendant in Washington, Michigan has become a symbol \u2014 and, for some, a cautionary tale \u2014 of a movement gone astray.Before Carver Academy could move ahead on the loan refinancing, the school had to obtain permission from its \u201cauthorizer,\u201d Bay Mills Community College. Perhaps the most startling feature of Michigan\u2019s system is its lack of centralized oversight. In most of the country, state governments play some role in determining who can open charter schools and monitor their progress. But Engler ceded nearly all control to dozens of groups throughout Michigan \u2014 universities and community colleges, as well as existing public-school districts \u2014 granting them the power to approve the charters of would-be schools and act as sole oversight bodies. A result has been an inconsistently regulated glut of schools, all fighting over the same pool of students and money, a situation that the authorizers, which receive up to 3 percent of their schools\u2019 per-pupil funding, have little incentive to rein in.There are no geographical rules governing authorizers and their schools, and inconveniently for Sylvia Brown, the campus of B.M.C.C. is 338 miles north of Highland Park, on the shore of Lake Superior. Her appearance in February before the Board of Regents involved a flight to Marquette and a morning drive through a white-out blizzard. More stressful than her journey, though, was the unwelcome news that Carver\u2019s low ranking on the Top-to-Bottom List had prompted Oak Ridge Financial to temporarily rescind the refinancing offer. The bank ultimately reconsidered, but it hadn\u2019t left Brown and her team much time to prepare for the presentation.B.M.C.C. is owned and operated by the Bay Mills Indian Community, an Ojibwa tribe with over 2,000 members and 5.5 square miles of reservation land. For years, Indians living on the reservation attended public school in the nearby town of Brimley, but they had a high dropout rate and often felt discriminated against. Bryan Newland, a board member and tribal judge who graduated from Brimley High School in 1999, told me: \u201cI remember in world-history class \u2014 this is a very vivid memory \u2014 our textbook was divided up into units, and we skipped over \u2018The Americas Before 1492.\u2019 And I raised my hand and asked the teacher, \u2018Why are we not studying this unit?\u2019 And the teacher said, \u2018We\u2019re only studying the things that matter to world history.\u2019\u2009\u201d In 2003, the tribe started its own K-8 charter, which would offer classes devoted to Ojibwa language and culture. In addition to serving as authorizer for the tribal school, Bay Mills Community College began authorizing other schools around the state. Today, with 42 schools in locations as far-flung as Flint, Benton Harbor and Detroit, B.M.C.C. is the third-largest charter authorizer in Michigan.The board meeting took place in a gray-carpeted classroom with a portrait of Chief Pontiac hanging on the wall. Brown looked anxious as she stood before the 12 board members, seated behind long tables, and talked about the importance of Carver to the children of Highland Park. \u201cWe provide breakfast, lunch and dinner for our students,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re not in session, we\u2019re often sending them to a worse environment.\u201d The refinancing would lower monthly debt payments, she noted, freeing up an extra $63,000 a year to spend on the kids.The B.M.C.C. president, Mickey Parish, nodded sympathetically as Brown spoke. A jowly, avuncular presence, Parish was the first member of the tribe, 37 years earlier, to earn a law degree. He told Brown the charter office would have to look over the school\u2019s test scores and financials before making a decision. He also asked about Carver\u2019s maximum occupancy. Brown said 650. The school currently had about 550 students, but the other K-8 in Highland Park had only one year left in its contract, and if the school closed, enrollment at Carver would likely increase. \u201cHighland Parkers are loyal,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019ll come to us.\u201dAt Michigan\u2019s current funding level, roughly $7,600 per pupil, 100 extra students would translate to $763,000. An authorizer\u2019s 3 percent cut of its schools\u2019 per-pupil state funding can add up to millions of dollars, if it approves large schools, and enough of them. Keeping the schools open, even if they\u2019re low-performing, can become a temptation, Miron told me. He found authorizers rarely closed schools in Michigan \u2014 typically, only if the school had \u201cbeen shamed by the media.\u201dAt the B.M.C.C. board meeting, two other struggling downstate charters were unanimously reauthorized. The first, the Academy of Warren, sits on a grim stretch of 8 Mile Road, in a largely abandoned strip mall. The school occupies a row of run-down, contiguous storefronts. Little effort has been made to brighten up the exterior of the buildings or landscape the oceanic, mostly empty parking lot. I found it difficult to picture an environment more aesthetically at odds, at least externally, with its supposed goal of nurturing children.And yet for years now, Detroit parents have been fleeing across 8 Mile to suburbs like Warren, in order to get their children out of the free-falling Detroit public-schools district. Michigan already had an open enrollment program that allowed schools with empty seats to accept students from other districts. It\u2019s no small oddity that formerly lily-white suburbs built on racist housing policies \u2014 as recently as the 1990 census, Warren was 96 percent white \u2014 now had schools openly courting black children from Detroit, because, like all school districts, they desperately needed those per-pupil dollars. (Much national focus has been placed on Detroit\u2019s declining population, but the state\u2019s overall population drop has also been reflected in suburbs like Warren, hence the pupil shortage.)The Academy of Warren was operated by a large, for-profit E.M.O. called CS Partners. Of the Academy\u2019s 646 students, 99 percent qualified for free or reduced breakfast and lunch; it had fallen into the bottom fifth percentile in 2014-15, but notched back up to the bottom sixth percentile last year. Parish, whose face had a resting look of concern, as if he\u2019d just received bad news via whisper, acknowledged the school \u201chas had a few difficulties.\u201d Still, he recommended that the board renew the charter for another four years. The charter-office staff \u201cthought four years would give us a chance to review them in the near future and make sure they move forward,\u201d Parish explained. Reading from the charter office\u2019s report, he noted the school \u201chad an end-of-year balance of over a million dollars, so from a financial standpoint, very stable. They own their facility.\u201dThe next charter, a K-7 called the Mildred C. Wells Academy, was located in Benton Harbor, a poor, predominantly African-American city in the southwestern corner of the state, about a seven-hour drive from Bay Mills. Parish offered a blunter assessment this time. The school\u2019s facilities, a pair of modular buildings, were \u201cvery poor,\u201d and the same went for student test scores, though Parish stressed the context: \u201cThe level of learning is comparable to that of the local public-school system, which is dismal. So ours is dismal.\u201d B.M.C.C.\u2019s curriculum specialist, Kathy Tassier, pointed to selective testing gains, and suggested that the students had been motivated to \u201creally take ownership for that growth\u201d after learning of another local charter\u2019s slated closure. Tassier meant the remark as a compliment. But inadvertently or not, she\u2019d applied the language of market capitalism, of increasing productivity via brutal Darwinist competition, to a group of K-7 students. They could have been assembly-line workers being warned that the factory would close if the Chinese kept eating their lunch. The board voted to renew the charter for another four years \u2014 again, unanimously, and with minimal debate.After the meeting, when I spoke with Parish alone, he acknowledged that the 3 percent fee, beyond covering charter-office expenses, \u201cdoes provide a little bit of extra money to help our college activities.\u201d But he said that he had no interest in expanding the charter office to maximize profit and that he thought there were too many charter schools in Detroit.When I later spoke to Newland, pointing out the cultural and geographical chasm between B.M.C.C. and the downstate, urban neighborhoods so many of their charters served, he shot back that Indians knew poverty as well anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a different stage for the same play,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we understand it very well.\u201d Were he \u201cdesigning an education system from scratch,\u201d Newland continued, he\u2019d make funding levels the same for every district and pay teachers \u201clike the white-collar professionals that they are.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t, so he supported charter schools. Unlike Parish, Newland was willing to discuss DeVos. \u201cI learned at a relatively young age not to ascribe malice to people as a motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when she says, \u2018I care about having our kids learn,\u2019 I believe that.\u201d But, Newland went on: \u201cShe didn\u2019t go to public school. Her kids didn\u2019t go. My guess is she doesn\u2019t hang out with a lot of people who know what it\u2019s like going to a school with 50 percent people of color. And I haven\u2019t seen evidence that she\u2019s taken the time to learn.\u201dWhen Brown took over at Carver Academy, one of the many problems she inherited was enormous real estate debt. The problem is not uncommon: Michigan does not mandate that its charter schools buy or lease property at fair-market prices, resulting \u2014 predictably \u2014 in wildly inflated real estate spending. In Carver\u2019s case, the situation was especially frustrating because the debt was a legacy from yet another for-profit entity. Though the school was founded in 1999 by Birdlene Esselman, a beloved local educator (she was Brown\u2019s elementary-school principal), it contracted with a for-profit E.M.O. called Mosaica Education. After only a year of operation, Carver, still run by Mosaica, signed a mortgage agreement to buy and upgrade the school property for $7.1 million \u2014 the loan Brown found herself facing down 17 years later.When she began talks with Scott VanderWerp, who runs the public-finance group at Oak Ridge Financial, Brown mainly hoped to lower the school\u2019s annual interest payments. But VanderWerp told her to write up a wish list of capital improvements. After he performed a refinancing analysis on Carver\u2019s outstanding debt, he told her he could deliver nearly $900,000 in savings over the remaining 13 years of the 30-year loan. A team of educators and financial auditors contracted by Oak Ridge made a two-day visit to the school and, in Brown\u2019s words, \u201cattacked the building,\u201d observing classrooms and interviewing everyone: teachers, administrators, security guards. Three weeks later they returned and did it again, analyzing strengths and weaknesses to determine, Brown said, \u201cif we are an investment that is going to make it or not.\u201dBefore joining Oak Ridge in 2015, VanderWerp spent nearly three decades in the bond market, often trading riskier, high-yield credits, and became an expert in municipal debt. \u201cOur basic function is to find funding solutions for public and charter schools, private schools, small community hospitals, not-for-profit senior living facilities,\u201d VanderWerp told me. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, he said, Oak Ridge was the No. 1 issuer, by total schools, of charter-school debt in Michigan.Carver\u2019s debt made no sense to VanderWerp: $6.5 million of debt on a building that\u2019s surrounded by public-housing complexes, in a place where 49 percent of people live under the poverty rate. \u201cThe crime rates are high, there are vacant buildings everywhere,\u201d VanderWerp said. \u201cI think you\u2019d readily agree that that building and land isn\u2019t worth $5- or $6 million. Quite candidly, it\u2019s probably worth $500,000 or $600,000.\u201d He said charters often entered bad deals because authorizers and school boards, which must approve loans, lacked a basic understanding of bond finance. \u201cThe vast majority of Michigan authorizers don\u2019t have anybody in-house who understands bond financing or researches it, even to the point of becoming a novice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in my experience, they rarely say no.\u201d (Carver\u2019s authorizer was Central Michigan University at the time of the building purchase.)At the same time, banks and hedge funds, Miron told me, profit greatly from the charter sector, thanks to large tax breaks dating back to the Clinton presidency that benefit investors in schools located in struggling \u201crenewal communities.\u201d And with so many eager lenders and bond underwriters lined up, E.M.O.s realized they, in turn, could make money from one of the largest expenses charter schools face. \u201cA bunch of them thought, Wow, I can start a real estate division!\u201d VanderWerp said. \u201cWe\u2019ve run into this all over the place\u201d: E.M.O.s buy buildings \u201cfor a couple hundred thousand bucks, lease them to the school for a couple of years and then sell them\u201d to the school \u201cfor a few million.\u201d In Michigan, 80 percent of charters are currently operated by for-profit E.M.O.s. The state\u2019s largest E.M.O., the Grand Rapids-based National Heritage Academies, operates 84 charters in nine states and has been criticized for charging wildly above-market annual rents to its schools: A Detroit Free Press investigation found that 14 National Heritage schools in Michigan pay the company $1 million or more.VanderWerp is pro-charter school: \u201cI love to see people compete to teach kids and shake up the norm,\u201d he says. But he finds the Michigan model deeply flawed. In Minnesota, he points out, a school must wait five years before purchasing a building, in order to demonstrate a proven track record. Michigan has no such rule, which was why Carver was able to purchase its building after a single year of operation. According to a 2015 study, Michigan was the state leader in charter-school bond defaults, responsible for more than a third of the nationwide total. In his own practice, VanderWerp makes sure the buildings being financed have intrinsic value, so they can be converted into offices or apartments if the charter school fails. \u201cIt\u2019s a real estate investment,\u201d he says, not \u201can investment in a business that has to stay afloat to pay a real estate loan.\u201dFor many students in Detroit, this unruly new education sector has made the vaunted ideal of \u201cchoice\u201d a question of least-bad options. One afternoon, I had coffee with Aleka Simmons, a senior at the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy, a Detroit charter school, and her mother, Caprice. Aleka had attended another charter, the University Yes Academy, since middle school. Her freshman year, she told me, U.Y.A. expanded to include kindergarten through sixth grade, but the building wasn\u2019t big enough to house all of the students. The school buses became so crowded, six kids would squeeze onto a seat. (Aleka posted photos online, and it became a local news story.) For part of her junior year, all 11th-grade classes were held off-campus, in the basement of Detroit\u2019s African-American history museum, \u201cone big room with wall dividers,\u201d she said. The school explained the move as a \u201cmulticultural experience,\u201d Caprice said, but she was convinced \u201cit was really just a space issue.\u201d And then the academy\u2019s high school abruptly closed in August 2016, less than a month before the start of Aleka\u2019s senior year. She and her classmates all had to scramble to find new schools. Aleka had made a couple of friends at Jalen Rose, but at U.Y.A., she said, \u201cI had three best friends \u2014 we all had 4.0 G.P.A.s, and we were always together \u2014 and we all wound up at different schools. We thought we\u2019d be going to prom together, but now we have a hard time even seeing each other.\u201dSince 2002, K-12 student enrollment has dropped by 214,000 in Michigan, but the number of charter schools has doubled. In 2011, state lawmakers abolished the longstanding charter-school cap, a project DeVos\u2019s Great Lakes Education Project strongly backed. So many new schools have opened in Detroit that there are an estimated 30,000 empty seats in the district.Last year, State Senator Goeff Hansen, a Republican from the tiny city of Hart, tried to rein things in. Setting his sights on Detroit, Hansen sponsored a bipartisan bill that would have increased oversight of charters in the city, creating a seven-member Detroit Education Commission with mayoral appointees and a mandate to determine where new charter schools could open and whether existing schools would expand or be closed. The bill passed the Senate with the support of Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, and Detroit\u2019s Democratic mayor, Mike Duggan, but it was derailed in the 11th hour by Republicans in the State Legislature \u2014 thanks, in large part, to the lobbying efforts of the DeVos family, which, The Detroit Free Press reports, showered the state Republican Party with \u201cnear-unprecedented amounts of money\u201d during the campaign cycle. Hansen, in a teary speech on the Senate floor, denounced the gutted version of the bill that eventually passed. \u201cThis was a just and honest cause,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhy should Detroit children accept less than what other children across the state are willing to accept?\u201dThroughout Michigan, though, the experiment goes on. The latest trend, virtual charter schools, could prove particularly lucrative for operators, who receive the same per-pupil funding as physical schools, but operate entirely online. The Michigan Virtual Charter Academy in Grand Rapids, the largest such school in the state, has over 2,800 students and is operated by a for-profit charter operator based in Virginia called K12 Inc. In a 2013 presentation, the hedge-fund operator and staunch charter proponent Whitney Tilson blasted K12\u2019s \u201cdismal academic results\u201d and \u201csky-high dropout rates\u201d (in some cases more than 50 percent annually), and described the publicly traded company as his \u201clargest short position.\u201d In 2010-11, only 27 percent of K12 schools met national Adequate Yearly Progress measures, versus roughly 52 percent of public schools overall. (Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut pointed out during DeVos\u2019s confirmation hearing that her family had invested in K12.) But after only three years of a pilot program in which the results were, in Miron\u2019s words, \u201cjust terrible across the board,\u201d the Michigan Legislature voted to gradually lift the cap on virtual charter schools.\u201cThese are the most vulnerable students we have,\u201d Miron said, referring to the students of Detroit. \u201cWhy do we experiment on them? If this is such a good idea, why aren\u2019t we doing it in West Bloomfield? There has been more than a decade of experimenting on these kids, and we\u2019ve seen nothing that works.\u201dKids sat at desk-clusters of four, wearing neat uniforms (powder blue shirts, navy blue pants or dresses) and appearing alert and engaged. Though the covers of their textbooks featured the hands of a dozen or so children stacked together in a multiracial huddle, all 17 of the girls and boys in Borden-Davis\u2019s classroom were black. Today\u2019s lesson centered on the conceptual distinction between \u201cwants\u201d and \u201cneeds.\u201dPacing at the front of the room, Borden-Davis began, \u201cWe know that \u2018needs\u2019 are things we need in order to ... what?\u201d\u201cLive!\u201d the first graders shouted.\u201cGood,\u201d Borden-Davis said. \u201cWho can name a need for me? Julian?\u201d\u201cWater?\u201d Julian offered.\u201cWater is a need,\u201d Borden-Davis said. \u201cMaleah?\u201d\u201cAir!\u201d Maleah cried.\u201cGood. Who can name another need?\u201d\u201cTV?\u201d another boy asked.\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need TV in order to live,\u201d Borden-Davis said.\u201cThat\u2019s a want,\u201d someone else chided.Borden-Davis shot the know-it-all a look. Then she elicited a few other suggestions \u2014 \u201cshelter,\u201d \u201cfood,\u201d \u201cclothes\u201d \u2014 before shifting the discussion to wants.\u201cI\u2019d like a cat,\u201d one girl said.\u201cO.K., give me another want.\u201dThe children cried out: \u201cA toy!\u201d \u201cA doll!\u201d \u201cCookies!\u201dNobody said \u201cschool.\u201d But it\u2019s an intriguing question: How would you classify free, high-quality primary and secondary education to a roomful of first graders? Want or need?When I went back to the superintendent\u2019s office, Brown was stewing about the all-important state M-STEP exam, only 27 school days away, the results of which would determine Carver\u2019s placement on the following year\u2019s Top-to-Bottom List. And then, right after the M-STEP, came the Measures of Academic Progress test administered three times a year to gauge whether students were improving throughout the course of a school year. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it, these kids are getting double-tested,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending every minute on instruction.\u201dShe sighed. Bay Mills had approved the refinancing plan, and Oak Ridge Financial\u2019s board was scheduled to finalize its decision shortly. Another disastrous set of M-STEP scores wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean the end for Carver, but it would most likely mark the beginning of a death spiral, as parents and teachers, not to mention financial partners like Oak Ridge, picked up on a gathering sense of failure. Brown believed her reforms were already working, but she also understood that they wouldn\u2019t necessarily carry over into a single standardized testing day.After college, Brown spent eight years as the director of a Detroit welfare-to-work program. Most of her clients had never received a high school diploma. \u201cAnd then I realized, I\u2019m on the wrong end of this,\u201d Brown said. She went back to school for a master\u2019s in education and began working at a charter school in Oak Park, a Detroit suburb. She had no real opinion of charters at the time, aside from having heard that they paid less. She planned to move to a public school after gaining a couple of years of experience.But soon, Brown had been won over. Charters, she told me, had less bureaucracy, more freedom to experiment. At Carver, Brown had started an intervention program for at-risk students, brought a reading specialist on board, reinstated art classes. She readily acknowledged the problems with for-profit E.M.O.s. The glut of schools in Michigan had also contributed to a teacher shortage, Brown said, making lower-salaried, nonunionized charter school jobs a tougher sell. Just a week before the start of the school year, one of Brown\u2019s science teachers quit unexpectedly, and she\u2019d been unable to find a replacement. When I visited, the classes were still being taught by a substitute, an engineer with little teaching experience, so Brown had also contracted with a private company called High Touch High Tech to provide hands-on science lessons.Brown told me she believed that there should be a cap on the number of charters in Michigan, that the unlimited growth had \u201ccreated a war, an enrollment war, over the last 10 years\u201d and that it had been destructive. \u201cWe\u2019re just trading kids,\u201d she said. When I asked Brown her thoughts on DeVos, she said the secretary\u2019s confirmation hearings had raised concerns about her level of understanding. Nonetheless, she appreciated DeVos\u2019s support of charters and hoped she would push for increased funding. Brown\u2019s own children attended public school in West Bloomfield, the affluent Detroit suburb where she and her husband had settled. (Her husband, also an educator, taught at a well-funded public school in Ann Arbor.) At her daughter\u2019s orientation, Brown met teachers who had been at the school for 20 years. She said she\u2019d love to have the financial ability to retain teachers like that.On my last visit to Carver, though, Brown said the school board had voted, just the night before, to hold off on refinancing the loan. The board\u2019s lawyer had looked at the terms being offered by Oak Ridge Financial and hadn\u2019t liked the fine print, and Oak Ridge\u2019s people \u201cweren\u2019t happy we were asking questions,\u201d Brown said. (Oak Ridge says that the school wasn\u2019t willing to meet the terms set by the team of experts.) She shrugged. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to shop around.\u201dIn the meantime, she would gut her budget, cutting popular but unnecessary expenses, like field trips and sports uniforms, in order to cover the repairs, pay for new computers, hire social workers and reading and math specialists. It wasn\u2019t easy, but the school was moving forward, Brown told me a few months later. The roof couldn\u2019t wait.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of an organization. It is the Education Policy Center, not the Education Policy Institute.A picture of Detroit\u2019s Ronald Brown Academy was posted in error with this article.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Voting in the Primaries", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 9:50 a.m.Good morning on this sparkling Tuesday.It\u2019s primary Election Day.Here\u2019s a friendly reminder to head to the polls today to cast your ballot in the 2017 Democratic primaries, where New Yorkers will be voting for mayor, City Council, borough president, Brooklyn district attorney and more.Here\u2019s what you need to know.Your council members, for example, are responsible for addressing issues ranging from that noisy bar keeping you up at night to concerns about education and immigration. They also play a role in holding the mayor accountable.Here\u2019s what else is happening:This evening is looking lovely, too \u2014 clear, calm sweater weather.It\u2019s a bone-chilling 10 degrees.On the ice at Madison Square Garden, that is.As many enjoy some spillover from summer \u2014 in the form of today\u2019s sunshine and 80-something-degree weather \u2014 a group of New Yorkers have been working tirelessly at the Garden to prepare the rink for the Rangers.At 7 a.m. on Labor Day, Jack Durkin, who has been part of the arena\u2019s ice crew for 29 years, left the beach to begin setting down the ice. When we visited him on the job last week, he and his team were putting on the finishing touches.\u201cToday, there\u2019s one sole task,\u201d Mr. Durkin told us. \u201cSpray water, get 10,000 gallons down, and create an inch of ice.\u201dThe ice temperature, which stays at about 21 degrees during a hockey game, first needed to be dropped to 10. The cleat-clad crew then took to the ice \u2014 their steps sounding similar to tap dancers on a wooden stage \u2014 and with a wand hose in hand they crisscrossed the surface, from Seventh to Eighth Avenue and back again, spraying a thin layer of water around the rink.After a few days of spraying \u2014 and listening to a good amount of Marc Anthony to keep things interesting \u2014 the team had crossed the ice hundreds of times, traveling nearly 15 miles, to create a one-inch-thick sheet of ice.Not quite.\u201cThink of it as a big refrigerator,\u201d Mr. Durkin said. He and the ice crew will lay large \u201cinsulation boards\u201d across the ice, lock them into place and leave them there to keep the ice, well, icy, during Knicks games and Paul McCartney gigs in the coming weeks.Once hockey season starts, a group of night owls working the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift at the Garden will be responsible for transforming the arena from a basketball court or rock concert stage back into home ice of the Rangers, all in a matter of only eight hours.Sounds tough. But during hockey season, \u201cthat day-to-day is easy,\u201d Mr. Durkin said. \u201cDefinitely easier than making the ice; this is the biggest thing that we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Local Housing Regulations Smother the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIf you live in a coastal city like New York, Boston or San Francisco, you know that the cost of housing has skyrocketed. This housing crisis did not happen by chance: Increasingly restrictive land-use regulations in the last half-century contributed to it.But what appears to be several local housing crises is actually a much more alarming national crisis: Land-use restrictions are a significant drag on economic growth in the United States.The creeping web of these regulations has smothered wage and gross domestic product growth in American cities by a stunning 50 percent over the past 50 years. Without these regulations, our research shows, the United States economy today would be 9 percent bigger \u2014 which would mean, for the average American worker, an additional $6,775 in annual income.For most of the 20th century, workers moved to areas where new industries and opportunities were emerging. This was the locomotive behind American prosperity. Agricultural workers moved from the countryside to booming cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit. In the Great Migration, some six million African-Americans left the South for manufacturing jobs in cities like Chicago and Buffalo.What allowed this relocation to places with good-paying jobs that lifted the standard of living for families? Affordable housing.Today, this locomotive of prosperity has broken down. Finance and high-tech companies in cities like New York, Boston, Seattle and San Francisco find it difficult to hire because of the high cost of housing. When an unemployed worker in Detroit today finds a well-paying job in San Francisco, she often cannot afford the cost of housing there.New housing construction in America\u2019s most dynamic cities faces growing regulatory costs, delays and enormous opposition from neighboring homeowners. Since the 1970s, a property-rights revolution \u2014 what critics call Nimbyism, from \u201cnot in my back yard\u201d \u2014 has significantly reduced the development of new housing stock, especially in cities where the economy is strongest.And once a project is approved, it faces an endless series of appeals and lawsuits that can add years of delay. Appeals are remarkably easy and affordable to file and can be done anonymously. This basically gives every neighbor a veto over every new project, regardless of how desirable the project might be. It\u2019s as if BlackBerry had veto power over whether Apple should be allowed to sell a new iPhone.To make things worse, well-intentioned regulations are often used by neighborhood groups to further delay projects. The California Environmental Quality Act, for example, was written to protect green areas from pollution and degradation from large industrial projects, like new refineries or power plants. Its main effect today is making urban housing more expensive. It has added millions of dollars of extra costs to a sorely needed high-rise on an empty parking lot on Market Street in downtown San Francisco.The Bay Area\u2019s hills, beaches and parks are part of the area\u2019s attractions, but there is enough underused land within its urban core that the number of housing units could be greatly increased without any harm to those natural amenities. To be clear, we are not advocating unconstrained suburban sprawl like Houston\u2019s, with all its negative environmental consequences. We are talking about building on existing parking lots or on lots with single-story buildings near transit, not in Golden Gate Park.Because of the prohibitive cost of housing caused by these regulations, innovative companies in Silicon Valley and Boston do not grow as much as they could, and new businesses do not get created. This means slower economic growth, fewer jobs and lower wages across the nation.Housing constraints also highlight the critical importance of investing in regional networks of public transportation that link high-paying job markets to areas with lower-cost housing. For example, the high-speed train under construction in California will connect cities in the Central Valley \u2014 Sacramento, Modesto, Fresno, Bakersfield \u2014 to high-wage jobs in the Bay Area. This will allow the number of workers benefiting from the strong San Francisco economy to increase overnight without changing the Bay Area\u2019s existing housing supply.The benefits of these investments are apparent in other countries. The metropolitan areas of London and Tokyo are illustrative: The cities\u2019 housing costs are significantly above the British and Japanese averages, but thanks to public transportation networks, workers have access to their remarkable economic dynamism. In fact, the economies of Britain and Japan are significantly larger because of the transportation network.There is a lot of debate in Washington about the costs of regulations for economic growth. Exclusionary land-use regulations in our most dynamic labor markets impose demonstrable high costs on our nation\u2019s economic well-being.Reforming these regulations through smart growth policies is a policy that should appeal to both Democrats and Republicans. The primary beneficiaries would be America\u2019s middle-class workers.Chang-Tai Hsieh is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

{"Headline": "Hugh Hefner, Who Built the Playboy Empire and Embodied It, Dies at 91", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "Supported byHis death was announced by Playboy Enterprises.He was compared to Jay Gatsby, Citizen Kane and Walt Disney, but Mr. Hefner was his own production. He repeatedly likened his life to a romantic movie; it starred an ageless sophisticate in silk pajamas and smoking jacket hosting a never-ending party for famous and fascinating people.The first issue of Playboy was published in 1953, when Mr. Hefner was 27, a new father married to, by his account, the first woman he had slept with.He had only recently moved out of his parents\u2019 house and left his job at Children\u2019s Activities magazine. But in an editorial in Playboy\u2019s inaugural issue, the young publisher purveyed another life:\u201cWe enjoy mixing up cocktails and an hors d\u2019oeuvre or two, putting a little mood music on the phonograph and inviting in a female acquaintance for a quiet discussion on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex.\u201d10 PhotosThis scene projected an era\u2019s \u201cpremium boys\u2019 style,\u201d Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at Columbia University and the author of \u201cThe Sixties,\u201d said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s part of an ensemble with the James Bond movies, John F. Kennedy, swinging, the guy who is young, vigorous, indifferent to the bonds of social responsibility.\u201dMr. Hefner was reviled, first by guardians of the 1950s social order \u2014 J. Edgar Hoover among them \u2014 and later by feminists. But Playboy\u2019s circulation reached one million by 1960 and peaked at about seven million in the 1970s.Long after other publishers made the nude \u201cPlaymate\u201d centerfold look more sugary than daring, Playboy remained the most successful men\u2019s magazine in the world. Mr. Hefner\u2019s company branched into movie, cable and digital production, sold its own line of clothing and jewelry, and opened clubs, resorts and casinos.The brand faded over the years, its flagship magazine\u2019s circulation declining to less than a million.\u201cYou\u2019re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s just pass\u00e9 at this juncture.\u201dMr. Hefner began excoriating American puritanism at a time when doctors refused contraceptives to single women and the Hollywood production code dictated separate beds for married couples. As the cartoonist Jules Feiffer, an early Playboy contributor, saw the 1950s, \u201cPeople wore tight little gray flannel suits and went to their tight little jobs.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t talk politically,\u201d Mr. Feiffer said in the 1992 documentary \u201cHugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t use obscenities. What Playboy represented was the beginning of a break from all that.\u201dPlayboy was born more in fun than in anger. Mr. Hefner\u2019s first publisher\u2019s message, written at his kitchen table in Chicago, announced, \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to solve any world problems or prove any great moral truths.\u201dStill, Mr. Hefner wielded fierce resentment against his era\u2019s sexual strictures, which he said had choked off his own youth. A virgin until he was 22, he married his longtime girlfriend. Her confession to an earlier affair, Mr. Hefner told an interviewer almost 50 years later, was \u201cthe single most devastating experience of my life.\u201d\u201cHefner won,\u201d Mr. Gitlin said. \u201cThe prevailing values in the country now, for all the conservative backlash, are essentially libertarian, and that basically was what the Playboy Philosophy was.\u201cIt\u2019s laissez-faire,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-censorship. It\u2019s consumerist: Let the buyer rule. It\u2019s hedonistic. In the longer run, Hugh Hefner\u2019s significance is as a salesman of the libertarian ideal.\u201dThe Playboy Philosophy advocated freedom of speech in all its aspects, for which Mr. Hefner won civil liberties awards. He supported progressive social causes and lost some sponsors by inviting black guests to his televised parties at a time when much of the nation still had Jim Crow laws.Hugh Hefner, the creator and curator of the Playboy empire, died Wednesday. Here\u2019s a look back at what made Playboy magazine and the media and entertainment empire it spawned so prominent.The magazine was a forum for serious interviews, the subjects including Jimmy Carter (who famously confessed, \u201cI\u2019ve committed adultery in my heart many times\u201d), Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre and Malcolm X. In the early days Mr. Hefner published fiction by Ray Bradbury (Playboy bought his \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d for $400), Herbert Gold and Budd Schulberg. It later drew, among many others, Vladimir Nabokov, Kurt Vonnegut, Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, James Baldwin, John Updike and Joyce Carol Oates.Hugh Marston Hefner was born on April 9, 1926, the son of Glenn and Grace Hefner, Nebraska-born Methodists who had moved to Chicago. Decades later, he continued to tell interviewers that he had grown up \u201cwith a lot of repression,\u201d and he often noted that his father was a descendant of William Bradford, the Puritan governor of the Plymouth Colony.As a child, Mr. Hefner spent hours writing horror stories and drawing cartoons. At Steinmetz High School in Chicago, he said, \u201cI reinvented myself\u201d as the suave, breezy \u201cHef\u201d \u2014 a newspaper cartoonist and party-loving leader of what he called \u201cour gang.\u201d At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, after serving in the Army, he edited the campus humor magazine, Shaft, and started a photo feature called \u201cCo-ed of the Month.\u201dHe married a high school classmate, Millie Williams, and began what he described as a deadening slog into 1950s adulthood: He took a job in the personnel department of a cardboard-box manufacturer. (He said he quit when asked to discriminate against black applicants.) He wrote advertising copy for a department store and then for Esquire magazine. He became circulation promotion manager of another magazine, Children\u2019s Activities.He was meanwhile plotting his own magazine, which was to be, among other things, a vehicle for his slightly randy cartoons. The first issue of Playboy was financed with $600 of his own money and several thousand more in borrowed funds, including $1,000 from his mother. But his biggest asset was a nude calendar photograph of Marilyn Monroe. He had bought the rights for $500.Plenty of other men\u2019s magazines showed nude women, but most were unabashedly crude and forever dodging postal censors. Mr. Hefner aimed to be the first to claim a mainstream readership and mainstream distribution.When Playboy reached newsstands in December 1953, its press run of 51,000 sold out. The publisher, instantly famous, would soon become a millionaire; after five years, the magazine\u2019s annual profit was $4 million, and its rabbit-head logo was recognized around the world.Mr. Hefner ran the magazine and then the business empire largely from his bedroom, working on a round bed that revolved and vibrated. At first he was reclusive and frenetic, powered past dawn by amphetamines and Pepsi-Cola. In later years, even after giving up Dexedrine, he was still frenetic, and still fiercely attentive to his magazine.In the Playboy offices, life imitated image. Mr. Hefner told a film interviewer that in the early days, yes, \u201ceverybody was coupling with everybody,\u201d including him. He later estimated that he had slept with more than 1,000 women. Over and over, he would say, \u201cI\u2019m the boy who dreamed the dream.\u201dThe glamour rubbed off on Mr. Hefner\u2019s new enterprise, the Playboy Club, which was crushingly popular when it opened in Chicago in 1960. Dozens more followed. The waitresses, called bunnies, were trussed in brief satin suits with cotton fluffs fastened to their derri\u00e8res.One bunny briefly employed in the New York club would earn Mr. Hefner\u2019s lasting enmity. She was an impostor, a 28-year-old named Gloria Steinem who was working undercover for Show magazine. Her article, published in 1963, described exhausting hours, painfully tight uniforms (in which half-exposed breasts floated on wadded-up dry cleaner bags) and vulgar customers.Mr. Hefner responded in 1970 by ordering an article on the activists, then called \u201cwomen\u2019s libbers.\u201d In an internal memo, he wrote: \u201cThese chicks are our natural enemy. What I want is a devastating piece that takes the militant feminists apart. They are unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society that Playboy promotes.\u201dMany questioned whether Playboy\u2019s outlook could be described as adult; Harvey G. Cox Jr., the Harvard theologian, called it \u201cbasically antisexual.\u201d In 1961, in the journal Christianity and Crisis, Dr. Cox wrote: \u201cPlayboy and its less successful imitators are not \u2018sex magazines\u2019 at all. They dilute and dissipate authentic sexuality by reducing it to an accessory, by keeping it at a safe distance.\u201dIn a 1955 television interview, a frowning Mike Wallace asked Mr. Hefner: \u201cIsn\u2019t that really what you\u2019re selling? A high-class dirty book?\u201dSuch scolding sounded quaint by the time crasser competitors like Penthouse and Hustler appeared in the 1960s and \u201970s. Playboy began showing pubic hair on its models, while the others doubled the dare with features on kinkier sexual tastes and close-up photos that bordered on the gynecological. Mr. Hefner would decide, after furious debate among the staff, not to compete further.The heady mood broke in 1974, when Mr. Hefner\u2019s longtime personal assistant, Bobbie Arnstein, committed suicide. Ms. Arnstein had just been convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and Mr. Hefner said bitterly that investigators had hounded her to set him up.He left Chicago for his second home in Los Angeles, an enormous mock-Tudor house with a grotto and a zoo (Mr. Hefner loved animals), where he could orchestrate the company\u2019s move into films.The 1980s brought a huge retrenchment for Playboy. The company lost its London casinos in 1981 for gambling violations and was denied a gambling license in Atlantic City, partly because of reports that Mr. Hefner had been involved in bribing New York officials for a club license 20 years earlier.The company shed its resorts and record division and sold Oui magazine, a more explicit but less successful version of Playboy, while the flagship\u2019s circulation plunged. The Playboy Building in Chicago, its rabbit-head beacon illuminating Michigan Avenue, was also sold, as was the corporate jet with built-in discoth\u00e8que. Bunnies were going the way of go-go dancers, and the Playboy Clubs closed.Mr. Hefner relied more and more on his daughter, Christie Hefner, named company president in 1982 and then chief executive, a position she held until 2009. Mr. Hefner suffered a stroke in 1985, but he recovered and remained editor in chief of Playboy, choosing the centerfold models, writing captions and tending to detail with an intensity that led his staff to call him \u201cthe world\u2019s wealthiest copy editor.\u201dIn 1989 Mr. Hefner married again, saying he had rethought Woody Allen\u2019s line that \u201cmarriage is the death of hope.\u201d His second wife was Kimberley Conrad, the 1989 Playmate of the Year, 38 years his junior. They had two sons: Marston Glenn, born in 1990, and Cooper Bradford, born in 1991.The couple separated in 1998, and Mr. Hefner plowed into his work, including the editing of \u201cThe Century of Sex,\u201d a Playboy book. They divorced in 2010.The re-emerged Hef reveled in the new century. In 2005 he began appearing on television on the E! channel reality show \u201cThe Girls Next Door,\u201d although his onscreen role consisted mostly of peering in while his three young, blond girlfriends planned adventures at the mansion. When the three original \u201cGirls Next Door\u201d went their separate ways after five seasons, he replaced them with three others, also young and blond \u2014 and shortly afterward asked one of them, Crystal Harris, to marry him.But Ms. Harris had another change of heart, and the two married on New Year\u2019s Eve 2012. On their first anniversary, Mr. Hefner tweeted to his 1.4 million followers, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be in love.\u201dMr. Hefner\u2019s survivors include Ms. Harris and his four children.Another of the \u201cGirls Next Door,\u201d Holly Madison, offered a much more depressing version of life in the mansion in a 2015 tell-all book. In the years when Mr. Hefner was calling her his \u201cNo.1 girlfriend,\u201d she wrote in \u201cDown the Rabbit Hole,\u201d she endured a dysfunctional household of petty rules, allowances, quarrels and backstabbing, all directed by an emotionally manipulative old man.Last year the Playboy Mansion was sold for $100 million to Daren Metropoulos, an investor. As a condition of the sale, Mr. Hefner was allowed to continue living in the mansion for the rest of his life, with Playboy Enterprises paying Mr. Metropoulos $1 million a year to lease it.Mr. Hefner was to be buried in Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles, in a mausoleum drawer he had bought next to Marilyn Monroe\u2019s.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated when Mr. Hefner edited the Playboy book \u201cThe Century of Sex.\u201d It was after he and Kimberley Conrad separated in 1998, not after they divorced in 2010. The author of the book, James R. Petersen, pointed out the error recently in an email.Matthew Haag and Zach Johnk contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Nick Kenner, the founder of the Just Salad restaurant chain, bought a townhouse, in Carnegie Hill, where the family of F. A. O. Schwarz once resided.The celebrated financier and author Martin Zweig, who predicted the 1987 stock market crash just days before it happened, had purchased the apartment in 1999 for the then-record-setting price of $21.5 million. He and his wife, Barbara Digan Zweig, filled the space with opulent furnishings and pop-culture memorabilia, including the guitars of major rock musicians, like Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Springsteen, and the team jerseys of sports icons like Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky.Mary Rutherfurd and Leslie Coleman of Brown Harris Stevens were the listing brokers. The monthly maintenance is $51,840, according to StreetEasy.com.Not much is known about the buyer, whose identity was shielded under the limited liability company 795 Properties. Like all purchases in the building, it was all cash. The Pierre, which was once owned by J. Paul Getty, who bought it in 1938 and converted the non-hotel part of the building to a co-op in 1959, does not permit financing.The seller was listed as the estate of Henry H.

{"Headline": "Internet Giants Face New Political Resistance in Washington", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.\u201cThere is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.\u201cWe are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\u201d said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview. \u201cThe growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\u201dPerhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\u201d Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement.Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook\u2019s discussions with the lawmakers were private.\u201cWe strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.\u201cSilicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \u201cBut selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\u201dOther issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.Even Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hugh Hefner, Between the Headlines", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the most part, news reports through the decades played along. His romp through the mid-20th century was impossible to ignore, and newspapers of the day, including The Times, followed his exploits, at first reluctantly, then eagerly and, finally, somewhat nonchalantly.As obscenity bans fell and Mr. Hefner\u2019s star began to rise, the coverage of his journey was mixed. But no matter the topic, it tended to dwell on a trio of elements: controversy, sex and an abundance of bunny puns.The magazine Mr. Hefner built sneaked into The Times\u2019s advertising column early on. The paper\u2019s businesslike tone stood in contrast to Playboy\u2019s obscenity, which was repelling advertisers even as it was attracting readers.By 1968, the world had shifted, and Mr. Hefner\u2019s libertine values were shared by much of a generation.The allegedly beautiful people of the Democratic National Convention were playing with Hugh M. Hefner\u2019s waterfall button early this morning, sending his waiters to the kitchen for everything from steaks to scotch, tilting his pinball machine and clustering around the color television set that disappears behind a painting.Ms. Curtis\u2019s remarkable story \u2014 featuring cameos from a withdrawn Warren Beatty, Adlai E. Stevenson\u2019s son, and the mayors of Boston and Cleveland \u2014 described the events of Aug. 28, which was also the day of the Chicago Police riot that became one of the defining moments of the decade. (Norman Mailer is absent, \u201cout with the hippies.\u201d)By the late 1970s, the magazine was plagued by financial problems, its reputation damaged as the feminist movement grew.Enter 26-year-old Christie Hefner, Mr. Hefner\u2019s daughter from his first marriage.Critics called the young, conservatively-dressed Ms. Hefner a figurehead who had been elevated to deflect criticism of the magazine. Her father did not entirely disagree.That became clear to the public three years later, when Mr. Hefner, 62, announced his plan to marry Kimberley Conrad, a 24-year-old model. That same year, he relinquished the chairmanship of Playboy to his daughter.Where Mr. Hefner had been revolutionary in his marketing of the playboy lifestyle, his thoughts on the subject of marriage were less groundbreaking. (He had been married once before and would marry once again.)In his final few decades, Mr. Hefner was forced to reckon with the decline of his empire.\u201cFor the better part of a decade, I\u2019ve been fighting smoke,\u201d a bitter Mr. Hefner told The Times. \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting semantic confusions in which Playboy has been accused of exploitation by people who, in every other area, have the same social-political views that I have.\u201dHe called those who opposed him \u201cauthoritarian true-believers,\u201d who included evangelists and \u201cone limited, radical but very vocal part of the feminist movement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, 20 years later, Mike Wallace has finished Volume II. And he\u2019s still not done.Supported byIn 1998, an unlikely tome by two academics became the most popular narrative of New York. The 4.7-pound, 1,424-page doorstop that focused on the city\u2019s first three centuries won the Pulitzer Prize and was instantly hailed as a definitive history.Now, nearly two decades later, the second installment has arrived, a 4.6-pound sequel written this time without a collaborator. Producing both books (plus teaching and other projects) might have left another 75-year-old historian sapped and hoping for more laurels on which to rest. Instead, Mike Wallace is poised to complete Volumes III and IV.The endpapers of his \u201cGreater Gotham,\u201d which is being published Oct. 2, epitomize the conflicts that transformed New York City during the first two decades of the 20th Century.Inside the front cover of Mike Wallace\u2019s magisterial sequel to the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cGotham\u201d is a signature pink-and-mustard Sanborn Insurance Co. map of Lower Manhattan with Wall Street at its core. Inside the back cover is another building-by-building survey, this one of the Lower East Side, then the densest place on the planet.Sandwiched between the Sanborn maps are 1,196 pages that bristle with a gripping narrative of the competing agendas that defined the two neighborhoods and reverberated from the 19th century to the 20th. \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d traces the historic conflicts amplified by two developments.First, the mania to curb destructive competition through consolidation, both in corporate America through trusts and monopolies and in government. While Europe was Balkanizing, the city fathers were amalgamating what become the five boroughs into Greater New York. Second, the specter of the First World War was emerging. Debates over immigration and Americanization magnified the perpetual predicament of a wealthy elite symbolized by Wall Street: how to mitigate class conflict to maintain order over a more and more diverse population now sprawling on the newly opened subways.Exploring the roots and ramification of both trends, \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d elaborates on the message that Professor Wallace, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and Edwin G. Burrows of Brooklyn College, an expert on the colonial period, conveyed in \u201cGotham\u201d: That current events, indeed, occur as part of a current, an ongoing momentum, and that you cannot understand New York today without appreciating the city\u2019s history from a global perspective.Professor Wallace was born in Queens to a bandleader father, spent his early childhood in San Francisco and then returned to New York City and Nassau County as a teenager.As a graduate student at Columbia, his exposure to the 1968 strikes against the university\u2019s administration and the war in Vietnam transformed him into a radical historian, determined to look beyond the conventional Anglo male version of events.Even as a radical student of history, a half-century later, at 75, he is rather old-fashioned in some ways. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 proudly proclaims \u201cNo Twitter, No Facebook, No Webpage.\u201d (He does use email.)\u201cGotham,\u201d which embraced nearly three centuries of history, was published in 1998 on the centennial of the city\u2019s consolidation, after 20 years of work.Since then, Professor Wallace consulted on Ric Burns\u2019s \u201cNew York: A Documentary Film\u201d and established the Gotham Center for New York City History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.Now, 20 years after the first volume, \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d encompasses the booms and busts from 1898 until the end of World War I.Nestled in the front parlor of the cozy townhouse in which he lives with his wife, the novelist Carmen Boullosa, on the border of Park Slope, Brooklyn, Professor Wallace ruminated the other day about \u201cGreater Gotham.\u201dYou said that \u201cGotham\u201d and \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d originated back in the mid-1970s. What was their genesis?In the 1960s, the official mainstream narrative had a pretty benign view of America\u2019s presence in the world. We were in the middle of a historiographical revolution, which was happening in tandem with social movements in the streets by blacks and other groups who wanted to be included in the historical narrative. We were not simply inserting blacks, but repeopling the national perspective. Once you have blacks in the picture, you have racism in the picture. Then, you have women \u2014 oops, we left out half the population.My generation began collectively rewriting the official narrative, but our impact on popular understanding was limited. There was no accessible narrative, one that pulled together all the new research into one coherent overview.How did that get you to \u201cGotham\u201d?Working with Ted Burroughs on a history of American capitalism, we had written hundreds of pages, but had barely gotten out of the 17th century. That\u2019s when we decided to make it more manageable and tell the story through New York City.How did you divide the volumes chronologically?\u201cGotham\u201d ended in 1898 if for no other reason than because we had surpassed the limits of bindery technology. Ted delivered his part, and I just kept going garrulously. \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d was going to go to 1945, to get through the war and reflect the kind of rhythm that repeats itself, boom bust, boom bust, and the busts are often ended by war. This one covers the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1890s to the end of World War I instead.Was that because those two decades were so transformative?We entered that war a massive industrial power, but second ranked in terms of finance and trade and as a debtor nation to Europe. Then they started killing each other, and there was this roar of demand for guns and this whole panoply of modern industrial war, and they ran out of money. They sold off their 60 years of holdings in American companies, and then they began borrowing. Britain ends the war still having the empire and the navy, but the United States ends as a creditor country. And New York is poised to become the capital of the capitalist world.You wrote \u201cGreater Gotham\u201d without a collaborator. What was the biggest difference about writing so big a book solo?For one thing there was no one to call at 2 in the morning to say I figured something out.What\u2019s striking about both books is that the same themes recur.There are things that are built into the historical structure. It still happens, and it\u2019s almost unnervingly repetitious. You can predict that every 20 years the economy will fall apart: the minks come out of the closet, and then comes collapse, unemployment, homelessness, in some instances political movements demanding federal intervention to support people who are down on their luck. But even in that rhythm, in that oscillation of the economy, things change. In the 1830s, people who were out of work were lazy. By the 1890s depression, it was patently clear that people were being pitched into joblessness through no fault of their own.Why did the five boroughs merge into Greater New York?One of the fundamental structural transformations that takes place in this period was the emphasis on consolidation and hatred of competition. For all the big bankers and corporate executives\u2019 putative love of free markets, real capitalists of that era thought competition is lunatic. They have to cut wages, which leads to unionism, which has to be repressed, which leads to socialism. This is an argument that is posed not just as economic, but as morally superior. If you impose order, you\u2019ll eliminate disorder. It\u2019s an advance in civilization. The big bankers and corporate executives consider themselves progressives. And they were instrumental in applying the consolidationalist ethos above all to the city.Has there been any change in the ambivalence with which the rest of the country viewed New York? There\u2019s tremendous hostility then because it\u2019s considered to be not really American, it\u2019s full of the wrong kind of people, who are resisting moral imperatives. On the other hand is this glittering attractiveness. I argue that by the end of this period, New York has really become, love it or not, the unofficial capital of the country with street names fulfilling national enterprises: Wall Street is finance, Madison Avenue is advertising, Broadway is theater, the Bowery is poverty.Isn\u2019t another theme, though, about an elite seeking to establish control over an increasingly diverse population?The Anglo-Protestant community in New York, which encompasses the upper echelons of the economic order, was definitely in favor of the British side of the war. And they had to confront the fact that the vast majority of New Yorkers were either Germans who were not disposed to war against Germany, or Irish not disposed to do anything positive for Britain, or Jews not disposed to support a Czarist regime busily massacring their colleagues, or a black population, which was divided.There\u2019s something special about New York; it becomes a cosmopolitan place. The ethnic enclaves in the city are a spectacular development. But they ran up against the grain of the Americanizers, who are saying that you have to pour everyone into the same mold, which is really an Anglo mold and pretending it\u2019s American. And cultural conservatives open up a new front, which is biological, eugenics: not only were we here first, but that we\u2019re a superior breed.By the end of this period something big has happened: Harlem has become a stronghold. The notion of whites invading Harlem and attempting to burn down churches, which they did in the old days, is preposterous and never more so than after the war.Is your book a radical history?Usually, when you\u2019re thinking radical, you\u2019re thinking history from the bottom up. It\u2019s usually seen as a counterbalance to the relentless focus on power and whiteness. But I did my theory work decades ago. From here on in, it\u2019s letting the theory inform, not guide, not dictate. It\u2019s a sensitivity to questions. And one of the questions is, class isn\u2019t the structure, class is something that happens. I don\u2019t think you can do history and call it history and call it radical if you only look at radicals, the downtrodden trodding up.You need the interaction, you need to understand the appeal of a system, not just that people are bamboozled into behavior that doesn\u2019t work for them, the same way that New York is appealing and appalling to the rest of country, between black and white, haves and have-nots.Novelists do this better because academics tend to dig tunnels in particular directions, but real life doesn\u2019t work like that. Real life happens all at once.Did anything you learned change your mind?That\u2019s a toughie. No, I don\u2019t think so. I had written a 200-page outline down to the 1980s, and that process helped clarify for me the historical forces which have been repetitively operative. There were endless specific instances where things turned out to be more complicated, but to the degree that I\u2019ve been able to allow for complexity, I try to incorporate that into the story and convey it as a narrative. I\u2019m sure this is a matter of provincial New Yorkism, but it\u2019s hard to think of a place on the planet that has evolved into such a complex social organism, with the constellation of cultures, the tremendous disparity of wealth, Wall Street\u2019s efforts to finance what it can\u2019t officially control, and \u2014 this is an issue not to moralize but to understand \u2014 well, it seemed like New York deserved to have its story told in a way that honored its complexity.Does your research make you more or less optimistic about the city\u2019s future?It\u2019s very tricky for a historian. You can get a swelled head and think you know so much about the past, you know about the present, that you can predict the future. If your reference is slavery, it\u2019s hard not to see improvement. If you insert yourself back in 1909 and the debates of the day, you\u2019d be appalled by the cultural assumptions and the arrogance of the people at the top. The disparities are enormous. I tend to think there has been a grindingly slow improvement on a variety of scores, but I also believe that history can go backward.\u201cGreater Gotham\u201d took 20 years and covers two decades. Does that mean, at that rate, the next volume won\u2019t be published until 2042?When \u201cGotham\u201d came out it, a considerable amount of work had been done on the next period. In fact, there\u2019s a fair amount of stuff that\u2019s already been written down to 1945. A lot of what will now be Volume III is done. While it looks like we went into micro-detail and went at a molasses pace, that is a little misleading.Will there be a Volume IV?This depends on sufficient longevity.Advertisement"}

Gamble Jr., sold shares worth almost $1.8 million in the days after the breach was discovered, but before it was disclosed. The shares were not part of a sale planned in advance.The letter \u2014 from the committee\u2019s leaders, Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon \u2014 asked for a timeline of the breach. It pushed for specifics on when the three executives, which also included Rodolfo O. Ploder and Joseph M. Loughran III, were notified of the problem.Equifax did not immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Although the stock sales by Equifax executives have prompted concerns, securities regulators have seldom, if ever, brought an insider trading case arising from a data breach. It all comes down to what an executive knew about a breach at the time of a stock sale.It is not uncommon for information about data breaches to develop over time. Initial reports of a relatively minor breach can be proved wrong with further investigation by a company\u2019s security team. If a corporate executive sold shares before the full extent of the breach was known, the trading might not be deemed to have been material at the time, even though in retrospect it looks especially prescient.The regulatory environment for credit reporting bureaus like Equifax has been a subject of debate in Congress.After the breach, senators are looking closer at the company\u2019s operations, like how management dealt with previous security breaches. Among other things, the Senate leaders asked about Equifax\u2019s use of third-party security experts to test its systems \u2014 and whether they worked to fix any of the issues that were identified.\u201cThe scope and scale of this breach appears to make it one of the largest on record, and the sensitivity of the information compromised may make it the most costly to taxpayers and consumers,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter, addressed to Richard F. Smith, Equifax\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTo make matters worse, Equifax is a critical partner of the Internal Revenue Service, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies that are the sources and recipients of the some of the most sensitive information affecting individuals.\u201dThe senators asked that Equifax respond to the letter by Sept. 28.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How China Aims to Limit the West\u2019s Global Influence", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSkeptics have derided the notion that China, which has resisted dropping the many barriers that restrict the free flow of goods and capital across its borders, is suddenly all-in on globalization. But this criticism misses the bigger picture.With the United States apparently pulling back from multilateralism, China is deploying to great effect an approach that has been some years in the making but is now bearing fruit.This form of multilateralism is built on transactional principles very different from the type of global order the United States and other Western economies have championed, one built on trust and mutual cooperation. It will eschew values like democracy, human rights and freedom of expression, which the United States has long sought to promote around the world.Beijing\u2019s strategy has two main prongs. The first is to change the rules of the game from within, by expanding Chinese influence in existing international institutions.China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, committing to opening its own markets to foreign goods and investment in return for better access to markets worldwide for its exports. China did indeed benefit, kicking its manufacturing machine into high gear and boosting its exports.But the other side of the bargain \u2014 China\u2019s opening \u2014 was not fulfilled. Foreign exporters and investors still face many barriers in China. To sell goods there, foreign companies often have to sign up with local partners. Foreign businesses undertaking production in China also have to partner with local companies, requiring transfers of technological expertise and intellectual property. Foreign investment is still restricted in certain sectors, including financial services like insurance.Meanwhile, China has become the second-largest economy and one of the biggest traders in the world, allowing it to hold sway within the World Trade Organization. The country is now one of the prime users of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement process to protect its own interests and to aggressively counter trade actions brought against it by other countries.With its rising economic clout, China has also been able to raise its voting shares at international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At these organizations, the United States and other advanced Western economies together still have the dominant voting power. So, China has been subtle in its approach, creating alliances with other emerging-market countries like India and Russia to advance its priorities.The second prong of China\u2019s strategy is to set up its own international institutions. These put a multilateral sheen on projects in which Beijing controls the purse strings and also makes the rules of the game.When China wants to show off its raw economic power, it can put on quite a show. The One Belt, One Road conference held in Beijing in May drew nearly 30 national leaders from four continents, an array of former heads of state, and numerous leaders from major public and private financial organizations. The gathering will someday be remembered not for who attended or for how much money was put up, but rather as a display of the Chinese strategy to expand its geopolitical influence.The professed multilateral nature of its initiatives allows Beijing to pull other countries more tightly into its fold. It becomes harder for countries that do not share China\u2019s values to stay on the sidelines. Many countries joining with China say they must do so to influence these new institutions from the inside rather than just complain about them from the outside. This was the justification when Britain, Germany and France signed up to become founding members of the Asian infrastructure bank, leaving the United States fuming.China has also been effective at pulling its potential geopolitical rivals into its economic embrace. Countries such as India and Russia are competitors in many areas. But Beijing has corralled these and two other major emerging market economies, Brazil and South Africa, into economic alliances.In addressing concerns that the institutions it is setting up will lead to low standards of governance, transparency and efficiency, Beijing has declared that it will uphold, and even improve upon, the standards set by Western-led institutions.Consider the governance structure of the I.M.F. and World Bank. In both organizations, an 85 percent supermajority is needed to approve major policy decisions. The United States, with its voting share of about 16 percent, in effect has veto power, giving it outsize influence over decisions like what projects and countries the institutions fund as well as the conditions attached to the funding.The dominance of the Western economies and their worldview, with the United States seen as the economic hegemon and the paragon of free markets and democracy, meant that this arrangement once gave these organizations legitimacy and power. But in recent years, with the declining economic power of the West and the rising clout of China and other emerging market economies, this situation has in fact eroded the legitimacy of such institutions.By contrast, at the Asian infrastructure bank, China has a 28 percent voting share and no veto power. Unlike at the I.M.F. and the World Bank, though, approval of major policy decisions at the bank requires only majority support. It is hard to imagine the bank making any decision against China\u2019s wishes. Yet, on paper, this structure beats one in which the dominant country has unbridled veto power, a situation that now rankles other members of the I.M.F. and the World BankFor its lending through the Asian infrastructure bank, China has indicated it will choose only projects that meet the highest standards in terms of corporate governance, environmental impact and commercial integrity. But unlike financing from the United States or from Western-dominated aid and financial institutions, Chinese-led projects rarely come with obvious strings attached. With this approach, China avoids sensitive political issues that could irritate loan recipients. Beijing does not bring up uncomfortable subjects such as corruption, freedom of expression, democracy and human rights.In December 2015, President Xi attended a meeting of African leaders in Johannesburg. He came bearing nearly $60 billion in loans, loan write-offs and other forms of financing. Then, to the delight of the leaders, including the many despots in attendance, he uttered words that were music to their ears: \u201cChina supports the settlement of African issues by Africans in the African way.\u201dChina\u2019s strategy amounts to a systematic displacing of a multilateral system that was built on high ideals and trust, mainly of the United States but also of other advanced economies. Institutions like the I.M.F. and the World Bank were meant to improve national economies and global cooperation rather than propagate the power and influence of any particular country. While the United States benefited from its outsize role in these institutions, the values Washington espoused, such as free markets and democracy, were seen to benefit economic and human welfare around the world.China\u2019s vision of multilateralism will certainly serve China well, allowing it to expand its economic and geopolitical influence in a manner that will become ever harder to resist. Whether this will be good for the world remains to be seen.Eswar Prasad is a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIn the last big economic downturn, back when Tim Ranzetta was in the student loan analysis and consulting business and working with colleges, borrowers often found their way to him, too.There would be tears. And he would get off the phone with the same frustration each time over how little the people who actually use them know about student loans.In an ideal educational world, experiential games like this would be core elements of a financial literacy master class that every high school student would take. I\u2019ve often imagined it as a semester-long study of the confounding financing system that defenseless American teenagers must navigate to pay for expensive colleges and universities. \u201cPayback\u201d is one possible name for such a course, albeit an optimistic one. \u201cProtection\u201d might be a more appropriate one, or \u201cPrudence,\u201d at least.After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. \u201cI was richer, frankly, than I\u2019d ever been in my life,\u201d she said.She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision \u2014 from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there \u2014 is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don\u2019t act fast enough.All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson\u2019s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she\u2019d had more fun and more friends.Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don\u2019t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they\u2019re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family\u2019s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn\u2019t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students\u2019 peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. \u201cMy hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,\u201d he said.There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.\u201cI\u2019ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don\u2019t have to give up everything to succeed.\u201dFeedback: lieber@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Will Be Yet Another Failed French President", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorElectoral arithmetic explains only so much. Mr. Macron\u2019s popularity suffers from something more fundamental: Macronism. His entire political project has been far too focused on his personality. Much of his appeal has come from his youth, his dynamism, his good looks and his oratorical skills. This hyper-personalized approach always carried the risk that once his charm wore off, there would be nothing left for his supporters to like, which is exactly what is happening.This arrogant attitude about power has destroyed the anti-establishment, upstart image that Mr. Macron cultivated during the campaign. The post-ideological platform on which he ran is starting to reveal itself for what it really is: an emptiness at the heart of his political project.The new president says he is determined to make France a \u201cstart-up nation,\u201d borrowing the vapid parlance of Silicon Valley. This has won him the support of venture capitalists and tech billionaires but has yet to convince the wider French public. Silicon Valley\u2019s libertarian social contract, with its cavalier attitude toward inequality, sits uneasily with a population raised on France\u2019s postwar social-democratic traditions.Not since the economic boom of the 1950s and \u201960s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses. Today, choices involve painful trade-offs. Mr. Macron\u2019s economic policies favor employers over workers and chip away at what remains of the French welfare state.But fearful of giving his program any actual political content, the president wraps up his reforms in the European flag. He tells French voters that only if they make these sacrifices at home, the rest of the European Union \u2014 especially Germany \u2014 will take them seriously and give France a better deal.Mr. Macron\u2019s European plans include a common budget and finance minister for the eurozone. His ideas have received warm words from Berlin, and there are signs that such a deal could be possible after Germany has its federal elections on Sept. 24.

The revisionism has infuriated Poles.In a speech, Mr. Medinsky lauded the gun designer as the embodiment of all that was good in Russia, and as a symbol of Russian culture.\u201cExtraordinary natural talent, simplicity, honesty, organizational skills \u2014 all of this made it possible to create a whole line of weapons in defense of the Fatherland, among which, of course, is the Kalashnikov automatic rifle, which is, one can say, a true cultural brand of Russia.\u201dThe sculpture was created by Salavat Scherbakov, an artist who gained attention last year for a monument to Prince Vladimir of Kiev, installed near the Kremlin in a ceremony led by the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Scherbakov has also designed statues of Czar Alexander I and Pyotr Stolypin, prime minister under Czar Nicholas II, in other prestigious Moscow locations.A fact sheet distributed at the ceremony by the Military-Historical Society describes General Kalashnikov as \u201cone of the most famous Russians in the world, and his invention, the Kalashnikov assault rifle, is depicted on the national emblems of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, East Timor and likewise on the national flag of Mozambique.\u201dThe AK-47 combined the portability of machine pistols popular in World War II with the precision of less portable, sharpshooting weapons and the firepower of earlier, heavier machine guns.The monument was financed in part by Rostec, the Russian state-owned corporation that owns the Kalashnikov Concern, the weapons manufacturer in Izhevsk where General Kalashnikov worked for decades (and which was renamed for him in 2013).Sergey V. Chemezov, the chief executive of Rostec, who reportedly became close to Mr. Putin in Germany in the 1980s when Mr. Putin worked for the K.G.B., praised General Kalashnikov as an \u201cexample of unwavering devotion to one\u2019s profession and one\u2019s motherland\u201d that should serve as \u201can example to our younger generation.\u201dThe monument was unveiled on Weapons Maker Day, a holiday promoted by General Kalashnikov and signed into law in 2011. It coincides with a feast day of the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of Russia\u2019s weapons industry.A priest from the Moscow Patriarchate\u2019s Department for Cooperation With the Armed Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies read the Lord\u2019s Prayer and blessed the monument with holy water.The monument is paired with another sculpture, of the dragon-slaying Archangel Michael astride a globe that includes a decorative relief with Kalashnikov rifle parts and an inscription attributed to General Kalashnikov: \u201cI created a weapon to defend the Fatherland.\u201dYelena Kalashnikova, the gunmaker\u2019s daughter, told reporters after the ceremony that her father \u201calways said that the designer is not to blame that his weapon is used, politicians are to blame\u201d and that weapons should \u201calways be under secure lock and key and only in the army.\u201dHe was not very proud, she said, when he was told that his weapon was \u201cwandering around the world,\u201d but he was pleased to be praised by Americans for his design.\u201cHe was very proud when he was recognized and when he came to America and all weapons makers there gave credit to him,\u201d she said.An honor guard in czarist uniform participated in the ceremony and wreaths with official ribbons and bouquets of red carnations and roses were piled at the base of the monument as friends and colleagues paid their respects.General Kalashnikov was born in Siberia to a family that suffered from collectivization under Stalin, but he always professed staunch allegiance to Soviet values.On Tuesday, a group of men who had worked in the Soviet defense industry lingered as the ceremony wound down and happily discussed him, stressing that he was \u201ca humble Soviet person\u201d who thought first and foremost of protecting his homeland.The monument, imposing as it is, should not be seen as threatening, they said.\u201cLook at how he\u2019s holding the automatic, he\u2019s holding it like a toy,\u201d said Vyacheslav Sokolov, 68, a former weapons designer in Moscow who met General Kalashnikov in 1981 in Izhevsk. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking aim. He\u2019s not even pulling the trigger.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the year in which the AK-47 was created.

{"Headline": "An Old Supreme Court Dream", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore there were the Dreamers, there were undocumented children occupying seats in the public school classrooms of America. And before there was Kris Kobach, or Jeff Sessions, or Donald Trump, or other exploiters of the nativist strain that runs just below the surface of the national psyche, there was Texas.In 1975, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to deny enrollment to children not \u201clegally admitted\u201d to the United States. A district that chose to retain such children would forfeit a proportionate share of its state funding, a bargain none was likely to accept.Lawsuits followed, and on June 15, 1982, by a vote of 5 to 4, the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional. \u201cBy denying these children a basic education,\u201d Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote for the majority, \u201cwe deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions, and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our nation.\u201d Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote for the four dissenters.Plyler v. Doe may be irrelevant in a strictly legal sense, but there are strong reasons to resurrect its memory and ponder it today. At the simplest level, it\u2019s clear that during the current anti-immigrant spasm, at least several states would have thrown undocumented children out of school but for Plyler. For example, Alabama\u2019s H.B. 56, enacted in 2011, requires school districts to collect data on the citizenship status of each child; while the law couldn\u2019t go further, it has driven a number of undocumented children out of school and their families out of the state.The case reached the Supreme Court during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first year in office. It presented the new administration with an acute dilemma and leaves us with a fascinating back story, one with obvious resonance with the Trump administration\u2019s vigorous effort to undo the Obama administration\u2019s legal legacy.The appeal was brought by Texas, which had lost in the lower courts. Under President Jimmy Carter, the Justice Department had entered the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs and would undoubtedly have defended their victory at the Supreme Court level. But the broad ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the Texas law violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection was anathema to the activist lawyers of the Reagan administration, who saw the Supreme Court as a potential ally and were shaping a litigation strategy accordingly.They ran into an unexpected obstacle: Rex E. Lee, the administration\u2019s solicitor general, in charge of all federal government representation before the Supreme Court. Mr. Lee, whose son Mike now represents Utah in the Senate, was a deeply conservative and deeply principled lawyer, a former law clerk to Justice Byron R. White. He saw an important part of his job as cultivating the long-term relationship between the court and the executive branch, particularly by maintaining the justices\u2019 respect for the office of solicitor general. That goal militated against simply repudiating the government\u2019s previous position in this high-profile case. So he filed a rather tortured brief that, at the bottom line, took no position on whether the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision should be affirmed or reversed.Solicitor General Lee\u2019s lack of team spirit was noticed in the office of Attorney General William French Smith. When the Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court and ruled for the plaintiffs, two young special assistants in Mr. Smith\u2019s office analyzed the opinion for him and delivered a memo. \u201cThis is a case in which our supposed litigation program to encourage judicial restraint did not get off the ground, and should have,\u201d the two lawyers wrote. They added: \u201cIt is our belief that a brief filed by the Solicitor General\u2019s Office supporting the state of Texas \u2014 and the values of judicial restraint \u2014 could well have moved Justice Powell into the Chief Justice\u2019s camp and altered the outcome of the case.\u201dOne writer of that memo was Carolyn B. Kuhl, who went on to a career as a Superior Court judge in California. The other was John G. Roberts Jr. The memo came to light when he was nominated to be chief justice of the United States.While the memo provides an insight into how the future chief justice saw the world, its premise was incorrect. No brief, no matter how on-message, would have moved Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. from the immigrant children\u2019s side of the case to the state\u2019s. Justice Powell\u2019s papers, as well as other justices\u2019 papers that have become available, make clear that he was on the plaintiffs\u2019 side from the very beginning, even though it wasn\u2019t clear for months whether he would actually join an opinion by the much more liberal Justice Brennan or whether he would file a separate opinion to reach the same result in a more constrained way.And that\u2019s the final reason that, in this mean season, Plyler v. Doe deserves to be remembered. The justices who worked out the majority opinion displayed a spirit of compromise and sense of common purpose that we today see all too infrequently across our government institutions.Justice Powell did join Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion. It was a surprise to nearly everyone, not only to John Roberts. Lewis Powell, who was named by President Richard Nixon in 1971 and who retired in 1987, was the swing justice of his day. Born in 1907 and raised in Richmond, Va., he was a Southern gentleman with a steely intelligence and a pragmatic streak. Before joining the Supreme Court at age 64, he had never been a judge, but he had been many other things: head of a big corporate law firm, president of the American Bar Association, chairman of the Richmond and the Virginia school boards.Justice Brennan was a strong supporter of both of those ideas and initially saw the Plyler case as a way of undoing some of the damage, at least by using the sympathetic facts of the case to declare that public education was a fundamental right that couldn\u2019t be withheld without some surpassingly persuasive reason. As the senior justice in the majority, he assigned the case to himself. In less than two months, he circulated a draft opinion that embodied his liberal vision: undocumented immigrants as a \u201csuspect category\u201d deserving of special protection, and education as a fundamental right. Justice Powell\u2019s reaction was tempered, to say the least. The draft \u201csweeps rather broadly and leaves me a little uneasy,\u201d he told Justice Brennan. His tone in a three-page letter was civil but his message was clear: I can\u2019t sign this.In response, Justice Brennan pulled back; Justice Powell responded; Justice Brennan pulled back some more. Correspondence between the two, shared with other members of the majority, extended for weeks. But in the end they worked it out, and that\u2019s the point. Both were highly motivated. Justice Powell\u2019s motivation came from his view that society itself would be the loser if the Texas law was upheld. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he wrote in a concurring opinion, \u201cthe interests relied upon by the state would seem to be insubstantial in view of the consequences to the state itself of wholly uneducated persons living indefinitely within its borders.\u201d He added, \u201cA legislative classification that threatens the creation of an underclass of future citizens and residents cannot be reconciled with one of the fundamental purposes of the 14th Amendment.\u201dJustice Brennan, for his part, was motivated by the desire to have five signatures on his opinion, making it fully a decision of the court and not of a plurality joined by a wavering Lewis Powell. If he had to wait for another day to achieve his doctrinal agenda, so be it.That day, of course, never came. Looking at today\u2019s Supreme Court as another first Monday in October approaches \u2014 No. 13 for the Roberts court \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine that it ever will. I, for one, have no crystal ball. But I do have a memory of Plyler v. Doe, and it was my purpose in this column to share it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Menendez Trial, Legal Wrestling Over Definition of \u2018Constituent\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 There are 325 million people living in the United States. About 56 million of those people claim Hispanic heritage.The United States Constitution does not specifically designate whom Mr. Menendez can legally count as a constituent, nor has the Supreme Court or any court for that matter offered a ruling defining who, exactly, is a constituent of a United States senator.That ambiguity has injected some intrigue into the federal corruption case against Mr. Menendez, with both the defense and prosecution debating the meaning of constituent. Mr. Menendez is charged with using the power of his office to do favors for Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy ophthalmologist and donor who lives in Florida, in exchange for gifts, luxurious vacations and political contributions. Mr. Menendez has denied any wrongdoing.More broadly, it has inserted a level of rhetorical uncertainty into one of the core principles defining the responsibilities of members of Congress: whether they serve on behalf of the people from their home state, or whether, once elected, they represent much broader interests.The prosecution, citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, argued in a brief filed on Tuesday that \u201cthe straightforward answer is that Senator Menendez\u2019s constituents are the New Jerseyans that he was elected to represent in the United States Senate.\u201dBut the defense, in a brief that was also filed Tuesday, claimed that the term was significantly amorphous and that wrestling with its meaning was \u201cnot a legal question for the court to answer\u201d but rather one for the jury to determine, \u201cbecause the word potentially bears on defendants\u2019 state of mind.\u201dIn its argument, the defense pointed to the lack of an existing legal or constitutional definition of the term, and sought to differentiate among the people represented by a senator.\u201cIn particular, Senator Menendez\u2019s attention to cultural minorities and underrepresented communities, particularly Hispanic-Americans, as well as immigration issues generally, exemplifies his focus on ethnic constituencies and issue constituencies whose members are not limited to New Jersey residents,\u201d according to the defense\u2019s brief, which was submitted by lawyers for Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen.They provided letters written by Mr. Menendez during his Congressional career, both as a representative and a senator, promoting issues of national relevance to Hispanics, including one to the Major League Baseball Players Association opposing Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration law and a letter to President Obama about discrimination in federal farm loan programs.\u201cI would argue publicly that when people say that Puerto Rico has no senator, I say, \u2018Well we have Menendez,\u2019\u201d said Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, the former governor of Puerto Rico in an interview. Throughout his four-year tenure, which ended this year, Mr. Padilla said he was in regular contact with the senator, in particular around Mr. Menendez\u2019s efforts to expand Medicaid benefits to residents of Puerto Rico.Bill Bradley, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, demurred on directly weighing in on what defined a \u201cconstituent,\u201d but he said that he often felt a dual responsibility when working on national issues.\u201cI always thought people elected me not to be a weather vane, but to use my judgment on issues that came before me,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cyou have an obligation to your constituents for your state because they elected you. But when you\u2019re called upon to do policy like taxes, like tax policy, which affects over 100 million Americans, they don\u2019t all live in New Jersey.\u201dThe nebulous issue of who Mr. Menendez represents was first broached in court during an opening statement by Kirk Ogrosky, a lawyer representing Mr. Melgen.\u201cA constituent doesn\u2019t mean that you have to live in New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Ogrosky said. \u201cA constituent, if you are a senior senator and the most senior Hispanic-elected American that\u2019s a Democrat in this country, he served people all over the United States.\u201dJudge William H. Walls told Mr. Orgosky that he had doubts that his definition was correct. But he asked the two sides to file written arguments about how they define constituent.Mr. Walls said his definition of constituent \u201cis a resident of a political district of which the person under consideration is the elected representative.\u201d But he said that he was willing to consider arguments from both sides to determine if the defense could refute his definition, or if he needed to issue a ruling or jury instructions on the term\u2019s meaning.Dr. Melgen lives in South Florida and has never counted New Jersey as his home. He is, however, Hispanic, having grown up in the Dominican Republic and emigrated to the United States in 1978.The debate over who is a constituent is relatively uncharted legal waters. The Constitution never mentions the word; its only oblique reference is that a senator must be \u201can Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.\u201dIndeed, 10 ZIP codes in 2016 accounted for $500 million of the $5 billion total raised in all federal elections, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance watchdog. The defense argued in its filing that \u201cover half of the itemized contributions to Mr. Menendez\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign\u201d originated \u201cfrom contributors outside New Jersey.\u201dShould Mr. Walls offer a ruling seeking to provide a legal definition of constituent, it could wind its way into the complex world of campaign finance regulations.In both the Alaska and the Menendez case, arguments over the definition of constituent raises an important question regarding influence.Mr. Fontana\u2019s argued, in his brief filed in the Alaska case, that out-of-state donors can certainly have an interest in and therefore the constitutional right to make a contribution, but that it should be \u201climited as well to preserve the autonomy and the uniqueness of state political communities.\u201d\u201cFlorida citizens can influence New Jersey politics, to be sure,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Fontana added. \u201cBut if Florida citizens can dictate New Jersey\u2019s elections, then there is no New Jersey anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The commonality is universal coverage, but wealthy nations have taken varying approaches to it, some relying heavily on the government (as with single-payer); some relying more on private insurers; others in between.Experts don\u2019t agree on which is best; a lot depends on perspective. But we thought it would be fun to stage a small tournament.We selected eight countries, representing a range of health care systems, and established a bracket by randomly assigning seeds.But enough talk. Let\u2019s play.Both have single-payer systems, but vary in the government\u2019s role and in what is covered.U.S. analogues are Medicare (more like Canada) and the Veterans Health Administration (more like Britain).Canada and Britain are pretty similar in terms of spending \u2014 both spend just over 10 percent of G.D.P. on health care. They also have reasonably similar results on quality, although neither ranks near the top in the usual international comparisons.

Singapore doesn\u2019t release the same data as most other advanced nations, although it\u2019s widely thought that it provides pretty good care for a small amount of spending. Others counter that access and quality vary, with wide disparities between those at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.Our pick: United States, 4-1What\u2019s your pick?United StatesSingaporeThe government pays for at least 85 percent of outpatient services, and for 75 percent of the medical fee schedule for private patients who use public hospitals. Patients must pay out of pocket for whatever isn\u2019t covered. Most doctors are self-employed, work in groups and are paid fee-for-service. More than half of hospitals are public.Everyone in France must buy health insurance, sold by a small number of nonprofit funds, which are largely financed through taxes. Public insurance covers between 70 percent and 80 percent of costs. Voluntary health insurance can cover the rest, leaving out-of-pocket payments relatively low. About 95 percent of the population has voluntary coverage, through jobs or with the help of means-tested vouchers. The Ministry of Health sets funds and budgets; it also regulates the number of hospital beds, what equipment is purchased and how many medical students are trained. The ministry sets prices for procedures and drugs.The French health system is relatively expensive at 11.8 percent of G.D.P., while Australia\u2019s is at 9 percent.

It\u2019s an example of how close the voting was. Not one vote was unanimous among the judges, and all the semifinal and final votes were 3-2. Clearly, there is room for disagreement about the relative merits of health systems, and different experts would surely reach different conclusions.Some judges took a global view, giving the edge to countries, like the United States, that promoted innovation that benefited the rest of the world. In other cases, how health systems treated the poorest of society was paramount.To nobody\u2019s surprise, the United States could do better at balancing health care costs with access, quality and outcomes. But there are many ways to reach that goal, and there will always be trade-offs. Learning about them from other systems and debating them honestly would probably do us a lot of good.We hope that readers will consider this to be merely the beginning of a discussion, not the end.

{"Headline": "Widespread Deceptive Practices May Reduce Payouts in N.F.L. Concussion Settlement", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Lawyers for professional football players who reached a landmark settlement with the N.F.L. over concussions said Tuesday that hundreds of their clients may have been swindled by unscrupulous lenders and advisers looking for a cut of their payments.In a hearing in federal court here, Christopher Seeger, a lawyer for the retired players who sued the N.F.L., said nearly 1,000 ex-players had signed dubious contracts with lenders and lawyers. Nearly a dozen lenders have lent money at interest rates of 50 percent or more to players who will pay them back with money they receive from the estimated $1 billion settlement, which provides up to $5 million to players with dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other serious neurological conditions.In the last few months, players have also signed contracts with law firms and so-called claims service providers that promise to help players file settlement claims in return for 10 or 15 percent of any cash awards. Some of these firms work with the lenders as well as brokers, who receive fees for referring players.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to watch these awards be cannibalized,\u201d Seeger told Judge Anita B. Brody of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who is overseeing the settlement. Judge Brody had called the hearing in response to news reports, including those in The New York Times, of what she called \u201cpurportedly deceptive or misleading solicitations\u201d of former players.In July, Brody gave Seeger permission to compel the lenders and law firms to turn over information about how they sought to sign up players. In all, Seeger pursued documents and information from 36 people or companies, though some firms did not cooperate.Seeger and a partner, TerriAnne Benedetto, detailed a litany of questionable practices, including charging players thousands of dollars in fees for loans with 50 percent interest rates; lenders paying fees to brokers for referrals; and former players being paid fees to convince those who qualify for the settlement to sign agreements with lawyers and lenders, some of whom promised to introduce the ex-players to doctors who could help them get larger amounts in the settlement.Benedetto provided several examples, including a player who received $10,000 from a lender but will have to pay back $17,310 from his settlement payout in one year. Another received $312,000 from a lender but will have to pay back $568,000 once he receives his settlement.Benedetto also mentioned Joe Pisarcik, a former quarterback for the Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles who once led the N.F.L. Alumni Association and had access to a database of retired players. Pisarcik received $200,000 from two law firms that wanted to use his name to help sign up former players.She said Pisarcik was also offered bonuses of up to $75,000 for every 25 players with diagnoses covered under the settlement that he referred to the law firms.Benedetto said that Pisarcik provided emails that showed that he tried to stop the lawyers from sending a deliberately misleading pitch letter with his name on it to former players. The law firms represented 92 former players before they retained Pisarcik, then signed up an additional 241 clients after he became a consultant to the firms.Benedetto said that some lenders had refused requests for documents.To date, 1,200 claims from former players or their representatives have been filed, out of about 20,000 players who are eligible to file claims.More than $130 million in claims have been approved so far, mostly for players who had previously received a diagnosis for a condition covered by the settlement. Some of that money has not been dispersed yet, though, because the settlement administrator must deduct money to repay Medicare and legal fees. Some awards have also been audited because of potential red flags, including doctors thought to have written incorrect diagnoses for players.Seeger told the judge he was worried, though, that the administration of the settlement could get bogged down if the lenders or lawyers ask the claims administrator to be paid before players receive their awards.Seeger said that he may ask the judge to pursue criminal claims against lawyers and advisers who filed false claims or asked doctors to write improper diagnoses for players.Advertisement"}

Over the weekend, shoppers here in Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace, which is also the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company, had a chance to walk away with a piece of theatrical history, as the legendary company held a sale of 15,000 costumes and other items.By the time the sale opened at 9 a.m. Saturday, a line snaked down the street; the first fans had arrived at 5 p.m. the previous day, camping out to secure a spot. Such patience was rewarded, and customers emerged clutching treasures, from the sublime \u2014 period ball gowns, lace ruffs, fairy wings \u2014 to the ridiculous \u2014 gold lam\u00e9 lion tails and grotesque pig suits.The life-span of Royal Shakespeare Company costumes, recycled across productions and for up to 100 performances, is among what makes them special, and every item has a sewn-in label identifying the actor who wore it last, and in which show. Beady-eyed rummagers could pick up Anita Dobson\u2019s grubby underskirt from \u201cThe Merry Wives of Windsor,\u201d or Joanna Vanderham\u2019s silver gown from \u201cOthello.\u201d One happy shopper claimed to have found a dress worn by Jane Asher.Even stars of Mr. Stewart\u2019s caliber are not immune to feeling awe when taking on the mantle (at times literally) of acting giants. \u201cI was once given a jacket which I did not really like,\u201d Mr. Stewart said, adding that he had then seen from the label that it had been worn by Paul Scofield, a British actor who died in 2008.\u201cSo of course I wore it,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it had to be cut down, because Paul was a much taller actor than I was, in every sense.\u201dPerformers often highlight how vital costumes are, and by trying on a vast crinoline (used in the \u201cTempest\u201d) and an absurdly heavy cloak (\u201cHenry VIII\u201d), I can understand why: They completely change the way you move and hold yourself.\u201cThere were times when the costume had a significant impact on the work I would do on that character,\u201d Mr. Stewart said, recalling the transformative effect of a luxurious pale gray three-piece suit worn for a modern-dress \u201cMerchant of Venice\u201d in 2011 \u2014 \u201cwhich I should have stolen because it fitted me so well.\u201dI unearthed a kitsch, frothy wedding dress from the same production, worn by Susannah Fielding as Portia. Indeed, a whole rail of wedding dresses were available to make wedding days extra special \u2014 once they\u2019ve had a good clean, at least.Outside, members of the public emerged enchanted with their hauls. Jenkin Van Zyl, whose parents drove up from London so that he could fill their car, went on quite a spree: \u201cI only wear theater costumes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just came to top up, but I didn\u2019t realize how cheap and amazing the sale was going to be. I spent \u00a3800.\u201dShelley Bolderson from Cambridge, England, also wears costumes in her daily life. She said she had been delighted to find a coat made from pages of a book, created for the dancing satyrs in the 2009 production of \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale.\u201d\u201cI just hope it won\u2019t dissolve in the rain,\u201d she said.The sale is also a godsend for amateur theater groups. Miriam Davies, from Stamford, England, is a costume designer for a company specializing in Shakespeare.\u201cYou can\u2019t really miss something like this,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving R.S.C. costumes is a special thing \u2014 it\u2019s history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billionaire Diller\u2019s Plan for Elaborate Pier in the Hudson is Dead", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDiller Island is dead.After years of toe-to-toe battling with a small band of critics and a fellow billionaire, Barry Diller said Wednesday that he was pulling the plug on his family\u2019s commitment to build and operate a $250 million performance center on an undulating pier 186 feet off the Hudson River shoreline.It was a fizzling end to a grand scheme that aimed to create a bold new landmark along the Manhattan waterfront on par with the nearby High Line, which has become one of the top tourist draws in the city.Some critics called the plan a monument to a billionaire\u2019s ego, and it was quickly nicknamed \u201cDiller Island.\u201dA session scheduled for Wednesday was postponed at the last minute.The futuristic pier would have stood on a forest of pilings in the river and would have included an amphitheater and two landscaped areas for staging musical and theatrical performances.Mr. Diller, the chairman of IAC/InterActive Corporation, had enlisted Hollywood friends to create an ambitious program that he and his wife, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, would underwrite.But the cost ballooned to more than $250 million today from $35 million six years ago because of the complexity of the design and the delays caused by legal wrangling over the pier\u2019s placement in a protected estuary, among other issues.\u201cBecause of the huge escalating costs and the fact it would have been a continuing controversy over the next three years I decided it was no longer viable for us to proceed,\u201d Mr. Diller said in an interview, appearing visibly distressed about dropping a project he had taken to heart.Mr. Diller\u2019s reversal caught everyone by surprise. Richard Emery, a lawyer for the opponents, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Mr. Diller\u2019s decision, \u201cbecause I thought we were close to a solution.\u201d But he was also elated.\u201cIt\u2019s a great decision,\u201d Mr. Emery said. \u201cIt shows great respect for the estuary. It preserves the estuary as the legislature intended. I believe he came to believe he was being manipulated by the trust as much as the public was.\u201dBut that was not the sentiment of the pier\u2019s supporters, who included the local community board, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Senator Chuck Schumer.Madelyn Wils, president of the Hudson River Park Trust, said in a statement that she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by Mr. Diller\u2019s decision, \u201cnot simply because this would\u2019ve been one of the world\u2019s greatest piers, but because this was a project the community so resoundingly wanted, and that millions would one day enjoy.\u201dSenator Schumer had a sharper-edged response. \u201cFor such a small group of people to hold up a public and philanthropic project that would benefit so many is just awful,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.The pier, envisioned by the British designer Thomas Heatherwick, would have been the capstone of Hudson River Park, a four-mile-long strip of green along the Hudson that was created in 1998 as a city-state partnership. The Hudson River Park Trust was created to oversee its development and operation.Mr. Diller also enlisted the help of the producer Scott Rudin and the director Mike Nichols.Speaking at IAC headquarters, a sinuous white glass building designed by the architect Frank Gehry that sits on 18th Street, a short distance from both the elevated High Line and what would have been the walkway to Pier 55, Mr. Diller said the idea was born in November 2011. It came at a party for the High Line, to which he and Ms. von Furstenberg have been major donors.Diana Taylor, the chairwoman of the Hudson River Park Trust, whispered to him, \u201cI\u2019ve got your next project.\u201dThe 875-foot Pier 54, at the foot of 13th Street, was slowly falling into the Hudson. Mr. Diller said Ms. Taylor later showed him a proposed amoeba-shaped replacement \u201cwith a few trees\u201d and an estimated cost of $35 million.He embraced the notion, but brought in his own experts and commissioned a space age structure.The project was formally announced in 2014 and won the support of the community board and other elected officials. The first lawsuit arrived seven months later.In an email he sent to supporters of the project, Mr. Diller said that his sole purpose was to provide \u201ca beautiful park on a dazzling pier for New Yorkers and visitors from around the world to stroll and wander, to be entertained, to be stimulated, to be playful, and to have the most wonderful time in a unique setting.\u201dIn his email, Mr. Diller decried that a \u201ctiny group of people had used the legal system to essentially drive us crazy and drive us out,\u201d rather than defeat the plan on the merits.Despite the recent settlement talks, Mr. Diller said members of his family asked him why he was bothering to continue with the project, when the family\u2019s money might benefit other causes.\u201cThat was a very hard question for me to answer,\u201d Mr. Diller said.Finally, he said, he grew discouraged after a settlement talk on Sept 5.Mr. Diller said that after he called Ms. Wils on Tuesday to tell her of his decision, she asked him, \u201cWould you consider building a smaller park?\u201d\u201cI said: \u2018Madelyn, honestly, we have to end this. Let a little time pass. I will be continually supportive of the Hudson River Park Trust.\u2019\u201dIn concluding the email to people who had labored over the project for as many as six years, Mr. Diller wrote, \u201cI am so sorry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love the Club. Loathe the American Owner.", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerLONDON \u2014 A few weeks before last November\u2019s presidential election in the United States, Matthew Barzun, the country\u2019s ambassador to Britain at the time, hosted a party.When all of his guests had arrived, Barzun clinked a glass and asked for silence. A confidant of the man who had appointed him, President Barack Obama, he said he knew that \u2014 whoever won the election \u2014 this would be one of his last chances to host such an evening.So, he said, he wanted to use it to celebrate something that he, and particularly his children, cherished: the special relationship between the United States and English soccer. This was the first time, he joked, that his children had been disappointed that they were not allowed to stay up late to join the party.The crowd was largely made up of players, coaches, owners and team executives. John Henry, Liverpool\u2019s owner \u2014 fresh from facing his wife, Linda Pizzuti Henry, on the Xbox \u2014 chatted happily with Stan Kroenke, his counterpart at Arsenal. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger; the former goalkeeper Brad Friedel; and Geoff Cameron, Stoke City\u2019s United States defender, joined Arlo White, host of NBC\u2019s Premier League coverage, for a question-and-answer session.On stage, Wenger expressed his amazement at the transformation. He could never have foreseen a time, he said, when Americans owned roughly a dozen of England\u2019s clubs. He was, he said, delighted by it. Polite applause rippled among the guests.Outside that room, though, the picture is rather more complicated. Barzun might have wanted to celebrate the special relationship that had brought so much American influence into the Premier League, but not everybody in England does.The detail that Josh Harris and David Blitzer, part of the ownership group that controls the Philadelphia 76ers of the N.B.A. and the New Jersey Devils of the N.H.L., went into as they considered their bid to take over Crystal Palace was forensic.Over the course of more than a year as they weighed investing, Harris and Blitzer had pored over the numbers so often that, by the end, they had dozens of financial projections for the club, accounting for a host of different outcomes. In none of them, it is fair to assume, did the prospect of firing a coach after 77 days feature.When Harris and Blitzer finally completed the deal to acquire Palace in December 2015, the South London club became the eighth English team under American control. The Glazer family had been the first on the scene, buying Manchester United in 2003. In the years to come, Liverpool (twice), Arsenal, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Fulham, Millwall and Derby County would follow.Fulham, Aston Villa and Sunderland have all been relegated. Swansea City only narrowly avoided the same fate last season, and relations between the club\u2019s fans and its American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, remain strained. And at Palace this week, the club appointed Roy Hodgson to replace Frank de Boer, fired after only four games in charge. He is the fourth coach in Harris and Blitzer\u2019s brief tenure.\u201cIt is unfair to say they have all been complete failures,\u201d Chris Anderson, who has consulted on a number of completed and putative takeovers, said of American owners in Britain. \u201cBut many do struggle with the dynamics of the game, and the industry. They find it hard to understand the nature of the beast.\u201dAccording to Steven Gans, a Boston lawyer who advises teams and owners, including several in Britain, there is a direct connection between the way American parents approach their children\u2019s soccer games and the way American owners approach the clubs they pay hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire, and he argues that it is this link that is the root of the problems Americans have endured since they started arriving in England.\u201cParents of kids who play soccer tend not to have a frame of reference for it in the same way as they would for baseball, for example,\u201d Gans said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey are insecure, only dipping their toes into it. They presuppose they do not know enough. So they outsource it to whoever seems to know more, and that is not always the right person.\u201cThe same pattern applies to owners when they buy an asset. They are at the mercy of their own insecurities. They have less confidence in their own judgment, so they completely outsource the running of it.\u201cJohn Henry knows baseball in a way he does not know soccer, so he suspends his normal instincts. He tends not to interject his own thoughts and evaluations. In soccer, U.S. owners outsource the running to people who seem to have the right experience.\u201dThe problem for many American owners \u2014 especially at first \u2014 is in establishing who, exactly, that might be. \u201cWhen you land at an airport in a foreign city, sometimes you get charged twice the normal rate by a taxi driver, and you pay it, because you don\u2019t know any better,\u201d said Hendrik Almstadt, a German executive who worked both at Lerner\u2019s Villa and Kroenke\u2019s Arsenal. \u201cIt happens to us all.\u201dAnderson compares it to someone functioning in a second language: able to grasp the meaning of the sentence, but not always the nuance.\u201cThey cannot necessarily read the signs in the same way as they would in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are finance guys, largely. They are used to a macho world, where everyone is wearing immaculate suits and has great teeth. That is what everyone in European soccer looks and behaves like. So how do you tell the good ones and bad ones apart?\u201dGiven the difference between the sports industries in Europe and the United States, Anderson sees establishing that credibility as crucial. \u201cIn the U.S., it is highly professionalized,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a small thing, but in a lot of front offices, you have guys with college degrees, a formal understanding of business. That is not the case in Europe.\u201dHe searches for the right word. \u201cNew owners do not understand how informal it is. It is less regulated. It is based on personal networks.\u201dJohn Henry has put it a little more succinctly: European soccer, he said early in his Liverpool tenure, is like the \u201cWild West.\u201dAt first, in Almstadt\u2019s experience, American owners tend to believe a \u201ccool, rational, analytical approach\u201d will make them the exception in the chaotic, impulsive atmosphere of European soccer.Few arrive aiming to be a benefactor in the style of Roman Abramovich, lavishing bottomless wealth on their teams. They believe that their knowledge will yield success.The problem, Almstadt argued, is that English soccer\u2019s establishment \u2014 the old hands, longstanding coaches, influential former players and a hostile news media \u2014 is inherently resistant to new ideas. Americans arrive wanting to mold their new environment, but on unknown territory in an unfamiliar sport, too often they allow the opposite to happen. It is an echo of Gans\u2019s theory: They are at the mercy of their insecurities.\u201cTraditionally, owners gave the manager the keys to the car,\u201d Almstadt said, as an example. \u201cAnd then, six months later, when it didn\u2019t work out, they did the same with another manager.\u201dThat is the way it has always been in England, where managerial omnipotence has long been considered a virtue. It is at odds with what Almstadt described as the \u201cfront office model\u201d of American sports, where the coach is just another link in a chain that leads up to the owner, whose position, according to the author Dave Zirin, is akin to \u201ca modern day Caesar.\u201dAt Sunderland and at Villa and increasingly at Palace \u2014 where Harris and Blitzer have left day-to-day decisions to Steve Parish, an Englishman and minority owner \u2014 the managerial churn has been endless. At other clubs, executives, too, have come and gone: owners not trusting their own judgment, vacillating between concepts and advisers, unable to hear themselves think amid the deafening cultural dissonance.\u201cAfter a while, you become locked in a death spiral,\u201d Almstadt said. Poor decisions induce panic, and vice versa.But he and Anderson say they believe things are improving. \u201cThe commercial model of the Glazers is now being copied by a lot of teams,\u201d Almstadt said. \u201cMore and more teams have a front office model now, too, where coaches are a part of \u2014 a very important part of \u2014 a broader structure.\u201cThere is a definite American influence on English football starting to show.\u201dAnderson has been encouraged, too. He praised Henry for his \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach, and noted that Liverpool\u2019s gradual improvement suggested lessons are being learned, and that the right people are being retained. He has also found that more owners are doing more comprehensive due diligence on teams before buying.\u201cThey are getting people in to look at their squads, their academies, their staff, to see exactly what they are getting,\u201d he said. Owners have always paid close attention to the finances. Now, they are beginning to dig under the surface of the soccer, too.That was why there was plenty to celebrate that night at Winfield House. As Wenger said, the special relationship between the United States and the Premier League would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. It is still young, though, still developing. It is perhaps a little too early for the Champagne to flow. There is a lot, still, for both sides to learn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India Does Not Need Boots on Afghan Ground", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 President Trump has pivoted toward India and away from Pakistan. Calling upon India to help in Afghanistan, \u201cespecially in the area of economic assistance and development,\u201d Mr. Trump was holding up the prospect of a major Indian presence to goad Pakistan to crack down on the Taliban and deny them sanctuary.Indian policy makers were pleased with Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt warning to Pakistan to stop \u201chousing the very terrorists that we are fighting,\u201d but Indian officials know the American president is neither measured nor consistent.It is because Pakistan insists that if the Taliban are to be persuaded to join peace talks over Afghanistan and the supply lines through Pakistan to the United States forces are not disrupted or stopped, the United States must not allow an Indian security presence in Afghanistan.In the early years after the fall of the Taliban, Indian policy makers were miffed at being prevented from putting a security presence on the ground. In 2011, India signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan, which enabled India to provide direct military support \u2014 initially trainers but potentially combat troops if the need arose.Indians are conscious of the limited leverage the United States has over Pakistan. Mr. Trump, like his predecessors, is likely to ease the squeeze after Pakistan sacrifices some jihadi pawns to save the king and queen.But the Indian presence in Afghanistan rests on deeper cultural foundations than United States support. Any evaluation of India\u2019s options requires an understanding of the close, even inexplicable, friendship between the two peoples who seldom meet. The irrational friendship toward India among Afghans of every stripe \u2014 Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Ubeks, Communists, Islamists, everyone \u2014 stems from the soft power that India projects in Afghanistan.Afghans avidly consume Hindi language soap operas and Bollywood films, which create a perception of India as a utopian idyll of noble friendships and relatively chaste romances where the good folks always win. Paradoxically, the physical distance between India and Afghanistan brings their people even closer in their common dislike of Pakistan, which separates them geographically.On several occasions, on learning that I am Indian, Afghan airport security officers insisted that I pull my bags off the scanning machine since checking them would be insulting a friend. Over years of travel in Afghanistan, I encountered surliness just once, while interviewing an Afghan currency dealer for a television network. After the interview, it emerged he had mistaken me for a Pakistani. The Afghan apologized profusely and insisted on a retake.The Taliban field commanders and fighters I have met, who many assume would be hostile to India owing to the support they receive from Pakistan, display the same disdain for Pakistan and affection for India as the average Afghan. One senior Taliban official reproached me for India\u2019s failure in 1979 to condemn the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. But he returned quickly to criticizing the domineering control of \u201cPunjabis,\u201d as Afghans disparagingly call Pakistanis.Sustaining this priceless Afghan affection for India is the fact that Indian troops have never spilled Afghan blood \u2014 not in the anti-Soviet jihad in the 1980s, nor the civil war in the 1990s, nor through the insurgency after 2002.The combat-weary Afghans associate India\u2019s presence with Kabul\u2019s biggest children\u2019s hospital and medical missions in their major cities that treated hundreds of thousands until some Indian doctors who manned them were killed in Kabul in 2010.Each project allocates up to a million dollars for a health, education or rural development project \u2014 such as building an irrigation channel for a village to bring water from a mountain stream to its fields.India merely selects and finances the project and provides technical oversight; the local community takes ownership of the project and executes the work on the ground. The wave of good will for India generated by the S.D.P.s has encouraged New Delhi to allocate a larger share of Indian development aid to these projects.Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a greater Indian developmental role in Afghanistan hardly constitutes a dilemma for New Delhi. India could oblige Mr. Trump, while simultaneously furthering its own interests, by doubling down on an aid-based strategy in Afghanistan.Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian Army colonel, is a consulting editor for Business Standard newspaper in New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Very Taxing President", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump is willing to suffer, just for you.Unrolling his tax plan, Trump wanted to make it very clear that it was going to cost him a ton of money. \u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing, and it\u2019s not good for me. Believe me,\u201d said the Robin Hood of Mar-a-Lago.He\u2019s always telling the public that he\u2019s given up a lot for them. During the campaign, when Trump had a fight with the gold star parents of a fallen soldier, he claimed that he had made \u201ca lot of sacrifices\u201d for the country by being a successful real estate developer.And then there was the time he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he\u2019d \u201cgiven up a tremendous amount to run for president. I gave up two more seasons of \u2018Celebrity Apprentice.\u2019\u201dI know you have been dealing with this man long enough to realize the last statement did not involve a drop of irony.This week, Trump was intent on convincing the nation that he was fighting to raise taxes on himself. Looking at the administration\u2019s package, cynics wondered how a real estate baron could suffer under a plan that calls for a reduction of the top income tax rate, the elimination of the estate tax and an end to the alternative minimum tax, which is supposed to impose some modest sacrifice on high-income people who would otherwise avoid paying anything.Only his tax returns know for sure.To hear the administration talk, the whole Trump tax initiative is one big assault on the wealthy, on behalf of the little guys. Who are their favorite, teeny-tiny people. Gary Cohn, the White House economic adviser, called them \u201cour hard-working citizens that get up every morning and work as hard as any people in the world, to try and keep more of their hard-earned income.\u201dCohn is a former investment banker who got a $285 million severance package from Goldman Sachs when he joined the government. Deeply cynical minds might have felt that his description of average Americans sounded a little \u2026 remote. As it did when he suggested that those hard workers could use their new typical $1,000 tax cut to \u201cbuy a new car.\u201dAt a press conference, Cohn also seemed to believe that Typical American Family earned $100,000 a year. To which the actual TAF says, \u201cWe wish.\u201d Anyhow, the message was that the whole tax effort was for the middle class, and the middle class alone. Although when asked whether every one of those humble folks would be protected from tax hikes, Cohn basically said he couldn\u2019t \u201cguarantee that.\u201dIt was one truly awful presentation. We\u2019d be talking about Cohn as Trump\u2019s worst appointment if there wasn\u2019t so much competition. Like the acting head of homeland security, who called the government response to the devastation in Puerto Rico \u201creally a good news story.\u201dAnd of course there was the late and unlamented secretary of health and human services, Tom Price. It\u2019s going to be hard for anyone to top Price\u2019s week, in which he watched over the total demise of the Obamacare repeal effort, admitted that he spent more than $400,000 of the taxpayers\u2019 money on private plane travel, and then offered to make restitution by reimbursing the government for 12 percent of the bill.Until now, Cohn\u2019s highest-profile moment probably occurred after Trump\u2019s appalling response to the tragedy in Charlottesville. At the time, Cohn wanted the world to know he was agonizing over whether to quit the government in principled protest. But he decided to stay on, for the tax package. \u201cWhy am I here? I am here for just this reason,\u201d he told reporters Thursday. Being able to rewrite the tax code was, he said, \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I would never miss this.\u201dAsked if he would finally stalk off in moral dudgeon once said tax plan was done, Cohn noted that there were \u201cmany more once-in-a-lifetime opportunities at the White House.\u201dAbout the plan itself. Cohn worked it out with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager. Amazingly, it does not include Trump\u2019s campaign promise to get rid of a famous tax break for hedge funds known as \u201ccarried interest.\u201d (\u201cHedge fund guys are getting away with murder,\u201d Trump said, so very long ago.)Cohn said the administration would get around to that later.The plan also dramatically drops taxes on businesses known as pass-throughs. It is possible you have never heard of pass-throughs, but there are a lot of them. If this plan makes it into law there will be even more. Everything will be a pass-through. Your family pet will turn itself into a pass-through for tax purposes.\u201cAnother megaloophole for the wealthy to dodge paying their fair share,\u201d said Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.Asked for specifics on how to avoid such abuse, Cohn said details were still to come. But, he assured reporters, the Trump team was opposed to a big new tax benefit for \u201cguys like myself.\u201dThe selflessness in this administration never ends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio Spreads His Gospel of \u2018Radical Transparency\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "Mr. Dalio has created an unusual and confrontational workplace at Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund firm. With a new book, he hopes to inject his ideas into the mainstream.Supported byAs thousands of Egyptians took to the streets during the Arab Spring protests of 2011, Ray Dalio, a hedge fund billionaire, decided to sail the Nile River with some friends, including some other financiers.It was a risky place to be, with the Middle East convulsed, and Mr. Dalio\u2019s trip raised concerns at the Connecticut headquarters of his company, Bridgewater Associates. But his security team couldn\u2019t get him to change his plans, so they set up a special team to track him and his group by GPS, hoping to keep him out of trouble.You could say that Mr. Dalio was applying one of his very own rules, known internally as Principle 188: \u201cIf you make a plan, follow through!\u201dOver four decades, Mr. Dalio, 68, has built Bridgewater, which has $160 billion in assets, into the largest hedge fund firm in the world \u2014 bigger than the next two largest hedge funds combined. He manages money for some of the largest companies, big public pensions, sovereign wealth funds and even some central banks. He has become a financier-statesman, of sorts, consulting with political leaders in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.He has also built an unusual and confrontational workplace at Bridgewater, where employees hold each other to account by following a strict set of rules that he created, \u201cPrinciples.\u201d He began developing the rules, which number more than 200, two decades ago based on his life experiences.Some, like advising employees not to \u201ctolerate badness,\u201d are self-evident. Others \u2014 \u201clook for people who sparkle\u201d; \u201cbe willing to \u2018shoot the people you love\u2019\u201d \u2014 are more unconventional.All of the rules celebrate what Mr. Dalio calls \u201cradical transparency\u201d in the workplace, and the search for the ideal employee. Those ideals stand in stark contrast to Bridgewater\u2019s reputation as particularly secretive when it come to its trading, even for an industry where secrecy about investing is the norm.Now, Mr. Dalio hopes that others will embrace his ideas about the future of work as he embarks on a big public push to promote his Principles. But is corporate America ready for his sometimes contradictory vision of radical transparency?The effort to establish Mr. Dalio as a business icon in the vein of Steve Jobs or Warren E. Buffett comes even as questions persist about Bridgewater\u2019s unusual culture. The firm videotapes nearly everything that goes on there for future case studies, and employees are given homework and graded on their understanding of Principles.In interviews with nearly 50 current and former Bridgewater employees, including several chosen by Mr. Dalio, The New York Times found that he is driven to enforce his rules to ensure that they survive at the firm. Some senior executives have been taken to task in \u201cpublic hangings\u201d \u2014 one of the Principles meant to \u201cdeter bad behavior\u201d \u2014 when they break the rules. Other employees have been pushed to tears.The Times also found that Bridgewater\u2019s investment process is largely a secret not only to investors but to most of the firm\u2019s 1,500 employees. No more than a dozen people have a full sense of how the firm trades.Even employees who left with a positive experience describe a workplace that is rigid and sometimes oppressive.\u201cIs it a hedge fund, or a social experiment?\u201d said Tim Bradley, a technology consultant who worked at Bridgewater for a year in 2010.Bridgewater, in a statement, said that people either thrived in the firm\u2019s \u201cunique culture\u201d or \u201cthey dislike it and decide to move on.\u201dNestled amid pine trees and hidden from the main road, the serene setting of Bridgewater\u2019s headquarters in Westport, Conn., is beloved by employees. Many also find the work intellectually stimulating.Plucked from top schools, most of those hired by the firm arrive with little or no expertise in the world of finance. They work hard, and party equally hard at off-site retreats sometimes held at the Lookout, a firm-owned guesthouse where meals are cooked by Bridgewater chefs, or at Mr. Dalio\u2019s house in Vermont.\u201cBridgewater definitely changed me and I would say for the better,\u201d says Owen B. Jennings, who was hired as an investment associate in 2011 after graduating from Dartmouth College.Others describe a darker side of the firm\u2019s culture. Turnover is high \u2014 a third of employees are said to leave within the first two years, a figure the firm does not dispute. Some who have left said they became disenchanted with the constant blunt feedback, questioning of their actions, lack of privacy and need to adhere to Mr. Dalio's rules.Nearly all of the current and former employees interviewed declined to speak on the record for fear of retribution because of the firm\u2019s strict nondisclosure agreements. The Times reviewed documents from a dozen lawsuits and complaints filed against the firm by former employees, and documents obtained from public agencies through Freedom of Information Act requests.The picture that emerges is that life at Bridgewater is demanding, with a heavy focus on maintaining Mr. Dalio\u2019s rules.Each day, employees are tested and graded on their knowledge of the Principles. They walk around with iPads loaded with the rules and an interactive rating system called \u201cdots\u201d to evaluate peers and supervisors. The ratings feed into each employee\u2019s permanent record, called the \u201cbaseball card.\u201dTwo dozen Principles \u201ccaptains\u201d are responsible for enforcing the rules. Another group, \u201coverseers,\u201d some of whom report to Mr. Dalio, monitor department heads.The video cameras that record daily interactions for future case studies are so ubiquitous that employees joke about \u201cthe men in the walls.\u201dMeetings occasionally last for hours, sometimes simply because of a debate over why certain subjects are on the agenda or the quality of an employee\u2019s presentation. Workers described being publicly berated for not completing homework assignments related to the firm\u2019s culture or, sometimes, for \u201cbelow-the-bar thinking.\u201dIn one of the firm\u2019s more memorable case studies \u2014 videotaped episodes of events at Bridgewater that employees review and analyze \u2014 a female employee burst into tears during a group interrogation. \u201cI have never seen so many smart people in a room who never get anything done,\u201d Mr. Bradley said.Bridgewater said \u201cit would be misleading to characterize\u201d the firm as a place where employees are publicly berated.The app that Mr. Dalio is developing will include some videotaped Bridgewater case studies but only ones that employees have agreed can be shared with the outside world.Mr. Dalio, a devotee of Transcendental Meditation, considers confrontation part of a quest for getting to the truth and determining an employee\u2019s \u201cbelievability.\u201d Because, as Mr. Dalio once explained in a Principle known in-house as No. 194, only \u201cbelievable\u201d people \u201chave the right to have opinions.\u201dJames Cordes, who was hired several years ago as an internal adviser to the Bridgewater management committee, said Mr. Dalio, \u201cwas a purist; you had to go all in.\u201dMr. Dalio has talked about the firm as a place devoid of office politics, where employees don\u2019t talk behind each other\u2019s backs. But some former employees contend Mr. Dalio has simply created a different kind of office politics, one that rewards those who play by his rules.The firm\u2019s top executives, like Mr. Dalio, see things differently. \u201cThis is a deeply analytical place,\u201d said Brian Kreiter, a member of Bridgewater\u2019s management committee. \u201cWhen something goes wrong in any part of our business it gets debated vigorously with reference to our shared understanding, systems, and principles.\u201d\u201cWe want this place to be an idea meritocracy,\u201d he said.But in Mr. Dalio\u2019s quest to create an environment that values data, emotional intelligence can be stripped out of business decisions, said Robin Levine, a former employee who now runs a job-matching platform she and another Bridgewater alumna founded. \u201cIf you read through the Principles, there is more emphasis on the individual.\u201d Ms. Levine added that working at Bridgewater did foster good interpersonal relationships.Yet some incidents of raucous behavior at off-site retreats have led employees to complain.In one 2012 episode, at Mohonk Mountain House in upstate New York, several dozen junior associates watched a fireside chat that started in humor, and then took a turn when Greg Jensen, one of Mr. Dalio\u2019s lieutenants and a co-chief investment officer, was asked by another employee to describe the time that he and Mr. Dalio sat naked together in a sauna during a trip to Japan.After the retreat, several employees said they were made uncomfortable by some of what had gone on that weekend, including skinny dipping and heavy drinking by some who were there.Three years ago, another top executive took a group of young interns to a strip club. Again, some employees complained about the outing later and the episode became a case study to be discussed internally.These incidents have spilled into public view over the past year, leading to concern about the firm\u2019s image. The impact on recruiting has become a topic of discussion within the firm, according to an internal document reviewed by The Times. One manager wrote in the document that Bridgewater had become \u201ca place that is difficult to hire for and lukewarm to join.\u201dMark Carey, an employment lawyer who has represented five Bridgewater employees in disputes over the past two years, said that Mr. Dalio had created an environment that could deter employees from speaking up about workplace problems.\u201cThis whole transparency and truth-seeking thing is juxtaposed with the fact that they intentionally secretize all interactions with employees from public view,\u201d Mr. Carey said.Mr. Dalio has acknowledged that the firm\u2019s culture is not for everyone. Of his rules, he writes in his book, \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to follow them blindly.\u201d The firm said, \u201cWhile there could be some concern that media distortions might impact recruiting, the firm just had one of its best recruiting classes ever.\u201dBridgewater also notes that business leaders like Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon have praised Mr. Dalio\u2019s book.Robert Kegan, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education who spent a week at Bridgewater doing research, likened Mr. Dalio to a great inventor. \u201cEvery critical thing you\u2019ve heard about Bridgewater could be true and it still doesn\u2019t take away from the basic project itself,\u201d Professor Kegan said,Mr. Dalio was contributing to \u201c as dramatic a transformation as the industrial revolution,\u201d he added, referring to the Bridgewater founder\u2019s vision of the future of work.His beginnings were more humble.He grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, the son of a jazz musician. He earned an undergraduate degree in accounting from Long Island University before heading off to Harvard Business School. After graduating, he landed at a small brokerage firm that was led at the time by Sanford I. Weill, who would later forge Citigroup.Mr. Dalio didn\u2019t last long. He punched his boss in the face and brought a stripper to a corporate event. He was fired and then formed Bridgewater in 1975, working out of his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment.He married Barbara Gabaldoni, a descendant of the Whitneys and the Vanderbilts, and the couple moved to Wilton, Conn. For a time, Bridgewater was so small that it was run out of their home.Early clients included the pension funds for the World Bank and Eastman Kodak. The firm gained a dedicated following on Wall Street because of its deeply researched daily economic note, Daily Observations.After profiting on the stock market crash of 1987, Mr. Dalio started to become known beyond Wall Street. The next year, he appeared in an episode of \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d called \u201cDo foreigners own America?\u201dIn 1991, Bridgewater started one of its flagship funds, Pure Alpha, which makes bets based on the direction of global economic trends. Five years later, it started All Weather, a fund that pioneered a steady, low-risk strategy called risk parity.As for Principles, the concept flowed from Mr. Dalio\u2019s early practice of jotting down his observations about how markets worked. He moved on to writing down his thoughts on how employees should interact in the workplace.In the mid-2000s, he had just a few dozen Principles, but the number quickly grew along with Bridgewater\u2019s head count. Ultimately, Mr. Dalio compiled his rules into a little white book. All employees carried hard copies before Principles became available on the firm\u2019s iPads.It wasn\u2019t until the financial crisis of a decade ago that Bridgewater made the big leagues. The firm saw before most in the industry that trouble was brewing in the mortgage market and at investment firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. So when the stock market tumbled in 2008 and most hedge funds recorded big losses, Bridgewater\u2019s Pure Alpha fund made for its investors. Its success led more money to pour in.Since it began, Pure Alpha has made investors an annual average return after fees of 11.9 percent, slightly better than the 9.5 percent average yearly return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. The All Weather fund has given investors an annual return of 7.9 percent return since it began.\u201cIt is a culture that is not for everyone but not one that would dissuade me from investing,\u201d said John Longo, a finance professor at Rutgers University School of Business.Yet much of the firm\u2019s vaunted investing machine remains shrouded in mystery, even to those working at Bridgewater. On Wall Street, how the firm makes its money long has been a source of envy and debate because it goes to great lengths to conceal its trades from competitors.As one of the first hedge funds to embrace quantitative analysis, Bridgewater bases almost all of its trades on algorithms derived from decades of market observations. The firm trades in many diverse markets, including the Japanese yen, Treasury securities and gold.There is little room at Bridgewater for intuition and fast-paced trading. Unlike their counterparts at other big hedge funds who are responsible for trade ideas, many Bridgewater traders simply press buttons that execute trades. Many of those positions are held for several months at a time.Only a small number of top executives who occupy Mr. Dalio\u2019s \u201ccircle of trust\u201d have a complete picture of the firm\u2019s trading strategy from start to finish. Another half-dozen employees on what is called Signals team, which decides how the firm should adjust its trading, sign long-term noncompete agreements.To avoid any inadvertent leaking of trading information, Bridgewater has a general policy that discourages the 450 employees who work on the investment side of the firm from socializing with those employed at Wall Street firms it trades with.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Dalio appeared on a panel with two senior Russian officials: Kirill Dmitriev, the executive officer of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Igor Shuvalov, the first deputy prime minister of Russia. The panel came as a political firestorm was spreading in the United States over intelligence reports that Russia had meddled in the presidential elections.\u201cIt would be better if the sanctions were lifted,\u201d for Russia\u2019s economic and financial development, Mr. Dalio told the audience, while adding that Russia had already made adjustments to be less dependent on foreign investment.The message appeared to please his panelists. Mr. Dmitriev said he hoped to organize a delegation to Russia later in the year, \u201ccontaining the largest funds and companies from the U.S.,\u201d adding, \u201cwe would love to have Ray and other people there as dialogue partners.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Dalio writes a good deal about his world travels, particularly his meetings with foreign leaders and economic thinkers. The meetings have not only informed Bridgewater\u2019s trading style, but also have shaped Mr. Dalio\u2019s views about how to manage his people and the firm.But no foreign country and its leadership is as important to Mr. Dalio than China, which he first visited in 1984 and where his son Matthew lived for several years. Mr. Dalio has often met with the country\u2019s senior leaders during his frequent visits there. In 2015, he was one of a few business leaders to attend a state dinner at the White House in honor of president Xi Jinping.Over the years, Mr. Dalio has geared up for the day when China opens itself up more fully to foreign investment firms, securing hard-to-get licenses in order to expand its investment business.Last year, Bridgewater became the third global investment firm to receive a license for a wholly owned foreign owned enterprise, allowing it to set up an entity to manage money for Chinese institutional investors and, potentially, to engage in foreign currency trading. The firm received the approval just weeks before China stopped issuing licenses to foreign investors.Months later, Mr. Dalio met with Pan Gongsheng, the deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China who is also an administrator of China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, which is responsible for managing China\u2019s foreign exchange currency reserves.Bridgewater has a relationship with SAFE and the China Investment Corporation, China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, and has advised both government entities.And, Mr. Dalio writes in his book, one of his close counselors, not only on China, but on big ideas about the wider world, is Wang Qishan, one of the most powerful men in China and the nation\u2019s anti-corruption czar.Every time Mr. Dalio goes to China, he meets with Mr. Wang. The two men, Mr. Dalio writes, discuss subjects as varied as artificial intelligence and the implications of Julius Caesar\u2019s rise to power. Mr. Dalio, who refers to Mr. Wang as one of his heroes, said that his advice had helped in the planning for Bridgewater\u2019s future.\u201cEvery time I speak with Mr. Wang, I feel I get closer to cracking the unifying code that unlocks the laws of the universe,\u201d Mr. Dalio writes. Such interactions, were \u201cthrilling to me.\u201dSusan Beachy and Cao Li contributed to researchAdvertisement"}

Rick DeVos, a tech entrepreneur, is chairman of ArtPrize\u2019s board, and family members donate generously and sit on the boards of many institutions that are among the 175 ArtPrize showplaces.Mr. DeVos was unavailable to comment, an ArtPrize publicist said. Nobody from the Dick & Betsy DeVos Family Foundation responded to a request for comment, and Ms. DeVos did not answer an inquiry sent to the Education Department.ArtPrize officials say the DeVos family\u2019s influence over the contest is minimal. The DeVos Place Convention Center is a major ArtPrize venue, but its assistant general manager, Eddie Tadlock, said the family\u2019s input over what pieces he hosts is \u201czero, zippo, nothing.\u201d The DeVoses tour ArtPrize entries there every year, Mr. Tadlock said, and that has not prevented him from showing art with progressive political intentions.\u201cPeople try to pin ideologies onto ArtPrize but it\u2019s really about open access to public space and free expression,\u201d said Mr. Buist, who helped Mr. DeVos start ArtPrize. \u201cThere\u2019s this persistent myth that anyone involved is in ideological lock step with one another. That\u2019s completely untrue.\u201d\u201cIt was her secretary of education nomination that got me thinking about making this piece,\u201d Ms. Ellis said. \u201cHer family\u2019s done a lot for the community, but in terms of public education, she\u2019s done a lot more harm than good.\u201dMs. Moore said that her work comments on the system that Ms. DeVos upholds, which \u201calso upholds white supremacy.\u201dThe perennial criticism ArtPrize weathers is about its unusual concept \u2014 that any business in downtown Grand Rapids can declare itself a venue and artists in any medium can pay $50 to show their work if a venue operator agrees to host it. As a result, exhibition spaces this year include an auto body shop, a bridal store and the local Y.M.C.A.Most artists who participate recognize that the event, which brought an estimated $28 million in business to Grand Rapids in 2016, is, as Mr. Reed put it, \u201can economic development piece with an artsy facade.\u201d Still, Mr. Reed and others say the kitschy entries and the American Idol-style voting process have their own value.\u201cA city that gives itself over to art for three weeks is something to be celebrated,\u201d Ms. Berman, the St.-Louis-based artist, said. \u201cPeople will find the pieces that speak to them.

{"Headline": "Essex College Administrator Is Placed on Leave Amid Investigation", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Essex County College administrator accused of causing problems at the troubled two-year school was placed on paid administrative leave on Tuesday by the trustees while an investigation is conducted into allegations of financial abuse.Mr. Munroe, president since June 1, and the college\u2019s legal counsel, Joyce Toliver, said that the law firm Schwartz Simon Edelstein and Celso would focus only on the allegations against Ms. Harley.Bibi Taylor, president of the board of trustees, declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of personnel and litigation matters.Mr. Munroe said Ms. Harley\u2019s leave would allow the school to address the issues pointed out by Middle States, which will send four evaluators to the campus in October. A loss of accreditation, though rare, would mean the college\u2019s degrees are worthless.Ms. Harley has also been named in multiple wrongful termination and whistle blower lawsuits. She has admitted to stopping the selection of a chief financial officer for the school, which would have addressed some of the criticisms of the Middle States, because she said the candidate was not qualified.Ms. Harley said she believes she will be cleared.\u201cThe most important thing I want is the success of the college,\u201d she said.Ms. Harley, who has been at the school for five years, was the Essex County administrator under the county executive, Joseph D. DiVincenzo Jr., a Democrat, who appoints the majority of the college\u2019s board trustees. Mr. DiVincenzo recommended Ms. Harley for the college post and had previously backed her bids to lead the school.Last week he said he believed that Ms. Harley, whom he called a \u201cgood friend,\u201d should move on.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. DiVincenzo expressed support for Mr. Munroe and the board of trustees and said he has \u201cconfidence they can move Essex County College forward.\u201dIn the meantime, Mr. Munroe said he is taking steps to help the college recover. He said the trustees approved the hiring of a deputy chief financial officer and a chief compliance officer. He also said the U.S. Department of Education has approved a corrective action plan.Acceptance of the plan means that the college will not have restrictions placed on its ability to create new programs or on the ability of its students to receive federal aid. More than 60 percent of students rely on federal assistance to attend the college, said Mr. Munroe.\u201cThis is a huge accomplishment in a short period of time in that we were able to avert significant sanctions,\u201d Mr. Munroe said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obamacare Repeal, Thought Dead in July, May Be Revived in Senate", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act sprang back to life on Monday as Senate Republicans pushed for a showdown vote on new legislation that would do away with many of the health law\u2019s requirements and bundle its funding into giant block grants to the states.The Republican leaders of the latest repeal effort, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said their effort \u2014 considered all but impossible earlier this month \u2014 was gaining momentum. The seven-year drive to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement appeared to collapse in July when it fell one vote short in the Senate.And the same three Republicans who opposed it then \u2014 John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 have yet to commit to voting for the latest repeal bill.Under the Graham-Cassidy bill, millions could lose coverage, Medicaid would face cuts comparable to those in earlier repeal bills, and insurers in some states could charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. But only days remain before the expiration of special parliamentary language that protects repeal legislation from a filibuster in the Senate, and pressure is mounting for another vote.\u201cI think the odds have improved,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership. \u201cI just told Bill Cassidy he\u2019s kind of the grave robber. This thing was six feet under, and I think he\u2019s revived it.\u201dIt is still too early for Republican leaders to celebrate. Mr. McCain said he would pay attention to the views of his governor, but he also insisted that Republicans should hold hearings and consider amendments, rather than ramming the bill through the Senate.Later Monday, the Senate Finance Committee announced it would hold a hearing on the Graham-Cassidy bill early next week. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee also plans a hearing.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in only having an up-or-down vote on what\u2019s one-fifth of the gross national product,\u201d Mr. McCain said.Ms. Collins was similarly skeptical.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about what the effect would be on coverage; on Medicaid spending in my state; on the fundamental changes in Medicaid that would be made without the Senate holding a single hearing to evaluate them; and also on what the effect would be on premiums, particularly for older Americans between 50 and 64,\u201d she said.In the latest fight, unlike the July showdown, repeal advocates must overcome one \u201cno\u201d vote from the right: Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who said the new bill would leave too much of the Affordable Care Act in place.A comparison of the latest bill released by Senate Republicans with the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThis bill keeps 90 percent of the spending of Obamacare and reshuffles it,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Paul said on Monday. \u201cReally, when you look at how it reshuffles it, it does it just to take money from the Democrat states and give it to Republican states.\u2019\u2019Ms. Murkowski said she was still considering her vote.If the Senate does not vote by the end of next week, it will become nearly impossible to repeal the health law because the drive to kill the Affordable Care Act will lose the procedural protections that allow it to pass the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes that would otherwise be needed.Democrats sounded the alarm Monday, and the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, geared up for an all-out effort to block the Graham-Cassidy bill, which has support from President Trump.\u201cAfter a few weeks of lying dormant, Trumpcare is back, and its meaner than ever,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Schumer said, adding: \u201cThis is so outrageous and so harmful that we\u2019re going to look at every possible way to slow the bill down.\u2019\u2019Democrats said the Senate should not vote on the bill before receiving a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. The budget office said it was aiming to provide a preliminary fiscal analysis by early next week, but would not have estimates of the bill\u2019s effects on insurance coverage and premiums \u201cfor at least several weeks.\u201dMr. Schumer said it would be much better for Congress to advance a bipartisan bill being drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. That bill would provide money to insurers to compensate them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Without those payments, insurers say, they will sharply increase premiums or withdraw from additional markets next year.The House passed an Affordable Care Act repeal in early May, by a vote of 217-213. But the movement appeared to reach a dead end in July, when multiple versions of repeal legislation failed to gain even a simple majority in the Senate.Refusing to accept defeat, Mr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy took another tack. The Graham-Cassidy bill has two major elements, one that is new and one that was found in many other Republican repeal bills this year.The new element is a block grant. Mr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy would give each state a fixed amount of federal money for health care and health insurance each year from 2020 to 2026. The allotments total $1.2 trillion over the seven years. That is slightly less than what the federal government is expected to spend under the Affordable Care Act on the expansion of Medicaid, on premium tax credits and on the \u201ccost-sharing reduction\u201d payments to insurers on behalf of low-income consumers.States would have sweeping new discretion over how to use the money, and they could receive federal block grant funds without putting up state money.In addition, the Graham-Cassidy bill would make deep cuts in Medicaid. It would end the expansion of eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to 13 million people. And it would put the entire program, which serves more than 70 million people, on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists. States would receive a per-beneficiary allotment of federal money.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 15 million fewer people would have Medicaid as a result of similar proposals in other Republican bills.Mr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy would distribute federal block grant funds to the states using a complex formula that, like any such formula, creates winners and losers. It is difficult for any state to be sure how much it would receive. The authors of the bill say they intend to reduce expected federal payments to high-cost states like Massachusetts and increase federal payments to states that have not expanded Medicaid.\u201cRight now, 37 percent of the revenue from the Affordable Care Act goes to Americans in four states\u201d \u2014 California, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland, Mr. Cassidy said. \u201cThat is frankly not fair.\u201dMr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy said that their bill would also enhance the ability of states to waive \u201cObamacare regulations.\u201d Insurers would still have to offer insurance to anyone who applied, but states could obtain federal waivers allowing insurers to charge higher premiums to sick people or to omit some of the benefits they are now required to provide, like maternity care, mental health care or treatment for drug addiction.Coverage, while theoretically available, could become unaffordable for some people with costly conditions like cancer or AIDS, health policy experts say. \u201cLess-healthy people would face extremely high premiums\u201d in states that obtained waivers involving both benefits and premiums, the Congressional Budget Office said in analyzing a similar provision of the bill passed by the House.Mr. Cassidy played down that concern. Under the Graham-Cassidy bill, he noted, a state seeking a waiver would have to describe how it intends to \u201cmaintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\u201dBut critics have taken notice. Sixteen groups representing patients and heath care providers came out Monday in opposition to the bill. Among those who issued a joint statement opposing it were the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, the March of Dimes and the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society.\u201cMuch of the proposal just repackages the problematic provisions of the Better Care Reconciliation Act,\u201d which the Senate rejected in July, the groups said.The Graham-Cassidy bill would eliminate the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance and for larger employers to offer it to employees. Like prior Republican bills, it would also cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood for a year \u2014 a provision opposed by Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski.The outlook for the Senate bill in the House is unclear. Some Republicans from states that lose money under the block grant could balk. But House Republicans would be under immense pressure to support the bill and fulfill their longtime promise to dismantle the law, which was passed seven years ago.Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Resegregation of Jefferson County", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "The Education IssueWhat one Alabama town\u2019s attempt to secede from its school district tells us about the fragile progress of racial integration in America.Supported byTo outsiders, these names are meaningless, but local residents knew exactly what was being said. In Jefferson County, like in any other racially mixed metropolitan area in the country, the names of towns and neighborhoods can serve as code, a way of referencing race without being explicit. Homewood, Hoover, Vestavia Hills and Trussville and their schools were heavily white. Center Point, Pleasant Grove and the others listed next to the girl all had large black populations \u2014 some had shifted from majority white to majority black.In Alabama, any town of more than 5,000 residents can vote to form its own school system, and over the years, members of Focus watched covetously as the neighboring white communities did just that. Gardendale, too, had considered secession for two decades but was deterred when feasibility studies showed that the town of nearly 14,000 could not support an independent school system, partly because the tax base could not generate enough revenue to replace its old and sagging high school. Gardendale lobbied Jefferson County to build a new multimillion-dollar high school, which opened in 2010, within the town\u2019s limits. In this community of modest homes and nondescript strip malls, Gardendale High, with its Grecian pillars and soaring, windowed foyer, spoke to the community\u2019s grander aspirations.The implication was clear. Center Point, which did not secede, has undergone a significant demographic shift as white residents fled to the districts that did. In 1970, only 30 black people lived among Center Point\u2019s nearly 16,000 residents and 12 black children went to Center Point Elementary. Today, the town is 63 percent black and its schools are 90 percent black.The town of Gardendale is 88 percent white, but its schools are now 25 percent black, in part because students bused in from North Smithfield, a working-class black community a few miles away, are zoned to schools located in Gardendale. Gardendale\u2019s secession would not eliminate black students from their schools, but by ensuring only students who lived in Gardendale could attend in the new district, it would significantly decrease their numbers.After lobbying by Focus, in 2013, Gardendale\u2019s all-white City Council voted to create a separate school system. A few months later in November, a measure to implement a property tax to fund the new school system passed with 58 percent of the vote. The City Council then appointed an all-white school board and hired its own superintendent.But there was just one thing: Jefferson County is one of a few hundred school systems in the country still bound by decades-old school desegregation court orders that came in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. Gardendale could not leave the district without the approval of the federal court in Birmingham. That court had been friendly to towns trying to secede, and the new school board apparently considered the desegregation order so inconsequential that it did not inform its new superintendent that it existed. So in February 2015, the Gardendale school board sent its lawyer to the federal court for what Gardendale secession supporters assumed would be a pro forma request to separate from the county schools. They were wrong.In light of the ruling, the Legal Defense Fund decided to challenge Lynne\u2019s order. They hired a recent law-school graduate named U.W. Clemon to help represent them. For Clemon, the case was deeply personal. He was a young black man born just a few miles west of Birmingham to a family of Mississippi sharecroppers who had migrated over so his father could trade the grueling work of picking cotton for the grueling work of feeding bricks into the kiln for United States Steel. The state of Mississippi didn\u2019t provide education for black children, and so his illiterate father never attended school; his mother\u2019s schooling at a black church ended after third grade. Clemon himself started his education at the Dolemite Colored School, a wood-frame structure with no indoor plumbing that was inferior in every way to the gleaming, modern school the white students in town attended. And though Clemon was only 11 in 1954 when the Supreme Court found segregated schools for black children unconstitutional, he never attended school with a white child.Despite graduating from all-black Miles College as the class valedictorian in 1965, the year the Stout lawsuit was filed, Clemon could not go to the state\u2019s only law school at the University of Alabama. That\u2019s because the university refused, still, to admit black students. To comply with a Supreme Court decision that forced states to provide equal access to graduate and professional schools for black residents, Alabama paid for students like Clemon to attend school out of state. He went to Columbia University in New York, a school far more prestigious and expensive than the University of Alabama. For the state, it was a calculated move. From the time when Alabama and other Southern states barred enslaved people from learning to read, there was an understanding that education led to resistance. In paying for its brightest black students to seek further education outside the state, Alabama bet that once those students lived away from Southern apartheid, they would never return. This calculation, however, did not account for people like Clemon, who graduated from law school and then immediately returned to Alabama to work to secure for thousands of Jefferson County\u2019s black children the constitutional rights that he had been denied.In the fall of 1968, Clemon stood in the courtroom of Judge Lynne, a segregationist known for issuing the dissent in the ruling to integrate Montgomery\u2019s buses following the boycott. Wearing a cheap dark suit he purchased at an army surplus store, Clemon stood before Lynne, a good old boy from Decatur, and argued that the judge\u2019s freedom-of-choice school-desegregation order no longer passed constitutional muster and he needed to alter it to force actual integration in the Jefferson County school district.Or, in Alabama, they could leave. In reaction to the Brown ruling, Alabama passed its school-secession law, and in 1959 Mountain Brook, an all-white, wealthy Birmingham suburb, withdrew from the Jefferson County school district. But the feared mandated desegregation did not occur, and so the other white towns stayed put until Clemon and the Legal Defense Fund secured the rezoning of the county\u2019s schools by court order in 1969. Pleasant Grove, a white, working-class town immediately moved to set up its own school district. The mostly-white towns of Homewood, Midfield and Vestavia Hills followed suit. Their strategy was simple: There could be no forced integration if there were no black children in the school system to integrate with.After decades of violent and brutal resistance, white Southerners largely acquiesced to the desegregation of other public places, of parks, restaurants, city buses and libraries. Contact in those spaces tended to be superficial, and if white people did not want to be around black people, they could simply avoid them. Schools were different. Nearly every American child, then and now, attended a public school. Schools were intimate. For hours each day, students sat next to one another, learned with one another, influenced one another. And also, most frightening, fell in love with one another. In the spring of 1954, as the Supreme Court was deliberating over the Brown case, President Dwight Eisenhower invited Chief Justice Earl Warren to dinner, where he attempted to explain that white Southerners \u201care not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negro.\u201d But even more than that, Americans saw schools as the primary drivers of opportunity and success, and white Americans had no desire to share access to the best schools and educational resources for which they\u2019d always held the monopoly.So instead of a quick hearing, Gardendale found itself taking part in what would be a five-day trial. On a crisp Alabama day in December 2016, the black witnesses filed into Birmingham\u2019s Hugo L. Black federal courthouse, named for the former Klansman who became a surprisingly liberal Supreme Court justice, and took seats on the benches behind the plaintiff\u2019s table. They sought, still, the fulfillment of the constitutional rights secured for black children of the county more than 60 years ago. On the defense\u2019s side, the secession supporters filed into their seats. Almost entirely white, they felt, as Gardendale\u2019s lawyers argued in their court filings, that \u201cthings have changed\u201d and that federal courts \u201cwere tired of school-desegregation litigation\u201d and so \u201ccourts must open their eyes to the conditions of the present.\u201d The desegregation order, they believed, had outlived its usefulness and was a relic from another time with no place in a modern world where black and white had the same rights before the law.The center aisle of the courtroom served as a physical divider between those in favor of the secession and those who were against it but also a metaphor for a much more impenetrable divide: On one side sat those who sought to be free of a past they do not want to remember; on the other sat those bound to a past they can never forget.If any one of them needed a reminder of how far this country had traveled toward living up to its creed, and how far it had still to go, they could look just a few feet ahead to the plaintiff\u2019s table. There U.W. Clemon sat, once again, to argue in the continuation of the very first school-desegregation case he worked on.It had been almost five decades since Clemon first stood in front of Lynne. His hair has thinned and turned white; his stride, slower. He has traded the army-surplus suits for finer Brooks Brothers threads. In a city once so hostile to black civil rights that it earned the nickname Bombingham, two streets now bear his name. When Clemon first entered the courtroom as a young lawyer, all the judges were white, but in 2008 he retired as the first black federal judge in the history of the state \u2014 turning in his resignation precisely two hours after the inauguration of the nation\u2019s first black president.It\u2019s something we Americans like to call coming full circle. But a circle returns to its beginning, and so, as is almost always the case when it comes to race in America, the victories would not be complete, nor would they be permanent. Nowhere is this more true than when it comes to schools.Clemon, who watched with growing despair as the integration efforts in the Jefferson County school district stalled and then eroded through the years, believed that Gardendale\u2019s attempt to break off mattered not just for Jefferson County but for the nation, where schools are resegregating at an alarming pace. Nationally, black children are more segregated today than they were a half century ago, in part because mostly-white well-off communities are separating themselves from diverse and poorer school systems.Gardendale\u2019s lawyers opened the trial, arguing first that Gardendale was not bound by the desegregation order at all because Jefferson County\u2019s schools had not been segregated for decades and so the order no longer mattered. But if the court did decide Gardendale was bound by the order, they said, its separation plan, which would allow them to take over the two elementary schools, the middle school and the high school located in Gardendale, would not hurt Jefferson County\u2019s desegregation efforts and so should be allowed.\u201cThere will be no credible evidence in this trial of racial animus motivating the Gardendale Board of Education,\u201d Aaron McLeod, a Gardendale lawyer, told the court. \u201cWhat the evidence instead will show is that the citizens of Gardendale cared so much about the education of their children that they raised their own taxes to enable their city to operate the schools their kids attend, and that is all that Gardendale is asking the court for today, to be allowed to operate its own school system for the sake of their children\u2019s education.\u201dGardendale called to the stand organizers of the effort. Chris Lucas, who works in banking and now sits on the Gardendale school board, moved to Gardendale after he had his first child because he could not afford the wealthier Birmingham suburbs that had already formed their own school systems. He said when he compared Jefferson County\u2019s schools with Mountain Brook and some of the state\u2019s other high-achieving school systems, the schools his children would go to just weren\u2019t up to par. Lucas said he had always figured he and his wife would move when their children became school-age. But then, he started having conversations with Salters, his friend, and others about how they did not want to leave and maybe they should do what those other communities had done.\u201cAt the end of the day, we want to provide a better education for the children so that they are prepared to go through life,\u201d he said from the witness stand. \u201cThere is no intention to harm any child,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe have a community that decided to pull itself up and provide a better education for its children. I\u2019m just flabbergasted that somebody would say, \u2018How dare you.\u2019 It blows my mind, frankly.\u201d (Lucas, Salters and other secession activists, along with all the Gardendale school-board members, the superintendent and all the City Council members, declined to be interviewed for this article.)Those who wanted to break off had some legitimate complaints about their schools \u2014 in some cases, children attended classes in trailers because of overcrowding, roofs sometimes leaked, textbooks could be in short supply and technology was too often outdated and broken. But the organizers also acknowledged in court testimony that they were satisfied with their children\u2019s teachers and that they had never complained to the district about conditions and were, in fact, pretty happy with how their children were performing. In court transcripts of the trial, it is clear that several years after the secession effort began, Lucas and others struggled to come up with specific ways that forming their own school system would improve education for their community. \u201cLocal control is also, I think, very important,\u201d Lucas said, echoing what other witnesses had said. \u201cAnd I also think that it\u2019s a known fact, whether you look in Jefferson County or whether you look across the state of Alabama or you look across the nation, that the better-performing public-school systems are city-based systems and they\u2019re smaller.\u201dBut there is no evidence that smaller school districts are better. In fact, they often have fewer resources because, as EdBuild\u2019s study shows, breakaway systems rack up significantly higher administrative costs, up to 60 percent more per pupil than larger systems. In addition, if Gardendale activists were focused only on the quality of the education, they would be concerned that Gardendale students who now have access to one of the best schools in the nation, an International Baccalaureate school in a nearby town, would have to pay out-of-district tuition to attend the school, if Gardendale broke off.Clemon pointed out that Lucas\u2019s statement simply did not match the facts. He asked Lucas if he knew that there were plenty of small city districts that performed poorly. \u201cWould that change your opinion?\u201d Clemon asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas responded. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t.\u201dHe and his wife had to battle against discrimination their entire lives, and they watched as many of the gains they fought for have eroded. They knew that behind Birmingham\u2019s new skyscrapers and fancy restaurants that served polenta instead of grits, the Old South still lurked. Racism had gone underground but not away. Reeves marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on Bloody Sunday in 1965 to achieve voting rights, only to watch decades later as the Supreme Court used a case from his home state to strike down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which the march had helped secure. As school systems across the South and the nation have resegregated, the Reeveses understood that the federal court order from 1971 was the only reason their own children, and now their grandchild, were able to attend integrated schools.Rickey Reeves anxiously waited for Clemon and the other lawyers representing the plaintiffs to make their case. Their argument was simple. Clemon had helped establish a precedent that secessions were not permissible if they undermined court-ordered desegregation. Judges had looked the other way and allowed other towns to leave. But if Gardendale seceded, it would take with it a substantial number of the white students left in the Jefferson County school district, and most likely more, if it annexed additional white communities as others had done. The fewer white children who remained in the system, the harder desegregation would become. The lawyers presented expert witnesses who explained how, if Gardendale left, too, Jefferson County would become even more black and how students who had once been assigned to Gardendale\u2019s integrated schools would, as a result of the separation, be rezoned to heavily segregated ones.The Legal Defense Fund also argued that it was racism, not the desire for local control, that was behind the secession effort. They pointed to a Facebook page that Focus activists had created. The very first post stated that forming their own school system would give Gardendale \u201cbetter control over the geographic composition of the student body.\u201d In another post, an organizer noted that the Jefferson County school district was busing children into \u201cour schools ... from as far away as Center Point\u201d and that \u201ca look around at our community sporting events, our churches are great snapshots of our community. A look into our schools, and you\u2019ll see something totally different.\u201d In another post, an organizer wrote that \u201cnonresident students are increasing at a [sic] alarming rate in our schools. Those students do not contribute financially. They consume the resources of our schools, our teachers and our resident students, then go home.\u201dSecession supporters had argued that their tax dollars should go to educate their own children instead of children who lived outside their community, that their shared responsibility stretched no further than the arbitrary borders of their town, even though for the vast history of the state, black taxpayers paid for white schools that their own children could not attend. The activists did not acknowledge that the public schools in Gardendale do not belong to Gardendale. They are paid for by the tax dollars of the entire county, including the parents of black children bused in. Moreover, students from neighboring Mount Olive also attended Gardendale schools, but Gardendale residents voiced no concerns about these students leaching resources or looking different from the community that showed up at Gardendale\u2019s sporting and church events. Instead, the conversations among Gardendale activists revolved around whether the town should annex Mount Olive so that its children would remain in the system. Mount Olive is 98 percent white.The lawyers for the black children of Jefferson County laid out a chronology that showed that when Gardendale secession advocates started working on secession, they assumed that breaking off would allow them to exclude from their schools all black children from outside Gardendale, including the children in North Smithfield. But after Gardendale\u2019s lawyers first announced their plan to the court in February 2015, the advocates discovered that Judge Pointer\u2019s 1971 desegregation order required all splinter districts to maintain a certain percentage of black students and that there were not enough black children in Gardendale\u2019s city limits to comply. The new district would have to include North Smithfield after all. The plaintiffs\u2019s lawyers presented emails and Facebook posts written by Gardendale residents saying they would never have supported secession if they knew that their new school district, paid for by taxing themselves, would still include the students who did not live in Gardendale.When it was Reeves\u2019s turn to testify, he walked from the gallery to the witness stand, raised his right hand, spelled his name for the court reporter, then looked at Clemon. The two men were of the same generation and had seen many of the same things. Law school had been Clemon\u2019s escape from segregation. Reeves chose the armed services.In a Black Belt accent clipped by the precision of the military, he talked about serving in the Air Force in Vietnam and then joining the National Guard, where he retired as a senior master sergeant after 24 years. He\u2019d worked as a telephone technician and in his free time tried to build up the North Smithfield community that some Gardendale residents had disparaged \u2014 joining its civic league, helping it get a charter and a fire district.Reeves spent his whole life serving his country and his community, and now, like Clemon, he found himself in his twilight years, doing it again. This fight was not for his family. \u201cMy duty, as I see it,\u201d he told the court, \u201cis to represent the blacks in Jefferson County.\u201d The secession, he believed, would be an injustice in a legacy of injustices.\u201cI was raised up in a segregated system, and I knew what could happen,\u201d Reeves told me in July, as we sat in his R.V. outside the second home he was renovating in his hometown Gadsden. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the same education they got, and I didn\u2019t want to see that happen again. I didn\u2019t want these children, any of our children, going through what we went through.\u201dReeves said he watched as other white communities left the Jefferson County school district, and now the secession had come to his doorstep with Gardendale\u2019s effort to exclude his community\u2019s children from its schools. \u201cI understand you are just trying to make your community better, but why hurt me to make yours better?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could just see it all reverting back. We have to draw a line in the sand and stop it. Somehow.\u201dDuring the second day of the trial Stephen Rowe, one of Gardendale\u2019s lawyers, called Sharon Porterfield Miller to the stand. \u201cIt\u2019s Dr. Miller, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rowe asked the petite, well-dressed woman in her 60s. The gallery peered on with interest. Miller has a doctorate in educational leadership, lives in Gardendale and supported Gardendale\u2019s effort to break away because she thought that smaller systems were generally better and may improve test scores. But most important for the defense, she is black.Court transcripts show Rowe expertly led her through her testimony. She moved to Gardendale 16 years ago because it was a quiet and older community. \u201cHave you and your husband enjoyed being residents of Gardendale?\u201d the lawyer asked.\u201cYes, we do.\u201dThen it was Clemon\u2019s turn to cross-examine Miller. Standing, he looked at her and gave her a warm smile. Clemon knew the witness \u2014 each Sunday they sat near each other during services at Sixth Avenue Baptist Church in Birmingham. His questions highlighted her experience with desegregation as one of the three black students allowed into a white high school in Aliceville, Ala. He pulled her through her biography, relaxing her: She\u2019d been a teacher and a principal in Jefferson County, earned her Ph.D. and serves as a chairwoman of the education department at his alma mater, Miles College.Then, casually, he turned to the fact that she had applied to sit on the Gardendale school board but had not been selected.\u201cDo you think you are qualified to be a member of the Gardendale Board of Education?\u201d he asked her.\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u201cHighly qualified?\u201d he asked.\u201cThe answer to your question is yes.\u201dWhat Clemon and everyone in the courtroom knew very well was that the all-white City Council had appointed an all-white school board. Miller told me later that when Gardendale announced the new board, she was dismayed to learn that only one of its members had any experience in K-12 education \u2014 a teacher who had worked directly under Miller during her tenure as a principal.Clemon asked Miller if she\u2019d felt disappointed when she was not chosen.\u201cYes, I was,\u201d she answered. \u201cI was.\u201d\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think it had anything to do with your race?\u201d Clemon asked.\u201dWell, I can\u2019t say that.\u201d she replied. \u201cYour question was, \u2018Was I disappointed.\u2019 Yes, I was really disappointed.\u201dClemon rephrased his question: \u201cLet me put it another way. Do you know of any reason which would justify your not being chosen other than your race?\u201dOne of Gardendale\u2019s lawyers objected. But instead of ruling on the objection, Judge Haikala restated the question directly to the witness.\u201cDo I feel race was part of the consideration?\u201d Miller asked.\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the judge responded.\u201cYes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI do.\u201dClemon sat back down. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201dGardendale then called the newly appointed superintendent, Patrick Martin, to testify. Gardendale had hired him away from a small, nearly all-white school system in rural Illinois. Under questioning from a Department of Justice lawyer, Martin said that he had not read the school desegregation order until a few months earlier, and he later acknowledged that he declined to meet with concerned black parents from North Smithfield. Eventually, Martin admitted a fact that surprised many in the courtroom: In nearly two decades as an educator, Martin had never hired a single black person for any position, nor worked with a single black teacher.It was late in a day that had felt very long, and everyone wanted to go home. Clemon and Lin-Luse recall Haikala\u2019s calling for a break. When Haikala returned to the bench, she turned to Martin, the superintendent, and asked a simple question:\u201cHave you read the Brown v. Board of Education decision from 1954?\u201dAt Haikala\u2019s words, Clemon looked up sharply.\u201cI\u2019ve read about the decision, yes, your honor,\u201d Martin answered.\u201cHave you read it?\u201d the judge asked.Martin said he hadn\u2019t read the entire ruling. Haikala handed him a copy. \u201cWhat have you read about it?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a test. I\u2019m curious to know what your understanding is.\u201dIf Gardendale won, Martin would oversee a school system located in the very cradle of the Confederacy, one that is still under a school-desegregation order. Martin fumbled a bit, struggling to describe what is considered by many the most important Supreme Court ruling of the 20th century, the ruling at the center of why they were all gathered in the courtroom that day. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a very good job of showing I was a history teacher, am I, your honor?\u201d Martin said. \u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cI told you it is not meant to be a test,\u201d Haikala replied. She then proceeded to go through the ruling. She voiced concern about the black students that Gardendale residents had talked so openly of excluding, emphasizing how the justices in Brown struck down segregation in large part because it stigmatized and demeaned black children.Then she read out loud part of the Brown opinion that focused on how segregation made black children feel inferior: \u201cSegregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children,\u201d she read. \u201cThe impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law. For the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn.\u201dWithout warning, tears started to stream down Clemon\u2019s face. \u201cIt was one of the most emotional moments of my life,\u201d he told me months later from the dining-room table of his Birmingham home. \u201cShe wanted to impress upon the superintendent the serious ramifications of Brown. I had never in my lifetime seen a judge read Brown in court, and I am more than threescore and 10.\u201d He added, \u201cI never expect to see it again.\u201dStill, Clemon and the other lawyers representing the black children of Jefferson County felt the trial went exceptionally well. After it was over, Clemon went home, culled from the transcript the passage where Haikala read the Brown decision to the superintendent and emailed it to colleagues all over the country, with a note: Can you believe this?In painstaking detail, Haikala laid out the 62-year history of school-desegregation case law and then each and every important fact of the current case. Within the first five paragraphs, she dismissed Gardendale\u2019s assertion that these court orders were inconsequential after all these years and also laid out the linchpin of her ruling. \u201cThe Court\u2019s desegregation order is designed to remedy the injury that institutionalized racial segregation causes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Brown is simple and unaffected by the passage of time: When black public-school students are treated as if they are inferior to white students, and that treatment is institutionalized by state or municipal action, the resulting stigma unconstitutionally assails the integrity of black students. That racial stigma is intolerable under the 14th Amendment.\u201d She added, \u201cThat was true in 1954, and it is true today.\u201dHaikala pointed out how the organizers of the Gardendale secession movement gave \u201cevasive responses\u201d about why they wanted to form their own system but that they wanted \u201cgeneral improvements of education.\u201d None had ever contacted the Jefferson County school district about their complaints, and she noted that one organizer said that his own children were doing well. The school-board president, she wrote, acknowledged that he was not even involved in his children\u2019s schools.She wrote about the testimony of one North Smithfield parent who said it felt bad that Gardendale wanted to exclude children from her community, until they found out that they had to include them, if they wanted to secede, and that she feared North Smithfield children would be scrutinized and treated like outsiders in the new system. Then Haikala wrote that if Gardendale splintered off, it would hurt the desegregation of the larger district, just as other secessions had. That alone, because of the precedent Clemon helped set in the Stout case decades earlier, was enough to put an end to the secession effort.Then on Page 138 of her opinion, Haikala went further than anyone expected. The Gardendale school board had argued that the dispute over the secession \u201cis not about segregation. ... Nor is this dispute about racism.\u201d With one sentence, she eviscerated that assertion: \u201cThe Court finds that race was a motivating factor in Gardendale\u2019s decision to separate from the Jefferson County public school system.\u201dShe went on: \u201cMore specifically, a desire to control the racial demographics of the four public schools in the City of Gardendale and the racial demographics of the city itself motivated the grass-roots effort to separate and eliminate from the Gardendale school zone black students whom Jefferson County transports to Gardendale schools under the terms of the desegregation order.\u201dClemon paused over those words. These days, he knew, you have about as a good a chance of winning the lottery as getting a federal judge to make a new finding of intentional discrimination in school cases. \u201cI was deeply impressed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe compelling evidence of racism was there, but she could have just stuck with the other issue.\u201dBut then, on Page 181 of the 190-page order, Clemon read these words: \u201cGiven these findings, the Court would be within its discretion if it were simply to deny Gardendale\u2019s motion to separate. Were it not for a number of practical considerations, the Court would do just that.\u201dHe sped through the remaining pages. Haikala had, despite her finding of intentional discrimination, decided to give Gardendale ownership over the county\u2019s two elementary schools located in Gardendale for the coming school year. In order to do so, she required the appointment of a black school-board member and for Gardendale to work with the plaintiffs and the Justice Department to come up with a desegregation plan to govern the new district. Gardendale would also either have to relinquish the high school that Jefferson County residents had paid for and that served students from several other communities or repay the county $33 million for the school. After doing that and then operating the two schools \u201cin good faith\u201d for three years, Haikala said she would reconsider their motion for a full separation.When Reeves read the ruling, he felt shock and then confusion. How could the judge find that Gardendale\u2019s residents had been motivated by racism and still allow them to create a separate school system? \u201cI felt all along she was going to rule against them, and then in the end, she said we\u2019re going to give them a chance,\u201d he told me, slightly shaking his head. \u201cI think she was trying to please everyone. I was let down.\u201dLast, and most critical, she wrote that the Jefferson County school district could very well make enough progress toward desegregation in the next few years to be released from its court order because the Supreme Court has determined that school districts have to prove to a court only that they have integrated \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d Once that was the case, Haikala worried, then Gardendale would be free to break off without the oversight of the court.Haikala was surely aware of this when she wrote: \u201cHistory teaches that communities, left to their own devices, resegregate fairly quickly. ... In doing the complicated work of dissolving a desegregation order, a court must ensure that the dying embers of de jure segregation aren\u2019t once again fanned into flames.\u201dHaikala understood that if she allowed Gardendale to create its own district, she could place the town under its own separate desegregation order and monitor the school system for a longer period of time.When the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Brown, which laid the foundation for the destruction of legal segregation not just in schools but in every other aspect of American life, it considered segregation a vestige of slavery. There is this beautiful phrasing taken up by the court in a 1968 school-desegregation opinion that says all these vestiges of slavery had to be eliminated \u201croot and branch.\u201d The history of school desegregation has shown that getting rid of the branches is the easier part. You can chop a tree down to the stump, but if the roots run deep enough, it will grow again. Clemon knows this better than most. The legal barriers fell and for a fleeting moment, during the prime of his life, the nation seemed poised to right its wrongs. His own children never knew the degradation of segregation. But too many of the grandchildren of Brown have known nothing but.What the Gardendale case demonstrates with unusual clarity is that changes in the law have not changed the hearts of many white Americans. As the historian Bagley wrote, when it comes to school segregation, \u201cthere would be no moral awakening.\u201d\u201cI never envisioned that I would be fighting in 2017 essentially the same battle that I thought I won in 1971,\u201d Clemon, who can recite the Stout case number from memory, told me. \u201cBut the battle is just not over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ondine Chavoya, a Williams College professor and a curator of \u201cAxis Mundo,\u201d said that for the title \u201cwe wanted to go with the more familiar, recognizable term that could help with online searching.\u201dScholars say that Latinx, the broader and more popular of the new terms, began to appear as early as 2004 in LGBTQ communities online but did not really take off until two or three years ago. This year Google Scholar shows about a thousand academic articles using the term, twice the number from 2016.But as the popularity of the words grows, so does the debate over their value. Some critics reject Latinx and Chicanx for being foreign to the Spanish language, off-putting to the public or simply unnecessary.\u201cAs a writer, I feel like these words are so clumsy and artificial. The \u2018x\u2019 looks like a mathematical annotation. I feel like language should be more organic,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201dThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bewildered by That Rarest of Sightings in Washington: Bipartisanship", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Bipartisanship can be disorienting.That\u2019s why Washington has seemed so perplexed over the past 10 days. An unexpected outbreak of cooperation between President Trump and the two top congressional Democrats has upended the established order and left lawmakers grasping to divine the significance, especially Republicans who saw themselves as a strong ruling majority.\u201cYou\u2019ve got an unconventional president who is not limited to what the conventions of political behavior are among office holders,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. \u201cHe is shaking things up.\u201dFor much of the preceding two presidencies and the beginning of this one, the parties have largely gone their separate ways, typically finding compromise only in emergencies and the need to renew popular expiring legislation. Common ground has been very uncommon.Now Mr. Trump, frustrated by the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to deliver him the victories he so craves, has decided to shop elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m a Republican through and through,\u201d the president told reporters as he returned from Florida aboard Air Force One, \u201cbut I\u2019m also finding that sometimes to get things through, it\u2019s not working that way.\u201dSome Republicans seemed to be left dazed by the fact that Mr. Trump was willing to reach a general agreement with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, her Senate counterpart, on allowing undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to remain, while not receiving a commitment for a border wall in exchange.Representative Gary Palmer, Republican of Alabama, spoke for many when he expressed incredulity that Mr. Trump had reached a deal that compromised on one of his key campaign pledges.\u201cI\u2019d be shocked that the president made a deal that said that there wouldn\u2019t be a wall,\u201d Mr. Palmer said.Mr. Trump said he still intended to push for the wall, and Republicans sought to minimize the depth of his agreement with the opposition. But there was no escaping the fact that twice in a week\u2019s time Mr. Trump embraced the top Democrats while keeping his supposed Republican allies well at arm\u2019s length.Given turnover on Capitol Hill, many lawmakers simply haven\u2019t experienced this dynamic, in which the president of one party tries to work amicably with leaders of the other. And the chaos has been intensified by the fact that the two sides have given slightly different versions of events \u2014 a development usually avoided when one party or the other strictly controls the message.The talks between Mr. Trump and the Democrats haven\u2019t been the only tentative stabs at bipartisanship. Republicans and Democrats on the Senate health committee have been meeting to try to work out a consensus way to shore up the struggling health insurance exchanges. Turnout has been strong and the talks productive, participants said.\u201cWe had more than 60 senators who came to either the meeting with the witnesses before the hearing or the hearing itself and engage in a serious discussion,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who leads the committee. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like that since I came to the Senate 15 years ago.\u201dKnocked off balance, Republicans say they really have no choice but to find a way to navigate within the president\u2019s new architecture. They say it would have been more truly bipartisan had Mr. Trump invited Republican leaders to join him at the dinner table with the Democrats. And they don\u2019t expect all that many occasions when Mr. Trump and Democrats are able to come together.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, said that on most topics, Mr. Trump was still more naturally aligned with Republicans.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with having Democrats support you from time to time,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an interview. \u201cBut I still am very comfortable with where the president is on most policy matters.\u201dMs. Pelosi, despite her advances with Mr. Trump on a spending deal and an effort to protect the so-called Dreamers, agreed that at the moment \u201cit\u2019s a one-by-one thing\u201d that could conceivably grow into more.\u201cI do think that, one by one, you establish more understanding of whether, in the president\u2019s case, understanding of the legislative process, and on our part, what some of his priorities might be, as we go forward,\u201d she told reporters.Without some dramatic ideological shift, many Democrats say it is hard to see the party lining up behind an administration-backed tax cut plan \u2014 the top current Republican priority \u2014 that will enact substantial tax reductions for affluent Americans.\u201cThe idea that he is not interested in giving stuff to the wealthy is about as plausible as my playing in the N.B.A. next year,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.Even with all the current focus on bipartisanship, there is plenty of partisan friction to go around. Senate Republicans seem to be building up to one last push to force through repeal of the Affordable Care Act before their authority to do so on a simple majority vote expires at the end of the month. The Senate also faces a lineup of conservative judicial nominations likely to divide the parties.Still, Mr. Alexander sees progress, and he recalled a bit of advice from Howard Baker, a former Senate Republican leader from Tennessee and a mentor to Mr. Alexander.\u201cSenator Baker used to say, the other fellow might be right,\u201d he recounted. \u201cWe have kind of lost the capacity to understand that.\u201dThat lost capacity is another factor contributing to the feeling of bewilderment in Washington at the moment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: SoFi Chief Executive to Step Down", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMike Cagney, the co-founder and chief executive of Social Finance, is to step down from the online lender by the end of the year.The financial technology start-up known as SoFi, which has been accused of having a toxic office culture, joins a substantial list of companies grappling with cultural issues in the workplace.\u2022 Several former employees said that Mr. Cagney had inappropriate relationships with SoFi employees. Mr. Cagney often overstepped personal and business boundaries, according to interviews with more than 30 people familiar with the company.\u2022 In 2012, Mr. Cagney sent sexually explicit text messages to an executive assistant named Laura Munoz. The company and its board agreed to pay Ms. Munoz a $75,000 settlement. The same year, he also pursued a relationship with another employee.\u2022 A spokesman for SoFi said that the board had investigated a dispute between Mr. Cagney and a former employee and found no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship. The company reached a settlement after the investigation.\u2022 Mr. Cagney may have been overaggressive in expanding the business, skirting risk controls and compliance rules, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The SoFi spokesman disputed this.\u2022 There were also questions about one of its initial products. The company said it had raised $90 million in debt financing for one of the loan products that it sold to investors in 2012, but that financing never took place. The issue was brought to the board, which made no changes. SoFi eventually bought the loans back from investors.These kinds of problems have been far from rare in Silicon Valley.Venture capitalists have faced questions about their behavior toward women entrepreneurs, while accusations of sexual harassment and questions about business tactics have led to an exodus of senior leaders at Uber.On the face of it, yes.Advocates of the Milton Friedman school of free-market theory contend that anti-gouging measures discourage people from conserving goods or suppliers from bringing in goods exactly when demand is highest.Take hotel rooms, for example.If a hotel were to double the price of a room during an emergency, a family might choose to rent fewer rooms at the higher price, or they might choose to tough it out at home if their house were damaged but livable.Either option would increase the supply of hotel rooms, making them available to those who most need them, argues Matt Swolinski, director of the Center for Ethics, Economics and Public Policy at the University of San Diego.There could be even more insidious side effects of anti-gouging laws.Maybe the lesson is that during national emergencies \u2014 the ultimate distortion in daily economic activity \u2014 a free market can make the distortion worse.The question remains: How can resources be made available to poor individuals and families in a fair way?Related Reading: Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee have demanded more details from Equifax about the data breach that may have compromised sensitive information of about 143 million people.The device has a storied history, but with competition catching up, Apple has to do something big for the iPhone to remain the trendsetting device of a generation, Mr. Manjoo writes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pakistan Won\u2019t Let Terrorist Organizations Contest Elections. For Now.", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPakistan is home to many Islamist terrorist groups. Some enjoy a permissive environment despite technically being banned by the state. This has enabled them to acquire political power. Politicians sometimes court terrorist leaders to turn out voters.While researching counterterrorism a few summers ago, I met with a high-ranking Pakistani official to talk about his decision to attend a campaign rally with the leader of a proscribed terrorist organization. He admitted that getting the terrorist leader to turn out voters for a politician was his motivation. He also suggested that encouraging such men get into politics was better than seeing them remain involved in terrorism.If the commission had recognized the Muslim Milli League, that would have in effect allowed a terrorist organization to contest elections. It could have opened the door for other militant groups in Pakistan \u2014 and several militant groups were already gearing up to establish their own political parties.Pakistan has a long history of political parties using violence to prevail in elections. Some parties have armed wings. Others rely on associated militias and criminal networks. Religious parties with ties to terrorist groups have contested elections for decades. Members of outlawed terrorist organizations have also won elected office as independent candidates. While no such organization had ever started its own party, Lashkar-e-Taiba and its social welfare wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, appeared well positioned to lead the charge.On the advice of Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, Pakistan\u2019s powerful spy agency, the group has changed its name several times since the Sept. 11 attacks to evade sanctions and escape bans.The Pakistani government still differentiates between Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is banned, and Jamaat ud Dawa, which is not. In reality, they remain two sides of a single organization, led by the same individuals. The military and the intelligence service still support the group. It remains their most reliable terrorist ally against India, sends fighters to Afghanistan, and has helped to combat separatists in Baluchistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.But militancy is not the group\u2019s only mission. It is also dedicated to proselytizing and nonviolent reformism intended to turn Pakistan into a \u201cpure\u201d Islamic state. Many Pakistanis see Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which runs hospitals and ambulance services across the country, as a robust social welfare organization, and not an alias for a lethal terrorist group.Debates about whether to take part in elections have been continuing for years, according to Laskhar-e-Taiba officials I have spoken with. Yet starting a political party was a major step for an organization whose longstanding position was that Islam forbids participation in electoral politics.The attempt to begin a party occurred at a time when the group and the Pakistani government are under increasing international pressure. Pakistan might make a cosmetic distinction between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa, but the United States and the United Nations have designated both as terrorist groups. The Financial Action Task Force, an international body focused on combating terrorist financing, has also zeroed in on Jamaat ud Dawa and its leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.Recasting their organization as a political party could have provided Mr. Saeed and other leaders with more influence over how the state deals with their group. It also would have given them greater freedom to operate, especially when it comes to raising money.Rather than sucking recruits and resources away from Lashkar-e-Taiba, a new political party could have drawn in more of both. In addition to political cover for its terrorist activities, this would have been another mechanism to influence the domestic discourse and promote hawkish policies toward India.In theory, entering electoral politics can have a moderating influence on terrorist organizations and perhaps even create conditions for mainstreaming them.Wasn\u2019t it preferable, the Pakistani official had asked me, for militants to involve themselves in elections than to continue engaging in terrorism? Of course, it was. Except Pakistan had never forced them to choose between terrorism and politics. Instead, these men and the groups they led have been allowed to ply their terrorist trade while simultaneously increasing their political power.It would be na\u00efve to think that the election commission\u2019s decision is a harbinger of a shift in terms of Pakistan\u2019s policy of supporting and tolerating militant groups. The men who lead them continue contesting elections as independent candidates and may persist in their attempts to register their proscribed organizations under different names. But for the moment, the election commission has held the line against allowing terrorist organizations to contest elections in Pakistan.Stephen Tankel, the author of \u201cStorming the World Stage: The Story of Lashkar-e-Taiba,\u201d is an assistant professor at American University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp Agree to Create European Steel Giant", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two of the world\u2019s leading steel makers said on Wednesday that they had agreed to combine their European operations, creating a regional giant they hope will be better equipped to tackle chronic problems like an excess of capacity in the industry.The deal between ThyssenKrupp of Germany and Tata Steel, a unit of the Indian conglomerate, still faces major obstacles, ranging from union opposition to obtaining the approval of regulators. But if the two companies were to complete the 50-50 joint venture, it would create Europe\u2019s second-largest steel maker.Still, the products turned out by Europe\u2019s steel mills remain vital for a wide range of economic activities from construction to energy, as well as carmaking, and of late, steel makers\u2019 fortunes have improved somewhat.Heinrich Hiesinger, ThyssenKrupp\u2019s chief executive, said at a news conference on Wednesday that he hoped the deal, agreed in a memorandum of understanding, would be a way out of a \u201cvicious circle\u201d of constantly restructuring operations to deal with weak profitability.\u201cWe had to look at the basic problem, and that is overcapacity,\u201d Mr. Hiesinger said. \u201cThat can only be done by achieving consolidation with other companies.\u201dAnalysts said the long-anticipated deal was likely to benefit both companies, allowing them to save money by integrating activities like logistics, sales, and research and development.\u201cOver all, this is a good deal,\u201d said Dalton Dwyer, managing director of Industry Corporate Finance, a London-based firm that advises on steel mergers.Mr. Dwyer said that the deal would allow ThyssenKrupp\u2019s German steel making operations to work with Tata\u2019s well-regarded plant in the Netherlands. But he said \u201cquestion marks\u201d remained over Tata Steel\u2019s British plants, which the company has wanted to exit.The deal would also reduce the number of competitors in the European market, possibly leading to higher prices and expanded margins, analysts say.The big question, though, is whether it will be concluded in its current form. The most important obstacle is likely to be the potential for opposition from German unions. Employee representatives hold half of ThyssenKrupp\u2019s supervisory board seats, and may resist any job cuts or plant shutdowns.By announcing the deal in the run-up to German federal elections on Sunday, ThyssenKrupp also risks making it a political issue. It has already attracted criticism from Germany\u2019s labor minister, Andrea M. Nahles.Still, analysts say those British operations could yet be at risk when the companies look more closely at production operations, as Mr. Hiesinger said they would do beginning in 2020, when the terms of Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union may be clearer.\u201cThere are a lot of questions left,\u201d said Carsten Riek, a steel analyst at the investment bank UBS in London. \u201cThere is still a long way to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Whether his start-up approach is effective is unclear.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has made a half-dozen or so investments in recent months with a specific aim: to counteract the influence of President Trump.The venture-style investments include starting a new group, Win the Future, whose self-described goal is to make the Democratic Party relevant again. He also invested $1 million in Cortico, a start-up that encourages online discourse between people with opposing political views. And he invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into Vote.org, which has a goal of getting all eligible Americans to vote; Higher Ground Labs, a start-up for progressive politicians; and the Center on Rural Innovation, which is working for economic improvements in rural areas.\u201cMy approach to political investing is the Silicon Valley approach,\u201d Mr. Hoffman, 50, said in an interview. \u201cFind and back powerful entrepreneurs.\u201dBut how effective a Silicon Valley approach to political change can be is a question \u2014 and Mr. Hoffman has experienced stumbling blocks before.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman pumped almost $30 million in new financing into Change.org and installed new board members, to try again.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about where we can get to,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a bumpy road.\u201dDebra Cleaver, a former Change.org employee who now runs Vote.org, said it was important to pursue innovative ways for achieving change. But, she added, politically driven investments can be more successful when they are \u201ctreated with the same level of accountability\u201d as traditional venture capital investments.\u201cI would describe Reid as left of center, with a very strong sense of empathy for those who are less fortunate,\u201d Mr. Thiel wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a character trait than an ideological position.\u201dIn 2000, he joined Mr. Thiel as an executive at PayPal, a stint that made Mr. Hoffman a millionaire. He founded LinkedIn, the career-oriented social network, in 2003, spurred by trying to connect people and the openness of online communities.By then, he had become involved in policy. During President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, Mr. Hoffman nurtured ties with the White House and Democratic politicians like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.\u201cReid was among the top leaders in Silicon Valley to whom we looked for good counsel\u201d on issues like immigration, said Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Last year, Mr. Hoffman joined the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, a group helping to modernize the military. Mr. Hoffman offered ideas about the impact that artificial intelligence would have on combat, and suggested ways to improve the military\u2019s personnel retention, according to a person who works with the board but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Mr. Hoffman decided the tech industry had to confront the challenges created by social networks, including their potential to undermine democracy. He said the industry would at some point need to regulate itself with a standards body like the Motion Picture Association of America.Mr. Trump also embodied a specific cause of anxiety for Mr. Hoffman.\u201cWe\u2019re in turbulent times, when concerns about the future tend to lead us to try and enshrine the past,\u201d he said. He began hosting discussions to generate policies for creating economic opportunity and how the government can serve broader swathes of people.Mr. Hoffman has since used his cash and connections to shape the organizations and start-ups that support the issues where he wants to exert the most influence. He has also tried to convince the tech industry to take responsibility for how its products are built and used.In the spring, Mr. Hoffman convened a small group of tech leaders to dine with Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, at the Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, Calif. The group discussed the prospect of governments trying to regulate tech companies and, in particular, the unemployment problems being created by automation and artificial intelligence.\u201cAt the end of the day, most people don\u2019t want a handout,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven a chance, they\u2019ll work hard.\u201dMr. Altman said he agreed with Mr. Hoffman\u2019s concerns and that he appreciated \u201chis willingness to debate issues.\u201dMr. Hoffman has also given money to organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Union of Concerned Scientists, which are explicitly resisting Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. He increased his venture-style investments in new civic and political start-ups, as well as continuing to fund some he had previously invested in, like Change.org and political fund-raising start-up Crowdpac.Win the Future has already drawn criticism for floating the possibility of billboards with crowdsourced ideas to shape the Democratic agenda. Mr. Pincus said most things in the start-up ecosystem took time to evolve and that early criticism of the new group was helpful.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s colleagues said his start-up method to politics was the right one. \u201cIt\u2019s a different approach, so naturally there will be skeptics,\u201d said John Lilly, one of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s partners at Greylock. \u201cBut entrepreneurship has been the driver of the economy. It will work.\u201dMr. Hoffman said he would judge his investments in civic-change start-ups by their ability to affect society, not by any financial return.\u201cOne of the things that I get most frustrated with is this kind of American business psychology, this view that I\u2019m only responsible to my customers and employees and shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be part of the political process.

{"Headline": "Pierre Berg\u00e9, Transformative Fashion Executive and Opera Czar, Dies at 86", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPierre Berg\u00e9, who transformed the French fashion industry as the managerial genius behind Yves Saint Laurent, and went on to have a tempestuous career as the czar of Paris opera, died on Friday in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France. He was 86.Under Mr. Berg\u00e9\u2019s guidance, haute couture became more of a bottom-line business, using success in runway shows to propel the sales not only of ready-to-wear clothes but also of perfumes, handbags and other accessories with designer labels.His ambitions carried him far from fashion into the worlds of politics and culture. Though his clients were mostly rich and conservative, he was a staunch supporter of the Socialist Party, a contributor to liberal causes and a patron and arbiter of literature, theater and music.\u201cPeople may hate me or love me, but they all want to brag that they once sat next to me at a dinner party,\u201d he once said.There seemed to be no neutral opinions about Mr. Berg\u00e9, a man of slight build, exquisitely tailored suits and oval, horn-rimmed glasses, which gave him an owlish look. Hailed as a master of the business deal, he was also denounced in some quarters as a scoundrel who fully deserved the fine he was ordered to pay for insider trading.But as Mr. Berg\u00e9 noted gleefully, he used that and other controversies to increase attendance at the opera house. \u201cParisians at this stage want a Barnum more than a Toscanini,\u201d he said.Philippe Collin, a film director and critic who knew Mr. Berg\u00e9 for 40 years, said, \u201cI think of him as a great Hollywood producer from the golden era.\u201dAt the Saint Laurent atelier in Paris, a seamstress spoke of Mr. Berg\u00e9\u2019s unstinting financial help to terminally ill colleagues, but another woman employed there called him a \u201cmisogynist\u201d who promoted only men to the higher rungs.At the Bastille Opera, employees of both sexes spoke sotto voce about Mr. Berg\u00e9\u2019s \u201creign of terror,\u201d which led to the resignations of much of the senior staff he had inherited. And fashion writers complained that negative reviews of Saint Laurent collections could get them banned \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 from future shows.Pierre Berg\u00e9 was born on Nov. 14, 1930, on the tiny \u00cele d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, off the Atlantic coast of France. His father was a civil servant, his mother a schoolteacher. Mr. Berg\u00e9 moved to Paris as a teenager intent on becoming a journalist. Arrested during a political demonstration, he spent the night in jail with Albert Camus and then joined him for coffee when they were released the following morning.The defining moment in his life, as Mr. Berg\u00e9 often said, was meeting Mr. Saint Laurent in 1958. Intense and introverted, Mr. Saint Laurent was already, at 23, a highly regarded designer for the House of Dior. \u201cI instantly recognized his genius,\u201d said Mr. Berg\u00e9, who was 29 at the time. The two men became lovers.With Mr. Berg\u00e9 as his manager, publicist and partner, Mr. Saint Laurent exhibited his first collection in 1962. By the 1970s, Mr. Saint Laurent was heralded as the most influential designer of his generation, epitomizing the modern woman with swagger and extending fashion\u2019s range of expression by bringing pea jackets, motorcycle jackets and Cossack coats to haute couture.For his part, Mr. Berg\u00e9 demonstrated a business creativity that the fashion world had seldom seen before. In the 1960s, he expanded Saint Laurent\u2019s operations from haute couture into the far more profitable ready-to-wear market, with boutiques in Paris, New York and other cities across the globe. When the haute couture operations needed capital in 1971, Mr. Berg\u00e9 sold the ready-to-wear division to the Squibb Corporation, only to buy it back two years later.In 1986, he arranged the sale of 25 percent of the Saint Laurent empire to Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian entrepreneur, and used the money to buy Charles of the Ritz, which owned a number of designer perfumes, including several Saint Laurent fragrances.Then, in 1989, under Mr. Berg\u00e9\u2019s guidance, the Yves Saint Laurent group became the first French design house to be listed on the Paris Bourse. Investor reaction was sensational. Trading had to be halted during the first two days because there were 28 buy offers for each of the 400,000 shares initially put up for sale. By 1990, the group was ringing up $500 million in annual sales.In addition to their glittering business relationship, Mr. Berg\u00e9 and Mr. Saint Laurent shared a sumptuous lifestyle that made them fixtures in European high society. They filled their grand Paris apartment with antique furniture and covered its walls with Impressionist, Cubist and contemporary paintings. They flew guests by helicopter to their chateau in Normandy, in northern France.In Marrakesh, Morocco, they opened one of their villa\u2019s buildings as a museum specializing in Islamic art. And in New York, they decorated their apartment at the Pierre Hotel with 19th-century Americana.It was only in the 1980s that Mr. Berg\u00e9, who had always portrayed himself as an \u00e9minence grise, began to step out of Mr. Saint Laurent\u2019s shadow. Mr. Berg\u00e9 said that the victory of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and his Socialists in 1981, after 23 years of conservative Gaullist governments, persuaded him to raise his profile. \u201cI was always a man of the left, though never a Marxist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I decided politics was interesting again.\u201dBut strains in his relationship with Mr. Saint Laurent were also leading Mr. Berg\u00e9 to cut a more public figure. Always timid, Mr. Saint Laurent became increasingly reclusive. In interviews, he admitted to struggles with alcoholism, an addiction to cocaine and nervous breakdowns. \u201cYves was born with a nervous breakdown,\u201d Mr. Berg\u00e9 said dismissively.By the mid-1980s the two men were living apart, though their business relationship apparently remained as strong as ever. While Mr. Saint Laurent seemed able to summon up only enough energy to design his collections, Mr. Berg\u00e9 displayed boundless dynamism. He united designers showing in France into one group, known as the Chambre Syndicale, to promote the fashion industry. He was the founding president of the French Fashion Institute and a founder of the Museum of Fashion Arts, both in Paris. Turning couture into an instrument of diplomacy, he staged Saint Laurent expositions in Moscow and Beijing.Mr. Berg\u00e9 did not mind risking Saint Laurent sales by his political activism. He offended some Saint Laurent clients by soliciting funds for the re-election of Mr. Mitterrand in 1988. The Gaullist candidate, Jacques Chirac, denounced Mr. Berg\u00e9 as the \u201cforemost representative of the Caviar Left.\u201dMr. Berg\u00e9 became a friend and trusted confidant of President Mitterrand. He was often invited to the president\u2019s country home, where they discussed politics and culture during long walks in the woods. After Mr. Mitterrand named him president of the Paris Opera, it opened a futuristic venue at the Place de la Bastille in time to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, in 1989.After that, hardly a month went by at the opera without disputes with singers and stagehands or with senior employees who left in a huff over Mr. Berg\u00e9\u2019s autocratic style.As opera czar, Mr. Berg\u00e9 coordinated the Bastille Opera; the Palais Garnier, the famous older opera house; and the Salle Favart, the traditional home of the Op\u00e9ra Comique. He admitted that he had failed in several of his goals. Instead of the promised 250 opera performances a year, he was rarely able to stage more than 140. During his four years at the helm of the Bastille, he said he could think of only two or three productions that were worth the price of admission.\u201cThe rest, for one reason or another, I haven\u2019t liked at all,\u201d he said.The critics generally agreed with him: The reviews were mostly brutal.Still, like a circus impresario, Mr. Berg\u00e9 gleefully pointed to the large audiences at the Bastille Opera as vindication of his stewardship. \u201cPeople are curious about this building, which is so talked about,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf of them never set foot in an opera house before. Yet suddenly, the opera has become the heart of French cultural and political life. It\u2019s laughable.\u201dMr. Berg\u00e9 also began to have legal problems linked to his business deals. In 1994, he was indicted on charges of selling nearly $20 million of shares in the Yves Saint Laurent group before the company announced a 94 percent plunge in net income in September 1992. Convicted of insider trading, he was fined $600,000, which, on appeal, was reduced to $200,000.Since 1996 Mr. Berg\u00e9 had been president of Sidaction, a fund-raising organization dedicated to AIDS research and treatment. He was also a founder of the French weekly Courrier International and the gay magazine T\u00eatu, and the chairman of the supervisory board at the newspaper Le Monde.And like another regal figure, Louis XV, who allegedly asserted that a deluge would follow his demise, Mr. Berg\u00e9 seemed convinced that the world of fashion he helped create would not outlive him.An earlier version of this obituary misidentified the king of France who was said to have predicted that a deluge would follow his demise. It was Louis XV, not Louis XIV.Sewell Chan and Elian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amateur U.K. Archaeologists Stumble on a Roman Masterpiece", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoxford JournalBOXFORD, England \u2014 Their ages range from 9 to about 80. They include a butcher and a builder. Some devoted vacation days to laboring on their hands and knees in an open field.The group of amateur archaeologists \u2014 55 in all, though only two dozen toiled on a typical day \u2014 were part of an excavation project near the village of Boxford, in southern England. They had to contend not just with days of backbreaking work, but also with a daunting, two-week deadline to complete the challenging dig.Their commitment was handsomely repaid, though, in a few magical moments one Saturday last month. As a layer of soil was carefully scooped away, small, muddy pieces of red-colored tiling glinted in the sunlight, probably for the first time in more than one and a half millenniums.The mosaic that slowly emerged from the earth is part of a Roman villa, thought to date from 380 A.D., toward the end of the period of Roman domination of England. The find is being described as the most important of its type in Britain in more than half a century, and in this picturesque, riverside village of thatched cottages, the scale of the discovery is still sinking in.While surveys had shown something of interest beneath this stretch of gently undulating English countryside, they had suggested that it was a medium-size Roman villa that was unlikely to yield anything exceptional.The surprise discovery came at the conclusion of a project that was spread over three years and a hectic two weeks \u2014 necessitated by limited financing and availability.\u201cI was stunned into silence,\u201d Ms. Appleton recalled of her first sight of the small red tiles, each the size of her fingernail. \u201cWhich is unusual.\u201dThe expert on site, Matt Nichol, was equally surprised. \u201cI will never forget that moment,\u201d said Mr. Nichol, a professional archaeologist who was supervising the dig.Experts say the mosaic at what is now called Boxford villa depicts Bellerophon, a hero of Greek mythology who was sent to kill the chimera, a fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, the torso of a goat and the tail of a serpent. Hercules is also thought to be featured, fighting a centaur, and so is Cupid.\u201cIt is so unusual because it has all sorts of quirks which you don\u2019t expect, and it has subjects on it that are completely alien to mosaics in this country,\u201d he said.Some figures breach geometric borders and there seems to be a trompe l\u2019oeil effect. Mr. Beeson added that he could not think \u201cof another Roman mosaic in this country that is as creative as this one.\u201d There are inscriptions, too, though only about one-third of the mosaic was excavated and the full text was not uncovered.The execution is uneven, Mr. Beeson said, suggesting that the \u201cmosaicist has had ideas above his technical ability,\u201d producing what he called a \u201cvery sophisticated design done in a slightly na\u00efve manner.\u201dBoxford villa had been marked \u2014 inaccurately, as it turned out \u2014 on an old map. (It later turned out that the site was disturbed in the 19th century, when the installation of a land drainage pipe damaged part of the mosaic.)With much to be revealed, there is still a lot to learn about life at Boxford villa, though its owner must have been affluent and cultured, and clearly wanted to show off a broad knowledge of mythology to guests.Mr. Beeson says he believes that it is \u201creally vital that we at least see what the other part of the mosaic is like; it\u2019s too important not to investigate.\u201dGiven the geographical location, and the quality of the agricultural land, Ms. Appleton was confident that this was also the site of a Roman settlement, a conviction reinforced by the discovery of several artifacts from that period.So Ms. Appleton and her group pressed ahead. Survey work began in 2012, and there were discoveries at two nearby sites during digs in 2015 and 2016.By chance, Mr. Nichol, who supervised the dig, does not live far away, an irony that is not lost on an archaeologist who has traveled to the Western Sahara, Macedonia and Serbia in search of antiquities, only to discover something so spectacular so close to home.\u201cI never believed it could have been in Boxford, 30 minutes drive from home,\u201d he said.What happens to the site into the future remains unclear because, once exposed to the atmosphere, a mosaic deteriorates quickly unless it is preserved.Ms. Appleton and Mr. Nichol hope to uncover the rest of it next year, though that will depend on whether funding can be raised.But even if they do, making it available for public view would be costly. Just lifting it and removing it from the site would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.In fact, there was little choice about an immediate solution \u2014 which was to bury it in the earth that had protected it for so long because the farmer needed his land back to plant his wheat crop.Even that step proved nerve-racking because there was no money to pay for security to prevent treasure hunters from damaging or destroying the mosaic.The risks increased when, the day before the mosaic was covered over, the site was opened to friends and families of the volunteers who had worked there, increasing the number of people who knew the location.So for the organizers, it was a relief, rather than a disappointment, when the earth was pushed back to conceal their discovery.The night before that was done, Mr. Nichol decided to keep watch over the site from his S.U.V. with a supply of food, a sleeping bag and a bottle of red wine, all donated by volunteers.The Roman owner of the villa would have invited guests to eat and drink on this spot, using the mosaic as a talking point, so a mildly bacchanalian vigil did not seem out of place.\u201cI was on my own in the field; it was incredible,\u201d Mr. Nichol said. He described how, in the solitude, he felt drawn back across the centuries to experience a unique connection to the more-than-1,600-year-old archaeological site, and to the mythological images of its extraordinary, colorful mosaic.\u201cThe wine did help,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big College Sports Business Is About to Get Bigger", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLearfield Communications was a farm radio network that stumbled into college sports when it began distributing radio rights for the University of Missouri in 1975. In a role largely invisible to fans, it proceeded to all but invent the industry of selling radio broadcasts, corporate sponsorships and in-stadium signage.Private equity firms were aware. Shamrock Capital purchased a nearly 80 percent stake in Learfield in 2011 that valued the company at about $100 million. Less than two years later, Shamrock flipped its stake to Providence Equity Partners, reportedly for more than $500 million. Three years later, in October 2016, Providence sold its stake in Learfield to Atairos Group, reportedly for $1.3 billion.While the soaring escalation in value has slowed, the merged company will have something quite valuable nonetheless: intimate access to young people about to enter the work force, a demographic coveted by advertisers. Together, Learfield and IMG own the multimedia rights for about 55 of the 65 colleges and universities in major conferences.While past acquisitions were seen as growth-oriented moves in a business \u2014 live sports and broadcasting \u2014 that thrived as other forms of media experienced headwinds, even live sports faces a challenging environment now. Dominant companies like ESPN are showing signs of struggle, and according to some industry experts, multimedia marketing has not grown as much as some expected.In that light, the potential merger \u2014 which would eliminate duplicative functions and most likely include some layoffs \u2014 seems less aggressive and more cautious, the corporate equivalent of the prevent defense.The multimedia rights that companies like IMG and Learfield buy and sell are not the rights to broadcast games themselves \u2014 those are typically sold by conferences to large broadcasters like ESPN, Fox and CBS. Instead, they sell the rights to radio broadcasts of the games and surrounding programming, including on digital platforms, and they sell ads in places like game-day programs and the stadium video board.At major sports programs, these rights are often the third or fourth biggest revenue streams for athletics departments, behind TV rights fees, ticket sales and fund-raising.George Pyne, who was the president of IMG Sports and Entertainment when it entered the college athletics business, said the demographics of college sports fans \u2014 a young, wealthy and diverse fan base of almost 200 million people \u2014 attracted IMG. The company also wanted to take advantage of a multimedia marketing business that was fragmented and localized.One of the big challenges in monetizing college sports is that the most important programs are not necessarily in the largest media markets. \u201cIf you are a national sponsor, and say you want to be in the top 25 markets,\u201d said Tom Stultz, president of JMI Sports, which owns Kentucky\u2019s and Clemson\u2019s multimedia rights, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t necessarily include Tuscaloosa, Ala.\u201dIf a company could acquire the multimedia marketing rights for enough colleges, it would effectively have a large enough network to sell sponsorships nationally. But the theory hasn\u2019t necessarily been matched by the reality.\u201cWe all thought that there were opportunities to really grow the business,\u201d Stultz said. \u201cI think there has been some success of that, but not what everybody thought it would be.\u201dLearfield and IMG are betting on the idea that their previous scale was not enough, and the solution is even greater scale, a one-stop shop for any advertiser wanting to reach the vast landscape of college sports fans. With the multimedia rights to about 85 percent of the major programs \u2014 as well as some associated licensing, naming rights and ticketing businesses \u2014 the merged Learfield and IMG will come as close to that as possible.\u201cThere is no question of power and efficiencies in big business,\u201d Palisi said.But the merger is also a retrenchment. Both companies are structured similarly, and when combined will have redundant functions. The euphemistic \u201cefficiencies\u201d that will come from the merger are likely to include layoffs. Perhaps reduced costs will achieve the profits that scale alone could not.Given that the new company will be the dominant player in the industry, the potential merger will surely attract antitrust scrutiny. In 2010, when IMG purchased ISP Sports, the Justice Department closely examined the purchase and raised some concerns, before eventually approving it. If the market is defined specifically as college athletics multimedia marketing \u2014 as opposed to the entire college sports business, or the more general sports multimedia marketing \u2014 the merger could be in trouble.The Justice Department declined to comment on the proposed merger.Pyne said he thought the idea that the merged company would monopolize the business was overblown. \u201cThere are no barriers to entry in college sports, and I don\u2019t think that is ever going to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe schools will have the final say in how their products and services are distributed to their fans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Agriculture and Farmers Decimated by Maria", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYABUCOA, P.R. \u2014 Jos\u00e9 A. Rivera, a farmer on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico, stood in the middle of his flattened plantain farm on Sunday and tried to tally how much Hurricane Maria had cost him.\u201cHow do you calculate everything?\u201d Mr. Rivera said.For as far as he could see, every one of his 14,000 trees was down. Same for the yam and sweet pepper crops. His neighbor, Luis A. Pinto Cruz, known to everyone here as \u201cPi\u00f1a,\u201d figures he is out about $300,000 worth of crops. The foreman down the street, F\u00e9lix Ortiz Delgado, spent the afternoon scrounging up the scraps that were left of the farm he manages. He found about a dozen dried ears of corn that he could feed the chickens. The wind had claimed the rest.\u201cThere will be no food in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Rivera predicted. \u201cThere is no more agriculture in Puerto Rico. And there won\u2019t be any for a year or longer.\u201dHurricane Maria made landfall here Wednesday as a Category 4 storm. Its force and fury stripped every tree of not just the leaves, but also the bark, leaving a rich agricultural region looking like the result of a postapocalyptic drought. Rows and rows of fields were denuded. Plants simply blew away.In a matter of hours, Hurricane Maria wiped out about 80 percent of the crop value in Puerto Rico \u2014 making it one of the costliest storms to hit the island\u2019s agriculture industry, said Carlos Flores Ortega, Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of the Department of Agriculture.Across the island, Maria\u2019s prolonged barrage took out entire plantations and destroyed dairy barns and industrial chicken coops. Plantain, banana and coffee crops were the hardest hit, Mr. Flores said. Landslides in the mountainous interior of the island took out many roads, a major part of the agriculture infrastructure there.The island suffered a loss of $780 million in agriculture yields, according to the department\u2019s preliminary figures. Hurricane Georges in 1998 wiped out about 65 percent of crops and Hurricane Irma, which only grazed the island, took out about $45 million in agriculture production.For over 400 years, Puerto Rico\u2019s economy was based on agriculture, historically focused on sugar cane, tobacco and citrus fruits. The island\u2019s economy rapidly industrialized after World War II, leading to the downfall of agriculture production. In recent years, in part because of the island\u2019s economic recession, people went back to the fields, and the industry is going through a small renaissance, growing at 3 to 5 percent every year over the past six years, Mr. Flores said. A growing farm-to-table movement has generated optimism in recent years about an agricultural rebirth.Puerto Rico already imports about 85 percent of its food, and now its food imports are certain to rise drastically as local products like coffee and plantains are added to the list of Maria\u2019s staggering losses. Local staples that stocked supermarkets, school lunchrooms and even Walmart are gone.\u201cSometimes when there are shortages, the price of plantain goes up from $1 to $1.25. This time, there won\u2019t be any price increase; there won\u2019t be any product,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cWhen I heard the meteorologist say that the two had turned into a three and then a four, I thought, \u2018Agriculture in Puerto Rico is over.\u2019 This really is a catastrophe.\u201dHe noted that other islands that export food to Puerto Rico, such as the Dominican Republic, Dominica and St. Martin, were also hit, and that the food supply could be even more precarious if the island\u2019s other suppliers were also affected.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any gandules at Christmas this year,\u201d Mr. Ortiz said, referring to a local favorite usually served as a combination of rice, pigeon peas and pork called arroz con gandules. \u201cEven if we planted now, they won\u2019t be ready.\u201dMr. Ortiz, 80, said he had been working these fields for seven decades. He has lived through his share of hurricanes, including Georges, which wiped out the local sugar refinery in 1998.\u201cI have never seen losses like these in any of my 80 years,\u201d he said as he stood on a riverbank, counting the number of coconut trees that fell. He could earn $100 a month from each one of them. A dozen cracked in half, beside a nursery where the winds swept away all the seedlings and left behind broken glass and ruin.\u201cThose palms take about 10 years to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be dead by then.\u201dHe is not the owner, but he said it hurt all the same. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to see the place where you earn your daily bread destroyed?\u201dEfrain M. Robles Menendez, a dairy farmer, said cattle ranchers had been hit hard, because not only was there major damage to the infrastructure needed to maintain the business, but the supply chain was also cut off. With stores closed and the power out, the dairy trucks have not come.\u201cSince Wednesday, I have thrown out 4,000 liters of milk a day,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back later, and watch me pour it all down the drain.\u201dSome see the potential for something positive to come out of a disaster. Agricultural officials are hoping this will be the island\u2019s chance to modernize its outmoded agriculture industry.\u201cAgriculture is the most vulnerable sector to natural disasters,\u201d Mr. Flores said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the one that can have the speediest recovery, and it\u2019ll be the great surprise in the Puerto Rican economy, because we\u2019re going to come back stronger.\u201dMr. Flores said much of the traditional agriculture in the island had depended on energy-inefficient practices that waste too much water and produce large amounts of waste. Federal funds that will help farmers rebuild infrastructure damaged by the hurricane will present an opportunity to improve the industry, he said.\u201cWe had an antiquated agricultural infrastructure that maybe now is the opportunity to make it more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the moment because we\u2019re starting from zero. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been done before because there was no way of financing it. We\u2019re going to rebuild better this time.\u201dEduardo Bhatia Gautier, a local senator, said, \u201cWe can start developing an agriculture industry that is more profitable and start exporting Puerto Rican products, something this island hasn\u2019t done in decades.\u201dPuerto Rico currently imports about 85 percent of the food it consumes and exports only 15 percent of what it produces, according to the government. Puerto Rico, Mr. Bhatia said, could service a growing demand for organic foods in the mainland United States. He estimated it could take at least a year to get the industry back up and running, as the soil recovers and farmers replant trees.But long-term optimism does little to help farmers contemplating the destruction they see around them.Mr. Pinto, 62, drove to the capital last week to stock up on vegetables to sell at a kiosk he runs with his wife. He did so because his 14,000 plantain trees are all dead and he had nothing of his own to sell.On the ride to San Juan, he looked around at toppled trees, downed telephone poles, tangled power lines, roofs and crumbled wood structures and wept.\u201cI could not take seeing my country in pieces like that,\u201d he said, holding back tears.Mr. Pinto also lost all of his cattle. Literally. He does not know where they are.He plans to start over as he did a decade ago when he lost everything to a flood. He will get about 35 percent of the value back from insurance, and will not quit, he said, using an expression that has become a popular hashtag: #yonomequito \u2014 I will not give up.\u201cA people without agriculture,\u201d he said, \u201care a people without food.\u201dFrances Robles reported from Yabucoa, P.R., and Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed from San Juan, P.R.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Next Move on Health Care? Choice for Secretary May Offer Clue", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats urged him to pursue such a course. \u201cLet\u2019s get a new H.H.S. secretary who\u2019s finally devoted to improving health care, move past these debates and come to bipartisan agreement on how to stabilize markets and make health care cheaper,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the departure of Mr. Price could begin \u201ca new chapter for the Trump administration\u2019s health care agenda.\u201dThe White House had no comment on Saturday, but two advisers who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters said two top candidates were Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Both have previously been vetted by the White House, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate to their current jobs within recent months, a significant selling point.Mr. Trump may not necessarily fill the post quickly. He has left the Department of Homeland Security in the hands of an acting secretary since John F. Kelly left in July to become White House chief of staff. The president appears to be in no rush to fill that post despite a series of hurricanes and a roiling immigration debate, issues managed by the Department of Homeland Security. He said on Friday that he would make a decision on that nomination \u201cprobably within a month.\u201dMr. Gottlieb has more experience in Washington and was seen at the time of his appointment as the more moderate of candidates being considered. In his first months at the F.D.A., he has deftly balanced the concerns of patients and pharmaceutical companies, while taking steps to combat the opioid epidemic and speed access to lower-cost generic drugs. His nomination would be seen as a signal that the president might want to take a different approach to the health care debate.\u201cWe have the votes on the substance but not necessarily on the process, which is why we\u2019re still confident that we can move health care forward and get it done in the spring,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said before Mr. Price\u2019s resignation.After the latest legislative failure, Mr. Trump said he would sign an executive order in the coming week intended to enable Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, a sign that he did not intend to wait for Congress. But it is not clear that he has the authority to do that on his own, and states often resist federal efforts to intrude on their regulation of insurers.Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, have resumed negotiations on bipartisan legislation intended to shore up the current insurance exchanges and prevent prices from shooting up.The uncertainty comes at a crucial moment, just as federal and state officials are preparing for the fifth annual open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. The open season, when people can sign up for coverage, runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15. Critics say that the Trump administration has destabilized insurance markets, driving up premiums for 2018 and making it harder for people to enroll.Mr. Price was confirmed in February by a party-line vote of 52 to 47 after giving vague, noncommittal answers about how he intended to carry out the Affordable Care Act. Confirmation of his successor could be an even sharper battle. Democrats may not have the votes to block confirmation, but they could drag out the process and make it excruciatingly difficult for the nominee and the White House.Democrats expect to press the new nominee for more specific answers to questions like these: Will the administration support bipartisan efforts to continue critically important payments to insurance companies, payments that Mr. Trump has threatened to cut off? Why has the president slashed funds for advertising, outreach and education programs and assistance to consumers who want to sign up for health insurance this fall?Neither Ms. Verma nor Mr. Gottlieb had easy confirmations to their current posts, but neither seems as strongly determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act as Mr. Price was.Ms. Verma, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in life sciences at the University of Maryland and a master\u2019s degree in public health at Johns Hopkins University, founded her own health policy consulting firm, SVC, and worked with state agencies to carry out the Affordable Care Act. Working with Mr. Pence when he was governor, she was the architect of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which expanded Medicaid under the Obama-era law.Rather than simply refusing to participate, as many Republican-led states did, Indiana under the program shaped by Ms. Verma expanded eligibility while emphasizing \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d by requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums and contribute to health savings accounts, and giving them incentives for healthy behavior.Mr. Gottlieb, who received a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Wesleyan University and a medical degree from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, served in several posts during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, including deputy commissioner of the F.D.A. While in the private sector, he worked as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and served as a consultant for pharmaceutical companies.Republicans said that experience would make him a formidable commissioner because he would understand the business better, while Democrats said it made him too cozy with the industry he would regulate. While a physician, Mr. Gottlieb has also experienced the industry as a patient, having been successfully treated for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

Trump \u2014 at least not yet.But blue-collar strongholds, which helped fuel the backlash in the United States, are providing a bulwark for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Dortmund and other onetime factory towns in Germany have largely avoided the working-class alienation that nourished populist sentiment elsewhere.Through a combination of public policy and entrepreneurial ingenuity, the city has attracted new jobs in sectors like semiconductors and logistics to replace the ones lost in heavy industry, while retaining a core of manufacturing jobs. Unemployment has fallen drastically in the last decade and continues to decline.More than any other wealthy nation, Germany still offers blue-collar jobs that provide a middle-class income for people without college degrees. Although the country has suffered a steep decline in factory jobs since the 1970s, 19 percent of Germans work in manufacturing, nearly double the percentage in the United States or Britain, and higher than in Japan or South Korea.Growth by midsize companies has helped compensate for job losses at the big steel conglomerates. These so-called Mittelstand companies, which account for half of German economic output, turned globalization to their advantage. They pushed into foreign markets with products that exploit Germany\u2019s long tradition in precision engineering.Wilo, a maker of specialized water pumps, is typical of the midsize companies that made Germany the third-largest exporter in the world last year, after China and the United States.Wilo is based practically in the shadow of one of the enormous, abandoned steel mills that stand as monuments to Dortmund\u2019s past. The company is constructing a new corporate campus across the street from its existing headquarters on land that is still being cleared of unexploded bombs from World War II. About 1,800 people will work at the complex, half of them in manufacturing.Wilo has factories in China, India and the United States, including one in Thomasville, Ga. It and other midsize companies also continue to create jobs in Germany, believing that it\u2019s important to retain manufacturing expertise close to home.\u201cWe had the coal crisis. We had the steel crisis,\u201d said Oliver Hermes, the chief executive of Wilo, referring to the resilience of Dortmund. \u201cThat\u2019s the big advantage of this area. It knows how to handle change, and the people here are very flexible.\u201dThings could easily have turned out differently for Dortmund. It lies in the Ruhr Valley, which played a central role in Germany\u2019s emergence as an industrial power in the 1800s because of its abundant coal and iron ore.But the region began a steep decline in the 1970s. Dortmund\u2019s last coal mine closed in 1987, and the last blast furnace used in steel making shut down in 1998. In some cases, the plants were dismantled and shipped to China for use by the same companies that put the Dortmund mills out of business. Even the city\u2019s breweries, once among Europe\u2019s largest, fell on hard times.Local political leaders took action well before the mines closed. The government built a technology park, which offered office space to fledgling companies, and provided entrepreneurs with start-up capital.An early tenant of the tech park was Elmos, a maker of specialized semiconductors for the car industry that was founded in 1984. Back then, surrounding fields were still used to graze sheep. Elmos, now the world leader in chips used in parking-assistance devices for automobiles, employs 750 people in Dortmund.\u201cThere was early investment in the right industries,\u201d said Anton Mindl, the company\u2019s chief executive.To ensure a supply of highly skilled workers, the State of North Rhine-Westphalia expanded the Technical University of Dortmund, which is now among Germany\u2019s largest universities, with 34,000 students.It has spawned start-ups like RapidMiner, a maker of so-called machine learning software \u2014 software capable of teaching itself to do things. Founded in 2007 by alumni of the university, RapidMiner employs 30 people in a local office, where the conference rooms are named after closed coal mines.\u201cThere is a good start-up culture,\u201d Ralf Klinkenberg, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, said of Dortmund.State and local officials also sought to improve the quality of life, which they see as key to attracting employers. After an enormous ThyssenKrupp steel-making complex closed in 2001, the local government cleared the property and created an artificial lake big enough to accommodate a small fleet of sailboats. Today the lake is ringed by modern low-rise buildings containing offices, pricey apartments and cafes.All of this comes at a price conservatives in America would find unacceptable. The government safety net here is more comprehensive, with taxes to match, including a 19 percent national sales tax. Germany has universal health insurance, relatively generous unemployment benefits, and free university tuition. The government plays a role in the economy that many Americans would consider heavy handed.In Dortmund, worker representatives have successfully pressured companies to finance retraining or early retirement for laid-off workers. Sabine Birkenfeld, chairwoman of the workers\u2019 council at a ThyssenKrupp steel galvanizing factory in Dortmund, has lived through serial mergers and layoffs over the years that reduced the work force by 90 percent to 1,300 people.Still, she said, \u201cno one had to go to the unemployment office.\u201dMs. Birkenfeld said workers would push hard for the best possible terms. \u201cIf no one lands on the street,\u201d she said, \u201cthen there won\u2019t be any fodder for the right-wing parties.\u201dIt won\u2019t be clear until the vote on Sunday whether Germany has succeeded in containing right-wing sentiment. Some analysts say the rise of populist parties stems not from economic factors, but rather from a feeling by some voters that mainstream politicians are not listening to them. In that case, Dortmund\u2019s revival would provide no insurance against a right-wing surge.A wild card is whether AfD\u2019s anti-foreigner policies, including calls for armed guards at the borders, will resonate with some voters here.Emad Abdelmalak, a 30-year-old Egyptian studying in Dortmund, said he did not think so. Mr. Abdelmalak has sensed hostility in Germany once or twice since arriving three years ago, he said. But, he added, \u201cin Dortmund I\u2019ve never had this feeling.\u201dA picture caption on Saturday with an article about blue-collar jobs in Dortmund, Germany, misidentified a piece of equipment shown on display at the former site of a ThyssenKrupp steel-making complex. It is a Bessemer converter, not a blast furnace.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Conservatives, Trump\u2019s Deal With Democrats Is Nightmare Come True", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is the scenario that President Trump\u2019s most conservative followers considered their worst nightmare, and on Wednesday it seemed to come true: The dealmaking political novice, whose ideology and loyalty were always fungible, cut a deal with Democrats.If Mr. Trump\u2019s agreement with the two Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, to increase the debt limit and finance the government for three months did not yet represent the breaking point between the president and his core, hard-right base of support, it certainly put him closer than he has ever been to tipping his fragile political coalition into open revolt.Stunned and irate, conservative leaders denounced news that Mr. Trump had agreed to rely on Democratic votes to win congressional approval for a temporary extension of the debt ceiling and funding of the government until mid-December.\u201cThese are the moments that can derail President Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d said David Bozell, the president of For America and a Trump supporter, who added that the president\u2019s base would be watching the next few months very carefully. \u201cHe is not Teflon,\u201d Mr. Bozell added. \u201cTrump spent some of his own political capital today.\u201dAdam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, offered a searing judgment of the president: \u201cTalk about burning bridges with the grass-roots.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s move further destabilized a volatile situation for his party, which many Republicans now believe is headed toward a reckoning it can no longer avoid. The party has, for years, been a group of political tribes gathered under one banner. And while Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and unified Republican control of Washington camouflaged longstanding differences within their ranks, it did not reconcile them.Mr. Trump, who is more of a nominal custodian with his own set of plans than he is a devoted guardian of the party\u2019s legacy and conservative principles, has so far failed to bring the warring factions together. The result has been to harden the same battle lines that formed at the time of the Tea Party uprising of 2009: a restless activist bloc of voters and interest groups who want to supplant the party leadership versus an establishment ruling class that has mostly clung to power.Mr. Trump was supposed to shatter their hold on power.That was why many activists and voters swallowed their own reservations about the sincerity of his commitment to their causes, and brushed aside concerns from many fellow Republicans that they were cutting a deal with a charlatan who would inevitably sell them out. Seeing no other alternative but Hillary Clinton as president, they bought into Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d promises to upend Washington and forged a bond over their mutual contempt with the Republican Party establishment.But on Wednesday, prominent conservatives scoffed at the deal that Mr. Trump signed onto \u2014 announced first, no less, by congressional Democrats \u2014 as something straight from the swamp.\u201cI know for certain,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, a founder of Tea Party Patriots, that grass-roots conservatives \u201cdid not work so hard last year to elect majorities in the House and the Senate and get Trump elected in the White House to enact liberal policy priorities.\u201dWith his approval ratings languishing at historic lows, Mr. Trump can hardly afford to lose much more support. And the Republican Party, which was already anxious about losing control of the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections, cannot remain competitive against Democrats if many of its most motivated and reliable voters stay home because they believe their president has betrayed them.Republicans were already facing a to-do list that threatened to drive them apart over the next several months.Besides another round in December on the debt ceiling and keeping the government funded, there is a continuing debate over what kinds of tax cuts Congress should approve and whether, as many conservative activists and Democrats believe, the plan Mr. Trump supports is too generous to corporations at the expense of individuals. Also to be resolved are questions about whether the president\u2019s border wall will be paid for and if he can deliver the deep cuts to the federal bureaucracy he promised.Some lawmakers openly aired their disappointment in the president. Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, offered a wry take on the deal, one that was not exactly a ringing conservative endorsement. \u201cWell, it shows he\u2019s a bipartisan president,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, everybody wants us to be bipartisan.\u201dGiven the enormousness of the issues Republicans have to tackle, and their deep divisions over how to do it, many in the party now say they are inching closer to an unavoidable, full-blown civil war.Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, has been using a simple Twitter hashtag to sum up to allies and friends his frame of mind about the recent turn of events: #War.His combativeness captures the attitude that many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have now, as they see conservatives like Mr. Bannon leaving the administration.Even if Mr. Trump cannot be counted on to fight for the principles he ran on, they say, they will. And that is essentially how Mr. Bannon now sees his role.Out of government but not out of the game, Mr. Bannon has spent much of the past two weeks visiting with conservative movement leaders, calling them and hosting them at the Capitol Hill townhouse where he also runs Breitbart.Among them were Ms. Martin, Mr. Brandon, Representative Mark Meadows of the House Freedom Caucus and veterans of past fights between the party\u2019s institutional wing and its restive grass-roots like Ed Meese, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s attorney general, and L. Brent Bozell III, the founder of the Media Research Center.When he spoke to a gathering of activists one recent Wednesday morning in a conference room in downtown Washington, Mr. Bannon told them their time to rescue the ideas that Mr. Trump ran on and the movement he built is running out. \u201cWe can do this, but we have to galvanize now,\u201d he went on as they picked at doughnuts and sipped their coffee. \u201cAnd you are the backbone of this fight.\u201dHowever disappointed they may be in Mr. Trump, many activists seem eager to first take their fight to Republican leaders in the House and Senate, starting with Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general, said it only reinforced why \u201cordinary Republicans of every stripe believe leadership must be replaced.\u201dFor decades, said Nicholas Everhart, a Republican strategist who has worked with conservative candidates, \u201cThe Republican Party has had developing divisions, fights, and battles going on from the populist, libertarian, America First, social conservative wings.\u201dThose divisions culminated, he said, with Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover of the party \u201cwhere he personally vanquished nearly every institutional challenger in the arena with his own bare hands.\u201dNow many of his supporters are starting to wonder whether they may end up being the next ones Mr. Trump vanquishes.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Firms Add $300 Million to Trump Administration\u2019s Computer Science Push", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe companies have said that donating money, technology and volunteers to schools is often the only way to fill gaps in American school systems\u2019 STEM offerings. Half of all schools in the country with students in kindergarten through 12th grade, where the money announced on Tuesday is to go, offer computer science education. In rural areas, the percentage is even smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the public and private sectors work together to ensure all American students have the opportunity to learn computer science and take part in the fastest growing sector of our economy,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that announced the new donations, said in a statement.The money will be disbursed over a five-year period, with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce contributing $50 million each. Lockheed Martin said it would donate $25 million and Accenture, General Motors and Pluralsight, an online education company, said they would give $10 million apiece.Some companies will also donate software and other technology as part of the initiative. Salesforce.org, Salesforce\u2019s philanthropy arm, said it would give 10 software subscriptions to every school in the country.Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, began organizing the effort about two months ago. She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills. And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York,\u201d Ms. Trump said in an interview, \u201cbut the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.\u201dMs. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education. In a news release, the Education Department said it had a \u201cgoal of devoting\u201d that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education. On Monday, Ms. Trump called 20 state governors and dozens of school superintendents to encourage them to submit grant applications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Rich Won\u2019t Tell You", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "Opinion\u201cThere\u2019s nobody who knows how much we spend. You\u2019re the only person I ever said those numbers to out loud.\u201dSupported byOver lunch in a downtown restaurant, Beatrice, a New Yorker in her late 30s, told me about two decisions she and her husband were considering. They were thinking about where to buy a second home and whether their young children should go to private school. Then she made a confession: She took the price tags off her clothes so that her nanny would not see them. \u201cI take the label off our six-dollar bread,\u201d she said.She did this, she explained, because she was uncomfortable with the inequality between herself and her nanny, a Latina immigrant. She had a household income of $250,000 and inherited wealth of several million dollars. Relative to the nanny, she told me, \u201cThe choices that I have are obscene. Six-dollar bread is obscene.\u201dAn interior designer I spoke with told me his wealthy clients also hid prices, saying that expensive furniture and other items arrive at their houses \u201cwith big price tags on them\u201d that \u201chave to be removed, or Sharpied over, so the housekeepers and staff don\u2019t see them.\u201dThese people agreed to meet with me as part of research I conducted on affluent and wealthy people\u2019s consumption. I interviewed 50 parents with children at home, including 18 stay-at-home mothers. Highly educated, they worked or had worked in finance and related industries, or had inherited assets in the millions of dollars. Nearly all were in the top 1 percent or 2 percent in terms of income or wealth or both. They came from a variety of economic backgrounds, and about 80 percent were white. Reflecting their concern with anonymity and my research protocol, I am using pseudonyms throughout this article.We often imagine that the wealthy are unconflicted about their advantages and in fact eager to display them. Since Thorstein Veblen coined the term \u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d more than a century ago, the rich have typically been represented as competing for status by showing off their wealth. Our current president is the conspicuous consumer in chief, the epitome of the rich person who displays his wealth in the glitziest way possible.Yet we believe that wealthy people seek visibility because those we see are, by definition, visible. In contrast, the people I spoke with expressed a deep ambivalence about identifying as affluent. Rather than brag about their money or show it off, they kept quiet about their advantages. They described themselves as \u201cnormal\u201d people who worked hard and spent prudently, distancing themselves from common stereotypes of the wealthy as ostentatious, selfish, snobby and entitled. Ultimately, their accounts illuminate a moral stigma of privilege.The ways these wealthy New Yorkers identify and avoid stigma matter not because we should feel sorry for uncomfortable rich people, but because they tell us something about how economic inequality is hidden, justified and maintained in American life.Keeping silent about social class, a norm that goes far beyond the affluent, can make Americans feel that class doesn\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t, matter. And judging wealthy people on the basis of their individual behaviors \u2014 do they work hard enough, do they consume reasonably enough, do they give back enough \u2014 distracts us from other kinds of questions about the morality of vastly unequal distributions of wealth.To hide the price tags is not to hide the privilege; the nanny is no doubt aware of the class gap whether or not she knows the price of her employer\u2019s bread. Instead, such moves help wealthy people manage their discomfort with inequality, which in turn makes that inequality impossible to talk honestly about \u2014 or to change.The stigma of wealth showed up in my interviews first in literal silences about money. When I asked one very wealthy stay-at-home mother what her family\u2019s assets were, she was taken aback. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me that, honestly,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one asks that question. It\u2019s up there with, like, \u2018Do you masturbate?\u2019 \u201dAnother woman, speaking of her wealth of over $50 million, which she and her husband generated through work in finance, and her home value of over $10 million, told me: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who knows how much we spend. You\u2019re the only person I ever said those numbers to out loud.\u201d She was so uncomfortable with having shared this information that she contacted me later the same day to confirm exactly how I was going to maintain her anonymity. Several women I talked with mentioned that they would not tell their husbands that they had spoken to me at all, saying, \u201cHe would kill me,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s more private.\u201dThese conflicts often extended to a deep discomfort with displaying wealth. Scott, who had inherited wealth of more than $50 million, told me he and his wife were ambivalent about the Manhattan apartment they had recently bought for over $4 million. Asked why, he responded: \u201cDo we want to live in such a fancy place? Do we want to deal with the person coming in and being like, \u2018Wow!\u2019 That wears on you. We\u2019re just not the type of people who wear it on our sleeve. We don\u2019t want that \u2018Wow.\u2019 \u201d His wife, whom I interviewed separately, was so uneasy with the fact that they lived in a penthouse that she had asked the post office to change their mailing address so that it would include the floor number instead of \u201cPH,\u201d a term she found \u201celite and snobby.\u201dMy interviewees never talked about themselves as \u201crich\u201d or \u201cupper class,\u201d often preferring terms like \u201ccomfortable\u201d or \u201cfortunate.\u201d Some even identified as \u201cmiddle class\u201d or \u201cin the middle,\u201d typically comparing themselves with the super-wealthy, who are especially prominent in New York City, rather than to those with less.When I used the word \u201caffluent\u201d in an email to a stay-at-home mom with a $2.5 million household income, a house in the Hamptons and a child in private school, she almost canceled the interview, she told me later. Real affluence, she said, belonged to her friends who traveled on a private plane.Others said that affluence meant never having to worry about money, which many of them, especially those in single-earner families dependent on work in finance, said they did, because earnings fluctuate and jobs are impermanent.American culture has long been marked by questions about the moral caliber of wealthy people. Capitalist entrepreneurs are often celebrated, but they are also represented as greedy and ruthless. Inheritors of fortunes, especially women, are portrayed as glamorous, but also as self-indulgent.The negative side of this portrayal may be more prominent in times of high inequality (think of the robber barons of the Gilded Age or the Gordon Gekko figures of the 1980s). In recent years, the Great Recession and Occupy Wall Street, which were in the background when I conducted these interviews, brought extreme income inequality onto the national stage again. The top 10 percent of earners now garner over 50 percent of income nationally, and the top 1 percent over 20 percent.It is not surprising, then, that the people I talked with wanted to distance themselves from the increasingly vilified category of the 1 percent. But their unease with acknowledging their privilege also grows out of a decades-long shift in the composition of the wealthy. During most of the 20th century, the upper class was a homogeneous community. Nearly all white and Protestant, the top families belonged to the same exclusive clubs, were listed in the Social Register, educated their children at the same elite institutions.This class has diversified, thanks largely to the opening of elite education to people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds starting after World War II, and to the more recent rise of astronomical compensation in finance. At the same time, the rise of finance and related fields means that many of the wealthiest are the \u201cworking rich,\u201d not the \u201cleisure class\u201d Veblen described. The quasi-aristocracy of the WASP upper class has been replaced by a \u201cmeritocracy\u201d of a more varied elite. Wealthy people must appear to be worthy of their privilege for that privilege to be seen as legitimate.Being worthy means working hard, as we might expect. But being worthy also means spending money wisely. In both these ways, my interviewees strove to be \u201cnormal.\u201dTalia was a stay-at-home mom whose husband worked in finance and earned about $500,000 per year. They were combining two apartments in a renovation, and they rented a country home. \u201cWe have a pretty normal existence,\u201d she told me. When I asked what that meant, she responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Like, dinners at home with the family. The kids eat, we give them their bath, we read stories.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if she was dining out at four-star restaurants every night, she said. \u201cWe walk to school every morning. And, you know, it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s a real neighborhood existence.\u201dScott and his wife had spent $600,000 in the year before our conversation. \u201cWe just can\u2019t understand how we spent that much money,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a little spousal joke. You know, like: \u2018Hey. Do you feel like this is the $600,000 lifestyle? Whooo!\u2019 \u201d Rather than living the high life that he imagined would carry such a price tag, he described himself as \u201cfrenetic,\u201d asserting, \u201cI\u2019m running around, I\u2019m making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\u201d Having money does not mean, in his view, that he is not ordinary.The people I talked with never bragged about the price of something because it was high; instead, they enthusiastically recounted snagging bargains on baby strollers, buying clothes at Target and driving old cars. They critiqued other wealthy people\u2019s expenditures, especially ostentatious ones such as giant McMansions or pricey resort vacations where workers, in one man\u2019s sarcastic words, \u201cmassage your toes.\u201dThey worried about how to raise children who would themselves be \u201cgood people\u201d rather than entitled brats. The context of New York City, especially its private schools, heightened their fear that their kids would never encounter the \u201creal world,\u201d or have \u201cfluency outside the bubble,\u201d in the words of one inheritor. Another woman told me about a child she knew of whose father had taken the family on a $10,000 vacation; afterward the child had said, \u201cIt was great, but next time we fly private like everyone else.\u201dTo be sure, these are New Yorkers with elite educations, and most are socially liberal. Wealthy people in other places or with other histories may feel more comfortable talking about their money and spending it in more obvious ways. And even the people I spoke with may be less reticent among their wealthy peers than they are in a formal interview.In response to these tensions, silence allows for a kind of \u201csee no evil, hear no evil\u201d stance. By not mentioning money, my interviewees follow a seemingly neutral social norm that frowns on such talk. But this norm is one of the ways in which privileged people can obscure both their advantages and their conflicts about these advantages.And, as they try to be \u201cnormal,\u201d these wealthy and affluent people deflect the stigma of wealth. If they can see themselves as hard workers and reasonable consumers, they can belong symbolically to the broad and legitimate American \u201cmiddle,\u201d while remaining materially at the top.These efforts respond to widespread judgments of the individual behaviors of wealthy people as morally meritorious or not. Yet what\u2019s crucial to see is that such judgments distract us from any possibility of thinking about redistribution. When we evaluate people\u2019s moral worth on the basis of where and how they live and work, we reinforce the idea that what matters is what people do, not what they have. With every such judgment, we reproduce a system in which being astronomically wealthy is acceptable as long as wealthy people are morally good.Calls from liberal and left social critics for advantaged people to recognize their privilege also underscore this emphasis on individual identities. For individual people to admit that they are privileged is not necessarily going to change an unequal system of accumulation and distribution of resources.Instead, we should talk not about the moral worth of individuals but about the moral worth of particular social arrangements. Is the society we want one in which it is acceptable for some people to have tens of millions or billions of dollars as long as they are hardworking, generous, not materialistic and down to earth? Or should there be some other moral rubric, that would strive for a society in which such high levels of inequality were morally unacceptable, regardless of how nice or moderate its beneficiaries are?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilian Art Show Sets Off Dispute That Mirrors Political Battles", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 A controversy has erupted in Brazil after organizers of an art exhibition on gender and sexual diversity caved to pressure from conservative groups and canceled the show \u2014 rekindling a political firestorm that gripped the country last year when the country\u2019s first female president was impeached.The offending images in the display \u2014 Queermuseu, or Queer Museum \u2014 included a baby monkey snuggling in the Virgin Mary\u2019s arms, sacramental wafers with the words \u201cvagina\u201d and \u201ctongue\u201d written on them and na\u00efve-style portraits of smiling children spray-painted with tags like \u201ctransvestite\u201d and \u201cgay child.\u201dOn Sunday, Santander Bank unexpectedly closed the exhibition, which is at its cultural center in the southern city of P\u00f4rto Alegre, a month ahead of schedule. The curator found out when a friend of his sent him a text message.\u201cI was completely taken by surprise,\u201d said the curator, Gaudencio Fidelis, in a telephone interview. \u201cIt is not normal for an institution to give into pressure like this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never happened in Brazil, not even during the dictatorship,\u201d he added, referring to the brutal military dictatorship that ended in 1985. \u201cIt sets a bad precedent.\u201dIn Brazil, private and public banks and other companies are some of the biggest investors in culture, many of them financing museums, artists and films.The cancellation reverberated across the country, feeding into the broad political feud that exploded during the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, pitting her supporters against the man who replaced her, Michel Temer.The country\u2019s top artists were already wary of Mr. Temer\u2019s close ties to the evangelical lobby in Brazil\u2019s Congress, and one of his early actions \u2014 to appoint an all-male, all-white cabinet, and to eliminate the Culture Ministry \u2014 did not help, even though the ministry was quickly reinstated.Also, Mr. Temer has continued to actively court religious conservatives in Congress to help push through his economic initiatives and protect him from a corruption investigation.Many artists have rallied to Ms. Rousseff. During her impeachment trial when she was accused of breaking budgetary laws, many musicians and artists who had resisted the dictatorship took a stand against Mr. Temer for what they said was an \u201cinstitutional coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201dAt the Cannes Film Festival last year, the cast of the Brazilian film \u201cAquarius,\u201d including Sonia Braga, held up placards on the red carpet denouncing the \u201cillegitimate government\u201d and urging people to \u201csave Brazilian democracy!\u201dA couple of months later, the new government\u2019s Oscar committee rejected \u201cAquarius\u201d as Brazil\u2019s candidate for best foreign-language film \u2013 prompting accusations of political retaliation.Santander\u2019s explanation for the cancellation of the show fueled the controversy.\u201cWe heard the protests and we understand that some of the works at the Queermuseu disrespected symbols, beliefs and people, which is not in line with our vision of the world,\u201d the bank said in a statement.The Free Brazil Movement \u2014 one of the same groups that organized huge demonstrations demanding Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment \u2014 declared victory. \u201cSantander used public money to finance an exhibition with pedophilia and bestiality,\u201d the group said on Facebook. \u201cBrazilian society organized to reject that. That is a boycott that worked.\u201dThe regional district attorney for children\u2019s issues, Julio Almeida, seemed to support the exhibition. \u201cWe saw the art and there isn\u2019t any pedophilia,\u201d he told journalists in P\u00f4rto Alegre. \u201cThere are some images that could be characterized as sexually explicit. But from a criminal viewpoint, there is nothing.\u201dThe exhibition, which opened on Aug. 15, included more than 263 works of art from 85 artists, including Candido Portinari, Alfredo Volpi and Lygia Clark.The paintings of children tagged \u201ctransvestite\u201d by the artist Bia Leite set off some of the strongest reactions. \u201cWe, L.G.B.T., were once children,\u201d she responded in an interview with the UOL news site. \u201cI am totally opposed to pedophilia and the psychological abuse of children. The goal of this work is just the opposite.\u201dThe curator said the exhibition was the first in Brazil to embrace the \u201cqueer perspective.\u201dIt might still find a new home in the city of Belo Horizonte, where the secretary of culture is a former minister from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government. He has received a proposal to put it in a municipal museum.\u201cI\u2019m smiling on the idea,\u201d said the secretary, Juca Ferreira, in a telephone interview. \u201cIf we allow the censorship of art, it will be a huge step backward. We lived with it during the dictatorship, so we know it has to be cut out at the root.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio, Seeking Second Term, Wins an Easy Victory", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio coasted to a decisive win on Tuesday in the Democratic primary in New York City, as he moved closer to securing a second term.\u201cTonight we took another big step toward a fairer city for all, tonight another ratification of all that we\u2019ve been doing together and it\u2019s going to give us the fuel to go farther,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a victory party in Brooklyn, naming some of his achievements, including universal prekindergarten classes, a two-year rent freeze for rent-regulated tenants and a sharp reduction in the stop-and-frisk policing tactic.With no major Democrat willing to take on the incumbent mayor, the contest had all the urgency of a preseason football game, generating tepid interest among voters.Turnout was relatively low: About 435,000 Democrats voted, the third lowest total since at least the mid-1960s. That could be attributed in part to a lack of strong contests in other races. Popular incumbents hold the other two citywide elected positions, public advocate and comptroller, and sit in the five borough president seats.In the general election, the mayor will again enjoy significant advantages. Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than six to one among New York City voters who designated a party affiliation.And in the most recent campaign finance report, Mr. de Blasio indicated that he had nearly $5 million in the bank. Ms. Malliotakis had just $220,000, and Mr. Dietl had $269,000.Mr. de Blasio has received about $5 million in donations and $2.8 million from the city\u2019s generous public financing program for campaigns, which gives candidates a six-to-one match for the first $175 contributed by New York City residents. And he stands to receive another sizable injection of matching funds ahead of the general election. Ms. Malliotakis has not yet reached the fund-raising threshold to receive matching funds; Mr. Dietl is not participating in the program.With 97 percent of electronic scanners reported, Mr. de Blasio received 320,812 votes. Michael Tolkin, a technology entrepreneur, got less than 5 percent; Robert Gangi, a police reform activist, got 3 percent; and Richard S. Bashner, a Brooklyn community board leader, got 2 percent.In the only other citywide Democratic primary on Tuesday, the public advocate, Letitia James, handily beat her challenger, David Eisenbach, a Columbia University professor allied with Mr. Albanese. She will run in November against the Republican candidate, Juan Carlos Polanco.The comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat, did not have a primary challenger. He will run in the fall against Michel J. Faulkner, a Republican minister.Given Mr. de Blasio\u2019s strong advantage heading into November, political analysts warned that the mayor must now try to generate interest in the general election contest.\u201cThere is a danger that turnout can be low in November, and that\u2019s what he has to be concerned about,\u201d said Charlie King, a Democratic political consultant, pointing to disenchantment with Mr. de Blasio among some sections of his liberal base, as well as missteps and distractions that clouded some of the achievements of his first term. \u201cHe\u2019s got a good two months to begin to unclutter the minds of New Yorkers and adequately send a message of why he deserves another four years.\u201dRick Fromberg, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign manager, said the mayor would emphasize his successes and would continue to position himself as the defender of New Yorkers against the policies of President Trump that threaten immigrants and key urban programs. That will give him a cudgel against Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl, both of whom voted for Mr. Trump. Before the primary, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign was already sending emails tying Ms. Malliotakis to the president.\u201cHe\u2019ll keep pounding away at Trump to energize that base,\u201d said William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, a Republican political consultant, adding that Mr. de Blasio was also likely to stick to a typical incumbent\u2019s strategy of ignoring his opponents whenever feasible. \u201cHe\u2019ll try to stay mayor and not mayoral candidate to the best he can.\u201dOpponents have criticized Mr. de Blasio for his antagonistic approach to the president, saying they would emphasize trying to work with Washington; questioned his work ethic; and accused him of not doing enough to improve the city\u2019s beleaguered subway system.For Ms. Malliotakis, regardless of her chances of winning, the simple act of running for mayor brings benefits, raising her profile, introducing her to Republican donors and making her a more formidable candidate in the future, should she decide to run for some other office.Mr. Dietl has made himself the loudmouthed class clown of the mayoral campaign, labeling the mayor, who is nearly 6 feet 6 inches tall, \u201cBig Bird\u201d and heckling him at some of his events.Despite losing the Democratic primary, it appeared that Mr. Albanese would still be on the mayoral ballot in November: He declared victory in a primary for the ballot line of the tiny Reform Party, in which fewer than 7,000 votes were cast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an Alabama Senator Got His Job May Have Led to His Losing It", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMontgomery Memo\u201cThe Bentley controversy shook the people of Alabama at their very core,\u201d said Angi Stalnaker, who managed one of Mr. Bentley\u2019s campaigns for governor.\u201cAll of our corruption up until now had been our own private family embarrassment,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately for Senator Strange, he had a timing issue: He was tangentially involved in a controversy that was the one where Alabamians finally said, \u2018Enough.\u2019\u201dMr. Moore, who brandished a revolver during a rally on Monday, was never able to show off a smoking gun tying Mr. Strange\u2019s appointment to a bargain to slow or stop the investigation that contributed to Mr. Bentley\u2019s downfall.In the end, though, running in a state still smarting from a tawdry scandal that was tailor-made for social media, he did not need to: Mr. Strange could offer nothing more than his word \u2014 and that of a disgraced governor, who did not respond to a message this week seeking comment \u2014 that nothing untoward had taken place.\u201cI think it was a factor that a lot of people in Alabama knew about, and I think that they saw that,\u201d Mr. Moore, now the favorite to win the seat in the special general election on Dec. 12, said in an interview after his victory speech here. \u201cIt was a factor. It was one of many.\u201dMr. Bentley, a Baptist deacon when he was elected governor in 2010, was reduced to a punch line in March 2016, when he apologized for \u201cany conversations and behavior that was inappropriate\u201d with one of his closest aides.Although the governor was circumspect in his public comments, Alabama did not have to imagine much of what had happened: A recording of Mr. Bentley, apparently in conversation with the adviser, included him saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do what we did the other day, we\u2019re going to have to start locking the door.\u201dMr. Bentley \u2014 whose wife, Dianne, had filed for divorce in 2015 \u2014 denied the existence of what he termed \u201ca physical relationship,\u201d but his acknowledgment of misconduct led to a number of investigations, including one by Mr. Strange\u2019s office.On the day impeachment hearings opened, Mr. Bentley pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges, including one connected to the use of campaign funds to pay the aide\u2019s legal bills. Mr. Bentley\u2019s plea agreement included a requirement that he resign his office.Two months earlier, the governor had appointed Mr. Strange to succeed Senator Jeff Sessions, President Trump\u2019s new attorney general, at least until a special election for the seat was held. Installed in the Senate, with the support of the nation\u2019s top Republicans but on the clock, Mr. Strange was unable to evade the perception that the scandal-scarred Mr. Bentley was his political patron.\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a political environment that I\u2019ve never had any experience with,\u201d said Mr. Strange, who, despite the vocal support of Mr. Trump, lost Tuesday\u2019s runoff by 10 percentage points. \u201cThe political seas, the political winds in this country right now are very hard to navigate. They\u2019re very hard to understand.\u201dBut in a memo to donors on the day of Mr. Strange\u2019s defeat, the Senate Leadership Fund, which allies of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, control, also noted the taint of the appointment.\u201cThe Bentley shadow still hangs over the state and has hung over Strange\u2019s candidacy as well,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Steven Law, wrote. But Mr. Law, whose group spent more than $10 million to try to protect the incumbent, said the Strange campaign had \u201ccorrectly tackled\u201d the issue by emphasizing Mr. Strange\u2019s conservative record and by trying to capitalize on the widespread support for Mr. Trump in Alabama.In doing so, longtime observers of Alabama politics said, his campaign might have underestimated the potency of a parochial issue that time did not make fade away.\u201cA lot of people just didn\u2019t trust Luther Strange,\u201d said Barry Moore, a state representative who, in 2014, was acquitted of all charges in a case from which Mr. Strange had recused himself.The troubles that trailed Mr. Bentley, Alabama Democrats and Republicans said repeatedly, had been easy for voters to understand, a subject that could and did percolate everywhere from Mobile\u2019s bars to the bedroom communities outside Huntsville.\u201cBentley himself was just, I think, another in a series of dominoes that were falling here, where people are just getting tired of having voted for folks in office that end up embarrassing them, that are not what they say,\u201d said Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent in December.Mr. Jones has suggested that he will try to sway voters who remain angry about conduct on Goat Hill, a nickname for the state government complex here.John H. Merrill, Alabama\u2019s Republican secretary of state, said it was difficult to say whether this week\u2019s outcome reflected \u201ca refresh of politics as usual in Alabama.\u201d But, he said, \u201cI think that a number of our people have used this particular opportunity to express their concern about things they\u2019ve seen go on in Montgomery before, and they want to make sure their voices are heard.\u201dWhether Alabama\u2019s political class will heed any warning about voters\u2019 wariness about the specter of endemic corruption, if there is one to heed, may be a different matter. On Monday, the day before Mr. Moore raced to his victory, a former majority leader of the Alabama House arrived at the federal courthouse in Montgomery to answer to a charge that he had used campaign money for personal expenses.He was there to plead guilty.Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Birmingham, Ala.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "J.J. Watt Appealed for Donations. Then His Mom Got to Work.", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPEWAUKEE, Wis. \u2014 Connie Watt, a former vice president at a home inspection company, sat at her kitchen table on Saturday morning and counted out nearly $20,000 in crumpled $1 bills, hastily signed checks, crisp $100 bills and loose change that schoolchildren had delivered to Pewaukee High School in plastic bags.Ms. Watt, the mother of Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt, made sure the money was counted three times, with the help of a few volunteers, before it was added to the millions already raised by her son\u2019s charity to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey in southeast Texas.For Connie Watt, who is vice president of her son\u2019s Justin J. Watt Foundation, and her helpers, that has meant day after day of counting the money pouring in. On top of that, Ms. Watt has turned Pewaukee High School, the alma mater of J. J. and his two brothers, into a giant pantry for relief supplies. The drive got so big that she had to organize a second pickup location in Janesville, Wis., about 50 miles away.Now she has to develop a game plan to redistribute all of this generosity to people suffering more than 1,000 miles away.\u201cI had no idea, obviously, what it was going to turn into,\u201d Ms. Watt said in a phone interview. \u201cWe knew that it would be well received and he has a great following, but not to this level. We had no idea.\u201dHer former career in finance and banking gave Ms. Watt some of the tools she needs to direct the huge fund-raiser she is suddenly responsible for overseeing. More than 160,000 donors have entrusted her and her son with managing their contributions and delivering them to victims in Texas. She also arranged drives collecting food and supplies at four locations in Wisconsin, photos of which surfaced on J. J. Watt\u2019s Twitter account on Sunday morning.\u201cEverybody knows people need water,\u201d Ms. Watt said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how can it really be best put to use. There were a lot of legal things we had to do as well with that much cash. It was a little scary. It was different. I account for every penny no matter what.\u201dInitially, Ms. Watt asked Marty Van Hulle, the Pewaukee High School principal, if she could park a semi trailer outside the school starting Tuesday, Aug. 29. She planned another drop-off location in the dusty parking lot of Blain\u2019s Farm & Fleet in Janesville.By Wednesday morning, it had become apparent that two trucks would not be enough. By midafternoon, the Pewaukee High School cafeteria\u2019s folding tables had stacks of canned tuna that rose taller than the 5-foot-10 school superintendent, Mike Cady. Nearby were similar towers of packaged snacks, disposable plates, laundry detergent and applesauce.Children showed up with their parents to volunteer. One resident brought 20 handmade blankets, and a woman in a wheelchair volunteered to check the condition of the food that was being sent for expiration dates and open containers because she could not help carry it.Ms. Watt had a hand in every step of the process. She formed an assembly line, starting with volunteers at the tissue-box station outside the choir classroom and ending with players from the Pewaukee football team \u2014 who had signed up to work in shifts \u2014 carrying the filled boxes to the trucks.She also stood in the brick-walled hallways and stuffed boxes herself between interviews with reporters from local television stations, and made appeals on social media when the volunteers ran out of items. Within minutes, new volunteers would arrive with the goods to fill her requests.She enlisted three people to go through an avalanche of emails and identify those who were offering trucks, because the school was running out of space.\u201cConnie and John were here the entire time,\u201d Van Hulle said of Watt and her husband. \u201cThey were here at 7:30 in the morning until after six o\u2019clock when we got things cleaned up. So they were completely invested in this process. They didn\u2019t just turn it over. They were hauling boxes and doing all kinds of grunt work like the rest of us were.\u201dIn all, the campaign sent 12 trucks of supplies and one cargo plane full of diapers and baby formula to Houston; on Sunday, J. J. Watt and several of his Texans teammates helped unload the supplies in Houston.But the most challenging part for Ms. Watt, who describes herself as \u201corganized to a fault,\u201d has been deciding how to handle the money. The J. J. Watt Foundation\u2019s largest event every year is a softball tournament in Houston that usually raises about $1.3 million, a fraction of what has been collected for Harvey relief.\u201cWe had to get the paperwork in place to be able to include the money in the foundation,\u201d Ms. Watt said. \u201cWe needed the legal team, the board members. It takes a little time. We had to set up a new bank account because it\u2019s all the same company, but we don\u2019t want a single penny going into the other accounts.\u201dThe foundation board, which includes her All-Pro son, planned to hold a conference call on Monday to discuss specific recipients for the money. Ms. Watt said she hoped to begin distributing money as soon as Monday night.But that does not mean the offers of help have stopped coming. Hours after the first trucks started their 17-hour drive to Texas on Friday night, and Ms. Watt left Pewaukee High for the short walk home, a man showed up at the school and asked, \u201cIs this still where we can drop off donations?\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Hurricane Harvey relief efforts led by the football star J.J. Watt and his mother, Connie, misstated the distance between Pewaukee and Janesville, Wis., two locations where relief supplies were stored. They are about 50 miles apart, not 30 miles.Advertisement"}

In a social media office, volunteers edited campaign videos to be released online.Naveed Qamar, the party\u2019s campaign manager, said a women\u2019s wing made up of relatives of senior Jamaat leaders was going door to door, and the party had set up around 150 small offices and stalls across the election district.\u201cPeople have emptied their homes and offered them to us as offices,\u201d Mr. Qamar said. \u201cOne supporter paid for all the banners. Another gave us his printing press.\u201dHe made no attempt to hide the party\u2019s anti-India leaning or what he called its \u201cideological affinity\u201d with Lashkar-e-Taiba, adding the party had the \u201cfull support and blessing\u201d of Mr. Saeed.\u201cFrom the deepest recesses of his heart, no Pakistani wants friendship with India,\u201d Mr. Qamar said. \u201cIn that way, we are with Lashkar-e-Taiba.\u201d\u201cBut that does not mean we are not a reality,\u201d Mr. Qamar said. \u201cWe have launched our party, and our campaigning is going on in full swing.\u201dThe campaign is seen as largely symbolic, and the party is not expected to win the seat.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Milli Muslim League is meant to legitimize or camouflage Jamaat-ud-Dawa\u2019s actions and avert international sanctions,\u201d said Muhammad Amir Rana, an expert on jihadist groups who runs the Pak Institute for Peace Studies in Islamabad, Pakistan\u2019s capital.A closed-door meeting organized by the institute in March, and attended by high-profile leaders of groups banned in Pakistan, discussed the \u201creintegration and rehabilitation\u201d of those willing to renounce violence, Mr. Rana said. One of those in attendance was Mr. Saeed\u2019s brother, Hafiz Masood, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa spokesman.After that meeting, the institute recommended that the government set up a parliamentary body to assess the activities of groups willing to shun violence, and that it review the criteria for banning organizations. \u201cBut the state doesn\u2019t seem to have a real plan to mainstream these groups,\u201d Mr. Rana said.For decades, Pakistan has cast a benign eye on groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba \u2014 which is perceived as an asset because its attacks target Indian soldiers in disputed Kashmir \u2014 even as the government battles entities like the Pakistani Taliban that directly threaten the country.\u201cThe fact that the state, to this point, has not stood in the way of this political party\u2019s formation gives the lie to the idea that Pakistan\u2019s powers-that-be are engaged in a full-court blitz against terror and extremism of all stripes,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, the deputy director for Asia at the Wilson Center, a research institute in Washington.Neither Pakistan\u2019s interior ministry, which oversees counterterrorism operations, nor the military\u2019s media wing, responded to phone calls seeking comment.Pakistan\u2019s all-powerful military openly controls the country\u2019s foreign policy and internal security, and its spy service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, is widely considered to have helped establish the Lashkar militant group in 1989 to counter India.The Pakistani government and military deny any link to that group. But officials have publicly rebuffed pressure by the United States and India to charge Mr. Saeed in the Mumbai attacks, arguing that there is not enough evidence to prosecute him.Mr. Rana said he did not think the state was behind the new party. \u201cSome people in the security establishment might be putting their weight behind this party,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see this as part of a concerted push by the state.\u201d\u201cFor Washington, the question is and will continue to be why the Pakistani state isn\u2019t stopping a political party tied to Lashkar-e-Taiba from being formed, particularly in light of President Trump\u2019s recent harsh words about Pakistan,\u201d Mr. Kugelman said.Foreign policy aside, analysts said Pakistan was hurting itself the most by allowing extremist groups to have political wings and to introduce more radical elements into mainstream society.\u201cHafiz Saeed\u2019s ability to damage Indian interests has declined sharply in the wake of the Mumbai terrorist attack,\u201d said Siddharth Varadarajan, an Indian journalist who covers Pakistan-based Islamist groups. \u201cBut the Pakistani establishment\u2019s failure to recognize the threat he poses to the people of the country poses a danger to Pakistan itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As such, Houston is offering other cities a real-life run-through of their own emergency plans as well as a stark reminder of the inevitability of such events.\u201cWe look at this and realize that while they might be under water, we someday will be under crumbled buildings,\u201d said Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles. \u201cAnd it will take years, if not decades, to rebuild.\u201dJames Redick, the director of emergency preparedness and response in Norfolk, Va., a city that has found itself vulnerable to hurricanes over the years, said he watched the water rise in Houston and began worrying about his own city\u2019s plans to rebuild after a cataclysmic flood.\u201cI keep asking myself, is our recovery plan good enough for when you essentially have to start over?\u201d Mr. Redick said.Speaking before Hurricane Irma set its sights on South Florida, Juvenal Santana, Miami\u2019s director of public works, expressed relief last week that his city was not the one in distress. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said we are not thankful that we are not sitting here talking about having had the storm come through Miami,\u201d he said.In Chicago, a city that lives under the threat of tornadoes, blizzards and overflowing rivers, officials watched the Houston response in search of new ways to guide a major population center through a crisis.\u201cI\u2019m shooting notes over to my guys who work in emergency management and saying, \u2018Hey, when was the last time we updated our shelters?\u2019\u201d said Alicia Tate-Nadeau, executive director of Chicago\u2019s Office of Emergency Management and Communications. \u201c\u2018Do we have a plan to put computers in our shelters, along with phone-charging banks?\u2019\u201dSome of the lessons, officials said, have been encouraging, in particular the initial willingness of Republicans in Washington, some of whom famously resisted providing assistance after Hurricane Sandy pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, to approve the billions of dollars that will be needed to rebuild.But for many emergency response leaders in major cities, Houston has also been a disturbing reminder of how even the best emergency plans are often not up to the task.\u201cIt makes you realize, these megastorms, if you haven\u2019t been hit by one, your worst-case scenario is nowhere near a true worst-case scenario,\u201d said Daniel J. Kelly, the executive director of the New Jersey Office of Recovery and Rebuilding, as he recalled his state\u2019s struggle to respond to Hurricane Sandy.For city officials who would have to manage these kind of crises, Houston has been a reminder of one of the toughest parts of their jobs. Martin J. Walsh, the mayor of Boston, told a radio audience that a storm of that magnitude would leave the city \u201cwiped out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s made me take a real serious look at how we would handle a storm,\u201d Mr. Walsh said in an interview. \u201cHopefully a lot of cities and towns around America take their time and pay attention to what\u2019s happening.\u201dMr. Walsh said he had talked with the city\u2019s water and sewer engineer about how much rain Boston could absorb without flooding, and had considered which neighborhoods might need to be evacuated. He said the city only had access to 7,200 cots, far fewer than he feared would be necessary in the event of massive flooding.\u201cOur financial district is pretty much on the coast,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. And a number of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, he added, are on the water.Across Miami and other Florida cities, like Tampa and Orlando, Harvey ushered in a common refrain: There but for the grace of God. Like Houston, Miami is flat and has gobbled up wetlands like the Everglades and coastal stretches to build and build. The more a city has been paved over, the greater the chance of flooding.There has typically been an uptick in disaster preparation in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophe \u2014 the 1994 Northridge earthquake here prompted many people to stockpile water and batteries, and some cities passed laws requiring vulnerable buildings to install reinforcing walls and pillars. That was just as typically followed by a return to normal behavior as the memory of the disaster faded.Scott Ashley, 46, who works the Los Angeles Unified School District, said he remembered the earthquake of 1994, and that in the days since the flooding began in Houston, he had refreshed the emergency kit he had set up to help his family survive the next one.\u201cWe are very ready,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have our emergency kits, we have our evacuation plans, M.R.E.\u2019s, water, kits for tents, warm weather supplies, storage space for materials, a kit that will take care of our family for at least 3 days.\u201dAnd Los Angeles got a reminder this weekend of the kind of disasters it might have to deal with beyond earthquakes, as wildfires broke out in parts of the city, destroying three homes and closing down a highway as temperatures soared above 100 degrees.Walt Hubbard, the emergency manager for King County, which includes Seattle, said the Texas experience has demonstrated that many disasters can go on for weeks or even months, and that residents should be prepared for the long haul.For Sam Liccardo, the mayor of San Jose, Houston reinforced the need for shelters evenly spread across the city and powerful but portable pumps, which his aides are now looking to purchase. \u201cNothing motivates action like the dreadful disaster that we see in Houston,\u201d Mr. Liccardo said. \u201cYou can only hope that we all collectively learn and better prepare.\u201dDr. Irwin Redlener, the director of National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said emergency officials in New York state and city government were watching Houston to see how the storm affected high-security plants where dangerous chemicals and pathogens are stored.\u201cWe are all questioning if they are secure enough,\u201d he said. \u201cNew Yorkers have no problem imagining that any kind of man-made or natural disaster is not out of the question since we have seen both kind of events.\u201d\u201cIt triggers memories of the Bay Area quake or the Northridge quake, he said, adding that Harvey has prompted many to ask, \u201cAre we ready? Are we prepared?\u201dAdam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles, and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

{"Headline": "Congress Rejects Trump Proposals to Cut Health Research Funds", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix months later, Congress has not only rejected the president\u2019s N.I.H. proposal; lawmakers from both parties have joined forces to increase spending on biomedical research \u2014 and have bragged about it.The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bipartisan bill last week providing $36.1 billion for the health institutes in the fiscal year that starts next month. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and the chairman of the subcommittee responsible for health spending, said it was the third consecutive year in which he had secured a $2 billion increase for the agency, amounting to an increase of about 20 percent over three years.The audience erupted in applause when Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, announced the increase at a hearing of a separate Senate committee.Mr. Trump had proposed to cut funds for the health institutes by $7.5 billion, or 22 percent, to $26.6 billion. Congress pushed back hard.The president\u2019s proposal \u201cwould have crippled American innovation in medical research, delayed new cures and treatments and brought N.I.H. funding to its lowest level since 2002,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat.The House Appropriations Committee, though less generous than the Senate, still approved a $1.1 billion increase for the health research agency. Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol said they expected the final figure to be close to the higher amount in the Senate bill.The appropriations committees in both houses rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to slash payments to universities for overhead \u2014 the \u201cindirect costs\u201d of research financed by the health institutes. These include the cost of utilities, internet service, data storage, the construction and upkeep of laboratories and compliance with federal rules protecting human subjects of clinical research.In identical language, the House and Senate bills explicitly prohibit the Trump administration from changing the formula used for decades to calculate and pay indirect costs.\u201cThe administration\u2019s proposal would radically change the nature of the federal government\u2019s relationship with the research community, abandoning the government\u2019s long-established responsibility for underwriting much of the nation\u2019s research infrastructure, and jeopardizing biomedical research nationwide,\u201d the Senate Appropriations Committee said in a report on its bill. The proposed cuts, it said, could not be made \u201cwithout throwing research programs across the country into disarray.\u201dBut he won few converts.\u201cIndirect costs are very real costs,\u201d said Dr. Landon S. King, the executive vice dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and \u201cthere is not another source to pay for them.\u201dThe Senate bill provides a 29 percent increase in funds for research on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, bringing the total to $1.8 billion for next year. The House bill provides a similar increase.\u201cDisease knows no borders,\u201d the Senate panel said. As evidence of its value, the committee pointed to the work of the N.I.H. unit, the Fogarty International Center, in fighting Ebola, Zika, malaria and many other diseases.The actions on both sides of the Capitol amounted to a vote of confidence in Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and retained by President Trump. Dr. Collins helped identify a gene responsible for cystic fibrosis and led the government\u2019s successful effort to map the human genome, deciphering the instruction book for human DNA.The spending bill was approved by a vote of 29 to 2 in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, voted no, but a spokesman said he was \u201cvery supportive of the increase in N.I.H. funds.\u201dThe spokesman, Darrell Jordan, said Mr. Lankford objected to other provisions of the bill, including one that would limit the Trump administration\u2019s ability to change the rules for federal grants to family planning clinics.Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said that was one of the bill\u2019s best provisions. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that this bill ties the Trump administration\u2019s hands as it tries to undermine family planning efforts,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Storm\u2019s Impact on Oil Industry Is Felt at Gasoline Pumps", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Ports along the Gulf of Mexico are closed to fuel barges. Part of the biggest pipeline between Texas and New York has stopped flowing. Refineries and gas stations are flooded. Drilling rigs in the biggest shale field in Texas are running low on diesel supplies.As a result, the fallout from Hurricane Harvey\u2019s devastation is now spanning the country, forcing gasoline price increases and possible consumer shortages of fuel.\u201cThis is going to be a substantial ouch for consumers,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. \u201cSatan could not have drawn up a more horrible geographic scenario for knocking out Texas refining.\u201dThat accounts for the disruption to the giant Colonial Pipeline, which delivers 100 million gallons of gasoline, home heating oil, jet fuel and diesel daily along a path from Houston to New York Harbor. Its operations in Texas have been shut, and the problem is not damage but supply: More than half of the 26 refineries that feed the pipeline between Houston and Lake Charles, La., have closed or curbed their operations.Mr. Kloza said this was easily the biggest blow to the American energy patch since Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005. Back then, gasoline prices soared 40 cents in one day and long lines reminiscent of the oil shocks of the 1970s appeared at gasoline stations.Every extra penny at the pump costs American consumers a total of $4 million daily, and the price spike after Harvey could last a month or more. Lower-income Americans who spend a large part of their income on gasoline fueling older, less efficient vehicles will be hit hardest.Fortunately for consumers, domestic inventories of gasoline and other fuels were near maximum capacity before the storm hit, keeping prices down somewhat, because of the frenzy of production in recent years. But the prices are increasing at a most inopportune time, just before the Labor Day weekend, one of the heaviest driving periods of the year.Even regions far from Texas are scrambling, and even competing, to compensate for lost refinery output.The Northeast is borrowing gasoline from Florida inventories, even though the state has been virtually cut off from Gulf Coast supplies. The price for regular gas in Florida rose to an average of $2.41 on Thursday from $2.35 in one day. Fuel prices are going up in the Midwest because of expectations that much of its gasoline and diesel will be moved to the Eastern Seaboard. Illinois, for instance, had a one-day jump of 5 cents a gallon.Much of the East Coast will have to turn to fuel shipped by railroads from refiners in the country\u2019s midsection and by tanker from other American coastal refiners and European and possibly Middle Eastern refiners for the next four to eight weeks.Railroad shipments are more expensive and hazardous than pipeline shipments.The situation may be eased by an announcement by the Energy Department that it will release 500,000 barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on loan to the Phillips 66 refinery in Lake Charles. The department said it was the first emergency release since 2012, when tough Western sanctions were put on Iranian oil exports to push Tehran to the nuclear bargaining table.Still, the effects are likely to ripple across the globe. Mexico and other Latin American markets that have come to depend on American gasoline and crude oil will have to turn to Europe and elsewhere, putting them in competition with American markets for the same supplies and probably compounding the impact of higher prices.The amount of refined petroleum products affected by the storm has risen daily, to 3.3 million barrels on Thursday from two million on Tuesday, according to a report by IHS Markit, an analytics and consultancy firm.Five of Houston\u2019s nine refineries are shut down, though no serious permanent damage has been reported. Floodwaters continue to rise in areas, potentially jeopardizing the city\u2019s other refineries, already operating below normal levels.Serious flooding may also be a problem in Beaumont and Port Arthur, where Exxon Mobil, Saudi Aramco-Motiva, Total and Valero have large refineries.The operator of the Colonial Pipeline has said operations from Texas will resume as soon as refining safely does, but probably no earlier than Sunday. The pipeline, which normally carries more than 15 percent of the fuel consumed nationwide, continues to operate east of Lake Charles, taking petroleum products north.Even when the refineries start again, problems will remain at the port of Houston. The Coast Guard, already overburdened, needs to remove debris to protect docking vessels, and flooded railways and roads may keep dockworkers from unloading vessels and putting cargo on trains and ships.The storm\u2019s impact has been felt in oil and gas production as well as refining. Output from offshore platforms is down nearly 20 percent. Oil companies are beginning to return to the platforms to inspect possible damage from the storm, a process that could take weeks, before near full production can resume.The most important shale field in the country, the Permian Basin in West Texas, was not directly hit by the storm. But with refineries closed along the coast, pipelines out of the Permian have been shut off, and production is already declining. Fuel supplies necessary to keep the drilling rigs going may also fall short because of the refinery shutdowns.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a curtailment of production levels because the refineries can\u2019t take the product,\u201d said Steve J. McCoy, a senior executive at Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma company active in the Permian. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of worried about the availability of diesel out here, and that, too, could have an impact.\u201dEd Hirs, an energy finance professor at the University of Houston, predicted that \u201cthis interruption may help Bakken producers as they ship more crude to the Pennsylvania and New Jersey refiners, and it will throw a temporary lifeline to the refiners in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\u201dThe flooding has also knocked out trucking routes to gasoline stations, and many stations in Texas and Louisiana are out of fuel or flooded.Some relief is coming from nuclear power. Two reactors outside Houston are running at full capacity and suffered no serious damage. That is helping to keep the lights on for thousands of residential and business customers.Advertisement"}

The extension delays the type of Tea Party-led showdown over spending and debt that has shut down the government before, but it also forces Republicans to engage in this politically damaging fight on the eve of an election year.As difficult as those items might be, there are other, tougher possibilities.Mr. Trump and his new Democratic friends could work on more. They could raise spending caps set to kick in next month by matching increases in military spending that Republicans want with increases in domestic spending that Democrats favor. They could back a proposal to automatically increase the debt ceiling, ending perennial partisan battles over what used to be a routine vote essentially recognizing the debts Congress has already incurred.Given the continuing Russia investigations, bipartisan bitterness, the limitations of the legislative calendar and Mr. Trump himself, we have no real reason to expect his bipartisan impulse to harden into practice.

{"Headline": "Median U.S. Household Income Up for 2nd Straight Year", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite eight years of economic growth since a brutal recession, some politicians and economists have worried that many Americans have not felt the benefits of the expansion.On Tuesday, the Census Bureau painted a brighter picture, suggesting that the recovery had shifted into a new phase in recent years and is now distributing its benefits more broadly.The bureau also reported that the percentage of Americans living in poverty continued to fall last year, while the share with health insurance continued to increase.The data may sharpen the political confrontation between President Trump, who is pressing to overhaul the nation\u2019s economic policies, and Democrats, who now have more ammunition to argue that the changes Mr. Trump seeks would mess with success.Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to lift the nation\u2019s fortunes and to repair what he described in his inaugural address as \u201cthis American carnage.\u201d He has called for cuts to federal taxes and spending, broad reductions in regulation and limits on foreign trade.But some Democrats said the Census Bureau\u2019s new figures reinforced their determination to resist.\u201cWe need to be building on the success of the past eight years, not abandoning the progress we have made as a country and the American people who worked so hard to get us there,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Budget Committee.The Federal Reserve is also closely watching the health of the economy as it debates how soon to resume hiking its benchmark interest rate.Household incomes are outpacing wage growth because millions of Americans have returned to the work force, a vivid illustration of the old maxim that a job is the best antipoverty program. The economy added roughly 2.2 million jobs last year and an additional 1.4 million in the first eight months of this year.But Census Bureau officials cautioned that those figures were not directly comparable because of a change in its methodology in 2013 that has tended to increase measured incomes.The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization based in Washington, estimated that without the change in methodology, median household income in 2016 was still 2.4 percent lower than in 1999 \u2014 and 1.6 percent below the level reached in 2007, before the recession began.Racial disparities also have increased. The bureau reported that the median income for African-American households has fallen by 1.6 percent since 1999. The adjusted numbers provided by the Economic Policy Institute pegged the drop at 7.5 percent.The annual report is based on a survey of 95,000 households.\u201cJust as in 2015, 2016 is going on record as another year of massive income inequality,\u201d said Mary Coleman, senior vice president at Economic Mobility Pathways, a Boston nonprofit group that focuses on female and family poverty. \u201cThere was no meaningful reduction in income inequality.\u201dThe good news is that income inequality, by some measures, is no longer increasing.The details of the report help to explain the reasons. Household incomes increased because more people were working, and the gains in employment have been concentrated among workers with less education, driving income gains on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.\u201cHouseholds are doing better because more people are working and more people are working full time,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com.But the increases in household income also reflected investment gains. The share of income that came from sources other than wages increased markedly last year, to 21.8 percent, from 21.1 percent in 2015. That kind of income flows mostly to households on the upper rungs of the ladder.Income inequality is at a very high level by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that the uneven distribution of income and wealth is an impediment to economic growth.The Fed has curtailed its efforts to stimulate economic growth, concluding that monetary policy has done what it can. The Fed is expected to announce next week, after a meeting of its policy-making committee, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, a final legacy of its stimulus campaign.\u201cThe challenge for policy makers now is to build on the last few years\u2019 progress and not worsen poverty and inequality,\u201d said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.The data also showed that the ranks of those with health insurance coverage continued to grow last year. Only 8.8 percent of the population lacked insurance for the full year, down from 9.1 percent in 2015.Montana and Louisiana expanded their Medicaid programs in 2016, joining 29 other states in accepting increased federal financing under the Affordable Care Act. Private coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered better benefits.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Funding Talks at Uber and Lyft Complicate Ride-Hailing Allegiances", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The only thing changing faster than who is winning the race in the cutthroat world of ride hailing are the shifting behind-the-scenes allegiances between those companies and investors.At the moment, Uber, the ride-hailing behemoth, is nearing a deal to receive billions of dollars in funding from SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.SoftBank is one of the largest investors in Didi Chuxing, one of Uber\u2019s largest former foes. Didi also happens to be a major investor in Lyft, Uber\u2019s biggest American rival. And, according to three people familiar with the discussions, Lyft has held recent talks to raise funding from Alphabet, whose venture capital arm also happens to be a major shareholder in Uber.The tangled state of affairs has made for strange bedfellows, and has helped to forge occasional alliances between companies. But it has also put companies in difficult positions when they have to decide which investors to accept money from \u2014 and what strings may be attached.\u201cIf you believe the ride-share industry is big enough, you believe that even if you have a losing investment in one of the two competitors, the winner will be big enough to justify the loss,\u201d said Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, a firm that invests in ground transportation start-ups and has invested in Lyft.Complicating the talks are the many strings attached to a potential deal. SoftBank is angling to invest in Uber at a steep discount to the company\u2019s nearly $70 billion valuation. SoftBank has agreed to buy some new shares at the same valuation, but would also participate in a tender offer sent to existing Uber investors, in which the Japanese company could potentially buy their Uber shares at a price that is cheaper than the ride-hailing service\u2019s last valuation.For Uber, SoftBank could be a potentially powerful ally. SoftBank\u2019s new capital could aid Uber\u2019s expensive expansion efforts in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America. The money could also go toward cashing out existing investors and employees, who have not been able to sell their stock since Uber is a privately held company.If no agreement is reached, SoftBank could also pose a significant threat to Uber. In a meeting with Uber investors this week, Rajeev Misra, leader of SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, said SoftBank would be willing to invest in a rival like Lyft if Uber did not agree to SoftBank\u2019s terms, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Those terms included demands like the heavily discounted share price, and two seats on Uber\u2019s board of directors.More recently, Lyft has held talks with Alphabet for a new $1 billion investment, according to people familiar with the discussions. It is unclear what the status of those talks are, though the discussions appear to be driven by Larry Page, Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, the people said.Lyft could use any new funding to keep pressure on Uber in its most lucrative market, North America, by offering subsidized trips to riders.An investment would also strengthen Lyft\u2019s relationship with Alphabet, which has emerged as one of Uber\u2019s most powerful foes. In May, Lyft reached a deal to work on a self-driving-vehicle pilot program with Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-vehicle subsidiary. Waymo sued Uber this year, claiming stolen trade secrets in driverless-car technology.\u201cRide sharing is starting to look more like a business that will be regionally dominated by local duopolies and monopolies,\u201d Mr. Garcia said. \u201cUntil the winners shake out, the companies will use money from the same investors to cannibalize one another.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label May Shrink for Some Firms Under Trump", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "The Trump administration is examining the use of the designation for large non-bank financial institutions, with a closely anticipated Treasury report on the matter expected next month.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is examining the labeling of large non-bank financial institutions as \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d with a closely anticipated Treasury Department report on the initiative expected next month.\u201cThis is probably a tool that goes dormant for the time being,\u201d said Edward Mills, a financial policy analyst with FBR Capital Markets.Both the Treasury report and the outcome of the MetLife challenge, should it advance, could give regulators fodder for eventually removing the label from both A.I.G. and Prudential.\u201cI really do expect them to be \u2014 in some way, shape or form \u2014 skeptical of the whole designations process,\u201d Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, said of Trump administration officials. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be skeptical of the way it was done in the past and I think they\u2019re going to be skeptical of the necessity to use it in the future.\u201dTreasury declined to comment for this article, noting that its report was pending.A shift away from designating large financial institutions as too big to fail would be a major departure from what was expected after Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage in 2010. At the time, concerns about non-bank firms like A.I.G. and the potential dangers of the so-called shadow banking system were running high.There was also debate over whether to designate other companies, like huge asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity, as too big to fail.\u201cIt appeared that they were taking a \u2018Noah\u2019s Ark\u2019 approach to designation \u2014 eventually they wanted to designate two or three of the largest organizations in every financial services industry that was out there,\u201d said Thomas Vartanian, a partner at the law firm Dechert. He helped file an amicus brief in the MetLife case on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and has represented other parties before the financial stability council.Avoiding being labeled too big to fail would be a boon for non-bank financial firms, which have sought changes to the labeling process and guidance on how to have a designation lifted.\u201cWe welcome the administration\u2019s examination of the designation process and look forward to reviewing the Treasury report once it\u2019s complete,\u201d Prudential said in a statement. \u201cPrudential has long maintained that we do not meet the standard for designation and that the flaws in the F.S.O.C. designation process led to this outcome.\u201dPrudential, based in Newark, is subject to supervision of its operations, including activities outside of insurance, by state regulators, under a 2014 New Jersey law. That is in addition to stricter oversight by the Fed.\u201cWe support the need for groupwide supervision and believe that this supervision is already being carried out by our state regulators, who have deep insight into the insurance industry and our business activities,\u201d the company added in its statement.Allowing A.I.G. to shed the label could be politically complicated, given the firm\u2019s role in the financial crisis and the $182 billion government bailout it received, although the company has streamlined its operations substantially since 2008.The Treasury said in July that the financial stability council had convened to discuss issues that included a continuing re-evaluation of the designation status of an unnamed company and the MetLife litigation. The council conducts an annual review of firms that have been designated.A.I.G. did not respond to requests for comment.In the 2016 ruling that allowed MetLife to shed the label, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of Federal District Court in the District of Columbia said regulators had fallen short in their analysis supporting the designation and had failed to properly account for the costs of being designated. The Treasury has been directed to take up those issues in its coming report, which is a response to a White House memo in April that requested a \u201cthorough review\u201d of the designation process.The court has suspended the MetLife case until the Treasury issues its report.Critics of the label have often pointed to the financial stability council\u2019s power to scrutinize risky practices as an alternative to singling out individual companies. The theory is that financial activities that could be cause for concern should be monitored industrywide, regardless of a company\u2019s size or market influence.\u201cA lot of the designation process has been very binary \u2014 yes or no, are you in or are you out?\u201d said Russ Grote, a managing director with the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies.The council has employed such an alternative approach in exercising its oversight of asset managers, studying certain practices and products rather than zeroing in on individual companies.Randolph J. Clerihue, a MetLife spokesman, said in a statement that \u201cif any financial company engages in activities that could pose systemic risk, primary regulators should target those activities directly.\u201d\u201cThe life insurance business model of making long-term promises and backing them with long-term assets does not create systemic risk,\u201d he added. \u201cInsurance companies are extensively regulated by the states, and there has never been a systemic failure of a state-regulated insurance company.\u201dDefenders of the current system said they were worried about efforts to strip regulators of designation authority.Dennis M. Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, an advocacy group that has filed briefs in support of the government in the MetLife case, said that labeling potentially risky firms and monitoring problematic activities were essential for rooting out threats to the financial system.\u201cOne without the other would be intentionally blinding yourself to potential systemic risks,\u201d he said, warning that a reduction in oversight could lead to another crisis.\u201cIf the Trump administration is not careful, it is going to recreate the pre-crisis, two-tier regulatory system, where banks are heavily regulated and non-banks, including gigantic non-banks, are going to be unregulated,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

It will be a limited pleasure for many (if they feel it at all), but for the fan of this sort of thing, it will be sufficient.The show takes place in an everyday New York \u2014 the Guggenheim Museum, San Remo apartments, Midtown hot-dog carts \u2014 with some major differences.

{"Headline": "Trump Bypasses Republicans to Strike Deal on Debt Limit and Harvey Aid", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump struck a deal with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday to increase the debt limit and finance the government until mid-December, blindsiding his own Republican allies as he reached across the aisle to resolve a major dispute for the first time since taking office.The agreement would avert a fiscal showdown later this month without the bloody, partisan battle that many had anticipated by combining a debt ceiling increase and stopgap spending measure with relief aid to Texas and other areas devastated by Hurricane Harvey. But without addressing the fundamental underlying issues, it set up the prospect for an even bigger clash at the end of the year.In embracing the three-month deal, Mr. Trump accepted a Democratic proposal that had been rejected earlier in the day by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Trump\u2019s snap decision at a White House meeting caught Republican leaders off guard and reflected friction between the president and his party. After weeks of criticizing Republican leaders for failing to pass legislation, Mr. Trump signaled that he was willing to cross party lines to score some much-desired legislative victories.The deal to keep the government open and paying its debts until Dec. 15 represented an extraordinary public turn for the president, who has for much of his term set himself up on the right flank of the Republican Party. But it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s collaboration with Democrats foreshadowed a more sustained shift in strategy by a president who has presented himself as a master dealmaker or amounted to just a one-time instinctual reaction of a mercurial leader momentarily eager to poke his estranged allies.\u201cWe had a very good meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters after the Oval Office session without mentioning that Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders had also attended. Regarding the immigration program, Mr. Trump said, \u201cChuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I.\u201dDemocrats were grinning at their surprise victory and happy to rub it in. \u201cIt was a really good moment of some bipartisanship,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. He added: \u201cThe bottom line is the president listened to the arguments. We think we made a very reasonable and strong argument. And to his credit, he went with the better argument.\u201dUntil now, Mr. Trump has sought to govern through the strength of Republican majorities in Congress, an approach that has not secured top priorities like repealing Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program. After castigating Democrats as obstructionists, Mr. Trump may now seek common cause on areas of mutual interest like infrastructure projects, immigration and taxes.Soon after meeting with congressional leaders at the White House, the president boarded Air Force One to fly to North Dakota to push for a tax overhaul. Among the onboard guests was Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the first Democratic lawmaker to join Mr. Trump aboard Air Force One since he was inaugurated in January.At the event, at an oil refinery in Ms. Heitkamp\u2019s hometown, Mandan, Mr. Trump called her onto the stage with her Republican colleagues.\u201cEveryone\u2019s saying, \u2018What\u2019s she doing up here?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said as she joined him in front of an audience filled with Republicans. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 good woman. And I think we\u2019ll have your support. I hope we\u2019ll have your support. And thank you very much, Senator.\u201dWhile Ms. Heitkamp can hardly afford to alienate Mr. Trump, she has been cagey about the tax issue. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging he committed to promoting American workers as key to any tax reform policy,\u201d she said in a statement after the president\u2019s visit on Wednesday. \u201cBut, as North Dakota\u2019s former tax commissioner, I know the devil is in the details of any reform plan as tax codes are complex.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s courtship of Democrats left conservatives miffed at a spending-and-debt deal they considered anathema to their principles. \u201cThe question of politics is, a deal to what end?\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cI think all of us as taxpayers need to be very skeptical of deals for the sake of deals.\u201dRepresentative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, expressed surprise at Mr. Trump\u2019s action. \u201cI\u2019m still processing this, but my first instinct is I\u2019m not very happy about it,\u201d he said.Conservative groups like FreedomWorks and For America expressed indignation. \u201cThis is straight out of the swamp,\u201d said Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, \u201cand I call on President Trump to say something publicly about how this is a swamp deal and will not be tolerated.\u201dThe agreement came as the House overwhelmingly approved nearly $8 billion in disaster aid in response to Harvey, taking quick action to help victims of the devastating flooding in Texas. The aid measure passed 419 to 3. The \u201cno\u201d votes were Republican.Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi pressed for a three-month deal to keep the government running and raise the debt ceiling along with the hurricane aid to give Democrats leverage later this year when other matters, including a longer-term government funding deal, could be negotiated between the two parties. By ensuring that all the pending issues converge at the end of the year, Democrats hope a longer-term agreement on fiscal matters could include immigration, health care and any number of other issues.Assuming that he had the support of Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan responded Wednesday morning by calling the Democrats\u2019 proposal \u201cridiculous and disgraceful,\u201d saying \u201cit could put in jeopardy the kind of hurricane response we need to have.\u201d\u201cTo play politics with the debt ceiling, like Schumer and Pelosi apparently are doing, I don\u2019t think is a good idea,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Once they arrived at the White House, however, Mr. Trump undercut Mr. Ryan. Congressional aides said privately that Republicans went into the meeting at the White House proposing an 18-month deal on government spending and the debt limit, only to run into resistance from the Democrats. They then proposed a six-month deal as a compromise, but Democrats insisted on a three-month agreement. Mr. Trump then surprised the Republicans by agreeing to the Democratic formulation.\u201cWe essentially came to a deal, and I think the deal will be very good,\u201d Mr. Trump said afterward. \u201cWe had a very, very cordial and professional meeting.\u201dPeter Baker and Thomas Kaplan reported from Washington and Michael D. Shear from Mandan, N.D.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chief Executive of Social Finance, an Online Lending Start-Up, to Step Down", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Finance, an online lender that is one of the more prominent financial technology start-ups, said on Monday that its co-founder and chief executive Mike Cagney planned to step down by the end of the year.In addition, Mr. Cagney may have been overaggressive in expanding SoFi\u2019s business, skirting risk and compliance controls, said people with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.In a letter to employees, sent on Monday evening, Mr. Cagney wrote that \u201cthe combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company\u2019s core mission.\u201d Mr. Cagney is stepping down as both chief executive and chairman, and the company said it had begun a search to find a new chief.The episodes have tarnished the image of Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem \u2014 which has long painted itself as a place of innovation, ideas and progressive workplaces \u2014 and it raises concerns about whether these start-ups and their investors operate under a sufficient number of checks and balances.A spokesman for SoFi disputed the notion that the company had taken on too much risk in its business. The spokesman also said that the board investigated a dispute between Mr. Cagney, a married father of two, and a former employee, Laura Munoz, in 2012, and it found no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship. The company reached a settlement after the investigation.Mr. Cagney did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.SoFi was founded in 2011 and began by offering online refinancing the loans of students. Since then, it has branched out to offer mortgages and personal loans, and it recently began the process of applying for a banking license. The privately held company, which is valued at more than $4 billion, has raised nearly $2 billion from investors, including SoftBank, Discovery Capital and Baseline Ventures.The lawsuit did not initially name Mr. Cagney, but he was later added as a defendant. He is accused in the lawsuit of \u201cempowering other managers to engage in sexual conduct in the workplace.\u201dThe chief executive has long been the touchstone of the company and its most central figure. According to interviews with more than 30 people familiar with the company, Mr. Cagney often overstepped personal and business boundaries. The people asked to stay anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.In 2012, for example, Mr. Cagney sent sexually explicit text messages to Ms. Munoz, an executive assistant, according to five people who saw the messages or discussed them with Mr. Cagney and Ms. Munoz. Months later, the company and board agreed to pay Ms. Munoz a $75,000 settlement.Ivo Labar, a lawyer representing Ms. Munoz, said matters were resolved between her and SoFi and declined further comment.That same year, Mr. Cagney pursued a relationship with another employee, and three colleagues said they saw them holding hands.The SoFi spokesman said that the company did not comment on personnel matters.In SoFi\u2019s loan business, at least one of the company\u2019s initial products may not have been what it appeared. According to interviews, sales documents and correspondence between investors and company executives, the company said it had raised $90 million in debt financing for one of the loan products that it sold to investors in 2012.That financing never took place. Some executives were upset about the misrepresentation to the company\u2019s sales teams and to the investors. The issue was brought to the board, which made no changes.SoFi eventually bought the loans back from investors. SoFi\u2019s spokesman said that \u201cno consumers were harmed in the process\u201d of rectifying the situation.In a statement on Monday, SoFi said it funded $3.1 billion in loans in the second quarter, producing more than $134 million in revenue. The company said it had lent more than $20 billion to more than 350,000 borrowers.The company also said on Monday that Mr. Cagney would be replaced immediately as the company\u2019s chairman by another board member, Tom Hutton, who is an early investor in SoFi.Mr. Cagney, a native of the Philadelphia area, majored in economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, before starting his career at Wells Fargo. After climbing the ranks to the trading desk there, he left to begin his own financial software company, and then his own hedge fund, Cabezon, in 2005. On the side, he attended the business school at Stanford.SoFi was created in 2011 by Mr. Cagney and four co-founders, all of whom had been classmates at Stanford. From the beginning, Mr. Cagney clearly ran the show. But his behavior appeared to take a toll on the people around him, and his co-founders left the company one by one. Now, Mr. Cagney is set to follow them.\u201cI believe now is the right time for SoFi to start the search for a new leader,\u201d Mr. Cagney said in a statement. \u201cI could not be more proud of the company we\u2019ve built together, and I look forward to passing the baton to a new C.E.O. who can continue SoFi\u2019s mission of revolutionizing personal finance, helping our members to get ahead and find financial success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Can U.S. States Fight Climate Change if Trump Quits the Paris Accord?", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a key question has always lingered: How much can these states really do on climate by themselves, without help from the federal government?\u201cTogether, we are a political and economic force, and we will drive the change that needs to happen nationwide,\u201d Mr. Brown said at a news conference in New York, held as world leaders were gathering for the United Nations General Assembly.For the country to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement, further action by states would be needed. The alliance could try to persuade other governors to ratchet up their ambitions, though those prospects are uncertain, since barriers to climate policy in Republican-leaning states are often as much political as technical. Or the alliance states could pursue even deeper cuts themselves. But here, experts say, they may face practical limits on how far they can go to tackle global warming on their own.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Within the climate alliance, most of the efforts to date have focused on cleaning up electric grids. Collectively, emissions from electricity in the alliance states are expected to drop by half between 2005 and 2025, the Rhodium Group analysis found.Here, the outlook is murkier. According to the Rhodium Group, emissions from cars and trucks in the alliance states are expected to fall just 18 percent by 2025. By contrast, emissions from sectors like buildings, heavy industry and agriculture are hardly expected to decline at all. These sectors are expected to make up more than 60 percent of alliance states\u2019 emissions by 2025.\u201cI see state action as important, but ultimately, if we\u2019re serious about deep decarbonization, the federal government needs to get back involved,\u201d said David M. Hart, who studies energy policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.\u201cRight now, solar and wind are still a relatively small slice of electricity, so this isn\u2019t a big problem yet,\u201d Mr. Clack said. But as these sources grow, he said, individual state efforts to build out their own renewable bases without broader coordination could lead to a system that is less well-suited to handling large quantities of wind and solar.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a virtue of necessity,\u201d said Richard Kauffman, Governor Cuomo\u2019s chairman of energy and finance. \u201cIn an ideal world, it would be fantastic if we had the federal government providing leadership and investing in R&D and energy infrastructure. But that\u2019s not only not the world we\u2019re in \u2014 with this administration, it\u2019s not even close to the world that we\u2019re in.\u201dAnd it remains to be seen if the climate alliance can keep adding members. \u201cThere was already heavy political pressure in these states to move forward on clean energy,\u201d said David G. Victor, a climate policy expert at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cBut just because these states demonstrate that it can be done doesn\u2019t mean the politics suddenly shift in places like Kentucky or Kansas.\u201dThe ultimate significance of these state efforts, Dr. Victor said, may be to help prevent international climate efforts from collapsing, by reassuring other countries that the United States has not totally abandoned the issue.\u201cNow that the rest of the world is over the initial reaction to Trump, they\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s still real and what\u2019s not in U.S. policy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these states can offer a starting point for other countries to gauge U.S. climate action, even when what\u2019s happening in Washington is chaotic.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Puerto Rico Fall Into an Economic Abyss", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAlmost nothing on the planet, short of nuclear weaponry, destroys economic value as rapidly as a mega-hurricane. In Puerto Rico, decades of economic progress were undone in 12 hours by Hurricane Maria.With millions lacking electricity or potable water, avoiding a humanitarian disaster should be President Trump\u2019s top priority. But these immediate needs are just the beginning of Puerto Rico\u2019s long road to recovery. As Congress considers an aid package in the days and weeks ahead, it\u2019s important to grasp the truly extraordinary scale of the storm\u2019s economic devastation.In all five cases, those strikes were on much smaller islands (Guam, Hong Kong and the Northern Marianas) making it easier to achieve high-intensity scores per area of land affected. More notably, all five were in the Pacific Ocean, whose wide, warm expanse gives cyclones a long runway to intensify. In more than 60 years of data, no Atlantic hurricane was a disaster as epic as Maria slamming into Puerto Rico.But sadly, the largest costs are yet to come. Research with Professor Jina shows hurricanes can have a strong effect on economic growth over the following decades. Historically, a 1-in-10 cyclone event slows per capita income growth in the affected country to the point that it is 7 percent poorer two decades after the storm. This is on par with losses from an average financial or banking crisis.Maria\u2019s impact may be much worse. To determine how much worse, we used an econometric model of the costs of cyclones over the past 60 years and applied it to the characteristics of Hurricane Maria and the pre-storm economic conditions in Puerto Rico. We calculated that Maria could lower Puerto Rican incomes by 21 percent over the next 15 years \u2014 a cumulative $180 billion in lost economic output. Supposing that Puerto Rico had been on track to sustain its 0.8 percent real per capita annual growth between 2009 and 2015, then we would expect to see Maria undo all those gains and then some. It could now take 26 years for the next generation to get back to where we are today, assuming that per capita growth rate would have continued.In percentage terms, the loss to the Puerto Rican economy is on par with the most heavily hit states during the Great Recession. For Puerto Rico, Maria could be as economically costly as the 1997 Asian financial crisis was to Indonesia and Thailand and more than twice as damaging as the 1994 Peso Crisis was to Mexico \u2014 but this time on American soil.But this doesn\u2019t need to become Puerto Rico\u2019s destiny. Sufficient, timely, sustained and well-designed disaster relief from Washington can help mitigate Maria\u2019s impact. The island\u2019s electrical grid needs to be rebuilt from scratch, and fast, to deliver lifesaving services now and to enable broader recovery and reinvestment in the months ahead. Thousands of buildings need to be repaired or replaced.Timely assistance can help ensure that this construction can happen without bankrupting families and small businesses, which would deprive Puerto Rico of private investment and household spending at the very moment it\u2019s most needed. Research has shown that people tend to leave storm-battered areas if there\u2019s not prompt outside support to rebuild and reinvest. If there is that support, people are more likely to remain.The Puerto Rican government has little ability to finance reconstruction of roads, power communications and other infrastructure, and these will need to be built differently, because Maria is certainly not the last storm we will see. Smart investments now can reduce the economic damage the next time.Attempting to grasp the true scale of devastation in the wake of Maria is mind-bending and heartbreaking. As Congress considers a Hurricane Maria aid package, it should not ignore these numbers. It is in everyone\u2019s interest to try to keep Puerto Rico\u2019s economy from falling into the abyss. And most important, we have a mutual duty to one another as Americans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Months After Second Avenue Subway Opening, Safety Testing Is Not Finished", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a rush to finish New York City\u2019s long-awaited Second Avenue subway by a New Year\u2019s Day deadline imposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority failed to complete final safety testing before opening the line to the public, according to oversight reports submitted to the federal government.When the stations opened on Jan. 1, the fire alarm system was still being tested and more than 17,000 defects found during inspections had not been fixed, according to the reports. One report noted that the large number of outstanding problems indicated that \u201cquality was compromised for schedule acceleration.\u201dNow more than eight months after the lavish opening, complete with sparkling wine and an elegant midnight celebration on New Year\u2019s Eve, the subway line is still operating under a temporary safety certificate, according to the Federal Transit Administration.Crews have had to be posted along the line to watch for fires \u2014 an expensive effort meant to serve as a stopgap. The project is not expected to earn its final safety certificate until November, according to the reports, which were prepared for the Federal Transit Administration and obtained by The Times through a Freedom of Information law request.John McCarthy, a spokesman for the authority, defended the authority on Wednesday. \u201cThe stations on the new Second Avenue line are completely safe and they have been since the day they opened,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement. \u201cThey feature state-of-the-art technology for fire protection, closed-circuit monitoring and new public address systems \u2014 any suggestion that safety was at all compromised to meet the deadline to open is patently false.\u201d\u201cIt would be better to wait a couple more months and get it right, rather than prematurely have a ribbon-cutting ceremony to benefit the governor,\u201d said Larry Penner, a former official at the Federal Transit Administration who oversaw grants for projects in New York and New Jersey.Officials at the authority have not publicly discussed its safety precautions on the new line or provided updates on the continuing work to the authority\u2019s board at monthly meetings. The outstanding problems on the line, according to the authority, include minor issues such as fixing door closures and signage and are akin to a punch list of issues that are usually addressed before a final home inspection. But the oversight reports themselves do not detail all the items on the list or whether they might be more substantial.The authority\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, said the quality of construction work was not sacrificed to meet the deadline and that the \u201cpunch list\u201d items remaining after the opening did not impact safety. \u201cThe project was not opened prematurely,\u201d Mr. Lhota said in an interview. \u201cIt was opened when it was safe to be opened.\u201dMr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has made infrastructure projects a central focus of his administration as he burnishes his image for a possible presidential run. But the governor\u2019s hands-on involvement in the Second Avenue subway is an example of how he tends to move aggressively on glittery, new projects, while more mundane concerns like maintenance, whose negligence has contributed to the subway system\u2019s collapse, have languished.Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement: \u201cThe M.T.A. does safety inspections for the entire system and they certified that the Second Avenue subway stations were safe to open.\u201dOn a recent evening, a worker in a neon \u201csafety\u201d vest and a hard hat patrolled the 72nd Street station, but declined to discuss his job. Another man in similar clothes paced the mezzanine level at the 86th Street station. At the 96th Street station, two M.T.A. workers said crews in neon vests were there regularly to check for safety problems.Michael Horodniceanu, the former president of capital construction at the authority who oversaw the Second Avenue subway, said he was confident that any safety issues were addressed before the opening, even if all of the testing was not done.\u201cThe governor may have pushed, but we would not have opened anything if it was not 100 percent safe,\u201d Mr. Horodniceanu said.Regarding posting safety crews along the line, Mr. Horodniceanu said: \u201cThere is nothing safer than having a fire watch. It\u2019s like having a fireman there.\u201dWhen the line opened, the authority agreed to address the outstanding problems within 60 days, according to the oversight reports. When officials missed that deadline, it was extended to April 15. By the end of May \u2014 the most recent report available \u2014 there were still 7,264 defects.Philip Plotch, an assistant professor at St. Peter\u2019s University in Jersey City who is writing a book about the Second Avenue subway, said he was concerned that the authority had not been transparent about the unfinished work and that it was not clear whether its board members knew about it. Fixing these problems after the opening is more expensive because trains are running round-the-clock, he said, limiting the time crews have to do work.\u201cWe the public have no idea how much it costs and what they\u2019re taking money away from,\u201d Mr. Plotch said.But the authority had not revealed that final testing for the fire alarms at each station was not finished. On Dec. 29, 2016, a safety committee at New York City Transit issued a certificate that allowed the stations to open on a temporary basis. One committee member did not sign the certificate, the reports note, though they do not identify the member or provide a reason for the omission.The company that prepared the oversight reports, Urban Engineers of New York, said in a January report that it was \u201cconcerned that the certification process has been circumvented\u201d regarding safety.Steven Kulm, a spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration, said the safe operation of the Second Avenue subway was the responsibility of New York City Transit and a state safety oversight agency called the Public Transportation Safety Board.\u201cThe F.T.A. does not have a role in the daily operation of the service, nor was it involved in the decision by N.Y.C.T. to issue an interim safety certificate prior to [Second Avenue subway]commencing revenue service,\u201d Mr. Kulm said in a statement.The agency does, however, provide an oversight role for federally funded projects like the Second Avenue subway, which received $1.3 billion in federal funding. The goal of the oversight reports is to examine whether a project is executed efficiently and the recipient should receive funds in the future.The reports repeatedly question the project\u2019s rising costs. The first phase of the Second Avenue subway, which includes three new stations, was expected to cost $4.4 billion, according to the authority, but the full costs are not yet known.In the months before the Second Avenue subway opened, Kent Haggas, an independent engineer for the project, provided monthly updates to the authority\u2019s board. But Mr. Haggas has not appeared at the board meetings this year to provide further updates.Mr. Penner, the former federal transit official, said the delays on the first phase of the subway did not bode well for the second phase, which would extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem.\u201cYou want the Second Avenue subway to be shown in the most positive light, especially when you\u2019re looking for federal financing,\u201d Mr. Penner said. \u201cWhy would you take so long to clean up these loose ends?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iPhone 8 Reviews: What the Critics Say", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnsurprisingly, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are very good phones. Most of Apple\u2019s improvements over the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are minor, but if you have an older model, either of the 8s will feel like a solid upgrade. And if you are considering upgrading from an Android phone, there\u2019s one area where the new iPhones still rank head and shoulders above their competition \u2014 the processor, the engine that runs the entire device, where Apple is so far ahead that it almost feels unfair.The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus may not be as flashy as the iPhone X, but anyone upgrading from an older model will appreciate the jumps. Coming from the iPhone 6s, for instance, you\u2019re getting double the storage, the option to wirelessly charge your iPhone, a refreshed design, and a faster camera. If you\u2019re coming from the iPhone 7 family, on the other hand, it\u2019s harder to make the case.While the 8 and 8 Plus share a processor, wireless charging capability, and similar camera setups to the X, they lack any truly new ideas about what an iPhone is \u2014 they\u2019re both very much just the next step along a path Apple\u2019s been on for quite some time now.So what\u2019s actually new? The most commonly cited improvements included the camera, wireless charging and augmented reality abilities.The new \u201ccolor filter\u201d and \u201cdeeper pixels\u201d in the 8 and 8 Plus mean more vivid colors and less noise. The new image signal processor helps optimize features like exposure, autofocus, and HDR, before you take the photo.What that means in practice is more detailed photos that really only appear more detailed if you zoom way, way in.Once you\u2019ve tried pad charging, you won\u2019t go back. You come home from work, you just set the phone down on your way in. Or you set it down on your bedside table. Done.After testing early augmented reality apps, it\u2019s clear the feature is well executed and packs a genuine \u201cwow\u201d factor. It\u2019s most useful for games, shopping and a star gazing app that overlays constellations on the real night sky. It also offers the most enjoyable way to dissect a beating human heart in my kitchen yet.The iPhone 8 Plus definitely has better battery life than its smaller sibling, even when being used heavily. On a day where I had to use it for navigation, video streaming and plenty of email, it made it through the day and probably could have made it through the next morning without being in dire need of a top-up. The iPhone 8, when I used it, got down pretty low by the end of the day, at which point I switched to low power mode. In other words, it got me through a day, but not much further.What can you do with a phone that fast? Those new camera tricks, plus high frame-rate 4K video, wouldn\u2019t be possible without it. And it never hurts to try to futureproof the computer you use most. But the bottleneck on the apps I use most often is internet speed, not the processor. Aside from some 3-D games, I couldn\u2019t find many apps that require so much horsepower today.There\u2019s something about the texture of glass. It\u2019s smoother than the aluminum, but typically less slippery and easier to grip. Glass also warms up to the temperature of your hand faster and stays at that temperature rather than getting hot. And when your phone is really chugging along, it distributes the heat from the processor better, making hot spots less pronounced.Apple has painted us a picture of what its mobile future looks like, so is it any surprise the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus seem dull by comparison? To be clear, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re poorly designed. It\u2019s just that the iPhone\u2019s aesthetic hasn\u2019t changed much since the debut of the 6 and 6 Plus three years ago.For the first time in the 10-year history of the iPhone, I can\u2019t recommend buying the newest models.That\u2019s not because the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are bad phones. They\u2019re actually great.But an even better phone is on the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Primary Choices for the New York City Council", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "\nAs politicians in Washington slash budgets and break promises, local governments are forced to pick up the pieces. New York City\u2019s 51-member City Council is critical to this effort, trying as best it can to fill gaps in housing, education, welfare, immigration, the environment and other important matters.But attending to big-ticket problems is only part of the job. Each council member represents the equivalent of a midsize city \u2014 about 160,000 constituents. Calls come in constantly from people who need help fighting a dishonest landlord or muting a neighborhood bar or keeping the local deli from shutting its doors. Council members must also keep a hard eye on the city\u2019s powerful mayor and his $85 billion budget.Sadly, New Yorkers as a whole do not give the City Council races the attention they deserve. Turnout in city primaries has been lamentably low given the importance of the jobs. In one district with nearly 50,000 registered Democrats, only about 7,000 are expected to show up at the polls to pick their candidate.We can hope for better on Sept. 12, when Republicans and Democrats will be asked to choose their favorites in the 2017 primaries. Many incumbents have no real challengers, but here are five competitive races that we believe deserve special attention in the Democratic primary. In all five districts, the winning Democrat usually prevails in the general election in November.ManhattanQueensBrooklynManhattanQueensBrooklynThe incumbent, Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, is facing a rematch with Mel Wymore, a community activist who nearly won the seat four years ago. The Times endorsed Mr. Wymore in 2013, and he has argued well for better constituent services and such improvements as a vacancy fee to limit the time allowed for empty storefronts.Still, Ms. Rosenthal deserves another four years in office, if only for her courageous support for a new school desegregation plan in the district. She has also pushed to protect tenants being overrun by developers and unscrupulous landlords.BronxQueensA former State Senate aide, John Doyle, is also running, but Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s main threat is from Mark Gjonaj, a member of the State Assembly. Mr. Gjonaj\u2019s Albany record is modest, and he has too many connections to the old Bronx political machine. By far the most promising choice for this district would be Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez.BronxManhattanQueensThis one is easy. Assemblyman Francisco Moya deserves every primary vote in this district. His opponent is former State Senator Hiram Monserrate, who seems to be hoping that voters will not recall the video showing him dragging his girlfriend through an apartment lobby after he had just slashed her face with a piece of glass, that he was thrown out of the State Senate after being convicted of misdemeanor assault, and that he later pleaded guilty to misusing public funds and was sentenced to two years in prison.Mr. Monserrate, who has shown little remorse, simply does not belong in public service. Mr. Moya, in contrast, has worked in Albany to increase the minimum wage, reform the criminal justice system and provide more protections for construction workers. He would be a credit to this district.QueensManhattanBrooklynCouncilman Carlos Menchaca, a Mexican-American, is fighting to stay on for another four years. He deserves that extra time to continue his work helping immigrants now under siege as they try to stay in the country. He has pushed the city to provide lawyers for tenants facing housing court, and he has held up waterfront developments, arguing that they need to serve the whole community, not just the hip and moneyed crowd. He has important endorsements from many public officials, including two prominent members of Congress, Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and Jerrold Nadler.Mr. Menchaca\u2019s main rival is Felix Ortiz, a member of the State Assembly. Sara Gonzalez, who once represented this district, is also running to reclaim her old job. Mr. Ortiz, who has had some legislative success in Albany, could serve the area best by continuing his work in the Assembly, where his successes have included a law banning texting while driving. Ms. Gonzalez lost to Mr. Menchaca in 2013 after years of absenteeism and few legislative successes. Mr. Menchaca is a vibrant and forceful advocate for his district and for the less fortunate in the city. He should be rewarded with four more years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Booming Church and Its Complicated, Ugly Past", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "Zarephath Christian Church is a dynamic evangelical congregation. But perhaps it\u2019s best not to mention the sect\u2019s fiery founder who embraced the K.K.K.Supported byHundreds of people each weekend drive up the hill to a newly built $12 million church surrounded by soccer fields in a New Jersey community named Zarephath. They worship by singing along with rock-ballad style prayer songs, following lyrics projected on three overhead screens. They sway and lift their arms high overhead, or say the words quietly with their eyes closed.Drums, several guitars, keyboards and backup singers accompany the prayers. Spotlights shift from purple to blue to red as the mood builds.\u201cO come to the altar, the Father\u2019s arms are open wide,\u201d about 300 congregants sang during a recent Sunday service, in a sanctuary that resembles a warehouse-style concert hall, save for two small crosses near the stage. \u201cForgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.\u201dThe worshipers at the central New Jersey church were of every description \u2014 young, old, white, black, Asian, Hispanic. The friendly, name-tag-clad greeters at the entrance of the 70,000-square-foot space were there to help people find Bible study groups or inspirational cards in the gift shop.The growth is quite a turn for a local church that until about 10 years ago consisted of fewer than 200 members in a timeworn chapel across Weston Canal Road, on a bathtub of land saddled by repeated floods. And even though its leaders don\u2019t talk about it much, the church also represents the local revival of what was one of America\u2019s most unusual Protestant denominations.The contradictions of the sect\u2019s fiery founder create a kind of puzzle for the church\u2019s modern leadership. Pillar of Fire long ago moved away from the hate of the Klan, and its leaders have issued statements denouncing and regretting the church\u2019s historic involvement with it. In a sign of how different the modern church is, the local presiding elder of the denomination, Robert Saydee, is an African refugee.Yet Pillar of Fire owes its existence to Bishop White, the first female bishop of any Christian denomination in American history. Her traces remain everywhere in Zarephath, the agrarian faith community she founded here in 1905 and named for the town where Elijah found comfort from a widow in the Bible. And yet her complicated legacy is virtually ignored by church leaders, who can still disagree about the extent of her intolerance.As a result, many people who worship each week in Zarephath don\u2019t know about the church\u2019s history, or even that their church is part of the Pillar of Fire. (Or that the 750-acre parcel that makes up what is essentially the town of Zarephath is owned by the denomination.) The new church is built on the opposite side of the Delaware and Raritan Canal from the denomination\u2019s historic home, so it is easy to get there without seeing the old brick Pillar of Fire sign at the entrance to those grounds.\u201cWe like that the church is nondenominational, because we are nondenominational as well,\u201d said Sabrina Da Cruz, 34, who drove 40 minutes from Elizabeth, N.J., with her husband and infant to attend a service this summer. \u201cThey talk about Jesus, which is what a lot of people need. It\u2019s Jesus from beginning to end.\u201dThe woman at the center of Zarephath\u2019s story was born in 1862 to a poor family in rural Kentucky. Mollie Alma Bridwell, as she was known then, grew up wanting to be a preacher, but was told to marry one instead. Chafing at the restrictions, she started preaching in Denver, where her Methodist preacher husband was posted, and ultimately formed her own church. When a New Jersey widow, inspired by her writings, deeded her 70 acres of farmland between the Millstone River and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, she left Colorado, ultimately separating from her husband, and moved the denomination\u2019s headquarters here.Pillar of Fire gained considerable fame in the first decades of the 20th century, in part because of the oddity of a woman running a religious sect years before women had the right to vote. Puritianical and strident, Bishop White described her church\u2019s guiding principles as \u201cemancipation for women and ultra-fundamentalist doctrine.\u201d Yet her followers also tried to capture the joy of Christianity in their worship.Driven by curious press accounts, several radio stations, and her publishing operation \u2014 Bishop White edited six magazines and wrote some 35 books \u2014 membership grew. Dozens of Pillar of Fire churches were founded around the country. Pillar of Fire slowly bought up the surrounding farms around Zarephath, growing the community to some 1,200 acres, with its own ZIP code, power plant, bible college and fire station, church historians recounted.At the height of its popularity in the 1920s, scholars believe, as many as six million Americans belonged to the Klan. As its popularity waned in later years, so did Bishop White\u2019s support. But it didn\u2019t disappear completely. She republished edited versions of her pro-Klan books in 1943, three years before her death, with introductions by her son, the Rev. Arthur K. White, who would lead the denomination until the early 1980s.The following decades were overall a period of decline for Pillar of Fire in America, though some of its overseas mission churches \u2014 in Liberia, for example \u2014 flourished. Repeated floods of the Millstone River devastated historic Zarephath several times.The old dormitory of Alma White Bible College is now boarded up, and a family of beavers is in residence. The old chapel, whose cornerstone was set in 1926, has been closed since flooding from Hurricane Irene in 2011. The radio station, flooded out, now broadcasts from a few miles away in the Somerset section of Franklin Township.The radio station switched to a mainstream contemporary Christian music format, featuring upbeat, young hosts. Star 99.1 now reaches some 400,000 listeners per month, not counting its gospel and Christian hip-hop channels streaming online. Alma White College was reopened as Somerset Christian College, with Mr. Cruver as president. In 2013, it was again renamed, as Pillar College, and began offering secular degrees in business administration and other fields at offshoot campuses across New Jersey.In 2004, Mr. Cruver became senior pastor of the Zarephath church, when its 100 or so worshipers still fit in the old chapel. With his childhood friend from North Brunswick, Raphael Giglio, he set out to change the church to reach young families. Mr. Giglio, who identifies as a Messianic Jew \u2014 a Jew who believes Jesus Christ is the messiah \u2014 had been preaching and writing worship songs at a contemporary evangelical church in Tennessee. Mr. Cruver visited and thought something similar could work in Zarephath, Mr. Giglio recounted.Following the template of other contemporary evangelical churches, Zarephath Christian Church embraced power-chord-driven prayer ballads, line-by-line Bible study, and direct, informal prayers to Jesus. It focused on service projects \u2014 a free medical clinic on campus, a food pantry, an urban outreach ministry aimed at young men, overseas mission trips \u2014 and downplayed the tangled history of the denomination.In a sense, what is most unusual about Pillar of Fire is that it still survives.\u201cWhat they look like now is totally common across what you could think of as the megachurch type of model,\u201d said Richard Flory, senior director of research and evaluation at the University of Southern California Center for Religion and Civic Culture. \u201cA destination worship service, lots of programming, small groups, popular music. What\u2019s interesting is that in an effort to grow and become more attractive, they are sort of jettisoning their history in favor of looking like essentially everybody else.\u201dIn 2015, Mr. Cruver published a book called \u201cThe Blue Jeans Gospel,\u201d writing that a relationship with Jesus should be as comfortable as a favorite pair of jeans, which is what he and his ministry staff generally wore when preaching. (And like many evangelical ministers, he and his staff are addressed by their first names: Pastor Rob and Pastor Raphael.) The $12 million church opened, on higher ground from the historic campus, financed by a mixture of donations, land sales and loans from the Pillar of Fire.New congregants seem to love the result. \u201cFor me, I feel that the body here is really filled with the Spirit,\u201d said Rich Zebro, 56, from Hillsborough, who has been a Zarephath member for about six years. \u201cThe leadership is led by what the Lord would want to have happen.\u201dCheryl Barker, who is African-American, attended a Sunday service in July with her children. \u201cEveryone is just really accepting, they just accept you how you are,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the worshiping, you meet so many different people of all different races.\u201dAs the new pastors modernized the church, how to handle Bishop White\u2019s complex legacy was not really discussed. \u201cIt was so far in the past that it just had no relevance to the church at the time,\u201d said Mr. Giglio, who is now the interim senior pastor.\u201cIt is something in our past that we cannot hide or deny that it happened,\u201d said Robert Saydee, 50, the presiding local Pillar of Fire elder, who emigrated to the United States from Liberia, where he had been educated in a Pillar of Fire mission school. \u201cWe are not proud of it at all. But it happened in a history, and things happen to people, and the organization changed tremendously after that, and we never looked back.\u201dAs for Bishop White, Mr. Saydee said, \u201cThere is no reason to discuss her. We know she is the founder, but there is no discussion or preaching about her. No, we don\u2019t do that.\u201dHer own writings serve as impassioned reminders of the intolerance she embraced along with her Christian values. She believed, for example, that blacks, as descendants of Ham, a son of Noah in the Bible, were cursed from birth, and should not mix with whites.Yet in interviews, Mr. Giglio said he did not think Pillar of Fire \u201cwas ever a bigoted or racist organization,\u201d though he did allow that it was anti-Catholic. Jim Pearsall, 78, the denomination\u2019s archivist, said in an interview with Pillar of Fire leaders in July that he did not think the terms \u201canti-Semitic\u201d or \u201canti-Catholic\u201d accurately described Bishop White. Instead, he said, she was \u201copposed to the meddling of the Roman Catholic Church in politics.\u201dWhen Mysti Jordan was hired as a morning host at the Pillar of Fire station Star 99.1, the history of the denomination came up only briefly, she said. As a result, she didn\u2019t realize that its official call letters, WAWZ, stood for \u201cAlma White, Zarephath.\u201dBut with the amnesia about Bishop White also comes the loss of the example of an early feminist leader within conservative Christianity. Zarephath Christian Church does have one female pastor, which remains uncommon among contemporary evangelical churches, whose traditional reading of the Bible often leads to male leadership. Yet the governing board of Pillar of Fire is almost completely male.Another lesson she tried to teach was about the temptations of ministry. In her sermons, Bishop White had railed against the decadence of modern life, particularly declaring war on male Protestant ministers who used their religious positions to conceal lusts for women, tobacco and other vices, wrote Kathleen M. Blee in her 1991 book, \u201cWomen of the Klan.\u201dThese warnings reverberate today. Mr. Cruver, the charismatic preacher and author of \u201cThe Blue Jeans Gospel,\u201d failed to heed them.In February, he humbled himself before his burgeoning congregation, whose average weekend attendance is now around 1,400. In two Sunday services, he admitted he had been carrying on an adulterous affair and announced he was stepping down from church leadership to repair his family, church members said. (Mr. Cruver declined to comment for this article.)Studying how other churches have weathered such scandals, Zarephath\u2019s leaders said they decided to be as open as possible with their followers about it. The remaining pastors reminded the congregants that they are at church to follow God, not an individual. \u201cAnd God is still here,\u201d said the Rev. Al Shjarback, an assistant pastor.The church is now searching for a new senior pastor, the latest trial for a denomination which has survived many. Its weekly attendance, said Mr. Giglio, has dropped about 10 percent since Mr. Cruver\u2019s departure.\u201cWe are here to share the mission of Jesus Christ,\u201d Mr. Saydee said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we still exist. If we were doing something wrong, we would have probably died like everything else dies. But the message that got us here is still a message that will keep us here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dyhrenfurth had retired to Salzburg.\u201cThere is no guarantee we\u2019ll make it,\u201d Mr. Dyhrenfurth said in preparing for the trip, which took two and a half years to plan and cost $326,000 (about $2.6 million today), partly financed by the National Geographic Society in Washington. \u201cAnyone who does guarantee it is either a fool or a confidence man. We may fail.\u201dMr. Dyhrenfurth\u2019s breakthrough began in May 1960, when he was the cameraman for a Swiss-Austrian expedition to Dhaulagiri, a Himalayan massif that includes the world\u2019s seventh-highest mountain.The next month, he sought permission from Nepal\u2019s government for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He received a permit in May 1961.Two of the climbers \u2014 Thomas F. Hornbein, an anesthesiologist, and Willi Unsoeld, a Peace Corps director \u2014 argued that climbing in Mr. Hillary\u2019s footsteps was too modest a goal, and urged trying a new but more dangerous route, the West Ridge.Mr. Dyhrenfurth said that getting an American to the top was the priority, and that Mr. Hillary\u2019s route, the South Col, was the more certain \u2014 if less adventurous \u2014 path. Mr. Whittaker sided with Mr. Dyhrenfurth.The climb was far from smooth. On March 23, an icefall buried and killed one climber, Jake Breitenbach. Mr. Dyhrenfurth, who was praised for his democratic and team-oriented leadership style, called a meeting at which the collective decision was made to continue the expedition.As the team approached the so-called Death Zone, a region of thin air above 25,000 feet, one climber suffered pulmonary edema, another a blood clot.Mr. Dyhrenfurth decided that Mr. Whittaker and a Sherpa guide, Nawang Gombu, would make the first assault on the summit, while two other climbers \u2014 Luther G. Jerstad, a college drama teacher, and Barry C. Bishop, a National Geographic Society cameraman \u2014 would make the second.Stumbling forward, and battling 60-mile-an-hour winds and a windchill factor of roughly minus 85 to minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Mr. Whittaker and Mr. Gombu staggered to the summit. They had run out of oxygen and spent only 20 minutes at the top before starting the treacherous journey back down.Mr. Dyhrenfurth and another Sherpa, Ang Dawa, had stayed at the high camp. The next morning, all four returned to the base camp.Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth was born on May 7, 1918, in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), to two accomplished Himalayan climbers, G\u00fcnter and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His father was also a geology professor.The family left for Austria in the 1920s and then settled in Switzerland, where they became citizens, before emigrating to the United States in the late 1930s.Mr. Dyhrenfurth made money as a ski instructor and mountain guide and became known for climbing many mountains, including Mount St. Agnes in Alaska, the Teton Range in Wyoming and the White Mountains of New Hampshire.He is survived by his longtime partner, Maria Sernetz.At the reunion, Mr. Dyhrenfurth recalled that some people had been skeptical when he first proposed the climb\u201cAmericans, when I first raised it, they said, \u2018Well, Everest, it\u2019s been done.

It can no longer accept American volunteers unless it wins exemptions from the travel ban.For now, the fall semester started with 20 to 25 non-American foreign volunteers, according to Colin McCulloch, the university\u2019s director of external relations.The university said in a statement that it was recruiting more non-American volunteers willing to teach there.Washington has said it would consider a one-time, special-validation visa for journalists, humanitarian workers, Red Cross officials and those who travel for \u201cthe national interest.\u201d The Pyongyang university said it would apply for such a visa for American volunteers.The university\u2019s founding chairman, James Kim, and its chancellor, Park Chan-mo, both American passport- holders, visited the campus in August but had to leave last week before the travel ban went into effect, university officials said.The Pyongyang university was founded in 2010 with the goal of helping North Korea\u2019s future elite learn the skills to modernize and open up the isolated country.

Hatch, Republican of Utah, and the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon.\u201cCongress needs to act quickly to extend the funding for CHIP,\u201d said Mr. Hatch, who helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.Mr. Hatch said the agreement would provide \u201cuninterrupted funding for CHIP\u201d and \u201cincreased flexibility for states to administer the program.\u201dThe agreement would provide federal funds for the program for five additional years.Mr. Wyden said the agreement was \u201ca great deal for America\u2019s kids.\u201dWhen the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010, some members of Congress suggested that the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program would no longer be needed because youngsters and their families could get coverage on the open market. But policy experts say that prediction was wrong. Several studies have found that CHIP coverage provides better, more comprehensive benefits for children, at lower cost, than the health plans sold on insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.The federal government and the states have historically shared the costs of the CHIP program, with the federal government paying a larger share in states where personal incomes are low. The Affordable Care Act increased the federal share in each state by 23 percentage points. As a result, the federal government pays the entire cost in 11 states.The agreement by Mr. Hatch and Mr. Wyden would gradually restore the financial partnership between the federal government and the states. The federal share would continue to be enhanced by 23 percentage points, as under current law, for two more years, in 2018 and 2019. The increase would then be halved, to 11.5 percentage points, in 2020, and would be eliminated in 2021 and 2022.The federal government would still pay a larger share of costs in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program than in Medicaid.House Republicans have expressed a desire to extend the program for five years, but have not worked out the details of legislation.President Trump\u2019s budget proposed extending the program for two years, through 2019, and called for changes to focus the program on \u201cthe most vulnerable low-income families and children that the program was intended to serve.\u201d But the administration has not been deeply involved in deliberations on Capitol Hill.Nearly 90 percent of children in CHIP are in families with annual incomes below twice the poverty level \u2014 less than about $49,000 for a family of four. Since the program was created, the proportion of children who are uninsured has fallen to less than 5 percent today, from nearly 14 percent in 1997.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Bring Your Vacation Home With You", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cruel thing about vacations is that they are pleasurable but finite. I recently had time to contemplate this unwelcome fact during a 10-hour flight home from a Greek island where I had spent a paradisiacal two weeks. I found myself wondering about the relationship between the duration of a vacation and the longevity of its mental health benefits.Is a large amount of time off the secret to bringing your vacation home with you?We Americans have been preoccupied with the length of our vacations for some time. William Howard Taft, our 27th president, opined on the subject in 1910 in an interview with The New York Times. He claimed that \u201ctwo to three months\u2019 vacation are necessary\u201d for someone \u201cto work the next year with the energy and effectiveness it ought to have.\u201dTwo to three months? For most of us, that is not a possibility.Not to worry, I have good news: Vacation research \u2014 yes, there is such a thing \u2014 shows that beyond a week or two away from work, more time off isn\u2019t going to make you happier or calmer or produce more lasting gains of another sort.I know this finding runs counter to the popular notion that you can\u2019t sufficiently recover from work stress or burnout without a long and leisurely break. But in fact several other studies have also failed to find a measurable psychological benefit to vacations that stretched beyond two weeks.Curiously, the Dutch researchers also found that those who couldn\u2019t resist the urge to do a little work while on vacation were no less likely to reap the benefits than those who avoided all work. So no need to banish your phones entirely. Perhaps the key to enjoyment on vacation is the ability to control what you do, and to do what is most natural to you. Workaholics might find \u201cenforced\u201d relaxation stressful. By all means let them work a little on vacation!At first glance, such research seems to support the idea that the best way to maximize the benefits of your vacation is to take shorter and more frequent breaks. Perhaps. But my personal and clinical experiences suggest that there might be something more to the effective vacation than just the proper length: namely, the importance of unexpected, immersive experiences.Consider a former patient of mine, a hard-driving guy in finance who rarely, if ever, took time off and who finally agreed to a vacation at the urging \u2014 or more accurately, the threats \u2014 of his wife. Reluctantly, off he went with his wife to Tuscany.Two weeks later, he returned to my office looking unusually relaxed. He related the following incident: He\u2019d been driving in a little village when his car stalled out at a train crossing. Panicked, he and his wife got out and prepared for the worst, when a local farmer came by and offered to tow the car to safety. The farmer also insisted on taking them to his house for lunch, which turned into an all-day affair.At first, the experience disconcerted my patient, who had carefully planned his vacation to the minute. But in the end he could not have been more delighted by this unexpected encounter. In fact, he referred to it repeatedly in his therapy after that.My patient had no pictures or videos to show me, just a sharp and indelible memory that he carried with him. And that I suspect is key to a great and long-lasting vacation: He allowed himself to be open to the unforeseen and immersed in his experience.In contrast, I think back to all the people I observed on my recent vacation armed with smartphones and cameras, diligently documenting the beauty around them. It made me wonder whether in the attempt to record and preserve our pleasure, we become observers of our experience rather than full participants in it.Looking at the hundreds of pictures I took drove this possibility home. There were scores of perfect sunsets, shots of the glittering sea \u2014 all beautiful to look at, but largely incapable of arousing in me the feeling of being there. I was probably too busy capturing the moment to be part of it.I do have one unglamorous, poorly framed shot of a dish of grilled octopus at a simple seaside taverna where I spent an unplanned afternoon talking with the charming owner. Whether or not I look at that image, when I think of that lunch, the pleasure of the afternoon comes rushing back.That, I believe, is the way to bring your vacation home \u2014 not as a collection of recorded moments but as a few vivid experiences you allow to take you by surprise.Richard A. Friedman is a professor of clinical psychiatry and the director of the psychopharmacology clinic at the Weill Cornell Medical College, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oakland A\u2019s Are Trying to Solve Their Stadium Problem. Still.", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 After decades of trying to move out of the dilapidated Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, the Athletics say they will soon announce a site, plans and a timeline for a new privately financed ballpark in Oakland. Leading the charge will be Dave Kaval, who was hired last November as team president, largely to guide the stadium effort.The Coliseum, the A\u2019s home since 1968, is the fifth-oldest stadium in Major League Baseball. But unlike Wrigley Field or Fenway Park, it isn\u2019t worthy of preservation. It\u2019s a bland, charmless concrete monstrosity, the last of the unfortunate wave of multipurpose stadiums built in the 1960s; the A\u2019s share it with the N.F.L.\u2019s Raiders.Kaval is building up a reservoir of good will from A\u2019s fans who have endured decades of owners\u2019 threats to move the team out of Oakland. The A\u2019s have upgraded food and beverage choices at the Coliseum, reconnected with their past by renaming the playing field for the Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson and held playful events in the community like hat buybacks, where fans could trade a San Francisco Giants cap for an A\u2019s one.\u201cEver since I started here in November, the commitment has been very clear to Oakland,\u201d said Kaval, who has overseen a marketing campaign with the tagline \u201cRooted in Oakland\u201d this season. \u201cI saw Oakland as a strength.\u201dBut good will alone will not build a ballpark. Kaval has to unify the team, the city and county governments, public agencies, interest groups and residents behind his vision for the park. He has to secure financing for a baseball-only stadium that could cost more than a billion dollars. He has to persuade corporations to lend their dollars in the form of sponsorships, naming rights and luxury box purchases.Perhaps most difficult of all, he has to rebuild a fan base that has eroded after years of the team\u2019s attempting to leave Oakland and trading away popular players.If any team can legitimately claim to need a new stadium, it\u2019s the A\u2019s. Besides ordinary plumbing problems, untreated sewage has flooded the clubhouses several times, the Coliseum has none of the amenities most other parks have, and the luxury boxes are much better suited to watching football. The absence of dining and shopping options near the stadium gives fans little to do before and after games.As far back as 1990, two ownership groups ago, the A\u2019s were threatening to leave town over changes being made to the Coliseum to entice the Raiders to return from Los Angeles. Over the last 20 years, the A\u2019s have considered ballpark sites in cities throughout the Bay Area, mostly focused on the South Bay, near Silicon Valley.But the Giants have asserted territorial rights to prevent the A\u2019s from building in San Jose or Santa Clara. An M.L.B. ballpark committee couldn\u2019t broker a resolution, and the city of San Jose lost its legal challenge to M.L.B.\u2019s antitrust exemption.But the A\u2019s may have an even better alternative. The Golden State Warriors and the Oakland Raiders, who also play at the Coliseum complex, are moving, to San Francisco and Las Vegas. By 2020 the A\u2019s will be the last major professional sports team in Oakland, which has undergone a major economic revival. Whether the A\u2019s are staying in Oakland by choice or necessity, their timing could not be better.\u201cI had a conversation with the mayor a long time ago, and she used \u2018Oakland is the new Brooklyn,\u2019 \u201d said Andy Dolich, an A\u2019s executive from 1980 to 1995. Dolich said he told Libby Schaaf, Oakland\u2019s mayor, that in fact Brooklyn is the new Oakland. \u201cBecause we\u2019re way ahead. We have Lake Merritt, we have Piedmont, Montclair, we have Upper Broadway, we have the estuary.\u201dThe A\u2019s have publicly identified three potential sites for a new park: Howard Terminal, at the Port of Oakland; Laney College, a community college close to downtown; and their current site, in the industrial southeast of the city. Each location would present substantial challenges.Howard Terminal is part of a busy commercial port, crisscrossed by active railroad tracks but without public transportation links, and could require expensive environmental remediation. The Laney College site is tiny, making connected commercial development difficult, and would require moving several of the school\u2019s administrative offices. Although the current site is easy to build on, it\u2019s far from the city center.\u201cIf this was easy, it would\u2019ve been done already,\u201d Dolich said. \u201cIt literally took eight years for the Colosseum in Rome to be built, and we\u2019re on Year 12, 13 or 14 of this.\u201dFisher, who also owns a stake in the Earthquakes, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed for this article.Kaval said he and Fisher have a \u201cgreat working relationship\u201d and a \u201csystem whereby we divide and conquer on certain things.\u201d When asked what Fisher concentrates on, Kaval mentioned the team\u2019s relationship with Major League Baseball before quickly promoting the team the A\u2019s have in place to build a ballpark.\u201cIt looks as if the owner isn\u2019t going to be involved,\u201d Dolich said. \u201cThat to me is not a wonderful model of success.\u201dThe city of Oakland has not taken a leadership role, waiting to see what the A\u2019s decide. Through a spokesman, Mayor Schaaf declined to be interviewed.The Bay Area may be the region of the country most hostile to public financing of sports arenas; the San Francisco 49ers received no direct public money for their new home in Santa Clara, and the under-construction Warriors arena is entirely privately financed. Kaval insisted that the A\u2019s would privately finance their new stadium.That will require corporate partners, and Oakland is home to just one Fortune 500 company, Clorox. But Kaval said he believed companies based in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley would work with the A\u2019s.\u201cTheir work force is here in the East Bay,\u201d Kaval said. \u201cI actually think the biggest benefit for them is around their work force, and making sure their knowledge workers have options here for quality of life.\u201dEven if the ballpark is built, Kaval will need help from the team\u2019s baseball side to field a team that will attract fans. This season the A\u2019s are far out of contention and attendance is flat despite improvements to the ballpark. The A\u2019s have traded Sonny Gray, Yonder Alonso, Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson \u2014 some of the faces of the team \u2014 for prospects.For decades the A\u2019s have used the poor condition of the Coliseum to justify their frequent roster teardowns, arguing that they cannot sustain a high payroll. Under the previous collective bargaining agreement, the A\u2019s \u2014 despite playing in one of the largest markets in the country \u2014 were considered a small-market club because of their stadium and received annual revenue-sharing checks, reportedly $35 million in 2015.The C.B.A. that was signed late last year will end payments to the A\u2019s in 2021 at the latest.At that time, they will have to sink or swim on their own, putting tremendous pressure on Billy Beane, the team\u2019s longtime roster builder.But given the A\u2019s financial constraints \u2014 they can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, simply spend their way to relevance \u2014 can they time the blooming of a suddenly stocked farm system to stadium construction? Even after announcing a site, the team will have to secure financing, conduct community meetings and work with public agencies, all before shovels hit the ground. Unless they open a new stadium by 2021, Beane may have started rebuilding too early.If and when the A\u2019s move to a new ballpark, the work of turning the team back into a powerhouse will be just beginning. The Giants have siphoned many of their potential fans, not to mention competition from the Warriors, the 49ers and the Raiders. But Kaval says they can coexist.\u201cEven in London, if you look at the big soccer teams, you can have more than one team thriving in a metropolis, like the San Francisco Bay Area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe almost drew three million fans in the 1980s, so I think that there is a sleeping giant \u2014 pun intended \u2014 of A\u2019s fans out there.\u201dKaval added, \u201cBeing a part of kind of the rebirth of this city in many ways is something that people are watching, and they are interested in that.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about plans for the Oakland Athletics\u2019 new stadium misspelled the given name of one player and the surname of another. They are Rickey Henderson, not Ricky, and Ryan Madson, not Madsen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Election Interference, It\u2019s What Reporters Didn\u2019t Find That Matters", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe story started, as many do, with our own confusion.The most unusual of presidential elections \u2014 one marred by Russian trolls, a digital Watergate-style break-in and the winning candidate\u2019s dire warnings of a \u201crigged election\u201d \u2014 was followed by the most unusual period of acceptance. In the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election, government officials, the Clinton campaign, intelligence analysts, and civic and legal groups all appeared to calmly accept claims that votes had not been hacked.I had been on the cyber beat for six years and had grown accustomed to deep, often lengthy digital forensics analyses of cyberattacks against a wide range of targets: Silicon Valley start-ups, multinational conglomerates, government agencies and our own Times breach by Chinese government hackers. In the vast majority of cases, it takes investigators months or years to discover that hackers had indeed been lurking undetected on victims\u2019 machines.Yet American intelligence officials were adamant in a report in January \u2014 just two months after Election Day \u2014 that vote tallies had not been hacked. This despite the broad consensus among United States intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election through an extensive disinformation and propaganda campaign, as well as the hacking of electoral databases and websites, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.My colleagues Michael Wines, Matthew Rosenberg and I set out to find out how government officials had nixed the possibility of vote hacking so readily. It was especially unclear to us given that officials at the Department of Homeland Security testified last fall that Russian hackers probed election systems in 21 states, with varying degrees of success, and that months later, a National Security Agency report found that Russian hackers had indeed successfully infiltrated VR Systems, an election service provider in eight states, including the battlegrounds North Carolina, Florida and Virginia.Among other things, we learned that intelligence agencies had intentionally worded their conclusions to specifically address \u201cvote tallying,\u201d not the back-end election systems \u2014 conclusions that were not even based on any in-depth investigation of the state election systems or the machines themselves, but on the accounts of American spies and digital intercepts of Russian communications, as well as on assessments by the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which were largely superficial and not based on any in-depth investigation of the state election systems or machines themselves.In fact, we discovered that precious little research had been conducted, the result of legal limits on the authority of intelligence agencies to address domestic issues and states\u2019 historic reluctance to permit federal oversight of elections.Michael Wines, who covers election issues for the Times, said that what stood out to him was the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s vast Rube Goldberg election system. Elections, he explained, \u201care run by understaffed, underfinanced and sometimes undertrained local officials, serviced by outside contractors who may or may not be well vetted, conducted with equipment and software that may or may not be secure.\u201dAnd Matthew Rosenberg, who covers national security issues for the Times, discovered that the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the Election Day vote was not hacked \u2014 was extremely limited in scope.I started calling around to the election security and technology experts who had witnessed some of the troubles that cropped up on Election Day. I found that they, too, were still searching for answers and were befuddled by the lack of any substantial investigation.We zeroed in on Durham, N.C. \u2014 a reliably blue county in a swing state that went for Donald J. Trump \u2014 where a breakdown in the electronic check-in software prevented hundreds of would-be voters from casting their ballots and hundreds more to simply give up in the face of long lines.Officials there relied on check-in software sold by VR Systems. Nobody in Durham \u2014 or any other county that relied on VR Systems\u2019s electronic poll books \u2014 was ever informed that their equipment had been compromised by Russian hackers. And yet Durham County officials rebuffed several offers to examine their systems at no cost \u2014 from the D.H.S., the F.B.I. and even Free & Fair, a group of qualified forensics investigators, many with security clearances.Susan Greenhalgh, one of the few election technology specialists fielding technical complaints from North Carolina on Election Day, told me she was still haunted by what happened in November, and even more so by the lack of any follow-up investigation. \u201cIf you were looking to influence an election, one thing you could do is keep people from voting in a targeted county by monkeying with the e-pollbooks so people couldn\u2019t check in, which would lead to long lines and chaos at the polls,\u201d she said.\u201cThis,\u201d she told me, referring to what she witnessed in Durham on Election Day, \u201cis exactly what that looked like.\u201dTo this day, county, state, and federal officials have yet to investigate what transpired in Durham in November.Instead, Durham officials asked Protus3, a little-known Raleigh firm comprised primarily of physical security experts and former law enforcement types with little, if any, of the technical expertise that is typically standard for breach investigations, to conduct an audit.The firm\u2019s confidential report was unlike any data breach investigation I have seen in my six years on this beat. Investigators had done none of the malware or coding forensics necessary to understand whether hackers had sabotaged VR Systems\u2019s software, instead basing their analysis largely on eyewitness accounts of poll workers with limited technical understanding. When I shared the report with some of the top digital forensics experts in the country, many had visceral reactions: They simply could not believe that this was the definitive take on what transpired in Durham that day.But through the course of our reporting, Michael, Matthew and I discovered that this was the norm.There was a seeming lack of interest in doing much of anything about the problems on Election Day, or even in securing future elections. \u201cBills to tighten election security are languishing in congressional committees,\u201d Michael noted. \u201cThe White House is focused on erasing fraud by individual voters, which experts say is a miniscule problem at its worst. A vast throng of voting machines that Congress financed after the disputed 2000 presidential election are now outdated, and no one wants to pony up the cash to modernize them.\u201dThe more places we looked, the worse things looked. In fact, we discovered that VR Systems was not the only back-end supplier of election services that was hacked by Russians ahead of Election Day. Two more vendors that provide critical election services were also hacked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sanders Single-Payer Plan Is No Miracle Cure", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThough we have widely divergent views on health policy \u2014 one of us preferring a German-style system (Dr. Weinberg), the other a more consumer-directed one (Dr. Chen) \u2014 we both believe that single-payer health care, including the proposal advanced by Senator Sanders, is the wrong choice for the country.We recently conducted an analysis of international health systems and concluded that single-payer advocates are substantially overstating the prevalence and success of such systems. While many other countries have universal health systems and feature more government control over individual health care decisions, almost none are actually single-payer. And all of them are wrestling with largely the same challenges Americans are, making different but equally difficult trade-offs on cost, quality and access.As Democrats and other policy makers debate the merits of Senator Sanders\u2019s proposal, here are a few important observations about international systems that they ought to consider.First, a vanishingly small number of countries actually have single-payer systems. In fact, almost all feature some role for private-sector insurance companies and providers. Britain, which employs providers in its National Health Services, has a parallel private payment system. In countries like Canada \u2014 the system most similar to the one that Mr. Sanders seeks to create \u2014 private corporations provide insurance for services that fall outside of government guarantees. And these guaranteed benefits are substantially more limited than those in the Sanders proposal. Canada, for example, has no national prescription drug benefit but instead a patchwork of provincial systems.Some of the highest-rated international systems rely on private health insurers for most health care coverage \u2014 Germany\u2019s, for example, is something like Obamacare exchanges for everyone, but significantly simpler and truly universal. The Netherlands and Switzerland have both moved recently to add more competition and flexibility to systems that were already built on the use of private insurers.Third, it is simply untrue that single-payer systems produce a better quality of care across the board. Most health-policy lectures in American universities start with a slide showing that we rank poorly on a broad number of public health measures and outcomes. Yet the United States scores much more highly on different measures, including innovation, patient-centered care and preventive health.Specialty care is better in many categories, although more needs to be done to create broader access to these services. The American health system excels, for example, in cancer care. And while we spend more on it than any other country, we find ourselves at the top of most international rankings in reducing the death rate of patients with preventable cancer deaths, as a product of this spending.In truth, all systems make trade-offs when it comes to allocating health care resources, and they all largely get what they pay for. To the extent that other countries achieve better public health outcomes, they do it primarily through more generous, rather than more efficient, social spending. When you add together health and social spending across countries, the United States is no longer a major outlier when it comes to per capita costs spent on factors that promote health.American policy makers can and should look abroad for examples of reforms that work. For example, many other countries have encouraged smarter public and private investments into factors that promote health and wellness, like stable housing and employment opportunities, rather than spending more overall on health care once people are sick.But just as trade-offs must be made to improve health care, so are other countries struggling with balancing the cost and quality of care and universal access. All Americans should bear one important precept in mind: If the Sanders plan sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saved on 9/11, by the Man in the Red Bandanna", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe is credited with helping at least 10 people escape the tower in several trips up and down stairwells, before perishing alongside a group of New York City firefighters.Its premiere was Wednesday night, not in Manhattan, but rather in Suffern, not far from Mr. Crowther\u2019s hometown Upper Nyack.Nearly 1,000 people packed the Lafayette Theater, a grand movie palace from the 1920s decorated with a big red bandanna for the evening.\u201cThat\u2019s the largest bandanna in the world \u2014 20 by 20 feet,\u201d said Matthew Weiss, who wrote, directed and co-produced the film.Mr. Weiss stood in the theater lobby greeting attendees, many of whom were family and friends of Mr. Crowther as well as local emergency workers.When he began the project six years ago, Mr. Weiss was a lawyer in Manhattan specializing in traffic violations with no filmmaking experience. He heard about the story from his banker, who happened to be Mr. Crowther\u2019s father, Jeff.The idea of a mysterious 9/11 rescuer in a red bandanna was a tale that Mr. Weiss decided he had to help spread.\u201cWhile there are filmmakers who look for stories,\u201d he told the audience Wednesday night, \u201cthis was a story that found a filmmaker.\u201dGwyneth Paltrow agreed to narrate the film and Lyle Lovett recorded a song.As a little boy, Welles Crowther followed his father\u2019s lead as a member of the local Empire Hook & Ladder Co., No. 1 in Upper Nyack. By age 7, he was helping clean the fire trucks. By 16, he became a junior member and gained full firefighter status at 18.After attending Boston College, Welles Crowther went to work for Sandler O\u2019Neill, an investment bank, and was working on the 104th floor of the South Tower on Sept. 11, 2001, when United Airlines Flight 175 hit the building.After leaving his mother, Alison, a voice mail message telling her that he was O.K., he was never heard from again. Ms. Crowther said she followed her \u201cmother\u2019s instinct\u201d after the attacks, searching for information about her son and his final moments. She combed through news coverage even after her son\u2019s remains were recovered from ground zero six months after the attacks.\u201cA mysterious man appeared,\u201d who managed to locate the only passable stairwell and began marshaling down groups of injured and dazed people, according to the article, which also gave a telling detail about the rescuer that floored Ms. Crowther. He wore a red bandanna over his face to keep out smoke and debris.\u201cOh my god, Welles,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI found you.\u201dShe summoned her husband, who nearly 20 years earlier had given two handkerchiefs to their son as he dressed for church one Sunday morning: a white pocket square and a utilitarian red one to blow his nose.\u201cOne to show and one to blow,\u201d Mr. Welles told the boy, who after that was never without a red bandanna.He wore it under his hockey and fire helmets as a teen and under his lacrosse helmet while playing for Boston College. He carried it in the pocket of his business suit every day to the World Trade Center.And apparently, as his parents were now reading, he pulled it out that morning before organizing a group rescue in the burning South Tower on floors not yet reached by firefighters.According to survivors\u2019 accounts in the Times article, which Ms. Crowther began reading aloud to her stunned husband, her son had searched for a fire extinguisher.He used it to put out some blazes and assigned a woman, Ling Young, to carry it down the stairs while he carried an injured woman on his back.He led a first group to the 61st floor, then pulled his bandanna over his mouth and told them he was going back up to guide down others.He later joined firefighters who had a tool to free trapped victims. His body was eventually recovered among those of firefighters at a command center in the South Tower\u2019s lobby \u2014 mere steps from escape.The Crowthers contacted survivors quoted in the Times article who then reviewed family photographs of Welles Crowther and confirmed that he was their rescuer.\u201cThey describe a calm, strong authoritative figure who they followed down,\u201d said Jeff Crowther, who at age 72 is still an active volunteer with the Empire fire squad.Maintaining composure during chaotic rescues was drilled into his son at the Rockland County Fire Training Center, where training included searching smoke-filled rooms and fiery structures and carrying out heavy dummies, he said.\u201cOn 9/11, he put that training to its highest and best use,\u201d said Mr. Crowther, who added that his son told him a few weeks before the 2001 attack that he had decided to leave his finance job and become a New York City firefighter.Mr. Crowther said he found an application for the firefighter job, partially filled out, in his son\u2019s Manhattan apartment after his death.He stood Wednesday evening in the theater lobby as the mighty Wurlitzer theater organ belted out old songs, and the audience settled into their seats. Some were survivors who Welles Crowther helped save, including Richard Fern, who recalled making his way down from the 84th floor to the 78th but then being unable to find a passable stairway until he heard somebody yell, \u2018Use the stairs over here.\u2019\u201dThis came from a young man \u201clining folks up to go down the stairs,\u201d said Mr. Fern, who later realized that the young man was Welles Crowther.One of Mr. Crowther\u2019s co-workers at Sandler O\u2019Neill once teased him about the red bandanna on his desk, Jeff Crowther said, and Welles had answered, \u201cThis bandanna\u2019s going to change the world.\u201d\u201cIt was just a casual remark,\u201d Jeff Crowther said. \u201cBut you know, in many ways, it has. The story of that bandanna has gone around the world and touched a lot of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Final Primary Debate, de Blasio Again Defends His Record", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt could have been mistaken for a slightly unorthodox mayoral news conference, with Mayor Bill de Blasio giving a forceful defense of his record and sometimes sparring testily with reporters.Mr. de Blasio is an overwhelming favorite to win the primary on Tuesday, and the one-hour debate, broadcast on WCBS-TV, was more than anything an opportunity for voters \u2014 those who bothered to tune in \u2014 to see him make the case for why he deserves a second term.\u201cThis is your city,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThat\u2019s my message to all New Yorkers \u2014 it has to work for you.\u201dMr. Albanese prodded the mayor over failures in the transit system and his cozy relationship with some campaign donors who do business with the city, saying more than once that New Yorkers were \u201crevolting\u201d over issues like gentrification. He portrayed himself, an immigrant who came from Italy as a child, as an embodiment of \u201cthe New York City story.\u201dThe mayor has a vast advantage in money raised. He has reported receiving nearly $5 million in campaign contributions, and an additional $2.6 million in public matching funds through the city\u2019s campaign finance program. Mr. Albanese has raised $207,000 but is not close to qualifying for matching funds because he has not received enough in qualifying contributions from New York City residents.Given the disadvantage in money and name recognition, Mr. Albanese has struggled to make himself heard in a primary campaign that voters have shown little interest in, partly because big-name Democrats opted to stay on the sidelines rather than challenge an incumbent mayor.Mr. de Blasio was confident and assertive in talking about the city\u2019s economic growth, educational system, defense against terrorism and other achievements of his administration.He also gave a classic performance, sometimes scolding the reporters who questioned him, often avoiding direct answers to questions and correcting Mr. Albanese when he felt that his policies or positions had been mischaracterized.\u201cThe number of mistruths is overwhelming,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, after Mr. Albanese criticized his leadership of the police force. Mr. de Blasio countered by citing continued reductions in crime, as well as steps that he has taken to improve policing techniques and increase the number of officers.In one sharp exchange, Marcia Kramer, a WCBS reporter who was on the debate panel, asked Mr. de Blasio whether he favored removing the statue of Christopher Columbus at Columbus Circle. When he refused to give an opinion, she pressed him, saying voters deserved to know his position, but he would not answer, defending instead his decision to form a commission to study the city\u2019s statues and monuments for symbols of hate and possible removal.\u201cI don\u2019t need a commission to tell me that the Christopher Columbus statue should not come down,\u201d Mr. Albanese jabbed, saying the commission was divisive. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage Bill.\u201dMr. Albanese, 68, a lawyer, was a member of the City Council, representing Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, from 1982 to 1997. He has run unsuccessfully to be the Democratic nominee for mayor twice before, in 1997 and 2013. He finished eighth of nine candidates in the primary in 2013, receiving 0.9 percent of the vote. Mr. de Blasio won with just over 40 percent.Three other Democrats are running in the primary against Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Albanese.Two of them, Bob Gangi, a police reform activist, and Richard Bashner, a Brooklyn community board leader, did not raise enough money to reach the threshold required by the Campaign Finance Board to qualify for the debate. The other candidate, Michael Tolkin, a technology entrepreneur, contributed enough of his own money to his campaign to reach the threshold, but because he is not participating in the city\u2019s matching funds program, he could participate only if the debate sponsors invited him. They did not.If Mr. de Blasio dispatches Mr. Albanese next week, as is widely expected, he will then face the Republican candidate, Nicole Malliotakis, an assemblywoman from Staten Island, in the first general election debate on Oct. 10. Another candidate, Bo Dietl, is running as an independent and would have to be invited to the debate by the sponsors.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s been that for many years,\u201d said the second-time exhibitor Pascal Izarn, a Paris dealer who specializes in museum-quality 18th-century French clocks and decorative objects. \u201cPeople don\u2019t collect the 18th century from floor to ceiling anymore,\u201d Mr. Izarn said. \u201cThey mix with modern and contemporary.\u201dThe biennale\u2019s organizers, the Syndicat National des Antiquaires, adopted the atemporal, gray styling characteristic of Frieze Masters in London and other fairs trying to find a new audience for old things. The number of exhibiting dealers shrank to 94, compared with 125 last year, with two-thirds of them based in France.\u201cIt\u2019s not that international anymore. It\u2019s too French,\u201d said Nikolas Barta, an Austrian collector based in Vienna, who has been a regular visitor to the Paris biennale, as well as Art Basel, Tefaf and Frieze. Mr. Barta, 62, buys artworks from the 18th to 21st centuries. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a bit quiet,\u201d he added during a somnolent Tuesday afternoon at the fair, when there were fewer than 200 visitors browsing under the cast iron and glass roof of the Grand Palais.

Mrs. Gates\u2019s decorator, the New York-based Thierry Despont, duly found a place, and they were sold for a price that Mr. Chevalier declined to divulge.The tapestries have since been bought back by Galerie Chevalier, and were in its booth at the biennale, priced at \u20ac4 million, or about $4.7 million.\u201cThey weren\u2019t just decorators,\u201d said Camille Leprince, a former Paris biennale exhibitor. \u201cThey turned clients into collectors.

On consignment from a French collector, who had reunited the figures after buying them as two pairs at separate Tefaf fairs, Mr. Leprince gave the price as between \u20ac200,000 and \u20ac250,000.But then 20 lots later, an amusing if hardly museum-quality pair of late 18th-century Chinese Export porcelain tureens shaped as ducks sold for \u20ac187,500 against a low estimate of \u20ac15,000.This result was a telling reminder that:\u2022 Auction house prices can only go up, while dealer prices can only go down, and\u2022 European 18th-century objects look seriously underpriced compared with their Chinese equivalents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalan Officials Are Squeezed as Madrid Tries to Stop Independence Vote", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARENYS DE MUNT, Spain \u2014 As Spain\u2019s government tries almost everything it can to stop an independence referendum Sunday in the restive northeastern region of Catalonia, the standoff is escalating into a constitutional crisis emblematic of the larger forces tearing at European unity.With the support of the Spanish judiciary, Madrid has shut down websites and advertising campaigns that have promoted the vote. It has raided the offices of companies that would print the paper ballots. It has sent in thousands of police officers from outside the region, threatening to block polling stations.\u201cWe are witnessing the worst democratic regression since the death of Franco,\u201d Mr. Puigdemont said in an interview, referring to Gen. Francisco Franco, the dictator whose death in 1975 opened the way for Spanish democracy. \u201cWhat is happening in Catalonia is very serious.\u201dThose elections presented big tests of the bloc\u2019s cohesion. The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy.Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, has long been an uneasy part of Spain, and aspirations for independence have surged and ebbed for generations. But Catalonia is also Spain\u2019s economic engine, and Madrid is determined to hold onto it. The tug of war is now entering perhaps its most intense and unpredictable phase since the approach of the Spanish Civil War last century.In 2014, the last time Catalonia held an independence vote, it, too, was declared illegal by Spain\u2019s constitutional court. But Catalan officials described that vote as a straw ballot, and the government in Madrid and the police did not prevent it.This time, sensing the growing seriousness of the Catalan referendum, which the regional government says will now be binding, Madrid is taking a far more aggressive tack.The approach has left many Catalans bridling under what they say is a heavy hand by the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The steps to intimidate people who back a vote not only may backfire, they argue, but also threaten to transform the conflict into a broad campaign of civil disobedience that could spiral out of control.Tensions on the streets have mounted, along with political recriminations. While the separatists charge that Mr. Rajoy is taking Spain back to the dark days of Franco, Madrid warns that the separatists have shifted from violating Spanish law to encouraging civil strife.In the interview, Mr. Puigdemont said the conflict would not turn violent, but he warned that Madrid would have to assume its share of the blame if things got further out of hand. \u201cIf you stop somebody from unfolding a banner that asks for more democracy, the problem is with the person who forces its withdrawal,\u201d he said.Even President Trump has weighed in, declaring that he supports a unified Spain after a meeting in Washington with the Prime Minister Rajoy. Mr. Trump took no position on whether the referendum should be held.The swirl of competing pressures is perhaps nowhere greater than at the local level, among city and small-town mayors who must decide whether to host the voting.On Monday, Joan Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, headed for a courthouse rather than his town hall because of his decision to ignore Spain\u2019s government and constitutional court and help his residents vote. Mr. Rabasseda could be suspended from office if found guilty of civil disobedience \u2014 along with about 750 of the almost 950 mayors of Catalonia who have vowed to facilitate the referendum.\u201cSpain\u2019s judiciary can go after me, but that\u2019s only helping unite my town even more and increasing everybody\u2019s determination to vote,\u201d Mr. Rabasseda said defiantly.Catalan officials who do not favor independence say that they, too, are facing intimidation \u2014 but from an increasingly aggressive pro-independence movement that wants them to go through with a vote declared illegal by Madrid.With the referendum just days away, taking a side has become inescapable. In many ways, for Catalonia\u2019s officialdom, it\u2019s a case of be damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t.\u201cThis conflict is forcing elected officials to walk into a cul-de-sac and then deal with very difficult consequences,\u201d said Irene Rigau, a Catalan politician. \u201cWhatever you do, you will be punished either by your citizenship or by the state.\u201dSeparatist mayors must endorse the referendum, she said, because otherwise \u201cnobody will vote for you again.\u201d\u201cBut if you stick to your promise,\u201d she said, \u201cthe state could then never allow you to be a politician again.\u201dMs. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.This time, Spain\u2019s judiciary is promising to punish anybody involved in organizing Sunday\u2019s referendum. But for mayors like Mr. Rabasseda, the choice to go ahead with the ballot was simple, if potentially disastrous for him.His was the first town in Catalonia to hold an independence straw ballot in 2009, at a time when secessionism had far less supporters than it now has. On Monday, a group of about 100 residents escorted their mayor to the courthouse in the nearby city of Matar\u00f3 and sang the Catalan hymn as he entered the building. When he emerged, they repeatedly shouted, \u201cWe will vote!\u201d and \u201cIndependence!\u201dA smaller number of mayors are complaining about suffering harassment and insults for refusing to turn their town hall buildings into polling stations. Their decision is forcing Catalonia\u2019s separatist government to find alternative venues for a referendum whose logistics have already been seriously complicated by the Spanish police, who are seizing ballot papers and other election-related equipment.While Mr. Rabasseda was in court, Josep Monr\u00e0s, the mayor of the town of Mollet del Vall\u00e8s, was filing a police complaint after a group of about 100 separatists surrounded his home last weekend and shouted insults. The protesters used a megaphone and also plastered secessionist posters on his house, Mr. Monr\u00e0s said in a telephone interview.He argued that Catalonia \u201cisn\u2019t viable as an independent state,\u201d but that his opposition to the vote was in any case entirely justified by his duties as a Spanish mayor. \u201cEvery mayor takes office with a promise that includes respecting the Constitution,\u201d he said.Mr. Monr\u00e0s, who has been mayor since 2004, said he had never before received such insults on his doorstep, including people calling him a fascist.\u201cThere have always been people who defend different ideas using legitimate means, but there are now some who use instead coercion and insults,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201dSunday\u2019s referendum has widespread support in the smaller towns and villages of the Catalan hinterland like Arenys de Munt.There, the owner of one fish distribution company had plastered a banner showing Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, the head of the autonomous Catalan police force, who has become an icon of the region\u2019s assertion of an independent identity since last month\u2019s terrorist attacks in Barcelona, the region\u2019s capital.After a foreign journalist left a news briefing, frustrated that it was being held partly in Catalan, Mr. Trapero commented, \u201cWell, very good, well, farewell.\u201d His words have since been turned into a slogan by separatists who want to say the same to Spain.But support for independence is far more limited in places like L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, whose mayor, N\u00faria Mar\u00edn, has been leading the call for mayors not to be intimidated into hosting the referendum.\u201cI was elected to manage a city, not to provide ballot boxes,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTelling me that I should help people vote is a political and not a legal argument \u2014 and in this case it\u2019s clearly not one that carries a lot of weight if made before a judge.\u201dSpain\u2019s attorney general has warned Catalonia\u2019s political leaders that they could be arrested at any time and face criminal charges for misusing public money to finance an illegal referendum.The separatists, however, have lashed out at Madrid\u2019s efforts to prosecute mayors and eventually, perhaps, thousands of other officials involved in their referendum. They say Mr. Rajoy is returning authoritarianism to Spain.Mr. Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, said that Madrid\u2019s clampdown has been disproportionate. He was prepared for a court battle, but acknowledged that his legal problems were worrying others, starting with his 86-year-old mother.\u201cShe\u2019s really upset and concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cFor her, it\u2019s a bit like returning to the past and the loss of all political freedom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Next Stop for the Steve Bannon Insurgency: China", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon has held court in the Capitol Hill townhouse of Breitbart Media since he packed up his West Wing office last month, meeting with conservative lawmakers, advocating hard-line policies on undocumented immigrants and waging gleeful war on those he considers traitors to the Trump cause.Now Mr. Bannon is taking his insurgency abroad.Next week, he plans to travel to Hong Kong to deliver a keynote address at an investor conference, where he will articulate his call for a much tougher American policy toward China. CLSA, the Hong Kong brokerage firm that invited Mr. Bannon, is owned by a politically connected Chinese investment bank, Citic Securities.People close to Mr. Bannon said he met recently with Henry A. Kissinger, the elder statesman who opened a diplomatic channel to China in 1972, to exchange views about the relationship with Beijing. Mr. Bannon said he admires Mr. Kissinger and has read all his books, but none of that swayed him from his preference for confrontation over diplomacy.The meeting and speech kicks off an effort by Mr. Bannon, who served as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist, to influence his former boss on China policy as much as he does on immigration, trade or tax policy. Given the lack of strong voices on China in the administration and the inconsistency in its approach, Mr. Bannon believes he can make a difference, though his record when he was inside the White House was mixed.It is no accident that of all the foreign policy issues he could have chosen, Mr. Bannon gravitated to China, where he once lived and which he now views as the greatest long-term threat to the United States.\u201cA hundred years from now, this is what they\u2019ll remember \u2014 what we did to confront China on its rise to world domination,\u201d he said in an interview, previewing the themes in his speech.\u201cChina right now is Germany in 1930,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the cusp. It could go one way or the other. The younger generation is so patriotic, almost ultranationalistic.\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s combative views on China are no secret to those who listened to his Breitbart radio show before the election. In March 2016 he declared, \u201cWe\u2019re going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years.\u201d Last month, he told Robert Kuttner, co-founder of the left-leaning journal The American Prospect, \u201cWe\u2019re at economic war with China\u201d \u2014 one of a number of impolitic observations that hastened his departure from the White House.But now Mr. Bannon is going to present this worldview to an audience of Chinese investors. His speech is likely to attract attention, if not raise eyebrows, at a forum where the past speakers have included Bill Clinton, Sarah Palin, Al Gore, Alan Greenspan and George Clooney. Among other things, Mr. Bannon will tell his audience that they made their wealth on the backs of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters.\u201cChina\u2019s model for the past 25 years, it\u2019s based on investment and exports,\u201d he said. \u201cWho financed that? The American working class and middle class. You can\u2019t understand Brexit or the 2016 events unless you understand that China exported their deflation, they exported their excess capacity.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Bannon declared. \u201cThe reordering of the economic relationship is the central issue that has to be addressed, and only the U.S. can address it.\u201dMr. Trump clearly shares that view. He made it a centerpiece of his campaign, and installed Mr. Bannon in an office near his, where he sought out like-minded China bashers, including the economist Peter Navarro. But Mr. Bannon had as many setbacks as victories on China at the White House.Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Bannon exulted when the president-elect threw in doubt America\u2019s adherence to the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. But he was undercut a month later when Mr. Trump, prodded by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, told President Xi Jinping that he would honor the policy.Mr. Bannon poured his energy into engineering Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist trade agenda. He cheered when Mr. Trump ordered investigations of China\u2019s theft of technology from American companies and its dumping of steel in the world market. But he fought constant rear-guard actions against other advisers, who warned Mr. Trump not to start a trade war with China at the same time that he needed its cooperation in confronting North Korea.Mr. Trump has suggested that he will go easier on trade if China steps up its pressure on the rogue regime of Kim Jong-un. Mr. Bannon contends that this is a sucker\u2019s bet: China is stringing along the United States, he says, and has no intention of exerting influence on its neighbor.\u201cIf you\u2019re a great power,\u201d he asked, \u201chow come you can\u2019t control the Frankenstein monster you created in North Korea?\u201dLast weekend, Mr. Bannon said he was thrilled when Mr. Trump tweeted that the United States would consider halting trade \u201cwith any country that does business with North Korea.\u201d The statement was aimed at China, which conducts the lion\u2019s share of trade with the North.But Mr. Trump has assiduously cultivated a relationship with Mr. Xi, and his willingness to confront him on this issue is not clear. After speaking by phone with the Chinese president on Wednesday, he told reporters, \u201cI believe that President Xi agrees with me 100 percent\u201d on the threat posed by North Korea. There is no evidence, however, that China plans to support Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a cutoff of oil supplies to the North.For Mr. Bannon, who lived in Shanghai when he ran an online gaming company, the key to understanding China\u2019s motives is to look at its history, specifically the Taiping Rebellion and the Cultural Revolution. \u201cThe whole thing is about control,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think that by 2050 or 2075, they will be the hegemonic power.\u201d\u201cWe have to reassert ourselves because we have retreated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to reassert ourselves as the real Asian power: economically, militarily, culturally, politically.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind New Obamacare Repeal Vote: \u2018Furious\u2019 G.O.P. Donors", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 As more than 40 subdued Republican senators lunched on Chick-fil-A at a closed-door session last week, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado painted a dire picture for his colleagues. Campaign fund-raising was drying up, he said, because of widespread disappointment among donors over the inability of the Republican Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act or do much of anything else.Mr. Gardner is in charge of his party\u2019s midterm re-election push, and he warned that donors of all stripes were refusing to contribute another penny until the struggling majority produced some concrete results.\u201cDonors are furious,\u201d one person knowledgeable about the private meeting quoted Mr. Gardner as saying. \u201cWe haven\u2019t kept our promise.\u201dThe latest unsightly pileup over health care was exactly what some Republicans had wanted to avoid by abandoning the repeal effort and skipping straight to tax cuts after the previous embarrassing health care collapse about eight weeks ago. Instead, Senate Republicans got caught up in a rushed, last-ditch repeal attempt that not only seems unlikely to prevail, but will only serve to remind disillusioned donors about the party\u2019s governing difficulties.This was not what Republicans had envisioned. Preparing for the 2018 midterm elections, they had thought they were in a strong position to maintain or expand their majority. Democrats must defend 25 seats \u2014 including 10 in states won last year by President Trump \u2014 while just eight Republican-held seats will be on the ballot. But their governing struggles \u2014 and attacks on congressional leaders by Mr. Trump \u2014 have soured their base, leaving the Senate majority feeling desperate.Addressing his anxious colleagues at their weekly meeting on Sept. 12, Mr. Gardner had a simple message: If we don\u2019t have something to run on, we are going to squander this opportunity.Republican senators strive to keep discussions at their weekly luncheons secret to allow for candid discussions. This meeting was held off the Capitol grounds, at the headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to enable a broad discussion of politics. Neither lawmakers nor staff would go on the record to discuss it, but the session was described by multiple people knowledgeable about what occurred.But the fund-raising drought has become a growing worry and lawmakers have not been reticent about noting that their political fate could be tied to the outcome on health care and how Senate Republicans handle other issues ahead.Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who has been deeply involved in health policy for years, told reporters back home that he could count 10 reasons the new health proposal should not reach the floor, but that Republicans needed to press ahead regardless in order to fulfill their longstanding promise to replace and repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\u201cRepublicans campaigned on this so often that we have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign,\u201d Grassley said in a conference call with Iowa reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.\u201dRepublicans say the fund-raising drop-off has been steep and across the board, from big donations to the small ones the party solicits online from the grass roots. They say the hostile views of both large and small donors are in unusual alignment and that the negative sentiment is crystallized in the fund-raising decline.One party official noted that Senate Republicans had a lucrative March, raising $7 million \u2014 an off-year record for the organization. But in the aftermath of the failed health repeal effort before the August recess and other setbacks, the take dropped to $2 million in July and August \u2014 a poor showing for a majority party with a decided advantage on the midterm map.The totals have left Republicans increasingly worried about having the funds they need next year. Mr. Gardner told his colleagues that a major Colorado contributor who played a role in his own campaign says party donors are reluctant to give any more money until congressional Republicans demonstrate results.Senate Republicans are entering a pivotal week. They have been scrambling to find the votes for the contentious new repeal effort before the Sept. 30 expiration of special budget authority, which would allow the bill to pass with a simple majority and not 60 votes. But Mr. McCain\u2019s decision to join at least two other Republicans \u2014 Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 in finding fault with the measure put its fate in real peril.If the bill is short of votes, Mr. McConnell could choose not to bring it to the floor at all to prevent a second embarrassing defeat on health care and spare Republicans a difficult vote.Mr. McConnell faces other immediate challenges as well. A primary on Tuesday in Alabama pits his candidate, Senator Luther Strange, against Roy Moore, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court challenging him as an outsider. The defeat of Mr. Strange would further rattle his colleagues and be seen as a major rebuke to Mr. McConnell and the Republican establishment in Washington for their failure to deliver on health care repeal and other issues.Republicans are also set to roll out their income tax overhaul plan next week in an effort to build support for it and find something the party can deliver to the president\u2019s desk. They see the tax plan as their best opportunity to win back the allegiance of donors.With health care repeal teetering yet again, the one thing they know for sure is that they need to show some accomplishments, and they need to do so fast.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lurid Lawsuit\u2019s Quiet End Leaves Silicon Valley Start-Up Barely Dented", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "For all the outcry over how women are treated in the tech industry, the resolution of a sexual harassment case against Upload, a virtual reality start-up, shows that little has changed.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At Upload, the parties never seemed to stop.The start-up began by hosting impromptu gatherings to promote virtual reality as the next big thing. It quickly became an entertainment and news hub for the VR industry, hosting hundreds of events. The crowds were young and eager to network. Models did demos, and the liquor flowed.The freewheeling atmosphere was not restricted to the evening hours. There was a \u201crampant sexual behavior and focus\u201d in the Upload office that created \u201can unbearable environment,\u201d a former employee, Elizabeth Scott, said in a lawsuit filed in May.Ms. Scott said in her suit that the Upload office had a room with a bed \u201cto encourage sexual intercourse at the workplace.\u201d It was referred to as the kink room. Men who worked for the company were described in the suit as frequently talking about being so sexually aroused by female colleagues that it was impossible to concentrate. When Ms. Scott, Upload\u2019s digital media manager, complained about the hostile atmosphere and other issues in March with her supervisor, she was fired, the suit said.In a statement after the suit was filed, Upload said that \u201cour employees are our greatest asset\u201d and that \u201cthese allegations are entirely without merit.\u201d The company said Upload\u2019s chief executive, Taylor Freeman, and president, Will Mason, could not discuss the lawsuit and its specifics. On Friday, as this article neared publication, the men issued another statement that said, \u201cWe let you down and we are sorry.\u201dIf the claims were striking, so was the response.A few weeks ago, the suit was crossed off Upload\u2019s to-do list when it was quietly settled for a modest sum, said two people with knowledge of the case who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Both sides had an incentive to come to terms: Upload could say the problem was now in its past, and Ms. Scott, 26, got a victory of sorts without the risk of going to trial.Shortly after Ms. Scott filed her suit, at least a half-dozen members of Upload\u2019s team quit in solidarity, but they did not go public with their complaints. (At its peak, the company had about 20 to 25 employees.) In interviews, two of those who left described what happened but said that even though they were now working elsewhere, they did not want their names used.Behind the scenes, in members-only Facebook groups and other forums, the virtual reality industry is still roiled. People have opinions, they just do not want to be caught uttering them.In more than two dozen interviews for this story, even those inclined to see Upload in the most favorable light said it was the story of a company run by young, immature men who were flush with cash and did not know how to handle their power.The situation at Upload was particularly fraught because its principal product was parties. In the great tradition of Silicon Valley start-ups, the company was less interested in making a profit than in getting attention, said former employees. So the line between work and play, often fuzzy, was entirely erased.The existence of the kink room became the enduring symbol of Upload as soon as Ms. Scott filed her suit. Employees of the porn site Kink.com came to an early Upload party and left behind a sign, said two people with knowledge of the events. It became the name of a room toward the front of the office, a narrow chamber equipped with a bed.\u201cThere was a lack of leadership to cultivate a healthy work environment, and investors who failed to take a more active role in oversight,\u201d Mr. Bye said. \u201cThe only way to resolve these sorts of problems is to confront them head on, and that is precisely what no one seemed prepared to do.\u201dUpload was founded in 2014 as entrepreneurs \u2014 many of them women \u2014 flocked to virtual reality. There was a feeling of vast potential in the young industry, a sense of being able to make a mark by moving quickly and meeting the right people.Upload was the place to do it. Two of the founders \u2014 a third had dropped out \u2014 were in their mid-20s, with energy and ideas but not many credentials. Mr. Freeman, the chief executive, listed \u201cbackpacking in Europe\u201d and \u201cfreelance user experience designer\u201d on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201cI tend to be fairly passionate about things and wear my heart on my sleeve,\u201d Mr. Mason explained in an email about his petition. \u201cLooking back, there are definitely ways I would handle this differently.\u201dAlthough Upload\u2019s ambitions were ill-defined, the company was popular from the start. It quickly raised $1.25 million. One of its most prominent early investors was Joe Kraus, a Silicon Valley veteran who is now at GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm. Mr. Kraus, who invested $25,000 of his own money in Upload, was described by the company as an adviser. He declined to be interviewed.Larger sums came from Shanda Group in China and, in a second funding round of $4.5 million, Colopl, a Japanese mobile gaming company. Colopl\u2019s Shintaro Yamakami is the only non-Upload employee on the company\u2019s board. A spokeswoman for Mr. Yamakami said he was currently \u201crefraining from public relations activity.\u201d A spokeswoman for Shanda, an investment firm, said, \u201cWe do not have comments to offer.\u201dMs. Scott joined Upload in April 2016. She had graduated in 2012 from Emory University, where she was president of a group called the Alliance for Sexual Assault Prevention.She declined to be interviewed. Her mother, Jenny Scott of Gainesville, Fla., said, \u201cElizabeth had several incidents growing up that targeted her physical safety and developed her sense of right and wrong.\u201dMs. Scott, whose Facebook page describes her as \u201cshort, sassy & blonde. Take it or leave it,\u201d managed the stories generated by Upload\u2019s writing team on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube, produced videos and handled relationships with software developers.She said in the suit that she had other work, too: The women at Upload were required to do what were called \u201cwomanly tasks,\u201d including cleaning up. They were also told to act like \u201cmommies\u201d to the men and help them with whatever they needed.The suit presented a portrait of a deeply entitled male culture, one that clashed with the fresh start VR seemed to offer the tech industry. But Ms. Scott\u2019s suit was the second in the virtual reality industry in just a few months to present such an unwelcoming picture.Two-thirds of the women, Ms. Hart said, had experienced unwanted sexual interactions, such as being groped or kissed, or hearing comments about the physical attractiveness of women colleagues and sexual jokes or references that made them uncomfortable. One-third talked about men they worked with expressing romantic interest that was not reciprocated.This and other surveys suggest that in some ways, Silicon Valley has not evolved much over 50 years, even as more and younger women arrived.Some young women said they did not expect much from Silicon Valley. Amanda Joan, a VR developer, said the \u201cmisogynistic and lewd culture\u201d described in Ms. Scott\u2019s suit was as common to Silicon Valley as heavy traffic and expensive housing.About 11 months after Ms. Scott joined Upload, Ms. Scott said in her suit, she complained to a supervisor about the office atmosphere, about being shunned by Mr. Freeman and Mr. Mason and about being paid less for equal work and forced to perform menial and demeaning tasks. She was subsequently fired.All the success on the surface masked a workplace where, one former employee said, \u201cwomen are seen as the candy in the room.\u201d At Upload events, VR technology was demonstrated by women hired from a company called Models in Tech. Ms. Scott\u2019s suit said the founders tried to secure \u201csubmissive Asian women\u201d for a fund-raising trip to Asia.\u201cUpload was a boisterous culture, a \u2018bro\u2019 culture,\u201d said another former employee, Greg Gopman, in an interview. \u201cVirtual reality is hyped and no one was hyping it more than Upload. Within the industry, they were loved for giving people attention in the most positive way. They had a lot of clout and were able to act as they wanted until someone called them out.\u201dMr. Gopman, 33, is mentioned in Ms. Scott\u2019s suit. Other male employees, the suit said, would talk about how he \u201crefuses to wear a condom\u201d and \u201chas had sex with over 1,000 people.\u201dMr. Freeman, the chief executive, said in an interview that the company was moving on. The lesson he learned, he said, was that employees need to talk more, and that especially in times of trouble they need someone to hear their complaints. Under the agreement to end Ms. Scott\u2019s suit, Mr. Freeman was precluded from discussing it.\u201cA lot of things could be avoided if there is an open line of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you have five people, male or female, at a start-up you need external HR. Not having someone to go talk to about your potential concerns just makes it so much worse.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re the strongest as a company that we\u2019ve ever been because of this.\u201dAs for Ms. Scott, she now works for a camera company. She told friends that she had numerous interviews with VR companies, but as soon as they found out she had filed suit against her previous employer, they all declined to hire her.A woman runs Upload now. Kind of.Anne Ahola Ward, a specialist in increasing internet traffic, was a consultant to Upload. In June, when many of the employees were quitting, she proposed taking over. Her title is chief operating officer.\u201cAnne has had a lot of experience, and experience is a huge thing,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. He demurred when asked whether she was the \u201cadult supervision\u201d that all start-ups are said to need. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults here,\u201d he said.Ms. Ward, 38, is wry about the opportunity.\u201cI\u2019m a woman in Silicon Valley,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think someone would have handed me the keys to a start-up that wasn\u2019t beleaguered?\u201d Her husband asked the obvious question: Why aren\u2019t you the chief executive? \u201cThe title isn\u2019t important to me,\u201d she said.The kink room is now Ms. Ward\u2019s office. There is no bed there. She has instituted mandatory anti-harassment training: a two-hour session led by an outside consultant. There is now a human resources department. People have formal job descriptions. And as a joke \u2014 but not quite \u2014 people in the office gave Ms. Ward a sheriff\u2019s badge.An article on Saturday about a lawsuit against the virtual reality start-up Upload misstated the age of Elizabeth Scott, the plaintiff in the case.

{"Headline": "Can South Africa Reawaken Nelson Mandela\u2019s Dream?", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewNelson Mandela\u2019s dream of a free, prosperous and nonracial South Africa has turned into a nightmare. The nation\u2019s constitution, often hailed as one of the most progressive in the world, is under siege by the very man who took an oath to protect it.Mr. Zuma\u2019s rampant corruption has bolstered this disillusionment.More recently, according to media reports, leaked emails and the findings of the public protector, Mr. Zuma outsourced some aspects of governance to a family of expats from India that has established businesses with his son, Duduzane Zuma, and is profiting from government contracts while exerting political influence wherever it can. The family \u2014 brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, and their nephew Varun Gupta \u2014 even influence ministerial appointments.In 2016 Mcebisi Jonas, then a deputy minister of finance, reported that he had been summoned to the Gupta family mansion and offered 600 million rand (about $43 million) if he accepted the position of finance minister. According to Mr. Jonas, the Guptas told him that the president was going to remove the current minister of finance, who had allegedly blocked some lucrative contracts and become an obstacle to the Guptas\u2019 access to the treasury.Mr. Jonas had enough integrity to refuse the offer. But Mr. Zuma nevertheless replaced the finance minister with a Gupta-approved official, who, after a public outcry, lasted only a weekend.And yet the president continues to enjoy powerful support from sectors of the electorate. Mr. Zuma remains popular in rural areas, particularly among the Zulu people, South Africa\u2019s largest ethnic group. They embrace him as a charismatic, conservative man with four wives who speaks their language at political rallies and makes inside ethnic jokes.Another source of power for Mr. Zuma is South Africa\u2019s electoral system, which is not constituency-based, but proportion-based. Voters do not directly elect their representatives; they vote for political parties. Party bosses then compile lists of candidates and dictate how members of the legislatures should vote. All of them toe the line, since none want to jeopardize their livelihoods.Then there is the Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association, a ragtag army of ardent Zuma supporters in ill-fitting camouflage uniforms who purport to be veterans of the A.N.C.\u2019s guerrilla war against the apartheid regime (though members in their early 20s are too young to have fought in a war that ended more than 25 years ago). Mr. Zuma recently tried to put this group on a war footing, instructing them to close ranks behind him and defend his beleaguered \u201crevolution\u201d against those who protest against him.Not all is lost, however. Despite South Africa\u2019s perverted state, the independent judiciary has been a saving grace, and a robust media regularly exposes government corruption. Additionally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the South African Communist Party and factions within the A.N.C. have banded together and demanded that Mr. Zuma step down. So have a number of civil society organizations (some led by A.N.C. members), which have organized mass demonstrations in major cities.Additionally, opposition parties, previously weak and ineffectual, have a much louder voice since being joined in Parliament by the Economic Freedom Fighters, a more radical party that has gained a large following among unemployed black youths.Despite all this, Mr. Zuma is unlikely to relinquish power.Mr. Zuma is also trying to position his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to take over as president in 2019 when his second term ends, most likely in the hope that she will grant him a pardon.The opposition parties are demanding that Mr. Zuma step down now. But it is unlikely that any party will secure an outright majority in 2019; instead, the opposition parties will gang up against the A.N.C. and form coalitions in some provinces. They have already done so in three major metropolitan areas where the A.N.C. failed to get a majority in the last local election.For too long Mr. Zuma has fostered a culture of arrogance and impunity among the ruling elite, and for too long the decay has continued unabated. South Africa must change course, before a troubled democracy is reduced to a thugocracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Wins, Democracy Loses", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 On Wednesday, Facebook revealed that hundreds of Russia-based accounts had run anti-Hillary Clinton ads precisely aimed at Facebook users whose demographic profiles implied a vulnerability to political propaganda. It will take time to prove whether the account owners had any relationship with the Russian government, but one thing is clear: Facebook has contributed to, and profited from, the erosion of democratic norms in the United States and elsewhere.The audacity of a hostile foreign power trying to influence American voters rightly troubles us. But it should trouble us more that Facebook makes such manipulation so easy, and renders political ads exempt from the basic accountability and transparency that healthy democracy demands.The majority of the Facebook ads did not directly mention a presidential candidate, according to Alex Stamos, head of security at Facebook, but \u201cappeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dThe ads \u2014 about 3,000 placed by 470 accounts and pages spending about $100,000 \u2014 were what the advertising industry calls \u201cdark posts,\u201d seen only by a very specific audience, obscured by the flow of posts within a Facebook News Feed and ephemeral. Facebook calls its \u201cdark post\u201d service \u201cunpublished page post ads.\u201dThis should not surprise us. Anyone can deploy Facebook ads. They are affordable and easy. That\u2019s one reason that Facebook has grown so quickly, taking in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, virtually all of it from advertisers, by serving up the attention of two billion Facebook users across the globe.The service is popular among advertisers for its efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness. Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more. There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it\u2019s being used for commerce instead of politics. What\u2019s alarming is that Facebook executives don\u2019t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.A core principle in political advertising is transparency \u2014 political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from. And it\u2019s expensive to run even one version of an ad in traditional outlets, let alone a dozen different versions. Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.None of that transparency matters to Facebook. Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing. The potential for abuse is vast. An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened. Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.Unfortunately, the range of potential responses to this problem is limited. The First Amendment grants broad protections to publishers like Facebook. Diplomacy, even the harsh kind, has failed to dissuade Russia from meddling. And it\u2019s even less likely to under the current administration.Daniel Kreiss, a communication scholar at the University of North Carolina, proposes that sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a repository of campaign ads so that regulators, scholars, journalists and the public can examine and expose them. But the companies have no impetus to concur and coordinate. And Congress is unlikely to reform a system that campaigns are just learning to master.Facebook has no incentive to change its ways. The money is too great. The issue is too nebulous to alienate more than a few Facebook users. The more that Facebook saturates our lives, families and communities, the harder it is to live without it.Facebook has pledged to install better filtering systems using artificial intelligence and machine-learning to flag accounts that are run by automated \u201cbots\u201d or violate the site\u2019s terms of service. But these are just new versions of the technologies that have caused the problem in the first place. And there would be no accountability beyond Facebook\u2019s word. The fact remains that in the arms race to keep propaganda flowing, human beings review troublesome accounts only long after the damage has been done.Our best hopes sit in Brussels and London. European regulators have been watching Facebook and Google for years. They have taken strong actions against both companies for violating European consumer data protection standards and business competition laws. The British government is investigating the role Facebook and its use of citizens\u2019 data played in the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 national elections.We are in the midst of a worldwide, internet-based assault on democracy. Scholars at the Oxford Internet Institute have tracked armies of volunteers and bots as they move propaganda across Facebook and Twitter in efforts to undermine trust in democracy or to elect their preferred candidates in the Philippines, India, France, the Netherlands, Britain and elsewhere. We now know that agents in Russia are exploiting the powerful Facebook advertising system directly.In the 21st-century social media information war, faith in democracy is the first casualty.Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, is writing a book about Facebook.Advertisement"}

At any moment, whoever is onscreen \u2014 the hunter who believes he has a God-given right to shoot animals; the anti-poaching officer whose work is financed in part by the hunting industry; the poor villagers endangered by animals that the wealthy pay to kill \u2014 might challenge our assumptions and expose our ignorance.Layered, thoughtful and infinitely curious, \u201cTrophy\u201d is shot so simply and beautifully, and with such nonjudgmental calm, that it\u2019s easy to miss the ingenuity of its construction. Intervening solely to offer the occasional devastating statistic, the filmmakers allow our perceptions to shift and slide with each new piece of information. Here, canny businessman and genuine animal lover share the same skin, and a high-end safari outfitter is no less concerned for his beasts than the most vehement anti-hunting activist.This blurring of lines is nowhere more pronounced than in the efforts of John Hume, the rhino breeder, to discourage illegal poaching by legalizing the sale of rhino horn. A profoundly polarizing and finally tragic figure, Mr. Hume opens himself for condemnation. But be careful: That moral high ground you\u2019re standing on might not be as solid as you think.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes.Advertisement"}

Ryan, who were pressing for an 18-month deal. Republicans complained that Mr. Trump had empowered the Democrats and made it harder to come up with longer-term fiscal legislation in December.Mr. Trump has also begun to seek Democratic votes for his tax overhaul, something he did not do in a sustained way during the health care fight earlier in the year. He is alternately pressuring and wooing Democrats representing red states like Missouri and North Dakota and may find some support among moderates in the opposition party.\u201cI think he\u2019s becoming a little more pragmatic and, frankly, becoming a little more presidential in his ability to recognize that you don\u2019t get anything done around here unless you can find ways to work with both sides,\u201d Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said on CNN on Friday.Watching on the sidelines were Republicans stewing at a president of their own party schmoozing with \u201cChuck and Nancy,\u201d as Mr. Trump called them. But they presume it will not last and that he will come to understand that he cannot trust Democrats nor find common ground with them on issues like the border wall. By postponing larger questions of government spending and the debt ceiling until December, they said, he simply gave Democrats weapons to use to hinder or force concessions on the tax overhaul legislation which may be coming to a critical debate around that time.\u201cThis was a bad deal, this was a foolish deal,\u201d Representative Sean P. Duffy, Republican of Wisconsin, said on Fox Business Network. \u201cHe shot from the hip and he missed the target, and I think he thinks it\u2019s great now, but you guys all wait, when we\u2019re trying to do this big issues that we promised, this is going to come blow back right in our face and it\u2019s going to be a big problem.\u201dMr. Trump planned to leave by midafternoon for Camp David, where he will host a Cabinet meeting over the weekend and monitor Irma\u2019s arrival and the response to it.

{"Headline": "Menendez Trial Set to Begin With Tensions High and Washington Watching", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 The senator paused in a corridor of the federal courthouse here last month to oblige a beckoning courtroom sketch artist.Since his indictment more than two years ago, Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence, and last week he reiterated that. \u201cI am going to be exonerated,\u201d he said in a brief interview on Wednesday with reporters following a rally protesting President Trump\u2019s immigration policies.Mr. Menendez is charged with 12 corruption-related counts, including six counts of bribery and three counts of honest services fraud.Aside from the fate of Mr. Menendez, the outcome of the trial could also have implications on how the government defines relationships between donors and politicians.Opening statements are scheduled for Wednesday, but legal sparring began picking up last week, as Mr. Menendez\u2019s team took exception to a pretrial brief from prosecutors, which summarized the indictment and laid out the government\u2019s legal arguments.\u201cThe first 16 pages of this \u2018brief\u2019 seem designed solely to generate adverse pretrial publicity for the defendants, giving the media a rhetorically florid preview of the prosecutors\u2019 opening argument,\u201d wrote Raymond M. Brown, one of Mr. Menendez\u2019s lawyers, in a response.The retort from the defense was a reminder of what is at stake for Mr. Menendez: Not only must his team win over the jury that will hear the criminal case, but the senator must preserve his standing with voters, who will decide next year whether to re-elect him.The trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, hinges not necessarily on the concrete evidence that the government has collected, but rather on subjective questions about intent, friendship and \u201cofficial acts.\u201dThe legal case revolves around whether those gifts were permissible as gifts a friend could give to another, or whether they were part of a longstanding bribery arrangement where Mr. Menendez would intervene to protect the financial and personal interests of Dr. Melgen in return for his gifts and donations.\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that makes this case interesting: It asks the existential question as to when friendship ends and corruption begins,\u201d said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Newark.The Menendez team asserts that the senator and the doctor have been close friends for more than 20 years, and that Dr. Melgen\u2019s generosity was simply his way of sharing his wealth with a close friend.But the prosecution argues that they were part of a corrupt pact to trade favors for influence. And, in a brief filed in court on Wednesday, prosecutors argued that even in a friendship, defendants could be found guilty of corruption.\u201cWith respect to claims of friendship in particular, it is not uncommon for defendants to establish some evidence of friendship in bribery cases but still be found guilty,\u201d the brief stated.The prosecution will also attempt to show that the timing of Dr. Melgen\u2019s gifts corresponded with Mr. Menendez\u2019s actions on his behalf, and that pattern established the quid pro quo necessary for a bribery conviction.In their brief, prosecutors alleged that Mr. Menendez began taking bribes from Dr. Melgen shortly after Mr. Menendez was elected to the Senate in 2006 and that a lot of his efforts on behalf of Mr. Melgen came after large donations to his re-election efforts and legal defense funds.When Dr. Melgen needed help to resolve a contract dispute for a company he owned operating X-ray equipment in the Dominican Republic, he donated $60,000 to various political groups and super PACs supporting Mr. Menendez, the brief stated. On the same day, Mr. Menendez met with an assistant secretary on the state to press the issue, according to the brief.When Dr. Melgen needed quick changes to a Medicare reimbursement program, he donated $300,000 through his company to Majority PAC, a super PAC supporting Democratic candidates for Senate. The same day, Mr. Menendez met with officials at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and a month later, with Kathleen Sebelius, then the secretary of Health and Human Services, according to the brief.The defense asserts that Mr. Menendez was acting on broad policies that were consistent with his policy views and that he did not do anything out of the ordinary for Dr. Melgen, on both the Medicare reimbursement and on the contract issue in the Dominican Republic.\u201cIf they can make this seem like the Virginia governor\u2019s case, that was McDonnell, that he\u2019s just doing what we want a responsible politician to do, he\u2019s creating opportunities for a friend \u2013 who parenthetically is not a constituent \u2013 that he\u2019s being responsive, he\u2019s opening a door, he\u2019s providing opportunities, that can help,\u201d explained Mala Ahuja Harker, a former federal prosecutor, in New Jersey. \u201cThe problem for the defense is that in this case the facts suggest that he went much further than that.\u201dFor the senator\u2019s part, he\u2019s been juggling preparation for his trial with an aggressive schedule in his home state: continuing his statewide Jersey Jobs Tour with a craft distillery visit, a meeting with the New Jersey Credit Union League to discuss tax reform, and appearances at two rallies fighting for immigration rights.His defense team says he\u2019s in \u201cgood spirits,\u201d and at the immigration rally in Jersey City on Wednesday, Mr. Menendez opened with a joke.\u201cThank you Madam President,\u201d he said to Sue Henderson, the president of New Jersey City University. \u201cI was hoping to say that more often but I\u2019ll say it today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Central Bank Signals End of Cheap Money Era is Coming", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Europe has taken a small step in its long march toward economic normalcy.The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said.Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank\u2019s Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008.The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump.But the program \u2014 known as quantitative easing \u2014 has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble.Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the benefits have far outweighed any negative effects. Still, with the Fed moving in the opposite direction, the European Central Bank has been under pressure to shift its policy.Yet he also left himself plenty of wiggle room in case conditions change. In particular, the central bank will be keeping a close eye on the euro\u2019s growing strength compared to the dollar, which Mr. Draghi said could alter assumptions about how the eurozone economy will perform.\u201cThe recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring,\u201d he said at a news conference.When the euro rises against the dollar, European exports become more expensive \u2014 not only in the United States but also in other countries, like China, whose currencies are linked with the dollar. That typically means that European companies will sell fewer goods abroad, hurting growth and prolonging the need for central bank stimulus.A robust euro also undercuts the bank\u2019s efforts to jolt inflation back to the official target of 2 percent, a level considered healthy for growth. A strong euro holds down consumer prices by making imported oil and other goods cheaper for eurozone residents. That\u2019s not all bad for people who live in Europe, but low inflation means that Mr. Draghi has to keep printing money longer than he would like.The eurozone\u2019s annual rate of inflation in August was 1.5 percent, and a substantial increase is nowhere in sight. According to forecasts by the central bank\u2019s staff, inflation will still be below the target in 2019.There\u2019s not much Mr. Draghi can do about the weak dollar, which analysts say reflects pessimism about the ability of President Trump and Congress to agree on legislation that many economists believe would help bolster growth in the United States, such as infrastructure programs or corporate tax reform.\u201cInvestors no longer trust the American government to push through tax reform and fiscal stimulus,\u201d Alwin Schenk, a portfolio manager at the German bank Sal. Oppenheim, said in a note to clients.In addition, investors have sold dollars and bought euros after becoming more optimistic about the eurozone\u2019s prospects for growth.Mr. Draghi may have tried to talk the euro down on Thursday by stressing that a stronger currency could alter assumptions about future inflation. But if that was his goal, the jawboning did not work \u2014 the euro rose about 1 cent to $1.20 after his remarks.The bank has said it will spend 60 billion euros, or $72 billion, a month in eurozone bond markets at least through December, but has not said what it will do after that. Mr. Draghi reiterated Thursday that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, currently zero, until it has ended the bond purchases. That means rate increases are probably still years away.There may be another reason the European Central Bank must dial back the stimulus \u2014 the supply of bonds may be getting scarce.When it announced its quantitative easing program, the bank promised not to buy more than 33 percent of any one bond issue, to avoid distorting the market too much. The limit is also designed to protect against legal challenges by critics who say the bond buying is illegal because the central bank is barred by law from using its printing presses to finance eurozone governments.Many analysts believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the bank to avoid exceeding the limit for German Bunds and other kinds of bonds because it has already bought so many.Mr. Draghi dismissed those concerns Thursday. \u201cThese doubts were present at the very beginning of the program,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we will be able to exploit all the flexibility the program has.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Social Contract Is Broken\u2019: Inequality Becomes Deadly in Mexico", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterMONTERREY, Mexico \u2014 Viewed from above, greater Monterrey, with its corporate headquarters and golf resorts, appears as one city stretching between the mountains that surround it.Closer up, though, it becomes clear that invisible walls enclose Monterrey\u2019s wealthy core, creating a dividing line between its four million residents. For the people within those invisible walls, government is responsive and crime low. Those outside face rising murder rates, corruption and, activists say, police brutality.Sergio Salas exists in both sides. He commutes between the education ministry in an affluent area downtown, where he works on special education programs, and his home in the working class suburb of Ju\u00e1rez.Mr. Salas always assumed he was safe at his home, with the butterfly preserve he built in the backyard. Then, last year, criminals arrived at his house, tied him up and robbed him. Shaken, he returned only after installing a fence and hiring a part-time guard.His beloved town, he said, has changed amid a rash of such crimes. Families put up walls, decamp for more prosperous areas or simply endure. The very notion of community has vanished.As Mexico descends into its most violent year on record and the state proves incapable of responding, those with resources are taking matters into their own hands. Landowners, businesses and the rich are buying security by means legal and not.Any social compact is built in part on the agreement that security is a public good, shared and maintained by all. As Mexico\u2019s rich effectively withdraw, the implicit arrangements that hold society together are breaking down.Though the effects are subtle, they are everywhere. The rise of vigilantism, criminal impunity, police corruption and state weakness can all be traced in part to this growing security inequality.In Ju\u00e1rez, neighbors would once come together against common challenges like crime or a corrupt police officer, but now, Mr. Salas said, \u201cthere is a culture of not participating, of not caring, of silence.\u201d\u201cThe social contract is broken,\u201d he said.In response, those who could afford it enlisted private security to do what the state could not.Between 2013 and 2015, the number of private security companies nearly tripled, according to government statistics. Industry analysts believe the real number, including unregistered firms, may be several times higher.The shift may be worsening Mexico\u2019s notoriously ineffective justice system, which secures convictions for only a tiny fraction of crimes. Armed guards can prevent a murder but they cannot investigate one, much less roll up a local cartel.As powerful classes grow less reliant on the state for security, political pressure for addressing crime or reforming police has declined, even as the murder rate rises.In moneyed enclaves across Mexico, where guards patrol boutique shops and hip restaurants, the violence rarely comes up in conversation, as if it were happening in another country.Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are left unprotected. Gangs and organized crime have flowed into poor neighborhoods.The divide is starkly visible in places like Santa Fe, an affluent neighborhood on Mexico City\u2019s western edge, where glass high-rises and shopping malls overlook slums that sprawl out from their shadows.On a recent afternoon in one such slum, Andres Ruiz, a sometimes-employed musician, leaned against a wall as he waited for the bus that, though frequently targeted by robbers, was his only way into town.\u201cSecurity is only for them, for the high people,\u201d he said, using a word that also means elite. Gang members, who openly patrol the streets, crawled past on a motorbike. \u201cWe are relegated, forgotten.\u201dLiving outside those walls, Mr. Ruiz said, \u201cis like being in a slaughterhouse.\u201dMarilena Hernandez, who sells quesadillas and tacos down the street, said it might be for the best that police ignore the robberies that come \u201cat any hour.\u201d\u201cIt can be counterproductive to call them,\u201d she said. The police, for her, were just another form of private security that she could not afford. \u201cIf you have money to give the officers, maybe they\u2019ll be more eager to help you, but otherwise they won\u2019t.\u201dAs the state recedes, inequality and violence, once largely distinct phenomena here, are feeding into one another. That cycle can be seen especially in the rise of vigilante militias. Those groups are \u201cthe extreme of the phenomenon of private security,\u201d Edna Trevi\u00f1o, the director of M\u00e9xico Eval\u00faa, a public policy think tank, said in her office in Mexico City.They began as a grass-roots solution to the violence. Local communities, fed up with police, organized self-defense groups to replace them. But this only accelerated Mexico\u2019s breakdown, with the proliferation of untrained gunmen who often acted with impunity.Many militias were bought off by cartels. Others were tempted into drug trafficking, kidnapping or extortion. They are now considered a major driver of the disintegration they were once meant to solve.In a study of 2,500 towns, Mr. Phillips found that vigilantes did not necessarily arise in the areas with higher crime or a weaker state presence, as one might expect.Rather, the wider a town\u2019s gap between rich and poor, the greater the odds that vigilante militias would form. Conversely, a town with more equality, even if it is poor, rarely produces such groups.When looking at individual cases, it becomes clear how inequality, more so even than violence, drives the vigilantism tearing apart the rural countryside.For the rural rich, who are often landowners, hired guns can guard a business or farm that local institutions are too weak to protect. Then, in a microcosm of national trends, the militia effectively replaces the police, but rarely protects those who cannot afford to pay them.This often prompts the poor, seeing that only militias provide security, to form their own volunteer forces, or to turn to lynchings, a form of vigilantism that requires few resources.Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor who studies security issues, said that might-makes-right vigilantism has shifted the \u201cgravity of power\u201d in rural areas toward those with the most money.\u201cPrivate security has become a central part of criminality itself,\u201d Mr. Ungar said.\u201cThere is something particular to security,\u201d said Rita Abrahamsen, a political scientist who studies security\u2019s effects on society. \u201cIt\u2019s different from something like health care. If you don\u2019t have security, then that cohesion cannot be maintained.\u201dAndr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a left-wing populist known for challenging the legitimacy of elections, leads polls for next year\u2019s presidential vote. Though he has emphasized economic inequality rather than security issues, his supporters include many poor and working class people who feel left behind.Inequality \u201cis one of the great issues in this country,\u201d Jorge Tello, a former director of the national intelligence service, said over coffee at a private club in Monterrey. Nearby, a well-dressed family sang happy birthday.When violence first rose citywide, Monterrey\u2019s powerful corporate leaders pushed for, and often directly financed, root-and-branch reforms intended to protect everyone.But when crime fell in wealthy areas, so did pressure for continuing the reforms. Though rich citizens had spent benevolently, they had deepened a political culture in which institutions and officials serve the moneyed. Areas like Ju\u00e1rez fell into neglect.\u201cThat\u2019s why I think L\u00f3pez Obrador has a huge chance to become the next president, because a big part of the population doesn\u2019t have access to a restaurant like this,\u201d he said.As Mexicans withdraw from the social compact, Mr. Tello warned, problems like crime and corruption entrench.\u201cWhen you talk about these issues in Mexico, it\u2019s said that there\u2019s such a lack of governance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the lack of citizenship as well.\u201d\u201cMexican society has always been unequal,\u201d Ms. Trevi\u00f1o, the director of M\u00e9xico Eval\u00faa, said.Now even security, the bedrock of social order, was becoming a matter of every Mexican for himself or herself, altering how citizens see their obligations to society itself.\u201cWe are a society that won\u2019t mobilize very much, won\u2019t act against deadly violence,\u201d she said.As the sense of collective good recedes, neglect is becoming the new norm.\u201cIn some slums of the city, there is no presence of the state,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing, literally nothing. Young people have to take care of each other in the street.\u201dMr. Salas, the Ju\u00e1rez robbery victim, expressed optimism that the social contract could be repaired if communities unlearned their new habits.\u201cIt is a cultural thing that was put together little by little, so you have to dismantle it and then put it back together piece by piece,\u201d he said. \u201cI bet on that. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019m not moving.\u201dBut Ms. Trevi\u00f1o, after watching years of work on poverty and governance unravel, worries that society might not come back together again.\u201cIt\u2019s very serious,\u201d she said.\u201cAs I say this, it\u2019s making me emotional,\u201d she added, tears of frustration rising in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified an affluent enclave of Monterrey, Mexico.

It is often said that Germany is too big for Europe and too small for the world.But with the presidency of Donald J. Trump and the newly aggressive and authoritarian leaders of Russia, Turkey, Hungary and Poland \u2014 and now a rearing of the far-right in Germany\u2019s election on Sunday \u2014 Ms. Merkel has had leadership thrust upon her.Angela Merkel won a fourth term on Sunday as German chancellor. Her longevity in power has helped her cement her formidable position in Europe.She regularly jousts with President Trump over trade and climate, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over the annexation of Crimea and economic sanctions, and with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey over human rights and migration.Re-elected on Sunday, the pragmatic Ms. Merkel will not recoil from new responsibilities, analysts and experts suggested. Instead, she wants to use her standing to set the European Union on a more stable, viable course, making it and Germany a larger and perhaps more rational force in an increasingly rancorous world.For someone who \u201chas always disliked being singled out or put on a pedestal,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said, this is a major change.Having grown up in East Germany, \u201cshe has learned in her biography that standing up for the rule of law and liberal values is worth it, and she\u2019s very sincere in that,\u201d Mr. Perthes said.But it is the future of Europe and the European Union, with all of its problems of currency, trade imbalances, sovereign debt, terrorism, migration, defense, demography, youth unemployment and slow but gradually improving growth that really preoccupies her.Especially after the global financial meltdown in 2008, Ms. Merkel grew into a leadership role as the weight in Europe shifted. \u201cAfter 2012 you could really feel it,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said.She led the Western response to the Russian annexation of Crimea, has been a bulwark against far-right parties and populism, has pushed for aid to Syria and North Africa, has been forthright in defending the Paris agreement on climate change, has committed rich Germany to spend significantly more on European defense and has urged German and European participation in diplomatic efforts to end the crisis over North Korea.\u201cAs the United States under Trump pulls away from that role, Germany has a huge interest in maintaining both the European and global order,\u201d she added.But to do that Ms. Merkel will need to fix the yawning problems of the euro common currency \u2014 the lack of fiscal discipline among member states and also the lack of European institutional backstops \u2014 and do it in conjunction with the new French president, Emmanuel Macron.She will also need to help modernize and reform the European Union so it can function with all its diversity and without Britain, which currently contributes 14 percent of the bloc\u2019s budget. And she is committed to paying significantly more for collective defense.There is no missionary zeal, but a deep sense of duty.\u201cIf she thinks about legacy, it\u2019s to finally get the eurozone right,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said. \u201cAnd she wants to move ahead with a more disparate Europe.\u201dThat Europe must find a better arrangement with more authoritarian outliers like Mr. Orban in Hungary and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the effective leader of Poland, who value their membership in the bloc but do not always share its values, and do not want the Brussels bureaucracy pushing them around.\u201cIt all sounds dull, but she likes that \u2014 dullness is her middle name,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said. \u201cBut it\u2019s ambitious all the same, even if she moves step by step, as ever with her. But that suits Europe \u2014 you can\u2019t revolutionize Europe. She sits and waits and lets everyone speak, and then she finds a compromise. That is her strength.\u201dIn general, European leaders admit, Ms. Merkel, by virtue of Germany\u2019s power and of her own longevity, has the deciding voice in Brussels. Even in the European bureaucracy, Germany has great sway; taking Europe as a fundamental national interest, senior officials are encouraged to take European jobs.\u201c\u2018Savior of the West\u2019 both gives too much credit to Germany and puts too much weight on it,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cGermany still thinks of its foreign policy as predominantly European, within the E.U. or certainly with E.U. partners.\u201cGermany never wants to lead alone,\u201d she added. \u201cBut she will stand up, even against allies, if she sees the principles of the international order undermined. That\u2019s why the French elections were so important, why Brexit is so painful and why Poland and Hungary are so difficult.\u201dThe German election campaign was complacent in a prosperous country, with little debate about the international challenges ahead.But Ms. Merkel\u2019s global role may only grow in the next few years, as Germany sees itself more and more as a \u201cnormal\u201d country, restrained but not paralyzed by the Nazi past.In Germany, Ms. Schwarzer said, \u201cyou see the impact of history, which is caution and the desire not to be alone.\u201d Still, she said, \u201ctaking more responsibility and not being able to rely on allies and structures like the E.U., as we could in the last decade, is the new reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even China\u2019s national government, fairly cautious in its previous borrowing, has been running budget deficits lately, and the country\u2019s famously frugal households have begun using more credit.\u201cThe downgrade reflects our assessment that a prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China\u2019s economic and financial risks,\u201d S.&P. said in a statement.Still, reaction to the downgrade was harsh.In a lengthy statement on Friday, China\u2019s Finance Ministry called the move \u201ca mistaken decision\u201d and labeled concerns about China\u2019s debt \u201cstale news.\u201d It cited the country\u2019s efforts to close excess factories and streamline industries that suffer from overcapacity and significant moves toward reform. It also cited the Chinese government\u2019s deep financial resources to address any potential debt shocks.\u201cThis type of misreading neglects the Chinese economy\u2019s good fundamentals and development potential,\u201d it said.The government is likely to be particularly upset because S.&P. issued the downgrade less than a month before the start of the Communist Party Congress. The meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinping as the country\u2019s core leader, but move some new officials to serve with him.Mr. Xi has made political and economic stability the country\u2019s top priority in the months leading up to the congress. That has included allowing the state-controlled banking system to continue, and even expand, its already heavy lending since midsummer, while a modest effort in late spring to limit the growth in lending has been pursued with less zeal.S.&P. downgraded its rating on the country\u2019s sovereign debt by one notch.Warnings about China\u2019s borrowing are not new.In the span of nearly a decade, China went from a country with few loans to one with debt levels comparable to those of the United States. While economists say China has plenty of financial firepower to address debt-related problems, the speed of the accumulation and the heavy lending in particular to rusty old industries such as steel and cement could cause issues.\u201cThis won\u2019t be news to anyone who has kept half an eye on China over recent years and shouldn\u2019t change anyone\u2019s thinking,\u201d Capital Economics, a research firm, said in a statement on Thursday evening, adding that since Moody\u2019s downgraded China in May and Fitch Ratings, another ratings firm, did so in 2013, \u201cS.&P. is playing catch-up.\u201dBut S.&P.\u2019s move could offer a reminder that those problems are not going away.The Chinese government has taken a number of small steps over the past year to rein in borrowing. While debt is still rising, it is not doing so quite as quickly relative to the size of the economy as it was a year ago. Banking regulators have also put pressure on financial institutions to move more fund-raising activities onto their balance sheets, in an effort to tame the country\u2019s large shadow banking sector.S.&P. also pointed out that China has a number of tools at its disposal to deal with any disruption resulting from its hefty debt levels. They include hefty foreign exchange reserves, large net overseas investments and large trade surpluses with other nations.S.&P. downgraded its rating on China to A+ from AA\u2212, but with a stable outlook, meaning that the company does not anticipate another rating change in the short term. It said it expected China\u2019s growth to slow to 5.8 percent by 2020. While that figure would be the envy of many countries, and S.&P. called it \u201cstrong,\u201d it would represent a slowdown from last year, with 6.7 percent growth.Advertisement"}

Both men have denied any wrongdoing.Prosecutors have sought to portray the senator as abusing his position to intervene when Dr. Melgen had concerns he needed addressed.In one instance, Mr. Menendez, according to testimony, met with two former high-ranking Democratic senators \u2014 Tom Harkin of Iowa and Harry Reid of Nevada \u2014 to discuss a Medicare billing dispute that would have cost Dr. Melgen millions of dollars. In a second, prosecution witnesses said he pressured the State Department and Customs and Border Protection officials to help Dr. Melgen, who owned a cargo-scanning equipment company, maintain his business\u2019s presence at ports in the Dominican Republic.In particular, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez urged Customs and Border Protection to stop a donation of cargo-scanning equipment from the United States government that would have cut into Dr. Melgen\u2019s profits.\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat unusual to have a senator or a member of Congress to ask us to stop \u2014 in a way, stop doing our law enforcement mission,\u201d Stephanie Talton, a former congressional liaison for Customs and Border Protection, testified. Ms. Talton had received an email from an aide to Mr. Menendez asking her to \u201cplease consider holding off on the delivery of any such equipment until you can discuss this matter with us.\u201d\u201cIf we had deemed that it was necessary to provide this equipment to do our law enforcement mission,\u201d Ms. Talton said, \u201cI found it odd that a senator would tell us to stop doing that.\u201dProsecutors on Thursday frequently returned to Mr. Menendez\u2019s membership on various Senate committees. In questioning Todd Robinson, the current United States ambassador to Guatemala, who worked under the ambassador to the Dominican Republic at the time Dr. Melgen was involved in the port dispute, prosecutors highlighted Mr. Menendez\u2019s seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which Mr. Robinson said held sway over the State Department.Mr. Menendez warned that he would convene a Senate hearing, Mr. Robinson testified, if the State Department did not help Dr. Melgen resolve a contract dispute between the Dominican government and Dr. Melgen\u2019s company.\u201cThe senator noted displeasure very clearly with the current state of affairs and threatened to hold a hearing on the matter if we don\u2019t meet his deadline,\u201d a State Department official wrote in an email to Mr. Robinson.Mr. Robinson conceded that it was not unusual for members of Congress to request assistance on behalf of American businesses abroad. But when government lawyers asked how many of those requests involved threats of Senate hearings, he replied, \u201cNone that I know of.\u201dMr. Robinson added, \u201cIt was not likely to be a friendly hearing, because you have the word threat in the email.\u201dLawyers for Mr. Menendez focused on the semantics of the request from his aide, pointing out words like \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cconsider\u201d as proof that the senator had not intended to give any sort of command.\u201cIt started off with \u2018please,\u2019 correct?\u201d Raymond Brown, a defense lawyer, asked Ms. Talton, the Customs and Border Protection liaison. \u201cAnd we understand that to be a word of entreaty, not direction, correct?\u201dBut Amanda Vaughn, a federal prosecutor, pressed Ms. Talton to explain why an entreaty from Mr. Menendez, also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, might hold more weight than a request from other senators.\u201cWhen something like that comes from a staffer for a member that sits on a committee as powerful to us as the Senate Finance Committee, it\u2019s just a polite way of telling us what to do,\u201d Ms. Talton said, explaining that the committee has oversight of her agency.Another witness, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, also alluded to actions by Mr. Menendez involving Dr. Melgen\u2019s Medicare dispute. Mr. Menendez had met with Dr. Melgen and Mr. Harkin, the former senator from Iowa, to discuss millions of dollars Dr. Melgen had been accused of overbilling Medicare. Ms. Krishnamoorthy, a former aide to Mr. Harkin, said she could think of only one other time in her 10 years of working for Mr. Harkin that another senator had asked to meet with her boss on behalf of someone who did not live in his state.\u201cIt just was different,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for a constituent.\u201dThe other instance, Ms. Krishnamoorthy said, was when another senator asked Mr. Harkin to discuss research on a rare disease that the senator\u2019s grandchild had been found to have.\u201cBut in that instance, it was the senator\u2019s grandchild,\u201d the prosecutor repeated.\u201cCorrect,\u201d Ms. Krishnamoorthy replied.After court Thursday, Mr. Menendez held a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport, where he planned to board a flight to travel to Puerto Rico to survey the damage wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. He would return Friday evening or Saturday morning, his spokesman said.Mr. Menendez called on President Trump to deploy more resources to the island, where his brother lives.\u201cI hope that I will be able to go back to the Senate, since we\u2019re having a short week here in Newark, and in doing so press some of this with my colleagues, as I have been doing on the phone,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Drops Stock Move That Would Have Solidified Zuckerberg\u2019s Control", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said Friday that it would drop a proposed reclassification of its stock that would have solidified Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s control over the social network, in a victory for shareholders in a class-action lawsuit against the social giant.\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Facebook has dropped the reclassification,\u201d said Stuart Grant, a partner at the law firm Grant & Eisenhofer, who represented institutional Facebook investors in the lawsuit. \u201cToday\u2019s move is a total victory for stockholders.\u201dVanessa Chan, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the board had \u201cdetermined that withdrawing the reclassification was in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders.\u201dThe decision to drop the stock reclassification bucks a trend for technology chief executives who have structured their stock to gain outsize control over their company, often at the cost of common shareholder input. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who founded Google, and Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy of Snap are among those who hold a disproportionate share of voting power over their companies.The impetus for the stock reclassification came after Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, his wife, celebrated the birth of their first daughter, Maxima. The couple used the occasion to found the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company that acts as the main vehicle for the couple to give away their wealth over the coming years.\u201cAt the time, I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I thought it was the only way. But I also knew it was going to be complicated and it wasn\u2019t a perfect solution.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg and a spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said the stock reclassification was no longer necessary. The chief executive noted that because of Facebook\u2019s strong stock performance, \u201cI can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more.\u201dHe said he planned to sell 35 million to 75 million shares over the next 18 months to finance work in fields like education and science.\u201cThis path offers a way to do all of this, and I\u2019m looking forward to making more progress together,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Architect of Austerity, Is Out as Germany\u2019s Finance Minister", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a dominant figure in the European Union for more than a decade, will leave his post as Germany\u2019s finance minister, effectively ending a career in international politics that has been marked by his insistence on budgetary penitence for suffering eurozone countries.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s impending departure leaves a huge gap in European politics. Loved or hated, he has been a force for stability who played a leading role in keeping the eurozone from disintegrating during a debt crisis that began in 2010.The Christian Democrats, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s party, said on Wednesday that he will become the speaker of the German parliament. The move is a consequence of the party\u2019s disappointing showing in recent elections, which have made the post of finance minister an important bargaining chip in negotiations to form a new government.A member of Germany\u2019s Bundestag since 1972, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, now 75, is among the last German politicians to come of age during his country\u2019s painful recovery from World War II and the tensions of the Cold War. He overcame a rivalry with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to become her ally \u2014 often playing the bad cop in eurozone negotiations while she privately struck compromises.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to articulate just how significant this change is going to be for the eurozone, for other member states, for the investment community,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a consultancy. \u201cIt introduces uncertainty into probably the most important economic position in the eurozone.\u201dNo major decision is possible in Brussels without the assent of France and Germany, and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s experience and toughness may be missed as European leaders confront a daunting policy agenda. Looming points of conflict include a reform of the European Union\u2019s finances, debt relief for Greece, and the choice of a successor for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, whose term ends in 2019.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s departure is also a blow to efforts by Emmanuel Macron, the French president, to create a stronger European Union with its own finance minister and a budget big enough to help member countries that get into economic trouble.Blunt yet affable, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble had a talent for brinkmanship that often helped Germany\u2019s point of view to prevail, to the frustration of his critics.He was unpopular elsewhere, too.\u201cSch\u00e4uble crystallized this growing gap between the so-called peripheral Europe and the core Europe,\u201d said Constantin Gurdgiev, an adjunct finance professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cAs a result of this, he was loathed not just in Greece, and not just in Ireland, but in the likes of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus.\u201dMr. Sch\u00e4uble was often caricatured as an uncompromising disciplinarian, but he belonged to a generation that saw the European Union not just as an economic convenience but as a bulwark against the wars that devastated the Continent early in the 20th century. He regarded crises as a chance to push closer to something resembling a United States of Europe.At home, he has been a fixture in German politics for more than 40 years, dating to the period when Helmut Kohl was chancellor and Germany was still divided between East and West.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble has survived innumerable crises, including an attempt on his life in 1990 that left him in a wheelchair. In 2000, a campaign finance scandal forced him to step aside as chairman of the Christian Democrats, paving the way for Ms. Merkel\u2019s ascent. She became chairwoman of the party at the time, and in 2005 rose to become chancellor.Still, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble often rated higher than Ms. Merkel in opinion polls. His insistence on balanced budgets, though criticized by economists, was extremely popular with debt-averse Germans. At conventions of the Christian Democrats he was greeted like a rock star, and his comments could move financial markets.The two leaders nevertheless overcame their differences and forged a partnership that helps explain the Christian Democrats\u2019 longevity as Germany\u2019s strongest party. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s tough talk on Greece appeased party conservatives, leaving Ms. Merkel the political space to work out compromises that, though often flawed, kept the eurozone together.\u201cThe two tag-teamed well together,\u201d Mr. Rahman of Eurasia Group said. \u201cThat will never be replaced.\u201dMr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s successor is likely to be ideologically similar, though lacking his political finesse or his bedrock belief in European integration.The leader of the pro-business Free Democratic Party, Christian Lindner, is widely expected to demand the Finance Ministry as a condition of joining a coalition led by Ms. Merkel. Mr. Lindner is known for being skeptical about giving more power to Brussels, and has expressed opposition to some of the proposals advocated by France.That means Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s legacy could live on when it comes to Germany\u2019s economic policy.\u201cWolfgang Sch\u00e4uble may have left the finance ministry but his project for turning the eurozone into an iron cage of austerity, that is the very antithesis of a democratic federation, lives on,\u201d Yanis Varoufakis, a firebrand former Greek finance minister who often clashed with Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, said in an email.\u201cThe Free Democratic Party\u2019s ascension will see to it that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s departure will not alter the policy of doing whatever it takes to prevent the eurozone\u2019s evolution into a sustainable macroeconomy,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s appointment as speaker must still be approved by the Bundestag, but he is not likely to face significant opposition. He is viewed as someone with the authority to keep order in the legislature, which will be more fractious after the far-right Alternative for Germany party won seats Sunday. The party has vowed to be a disruptive force.If he ascends to the post of president of the Bundestag, the position\u2019s formal title, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble will ostensibly be Germany\u2019s second highest official, just behind the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and ahead of the Ms. Merkel. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s nomination for the new position was confirmed Wednesday by Volker Kauder, chairman of the Christian Democrats\u2019 parliamentary bloc. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble will probably remain at the Finance Ministry until a successor is chosen, a process that could take months.Melissa Eddy and Edmund Heaphy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nafta Talks Lurch Ahead Without Signs of Major Progress", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement sputtered forward on Tuesday as officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico concluded their second round of talks with plenty of pleasantries but little major progress to announce.After five days of discussions in Mexico City, trade negotiators from the three countries said they were encouraged by the talks\u2019 cooperative tenor and remained confident that they could reach a deal by the end of the year.\u201cI am pleased to report that we have found mutual agreement on many important issues,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said during a briefing with reporters at the conclusion of the talks. \u201cOur work continues at a record pace.\u201dDespite their optimistic tone, however, there was no public discussion of the thorniest points of contention between the countries.The latest round of talks came as the Trump administration promised to upend America\u2019s trade agreements with the goal of creating better deals for domestic manufacturers.The lack of concrete progress raises questions about whether the three countries will be able to rewrite Nafta this year, if at all. Thus far, Canada and Mexico have made it clear that they will not be cowed by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to unilaterally scrap the trade agreement, a move that would most likely damage the United States economy.\u201cI think they might be tougher than the Trump administration thought,\u201d Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of Canada and Mexico. \u201cTrade negotiations are always challenging.\u201dIn the current talks, Canada\u2019s top concerns include low wages in Mexico and so-called right-to-work laws that have weakened unions and labor standards in some parts of the United States.Ms. Freeland noted in her closing remarks that Nafta had yielded substantial economic benefits for the United States since it was enacted in 1994 and said that the trade relationship between the United States and Canada was \u201creciprocal,\u201d a principle that Mr. Trump prizes.Echoing comments made recently by Vice President Mike Pence, Ms. Freeland said she was confident that the three countries could find a way to reach a deal that is a \u201cwin, win, win.\u201d\u201cAll three parties are absolutely committed to getting this done,\u201d Ms. Freeland said.For Mexico\u2019s part, a top priority remains finding ways to incorporate President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2014 energy program in a modernized Nafta. This would further open up Mexico\u2019s energy sector to private investment and could reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with Mexico.While many details remain to be worked out, the course of the Nafta talks is also likely to be directed by politics and the passions of Mr. Trump. The decision on Tuesday by Mr. Trump to end the Obama-era executive action that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation could ratchet up tension between the countries. And Mr. Trump\u2019s ongoing commitment to making Mexico finance a border wall rankles its leaders.\u201cIt is hard to reconcile the political language of the U.S. leaders and their aggressiveness and their sense of being abused by Mexico in the relationship,\u201d said Alejandro G\u00f3mez-Strozzi, Mexico\u2019s undersecretary of economy from 2000 to 2006. \u201cNafta needs some improvement, but not in the light that is being portrayed by the U.S. president.\u201dMr. Trump may have to decide if he wants to tweak the deal and call it a win, get bogged down in painstaking details or bail on Nafta entirely.Most trade experts agree that achieving a major rewrite of Nafta in the next few months is a long shot, if only because most major trade pacts take years to reach. To veterans of big trade agreements, the lack of immediate breakthroughs is not necessarily bad news for Nafta, but the urge to rush the negotiations could prove to be counterproductive.\u201cAs you\u2019re thinking about the timetable, you need to make sure you have enough time to consult with Congress, consult with stakeholders and find creative solutions to new problems,\u201d said Michael Froman, who was a trade representative under President Barack Obama.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As German Election Looms, Politicians Face Voters\u2019 Wrath for Ties to Carmakers", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Sometimes it is hard to tell where the German government ends and the auto industry begins.Daimler and Volkswagen\u2019s top lobbyists were once close aides to Chancellor Angela Merkel. The foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, used to sit on Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board. Ms. Merkel herself once buttonholed the governor of California to complain about the state\u2019s strict emissions standards.Those close relations between public officials and car manufacturers were once considered vital economic policy for Germany\u2019s most important export. Now, they are a political liability.The backlash has been building since 2015, when United States regulators uncovered widespread emissions cheating by Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s largest automaker. The broadening case, which has also ensnared BMW and Daimler, has called attention to the harmful effects of nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel vehicles. Cities across Europe are considering diesel bans, and sales of diesel engines are plummeting.For decades, the German government has been a crucial ally for carmakers, operating as a de facto lobbyist for the industry.With the active support of officials, automakers used their political clout in Brussels to block stricter emissions regulations and to promote subsidies for diesel. German leaders, including Ms. Merkel and her predecessor, argued against tough emissions rules and pushed for better terms for the country\u2019s carmakers abroad.Most recently, Germany led a group of auto-producing countries in weakening European emissions testing procedures that were designed to prevent the kind of deception committed by Volkswagen. New cars must pass road tests. Previously, they had to pass only laboratory exams, which Volkswagen and other carmakers were able to game. But, at German insistence, cars can emit double the legal limit of nitrogen oxides and still be approved.German political leaders and automakers have worked together to promote diesel technology since the 1990s. Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, was proud to be known as the \u201cauto chancellor.\u201dGermany has taxed diesel fuel at a lower rate than gasoline since the 1980s, originally to make truck transport, which is predominantly diesel, less expensive. The goal, according to a 2011 study by Transport and Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels, was to lower costs to help German manufacturers compete internationally.Those tax breaks have ensured that diesel is significantly cheaper at the pump, leading to a steady rise in the popularity of diesel-powered cars. Until recently, they outsold their gasoline-powered counterparts around Europe.German carmakers and politicians engaged in a similar battle in Brussels, fighting for years to bat away tougher emissions rules. In 2013, Germany used its clout as the European Union\u2019s largest economy to intervene when the bloc\u2019s executive arm wanted to tighten limits on carbon dioxide emissions.Matthias Wissmann, head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry and a former transportation minister, wrote a letter to Ms. Merkel, warning that the new standards would hurt sales of German luxury cars. In that letter, he addressed Ms. Merkel as \u201cdu,\u201d the informal German word for \u201cyou\u201d normally used only between close friends.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.German leaders campaigned for carmakers farther afield, too. On a trip to California in 2010, Ms. Merkel complained about the state\u2019s strict limits on nitrogen oxides during a meeting with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.The bond between politicians and automakers persisted even after the Volkswagen scandal erupted.Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, home of Volkswagen, conceded in August that he had allowed company lobbyists to vet a 2015 speech about the emissions deception. The state of Lower Saxony owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen, and Mr. Weil sits on the carmaker\u2019s supervisory board.Mr. Weil, a member of the Social Democrats, denied making significant changes to the speech after it was shown to Volkswagen. Thomas Steg, head of government relations for the carmaker, said Volkswagen looked only for factual errors.Against that backdrop, deep political ties were forged.German carmakers have often recruited government insiders to represent their interests. Mr. Steg of Volkswagen was once a spokesman for Ms. Merkel. Eckart von Klaeden, responsible for Daimler\u2019s relations with governments worldwide, served under her as a junior minister.All of the country\u2019s main parties, even the environmentalist Greens, have long histories of amiable relations with the auto industry. Joschka Fischer, a former foreign minister who for many years was standard-bearer for the Greens, now works as a consultant to BMW, though the carmaker says he does not do any lobbying.BMW said in a statement that it had tightened its rules on interactions with politicians, ensuring, for example, that parties report the use of vehicles as a financial contribution. Daimler did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Steg, the Volkswagen lobbyist and former aide to Ms. Merkel, said a close relationship between carmakers and politicians was of common interest. Others argue that lobbying helps auto executives understand the workings of government, and public officials understand the car business.\u201cThe government has its own positions,\u201d said Mr. Wissmann, the head of the auto industry association. \u201cIt has not simply followed the positions of the auto industry blindly.\u201dSince the end of World War II, Mr. Steg said, \u201cpoliticians have always had a huge interest in the well-being of the industry and the creation of jobs.\u201dAs the scandal\u2019s focus expanded, German officials have found themselves on the defensive.\u201cThey take the line of industry,\u201d said Julia Poliscanova, manager of clean vehicles and air quality at Transport and Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels, \u201cinstead of citizens and public health.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samantha Power: Why Foreign Propaganda Is More Dangerous Now", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewWhen George Washington gave his Farewell Address in 1796, he urged the American people \u201cto be constantly awake\u201d to the risk of foreign influence. In the wake of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 United States election, the president\u2019s warning has a fresh, chilling resonance.The debate in the United States about foreign interference concentrates on who did what to influence last year\u2019s election and the need for democracies to strengthen their cybersecurity for emails, critical infrastructure and voting platforms. But we need to pay far more attention to another vulnerability: our adversaries\u2019 attempts to subvert our democratic processes by aiming falsehoods at ripe subsets of our population \u2014 and not only during elections.In the Cold War era, Soviet attempts to meddle in American democracy were largely unsuccessful. In 1982 Yuri Andropov, then the K.G.B. chairman, told Soviet foreign intelligence officers to incorporate disinformation operations \u2014 the so-called active measures meant to discredit adversaries and influence public opinion \u2014 into their standard work. They had an ambitious aim: preventing Ronald Reagan\u2019s re-election.Soviet agents were instructed to infiltrate party and campaign staffs in the United States in search of embarrassing information to leak to the press, while Soviet propagandists pushed a set of anti-Reagan story lines to the Western media. Ultimately, they failed to influence the election. President Reagan defeated Walter F. Mondale, winning 49 states. Margaret Thatcher, who was similarly targeted, also won re-election in a landslide.What exactly has changed since then to make foreign propaganda far more dangerous today?During the Cold War, most Americans received their news and information via mediated platforms. Reporters and editors serving in the role of professional gatekeepers had almost full control over what appeared in the media. A foreign adversary seeking to reach American audiences did not have great options for bypassing these umpires, and Russian dezinformatsia rarely penetrated.After the election, around 84 percent of Americans polled by Pew described themselves as at least somewhat confident in their ability to discern real news from fake. This confidence may be misplaced.Russia has keenly exploited our growing reliance on new media \u2014 and the absence of real umpires. Last year the Russian government supplemented the growing reach of its state-owned, English-language media outlets \u2014 RT and Sputnik \u2014 by employing a network of trolls, bots and thousands of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts that amplified damaging stories on Hillary Clinton.In the United States, the vulnerability to foreign influence is exacerbated by divisions within the political establishment. During the Cold War, the larger struggle against communism created a mainstream consensus about what America stood for and against. Today, our society appears to be defined by a particularly vicious form of \u201cpartyism\u201d affecting Democrats and Republicans alike. This divisive environment can make the media more susceptible to repeating and amplifying falsehoods.Because of the attention to last year\u2019s Russian election meddling, there is a risk that going forward we will be inclined to \u201cfight the last war\u201d \u2014 mobilizing our defenses with a focus on Russia or on the next election cycle. But we must be on our guard toward all adversaries at all times.The bipartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy, meanwhile, has begun tracking and exposing Russia\u2019s extensive disinformation efforts in the here and now.For example, the alliance documented how on the same day in August when Mr. Trump signed a bill imposing significant sanctions on Russia, the top story promoted by Russian-associated Twitter accounts concerned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s links to foreign arms sales. More recently, the alliance showed how Russia-linked accounts promoted alt-right conspiracies about the violence in Charlottesville, Va., as well as stories that slammed those \u2014 like Senator John McCain \u2014 who had criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocal response.It is a testament to our times that it now seems unthinkable that the State Department \u2014 much less the president \u2014 would publicly call out the misinformation being spread. But now that there is a genuine risk of foreign powers who, in George Washington\u2019s words, \u201cpractice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion,\u201d it is incumbent on the rest of us to enhance our vigilance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the World\u2019s Emptiest International Airport Says About China\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyMattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the second-largest in Sri Lanka, is designed to handle a million passengers per year. It currently receives about a dozen passengers per day. Business is so slow that the airport has made more money from renting out the unused cargo terminals for rice storage than from flight-related activities. In one burst of activity last year, 350 security personnel armed with firecrackers were deployed to scare off wild animals, the airport\u2019s most common visitors.Projects like Mattala are not driven by local economic needs but by remote stratagems. When Sri Lanka\u2019s 27-year civil war ended in 2009, the president at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa, fixated on the idea of turning his poor home district into a world-class business and tourism hub to help its moribund economy. China, with a dream of its own, was happy to oblige. Hambantota sits in a very strategic location, just a few miles north of the vital Indian Ocean shipping lane over which more than 80 percent of China\u2019s imported oil travels. A port added luster to the \u201cstring of pearls\u201d that China was starting to assemble all along the so-called Maritime Silk Road.Sadly, no travelers came, only the bills. The Mattala airport has annual revenues of roughly $300,000, but now it must repay China $23.6 million a year for the next eight years, according to Sri Lanka\u2019s Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry. Over all, around 90 percent of the country\u2019s revenues goes to servicing debt. Even a new president who took office in 2015 on a promise to curb Chinese influence succumbed to financial reality.To relieve its debt crisis, Sri Lanka has put its white elephants up for sale. In late July, the government agreed to give China control of the deepwater port \u2014 a 70 percent equity stake over 99 years \u2014 in exchange for writing off $1.1 billion of the island\u2019s debt. (China has promised to invest another $600 million to make the port commercially viable.) When the preliminary deal was first floated in January, protests erupted in response to the perceived sell-off of national sovereignty, a reminder of Sri Lanka\u2019s colonial past under British rule. \u201cWe always thought China\u2019s investments would help our economy,\u201d says Amantha Perera, a Sri Lankan journalist and university researcher. \u201cBut now there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019ve been maneuvered into selling some of the family jewels.\u201dThis is China\u2019s long game. It\u2019s not about immediate profits; infrastructure projects are a bad way to make money. So why is President Xi Jinping fast-tracking OBOR projects amid an economic slowdown at home and a crackdown on other overseas acquisitions? Economics is a big part: China wants to secure access to key resources, export its idle industrial capacity, even tilt the world order in its favor. But there is also a far greater cultural ambition. For centuries, Western liberalism has ruled the world. The Chinese believe their time has come. \u201cChina sees itself as a great civilization that needs to regain its status as leader of the world,\u201d says Kadira Pethiyagoda, a fellow at the Brookings Institution Doha Center. \u201cAnd America\u2019s retreat gives China the space to do that.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to see OBOR as a muscled-up Marshall Plan, the American-led program that helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II. OBOR, too, is designed to build vital infrastructure, spread prosperity and drive global development. Yet little of what China offers is aid or even low-interest lending. Much OBOR financing comes in the form of market-rate loans that weaker countries are eager to receive \u2014 but may struggle to repay. Even when the projects are well suited for the local economy, the result can look a bit like a shell game: Things are built, money goes to Chinese companies and the country is saddled with more debt. What happens when, as is often the case, infrastructure projects are driven more by geopolitical ambition or the need to give China\u2019s state-owned companies something to do? Well, Sri Lanka has an empty airport for sale.Sri Lanka may be a harbinger for debt crises to come. Many other OBOR countries have taken on huge Chinese loans that could prove difficult to repay. For example, Chinese banks, according to The Financial Times, recently lent Pakistan $1.2 billion to stave off a currency crisis \u2014 even as they pledged $57 billion more to develop the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. \u201cThe projects China proposes are so big and appealing and revolutionary that many small countries can\u2019t resist,\u201d says Brahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at New Delhi\u2019s Center for Policy Research. \u201cThey take on loans like it\u2019s a drug addiction and then get trapped in debt servitude. It\u2019s clearly part of China\u2019s geostrategic vision.\u201dThis charge conjures the specter of colonialism, when the British and Dutch weaponized debt to take control of nations\u2019 strategic assets. China insists it is nothing like a colonial power. Its appeal to developing countries, after all, is often based on a shared negative experience of colonialism \u2014 and the desire to have cooperative \u201cwin-win\u201d trade and investment relationships. Unlike Western countries and institutions that try to influence how developing countries govern themselves, China says it espouses the principle of noninterference. If local partners benefit from a new road or port, the Chinese suggest, shouldn\u2019t they be able to \u201cwin,\u201d too \u2014 by securing its main trade routes, building loyal partnerships and enhancing its global prestige?After Zheng He\u2019s death at sea in 1433, China turned inward for the next six centuries. Now, as the country has become a global power once again, Communist Party leaders have revived the legend of Zheng He to show China\u2019s peaceful intentions and its historical connections to the region. His goal, they say, was not to conquer \u2014 unlike Western empires \u2014 but to establish friendly trade and diplomatic relations. In Sri Lanka today, Chinese tour groups often traipse through a Colombo museum to see the trilingual stone tablet the admiral brought here \u2014 proof, it seems, that China respected all peoples and religions. No mention is made of a less savory aspect of Zheng He\u2019s dealings in Ceylon. On a later expedition, around 1411, his troops became embroiled in a war. Zheng He prevailed and took the local king back to China as a prisoner.The unsanitized version of Zheng He\u2019s story may contain a lesson for present-day China about unintended consequences. Pushing countries deeper into debt, even inadvertently, may give China leverage in the short run, but it risks losing the good will essential to OBOR\u2019s long-term success. For all the big projects China is engaged in around the world \u2014 high-speed rail in Laos, a military base in Djibouti, highways in Kenya \u2014 arguably its most perilous step so far may be taking control of the foundering Hambantota port. \u201cIt\u2019s folly to take equity stakes,\u201d says Joshua Eisenman, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cChina will have to become further entwined in local politics. And what happens if the country decides to deny a permit or throw them out. Do they retreat? Do they protect?\u201d China promotes itself as a new, gentler kind of power, but it\u2019s worth remembering that dredging deepwater ports and laying down railroad ties to secure new trade routes \u2014 and then having to defend them from angry locals \u2014 was precisely how Britain started down the slippery slope to empire.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Republican Leaders Defy Bipartisan Opposition to Health Law Repeal", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Eleven governors, including five Republicans and a pivotal Alaskan independent, urged the Senate on Tuesday to reject a last-ditch push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.But Republican leaders pressed toward a showdown vote. And they choked off separate bipartisan efforts to shore up health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, hoping to give Republican senators no alternative but to vote for repeal.The latest repeal bill, drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, would undo much of the Affordable Care Act and send tens of billions of federal dollars to the states with vast discretion over how to spend the money.This is the choice for America, Mr. Graham said on Tuesday: \u201cSocialism or federalism when it comes to your health care.\u201dYet some governors, the supposed beneficiaries of that federalism, were decidedly cool to the proposal. New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Sununu, had criticized the proposal on Monday. But it was the opposition of Alaska\u2019s governor, Bill Walker, that might prove most important. He increased pressure on Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to cast what could be a deciding vote to kill the repeal effort, just as she voted against the last repeal bill in July.Republican leaders appeared determined to thwart any alternative ahead of a possible showdown vote next week. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, announced Tuesday that he and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, would not come forward with the \u201climited, bipartisan plan to stabilize 2018 premiums\u201d in the individual health insurance market that they had been working toward.Their bipartisan efforts, which grew out of four days of committee hearings, were overtaken by the resumption of partisan warfare on health care.\u201cWe have worked hard and in good faith,\u201d said Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee, \u201cbut have not found the necessary consensus among Republicans and Democrats.\u201dMs. Murray was more blunt: \u201cRepublican leaders have decided to freeze this bipartisan approach and are trying to jam through a partisan Trumpcare bill.\u201dThe Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, accused Republicans of crushing \u201cvery, very hopeful sprouts of bipartisanship.\u201dBut the latest repeal legislation was facing significant opposition. The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and AARP, the lobby for older Americans, all urged the Senate to reject the bill. And 10 of the 12 governors opposing the measure signed a letter urging Senate leaders to scrap it.The Graham-Cassidy bill \u201cwould result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance coverage, destabilize health insurance markets, and decrease access to affordable coverage and care,\u201d Dr. James L. Madara, the chief executive of the A.M.A., said in a letter to Senate leaders.Richard J. Pollack, the president of the hospital association, said the bill \u201cwould erode key protections for patients and consumers.\u201d\u201cFrom a public policy standpoint, it is not a good piece of legislation,\u201d Centene\u2019s chief executive, Michael F. Neidorff, said in an interview. He urged lawmakers from both parties to work together to avoid passing a law before understanding its full impact. States may not be able to plan, given the uncertainty over their funding, he said. \u201cYou could end up with 50 different plans,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is unlike anything I have ever seen,\u201d Mr. Neidorff said. \u201cThey have to sit back and think through what they are doing.\u201dWithin hours after the bipartisan group of governors sent their letter opposing the repeal bill, Senator Cassidy provided a letter from 15 Republican governors supporting the concept of \u201cadequately funded block grants to the states.\u201dBy Tuesday evening, Ms. Murkowski appeared to be the key vote.At least two other Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine, are likely no votes. With Democrats united in opposition, Republican leaders cannot afford to lose any other votes.Vice President Mike Pence met with Senate Republicans at lunch in the Capitol on Tuesday and told them the Trump administration was fully behind the repeal bill, which would send more than $1 trillion to states from 2020 to 2026.After the lunch, Mr. Graham said, \u201cI\u2019ve never felt better about where we\u2019re at.\u201dMr. Graham said he had spoken to President Trump about the bill five times in the last two days, and said Mr. Trump was \u201cfocused like a laser\u201d on it. Mr. Graham quoted Speaker Paul D. Ryan as saying that the House would pass the bill if the Senate approved it.The Graham-Cassidy bill would blow up the architecture of the Affordable Care Act, a striking departure from the Alexander-Murray effort to draft a modest bipartisan bill to provide federal funds to insurance companies to reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers.Some conservatives argued that the bipartisan bill would just prop up the health law.It \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a chance in the House,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, who helped write the Graham-Cassidy bill.Mr. Alexander said the resistance to his bill was formidable. \u201cI know how to get bipartisan results, but I\u2019m not a magician,\u201d he said.The battle over the Affordable Care Act \u2014 adopted in 2010 without any Republican votes \u2014 has once again become an all-consuming political drama on Capitol Hill.The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the top Democrat on the panel announced last week that they had reached agreement on a plan to prevent the imminent exhaustion of federal funds for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. But efforts to translate that agreement into legislation have been at least temporarily derailed by the Republican push for repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Which states would gain or lose federal funding in 2026.Republicans were trying desperately to round up votes for the Graham-Cassidy bill before the end of next week, when the measure will lose the procedural protection that allows it to pass with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes that would otherwise be required.While Republicans like the idea of federalism and block grants, many wanted to know how their states would be affected. Under the legislation, states with high health care costs \u2014 especially if they expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 would generally lose money, while low-cost states that did not expand Medicaid would gain.\u201cThe idea of giving the states more flexibility and authority is a good idea,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. \u201cAs a Republican, I join my colleagues in thinking that states are the place where many health care decisions are already being made, and can be made more efficiently to cover more people and to lower costs.\u201dBut he added, \u201cI want to see what the impact is on Ohio.\u2019\u2019Ohio did expand Medicaid, and roughly 700,000 people have gained coverage as a result.The Republican governors who signed the letter opposing the latest Republican repeal plan were John R. Kasich of Ohio, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Phil Scott of Vermont.Two other Republican governors, Mr. Sununu and Larry Hogan of Maryland, expressed similar concerns in separate statements.\u201cThe Graham-Cassidy bill is not a solution that works for Maryland,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cIt will cost our state over $2 billion annually while directly jeopardizing the health care of our citizens.\u201dMr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy have cited Maryland as a state that, in their view, has been receiving more than its fair share of money under the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Sununu said he could not support the Graham-Cassidy proposal because \u201cNew Hampshire could possibly lose over $1 billion in Medicaid funding between 2020 and 2026.\u201d He said such a cost shift would be a particular problem for his state because \u201cNew Hampshire is proud of its tradition of not having an income tax or sales tax.\u201dMembers of the Senate health committee, who celebrated its bipartisan efforts to stabilize insurance markets in the past two weeks, said they were disappointed.Senator Collins said she hoped the panel would continue its work on a bipartisan measure, which she said had gone \u201cextremely well\u201d under the leadership of Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray.Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said the Graham-Cassidy bill had been moving quietly through Washington, \u201clike a snake in the grass,\u201d while senators on the health committee were trying to work together across party lines.\u201cIf we allow that snake in the grass to inject its venom into people \u2014 my analogy for losing your health care coverage \u2014 then we\u2019re not the Senate we should be,\u201d Mr. Casey said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the government that we should be.\u201dBesides creating block grants, the Graham-Cassidy bill would make deep cuts in Medicaid. It would end the expansion of eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, which has provided Medicaid coverage to 13 million people. And it would put the entire program, which serves more than 70 million people, on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that exists. States would instead receive a per-beneficiary allotment of federal money.Reed Abelson contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

So it is not without a smile that I can write that the G.O.P. has been hoist by its own petard.JONATHAN D. KARMEL, CHICAGOTo the Editor:I have mixed emotions about the Democrats\u2019 wanting to tie the debt ceiling to Hurricane Harvey funding. Although I overwhelmingly approve both funding for Harvey relief and raising the debt ceiling, which is the only responsible option, I think it should be a hard-and-fast rule that you do not politicize the debt ceiling. Ever.Defaulting on our debt is the fiscal equivalent of a unilateral nuclear strike. It is unthinkable. There should never be conditions set. There are reasons for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to be concerned about our debt. Those concerns should be addressed in the budgeting process, not in keeping the promises to pay debt that Congress has already approved.Tying together Harvey relief funding and paying our bills on time puts both at risk, as it asks for political courage from G.O.P. legislators.

{"Headline": "Ruling Conservative-Led Bloc Wins Norway\u2019s National Elections", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSLO \u2014 The coalition led by the center-right Conservative Party won the final round of Norway\u2019s national elections on Monday, in what was seen as a referendum on taxes, immigration, energy policy and European integration.In Norway, which has multiple parties and proportional voting, it is effectively impossible for any party to secure an outright majority.Before the election, the Green Party, which advocates curbing Arctic oil exploration, seemed to have be gaining popularity and there was speculation that it could provide the edge to a Labor-led government. But the Greens won just one seat in Parliament, which is what they had before.As in Britain, which historically has had close ties to Norway, relations with Europe are a touchy subject, as is immigration. Norway\u2019s population of 5.3 million is still fairly homogeneous, but it is becoming increasingly diverse.The right-wing Progress Party, founded in 1973, is more moderate than its counterparts in Scandinavia: the far-right Sweden Democrats and the Danish People\u2019s Party, which are largely considered outside the mainstream. Unlike those parties, the Progress Party has been part of day-to-day governance, controlling major portfolios like finance, transportation and oil.\u201cThe four years of coalition government has tamed the Progress Party and made it harmless,\u201d Mr. Baldersheim said.In any event, the New Parliament will include more women than ever before. On Tuesday night, the Norwegian news agency NTB estimated that 70 of the 169 seats would go to women, meaning that female representation in Parliament for the first time would pass 40 percent.Mr. Gahr Store, 57, unusual for a Labor politician, is the heir to a fortune, in fireplace manufacturing. He has been criticized in the press for investing in overseas venture capital funds that do not abide by rules as strict as those followed by the sovereign wealth fund, which is commonly called the Oil Fund. Mr. Gahr Store, who has served as foreign minister and health minister, has also faced accusations in the news media of not paying full taxes on improvements to a country home that he made in 2011.Both candidates were active on social media. Mr. Gahr Store\u2019s campaign posted footage of him voting on Facebook. Ms. Solberg used the platform to post a message thanking the Norwegian people \u201cfor letting me be your prime minister the last four years.\u201dOn YouTube, as part of a campaign to stimulate youth engagement, the candidates were challenged to do impromptu sketches. (Ms. Solberg drew a school and a treasure chest to reflect her commitment to educational improvements and lower taxes; Mr. Gahr Store drew figures and a map that he said depicted his commitment to lowering climate emissions.)His party won 18 seats, up from 10.Voter turnout in Norway is typically high; in the 2013 elections, it exceeded 78 percent.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the time that polls close in Norway\u2019s elections.

{"Headline": "China Tries to Steer Loans to Small Businesses", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China announced a move on Saturday aimed at addressing a vexing problem: how to steer more bank loans to small businesses while adding little to the country\u2019s huge debt load.Yet even as steel mills, aluminum smelters, cement factories and other big enterprises have gorged on debt, small businesses have struggled to find the money they need to expand.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, tried to address that on Saturday with a complex adjustment to a crucial regulation for commercial banks.The central bank lowered what is called the reserve ratio, or the amount of money it requires banks to keep at the central bank for a rainy day. When the move takes effect in January, it will become cheaper and easier for banks to make more loans.The People\u2019s Bank of China had used reserve ratio cuts in past years to spur broader economic growth. This time appears to be different.The central bank said it would cut the ratio only for banks that meet minimums for lending to small businesses or other borrowers that it called \u201cinclusive finance.\u201d The new category encompasses loans typically of less than 5 million yuan, or about $750,000, that are issued to small businesses, small family companies, farmers, students and poverty alleviation programs.Zhu Ning, a prominent economist at Tsinghua University, said that the central bank was trying to ease credit for the smallest-scale borrowers without setting off more wasteful lending.The move on Saturday, he said, \u201ckills two birds with one stone, by providing liquidity to small enterprises while also providing a subtle sign of loosening.\u201dReserve ratios are currently 15 to 17 percent of a bank\u2019s assets, depending on the bank\u2019s size. The central bank said that it would reduce the reserve ratio by half a percentage point for banks that have at least 1.5 percent of their loans in inclusive finance. It also said that it would lower the ratio by 1.5 percentage points for banks with at least 10 percent of their loans in inclusive finance \u2014 a threshold that practically no banks meet in China except for a few small, mainly rural financial institutions, experts said.In another move that makes the announcement this weekend different from past moves on reserve requirements meant to spur growth, the central bank said the rules would not take effect until the beginning of next year. In the past, such changes took effect immediately or within a few days. Delaying the start of the rule this time gives banks time to increase their lending to small businesses so they can qualify for the new reserve ratios.Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group in Shanghai, said that the timing of the central bank\u2019s action on Saturday, the day before China\u2019s National Day holiday on Sunday and before a week when most of the country will be on vacation, suggested that the central bank was trying to show that it was following a broad Communist Party mandate to regulatory agencies to keep the financial sector stable ahead of an important political meeting.The Chinese Communist Party will hold its twice-a-decade congress beginning on Oct. 18, an event that is expected to confirm President Xi Jinping as the party\u2019s general secretary for another five years while also shaking up the rest of the party\u2019s top leadership.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The money was instead used to pay personal debts and earlier investors.Mr. Carton, 48, of Manhattan, faces charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiring to commit those offenses, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.Mr. Carton sought the investments last year around the time he also accrued millions of dollars\u2019 worth of gambling debts to casinos and other parties, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a civil complaint filed on Wednesday.The station\u2019s owner, CBS Radio, said it had suspended Mr. Carton pending an investigation and was cooperating with the authorities.The acting United States attorney in Manhattan, Joon H.

But in December 2016, a fund managed by Brigade Capital Management filed a financing statement with New York State to record a debt owed by two corporations that the S.E.C. complaint says Mr. Carton controlled.Aaron Michael, the chief compliance officer for Brigade, which manages more than $18 billion in assets, declined to comment.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Far Right Complicates Life for Merkel, and the E.U.", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has gained a powerful place from which to alter the agenda of European politics. The far right\u2019s gains in Germany will now complicate not only the calculations of Ms. Merkel, the de facto leader of the European Union, but by extension the path ahead for the entire bloc.Polls indicate that the same will be true in Austria, where the Freedom Party seems set to enter the coalition government after next month\u2019s elections.The far right will be a constant presence in the minds of Europe\u2019s leaders if they want to avoid worse political fallout ahead, even as the populists may make it harder for Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron to come up with solutions that could keep them at bay.In Germany, many votes for the AfD were cast in protest against 12 years of Merkel\u2019s pragmatism about issues like immigration, national identity and the burdens of the European Union.As Mr. Macron himself has warned, a failure to reform the European Union, better secure its borders and fix the euro currency will only further feed the far right.Globalization, the bureaucratic nature of the European Union and its inability to protect its borders and produce thriving economies in all member states have led to increased nationalism, anxieties about national identities and Islamophobia.But while institutional reform of the European Union may be vital, it is harder to sell to increasingly fragmented national polities, especially as the center-left parties lose ground.\u201cThe German elections confirm the decline of mainstream traditional parties in Europe to the benefit of insurgents, including Macron\u2019s En Marche,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian diplomat based in Brussels.\u201cA domestically weakened Merkel must hold the E.U. together and safeguard the trans-Atlantic bond despite an unpredictable American president, while trying to forge a strong alliance with Macron, tame the Visegrad dissidents and bring on board Italy and Spain, both in choppy waters,\u201d he said. (The Visegrad countries are Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.)There is also a danger that Ms. Merkel will be forced to focus more domestically as she faces the absorbing challenge of balancing what promises to be a new, unwieldy and potentially less stable governing coalition. The decision of the Macron-friendly Social Democrats to leave government and become Germany\u2019s official opposition means that Ms. Merkel will now probably have to form a government with the liberal Free Democrats as well as with the Greens.\u201cThere is unlikely to be a large eurozone budget,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will still be progress on European reform,\u201d including security issues. \u201cBut the fiscal integration that Macron wants looks much harder.\u201dToughness on eurozone budget discipline and opposition to any fiscal transfers within the eurozone are \u201ccentral points for the liberals, and they will continue to be hard on this, because this is where they compete with the AfD,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Social Democrats were very eager to be nice to the French, but the liberals are not,\u201d he added.Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank, said the Free Democrats \u201cwill be the big decelerator of European integration\u201d because of their opposition to a large eurozone budget, shared debt, and debt forgiveness for Greece.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear cold shower for Macron,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cIt means a very cumbersome process of further integration.\u201dIn a telephone call on Sunday night, Mr. Macron congratulated Ms. Merkel on winning a fourth term, and he said on Twitter that \u201cwe resolutely continue our essential cooperation for Europe and our countries.\u201dMr. Macron is scheduled to make a speech on Tuesday to present his reform proposals. But he should expect little support from Ms. Merkel for any big ideas before she forms a government, which may take until the end of the year, and only selective support thereafter.In a briefing in Paris on Monday, French officials outlining Mr. Macron\u2019s speech were cautious and short on detail. They insisted that Mr. Macron was not pressuring the chancellor, but that it was important to outline French ideas as Ms. Merkel begins the laborious coalition negotiations.But it is also possible that Mr. Macron\u2019s early intervention may backfire in what will already be a difficult task for Ms. Merkel.It may be easier for her to support Mr. Macron\u2019s less controversial proposals, like better border security and turning an existing eurozone bailout fund into a kind of European Monetary Fund, as long as they do not involve new commitment of funds.She has already given some support to Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal of a eurozone finance minister.But the French and Germans differ on the responsibilities that such a minister should have. The Germans would want a taskmaster to enforce the rules and keep national budget deficits within the debt limits required by the eurozone. The French want a minister with flexibility who would control a eurozone budget financed by the states \u2014 but that is exactly what Ms. Merkel\u2019s likely new coalition partners, the Free Democrats, oppose.Mr. Lindner told journalists before the election that he would push for the finance ministry in a coalition. If he succeeds, it may produce little change from the similarly tough-minded Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who has been Ms. Merkel\u2019s finance minister.\u201cWill Lindner be tougher than Sch\u00e4uble?\u201d asked Hans Kundnani of the German Marshall Fund. \u201cUnlikely.\u201dIn the end, Ms. Merkel may have more trouble with her coalition from her sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, which is deeply conservative and which lost about 10 percent of its vote from 2013, largely to the AfD.With regional elections next year, the Christian Social Union and its leader, Horst Seehofer, will try to push Ms. Merkel farther to the right on security and migration issues.To some degree he blames her for his poor showing at the expense of the AfD.But as Mr. von Marschall pointed out, Ms. Merkel\u2019s move toward the center over the last four years \u2014 on the euro, migration and same-sex marriage \u2014 also meant that she would not find herself losing to a left-leaning coalition. The sacrifice of conservative supporters was probably a price she felt she had to pay to keep her party in power after so many years, he said.The coalition that is likely to result will be unpopular in eastern Germany. And it is likely to be unstable, given the tensions within Ms. Merkel\u2019s own party.Yet unstable coalitions and early elections are the norm in most of Europe, Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cGermany has become a bit more European.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Berlin and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

A candidate must raise at least $250,000 in qualifying contributions from city residents to start getting matching funds, and Ms. Malliotakis reported that she now has received $293,000.The program pays $6 for every $1 in such contributions, and her campaign said that it expected to get about $1.6 million in matching funds later this month. Under the program, the first $175 in contributions from a city resident (excluding those who do business with the city) can be matched at the six-to-one rate.Ms. Malliotakis is the only Republican candidate, and did not face a primary challenge.Sal F. Albanese, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s main opponent in the Democratic primary, raised $6,360 during the reporting period, including $225 that he reported receiving after the Sept. 12 primary.

{"Headline": "Officials Eye Euphrates River Valley as Last Stand for ISIS", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Islamic State fighters are expected to make their last stand in a series of Euphrates River Valley towns and villages that American-backed Syrian and Iraqi forces are not expected to attack for months, American officials said Thursday.American military officials were quick to congratulate the Iraqi forces on their surprisingly swift victory in the northwest town of Tal Afar this week. But the seizure of that town is not seen by United States military commanders as an indication that the next phase of the campaign against the extremist fighters will be easy or quick.Instead, the operation will need to deal with a complex array of political and military problems as American officials and their allies try to deliver the knockout blow against the militants. They must first ensure that American-backed fighters do not collide with converging Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran and Shiite militias supported by Tehran.\u201cThe final stand of ISIS will be in the Middle Euphrates River Valley,\u201d Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the top commander of the American-led task force that is battling the militants in Iraq and Syria, told reporters on Thursday as he wound up his one-year assignment in Baghdad. \u201cAll these forces will converge there.\u201dA year and a half ago, the Pentagon had a simple way to describe the American strategy to collapse the Islamic State\u2019s caliphate. The group\u2019s military, economic and political power centers were based in Raqqa, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq \u2014 both of which needed to be taken back.But the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, appeared to have anticipated the loss of both cities. It has since moved its most important administrative functions, including operatives in charge of recruiting, financing and plotting external attacks, into the Euphrates River Valley.While the resistance by foreign fighters in Raqqa has been fierce \u2014 roughly half the city has been retaken and the hardest combat may lie ahead \u2014 the city no longer functions as the capital of the caliphate.Instead, the militants are operating from Syrian towns like Mayadin and Abu Kamal and Iraqi towns like Al Qaim \u2014 all Sunni enclaves where the militants enjoy support, and where the American-backed campaign has no ground forces, at least not yet.Operations in the Euphrates River area, which straddle the Syrian and Iraqi border, will be more complex than the battle for Tal Afar, which was surrounded for months by Iraqi forces.\u201cWe\u2019re planning for tough fights ahead,\u201d General Townsend said.The Syrian Democratic Forces, which are backed by the United States, are largely led by Syrian Kurds who may not be immediately acceptable to the local Arab populations. The Syrian Kurds provide most of the essential command-and-control for the overall fighting force, half of which is Arab.But as they move into the Euphrates River Valley, the Syrian forces now are expected to recruit additional local Arabs as well other Arab fighters who have been trained by American and allied forces at al-Tanf, a desert outpost in southern Syria near the intersection of the Jordanian and Iraqi borders.The Arab fighters from al-Tanf are vetted and supported with small arms, navigation tools and medical supplies. American and other allied advisers also provide basic combat training skills, including first aid, marksmanship and techniques on how to clear a house of militants.American commanders remain worried about ensuring \u201cde-confliction\u201d: avoiding potential clashes between United States-supported troops that are battling the Islamic State and eastward-moving Syrian forces that are backed by Moscow and Tehran with Shiite militias supported by Iran.\u201cWe want to avoid inadvertent clashes,\u201d General Townsend said. \u201cIt gets even tougher when you have a force that may be something other than friendly \u2014 not necessarily an adversary, but something other than friendly \u2014 and you don\u2019t have great communications with them, and you don\u2019t have an agreed-upon plan.\u201dThe United States military is not in contact with Mr. Assad\u2019s forces, but it is in daily discussions with Russian forces, including through a telephone line from General Townsend\u2019s headquarters in Baghdad to the Russian military in Syria.Officials said American and Russian commanders had discussed making the Euphrates River a dividing line between Syrian government forces and those backed by the United States. But Russia has also suggested that Syrian forces should be able to operate north of the river in some areas, and the arrangements have not yet been settled.\u201cWe\u2019ve already established the measures that are in place that go down into the MERV a ways,\u201d General Townsend said, using a military abbreviation for the Middle Euphrates River Valley. \u201cWhen the time comes, we\u2019ll work out other measures in the future that will cover the entire area that needs to be covered.\u201dTensions between the Assad government and the American military, however, have underscored the limits of the Russian influence and, thus, the potential difficulty of completing such arrangements.The tensions escalated after Syrian authorities allowed buses of Islamic State fighters and their relatives to move from Syria\u2019s western border toward the country\u2019s east, where they hoped to link up with militants in Abu Kamal.\u201cThe Syrian regime appears to be quite happy to deliver them right to Abu Kamal on the Iraqi border,\u201d General Townsend said. \u201cI know the government of Iraq doesn\u2019t appreciate that much, and we don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201dFor all the success that the United States has had in working out understandings with the Russians to avoid inadvertent clashes near Raqqa, the hotlines between the American and Russian commanders have been of little use in the episode with the convoy.\u201cWe have communicated with the Russians, and I think that the Russians are basically telling us that that\u2019s not their activity, and they\u2019re not responsible for that,\u201d General Townsend said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Is Smuggling Increasingly Potent Weapons Into Yemen, U.S. Admiral Says", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe top American admiral in the Middle East said on Monday that Iran continues to smuggle illicit weapons and technology into Yemen, stoking the civil strife there and enabling Iranian-backed rebels to fire missiles into neighboring Saudi Arabia that are more precise and far-reaching.Iran has been repeatedly accused of providing arms helping to fuel one side of the war in Yemen, in which rebels from the country\u2019s north, the Houthis, ousted the government from the capital of Sana in 2014.The officer, Vice Adm. Kevin M. Donegan, said that Iran is sustaining the Houthis with an increasingly potent arsenal of anti-ship and ballistic missiles, deadly sea mines and even explosive boats that have attacked allied ships in the Red Sea or Saudi territory across Yemen\u2019s northern border. The United States, the Yemeni government and their allies in the region have retaliated with strikes of their own and recaptured some Houthi-held coastal areas to help blunt threats to international shipping, but the peril persists, the admiral said.\u201cThese types of weapons did not exist in Yemen before the conflict,\u201d said Admiral Donegan. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science to conclude that the Houthis are getting not only these systems but likely training and advice and assistance in how to use them.\u201dAdmiral Donegan gave his assessment in an hourlong telephone interview from his Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain as he prepared to conclude his two-year tour, and take a new assignment at the Pentagon.The admiral\u2019s comments came a day before President Trump is to address the United Nations General Assembly amid deep uncertainty about what he will do about the nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, including the United States. The administration is conducting a review of its Iran policy, to include Iran\u2019s backing of Shia fighters in Syria and Iraq.In the wide-ranging interview, Admiral Donegan said that the bitter rift between Qatar and many of its Persian Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who accuse Qatar of financing militants and having overly cozy relations with Iran, has not yet hindered coalition efforts to battle terrorism, piracy or other mutual maritime scourges.Admiral Donegan also said that the Navy\u2019s recent 24-hour stand-down of ships around the world after two fatal collisions in the western Pacific revealed some shortcomings among ships in the Middle East that commanders were now correcting. The admiral declined for security reasons to identify the problem areas, but senior Navy officials had said the \u201coperational pause\u201d was to review safety and operational procedures.On Monday, the new head of the Seventh Fleet in Japan, Vice Adm. Phillip G. Sawyer, announced that two more senior officers in the fleet had been relieved of their commands: Rear Adm. Charles Williams, the head of the Navy\u2019s largest operational battle force, and his subordinate in charge of destroyers in the region, Capt. Jeffrey Bennett. Both were relieved because of a loss of confidence in their ability to command, according to a Navy statement.In addition, the officer overseeing Navy surface warfare, Vice Adm. Tom Rowden, has requested early retirement.Admiral Donegan\u2019s most pointed accusations focused on suspected Iranian assistance to the Houthi rebels. The United States and other Western governments have provided vast quantities of weapons, and other forms of military support, to the embattled Yemeni government and its allies in a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, contributing to violence that the United Nations says has caused more than 10,000 civilian casualties.For years, Iran has been under a series of international sanctions prohibiting it from exporting arms. The United States has frequently claimed that Tehran has violated the sanctions in support of proxy forces in many conflicts, including in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian territories.Between Sept. 2015 through March 2016, allied warships interdicted four Iranian dhows that yielded, in total, more than 80 antitank guided missiles and 5,000 Kalashnikov rifles as well as sniper rifles, machine guns and almost 300 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to data provided by the United States Navy.Admiral Donegan said that while there have been no seizures since, he said he suspects Iran\u2019s hand in the Houthis\u2019 apparent ability to replenish and improve their arms stockpiles. \u201cIt is not something that was a one-time deal and stopped,\u201d Admiral Donegan said. \u201cIt appears to be progressive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Leader Suggests Simplifying How the Bloc Is Run", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, laid out plans on Wednesday to simplify the byzantine governance of the European Union.In perhaps the boldest proposal in his annual address to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker suggested streamlining the leadership of the 28-nation bloc \u2014 an idea that could in theory eliminate his own job.The complexity of the European Union is legendary. It has a plethora of institutions and no single leader, leaving many wondering who is in charge \u2014 or speculating that Germany, the bloc\u2019s largest economy, really runs the show.Then there is the Council of the European Union \u2014 not to be confused with the European Council \u2014 which is made up of ministers and has a six-month rotating presidency.Mr. Juncker seemed sympathetic to this criticism in his remarks on Wednesday, suggesting that a single president should lead both the European Commission and the European Council.\u201cThe European landscape would be clearer and more understandable if the European ship was steered by one and the same captain at the helm,\u201d he said.Mr. Juncker\u2019s wide-ranging speech touched on these themes:Economic growth, which stands at more than 2 percent across the European Union, has outstripped growth in the United States, while unemployment has reached a nine-year low, he said.\u201cTen years since crisis struck, Europe\u2019s economy is finally bouncing back \u2014 and with it our confidence,\u201d he said, a reference to the long, grinding battle to overcome a debt crisis that nearly destroyed the euro currency, prompted the imposition of austerity on millions of citizens and helped fuel a populist backlash that focused anger at the European Union.The idea, he said, would be for this new minister to coordinate among various European bodies to help countries that are in an economic recession or \u201chit by a fundamental crisis.\u201dThe goal would be \u201cefficiency\u201d rather to create a new position \u201cjust for the sake of it,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Even as Europe opens up to new trade opportunities, Mr. Juncker said, it must do more to protect strategic sectors like defense \u2014 a remark that was essentially a response to calls from Germany, France and Italy to vet the acquisition of European technology by Chinese companies.\u201cWe will always regret this, and I think you will regret it as well soon, if I might say,\u201d Mr. Juncker told the British, to a thunderous burst of applause.In hopes of encouraging a strong voter turnout for European Parliament elections in May or June 2019 and shoring up confidence in the bloc, Mr. Juncker called on Romania, which is set to hold the union\u2019s rotating presidency during that period, to schedule a European Union summit meeting on the day after Britain\u2019s planned exit from the bloc.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Treat Refugees With Dignity: A Lesson From Turkey", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJARABULUS, Syria \u2014 Since 2011, the civil war in Syria has killed more than 470,000 people, mostly civilians. Millions of people have been displaced, and nearly five million Syrians have fled, creating the biggest refugee crisis since World War II. By far the greatest burden of receiving Syria\u2019s refugees has fallen not on the United States or on Europe, but on Syria\u2019s neighbors: Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Together, these countries are hosting most of the five million Syrians.Each is coping with huge challenges, with different degrees of success. In my visits to those three countries, I\u2018ve been struck by how much more dignity has been accorded to Syrian refugees in Turkey than in Jordan, and especially in Lebanon.Lebanon, with a population of six million, has long given refuge to Palestinians. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, some 450,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Lebanon, most of them in camps. Even third-generation Palestinians born in Lebanon retain refugee status and live in refugee camps without a pathway to citizenship \u2014 almost 70 years after their ancestors arrived. Lebanese law even excludes refugees from most jobs.To this refugee population, Lebanon has now added an estimated 1.5 million Syrians. Many live in plastic tents in crowded camps with scarce access to clean water, surviving on aid from nongovernmental organizations. Because the Lebanese government doesn\u2019t want the Syrians to become permanent residents as the Palestinians have, the camps are not officially recognized or managed by the United Nations. Resentment toward Syrian refugees has reached alarming levels. With elections next year, some Lebanese politicians are promising to deport the refugees once the war in Syria has been fought to a standstill. For the time being, Syrians receive charity, not dignity.Over the last 10 months, I visited several of these camps. In a camp in the Bekaa Valley, I met 12-year-old Nour and her sister, Aya, outside a bakery. As I stopped to buy sweets to celebrate the end of Ramadan, I asked Nour about her family. She told me that she and Aya had lost everyone. She now lives with her only remaining relative \u2014 an impoverished elderly aunt who has five children of her own.Nour hasn\u2019t been to school since the outbreak of the war. In Lebanon, she spends her days in the street with her sister, begging. Nour and Aya are among thousands of Syrian children who have to roam the streets selling napkins, candies and bottled water. Others work on farms to support themselves and what is left of their families.At the Tal Sarhoun refugee camp, also in the Bekaa Valley, by government decree Syrian and Palestinian children go to United Nations schools only in the afternoon. This policy is a deliberate attempt to segregate refugees from Lebanese children. I saw many boys who, instead of going to school, were playing in the street with toy guns. What future is there for these young people?Jordan has shown a more welcoming attitude toward its 1.3 million Syrian refugees. The largest camp, Zaatari, sits close to the northern border, where it is managed by the Jordanian Ministry of Interior and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and financed by a consortium of international aid agencies.Still, up to 60,000 people are trapped at the Syria-Jordan border. After Jordanian security officials were killed by an Islamic State car bomb in 2016, the government closed down access to another camp, Rukban, and banned border entry to Syrians. That has left Syrians camping in the desert in a no man\u2019s land, an area called \u201cthe berm.\u201d There, thousands are vulnerable to airstrikes, living in desperate conditions and subsisting on scarce rations. Disease is rife, but the Jordanian authorities have blocked access to aid and medical treatment, designating the area a closed military zone.Amid this suffocating humanitarian crisis, the Trump administration has threatened to cut funding to international aid agencies that are assisting Syrian refugees. As the United States slouches away from its global leadership role, regional powers like Turkey are stepping in to fill the vacuum. Turkey and its 80 million people have welcomed more than three million Syrian refugees.\u201cSyrian refugees are not a problem to solve,\u201d the head of the Turkish emergency relief effort told me. \u201cThey are a reality to manage.\u201dThe Turkish city of Gaziantep sets an example in treating refugees humanely. A beautiful city on the Syrian-Turkish border, Gaziantep is said to house 600,000 Syrians, approximately 40,000 of which live in the city\u2019s five camps, which are administered by Turkey\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency. The rest \u2014 the vast majority of them \u2014 live in the city itself. Refugees are allowed to work and have access to free health care and schools, and the government has repeatedly committed to creating a pathway to Turkish citizenship.Gaziantep\u2019s mayor since 2014, Fatma Sahin, has made the safeguarding of refugee rights a signature policy. Her city has become a global model on how to embrace the survivors of a war. I accompanied Ms. Sahin to see some makeshift homes in the city\u2019s camps, where the Syrian refugees greeted us as though we were long-lost relatives. It was inspiring to see hope alive for an otherwise humiliated people.Turkey\u2019s refugee policy does not stop at its border. I visited Jarabulus in Syria, a town liberated from Islamic State control last year by the Turkish military. While Ankara\u2019s motives are many, one concrete result is a reduction in the flow of refugees across the border and the possibility that many refugees can return to their homes. In place of the Islamic State\u2019s summary justice and public beheadings, there is now a hospital with a maternity ward. The schools are being rebuilt, and the city has formed a new local council.Though facing difficulties of its own \u2014 the attempted military coup was little more than a year ago \u2014 Turkey has managed to pursue a far more humane refugee policy than its neighbors. Europe has been happy to let Turkey play this leading role in refugee relief. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government struck a deal with the European Union in which Europe is funding Turkey\u2019s refugee program in exchange for preventing migrants from reaching European shores.Turkey\u2019s response to the refugee crisis has considerably enhanced the regional prestige and power of its president. Mr. Erdogan has long cherished a dream of building a new Ottoman Empire, with Ankara as its capital. Turkey\u2019s robust refugee policy has materially advanced that ambition.Most Syrians I spoke to during my travels in the refugee camps told me of a common culture of abuse by their host country\u2019s military and police. In Lebanon especially, generations of Syrians \u2014 broken women, men and children \u2014 may be forced to live under a state with little means or patience to deal with the long-term reality of their presence. People forced to flee from their homes and then rejected will be ripe for radicalization unless the world turns its attention to helping them rebuild their lives, with real homes, some honor and at least a little hope.An earlier version of this article misstated a detail about the return of 600,000 people to their homes in Syria. Most of them returned from areas elsewhere in Syria, not from outside the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Debt Ceiling: Why We Have It, and What Would Happen if It Died", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThere are a lot of good reasons to do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday, acknowledging that the idea had come up in his meeting with congressional leaders.Republican leaders such as Speaker Paul D. Ryan quickly dismissed the idea, but if the statutory borrowing limit were ever eliminated, it would be the end of an era.As defined by the Treasury Department, the debt limit is the total money that the government is allowed to borrow to fulfill its financial obligations. That includes funds for social safety net programs, interest on the national debt and salaries for troops. While the debt ceiling debates are often tied to the prospect of future spending, in fact they involve financing of obligations that are already on the books.Constitutionally, Congress must authorize borrowing. The debt limit was instituted in the early 20th century so the Treasury did not need to ask for permission each time it needed to issue bonds to pay bills. According to a history of the debt limit from the Congressional Research Service, the first debt limit came as part of the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. A general limit on the federal debt was imposed in 1939.Generally, no. Denmark also has a debt limit, but it is set so high that raising it is generally not an issue.For many years, raising the debt ceiling was routine. But as the political environment has become more polarized, brinkmanship over the debt ceiling has increased. The House used to employ the \u201cGephardt Rule,\u201d which required the debt limit to be raised when a budget resolution was passed, but that was for the most part phased out during the 1990s. During the 2011 debt ceiling battle, some argued that the president had the power to unilaterally lift the debt ceiling, but President Obama and his lawyers disagreed.The lack of a replacement is one of the main reasons the debt ceiling has persisted. Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has called for the repeal of the debt limit but said some type of mechanism needed to be in place to force lawmakers to address long-term fiscal imbalances. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could get rid of it and do nothing in the wake of that,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. Other options include following the Denmark model and raising the debt limit stratospherically high or forcing the limit to increase in lock step with new funding.A lot of people think so. Few lawmakers from either party enjoy a vote on the debt ceiling, and the default that would be caused by a failure to raise it would lead to an economic catastrophe. Jason Furman, an Obama administration economist, said that the risks of accidental default were on the rise, and that the benefits of greater fiscal responsibility produced by the debt ceiling had been diminished.\u201cIn most countries, a fiscal crisis is when people don\u2019t want to lend to the government anymore,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cIn the United States, the main fiscal crisis is if we unilaterally shoot ourselves in the head.\u201dHe added, \u201cTaking that gun away would be a good idea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They paid $905,000, $57,000 over the asking price, as there were multiple bids. \u201cWhen I saw it, I could picture us there,\u201d said Ms. Balafas, 35, an admissions director at a private school on the Upper East Side. With that, she changed her mind about the suburbs.Since then, the Balafases, who now have two girls, ages 3 years and 5 months, have embraced their community \u2014 not only its proximity to the city but also its friendly, small-town ambience. Just two and a half square miles, Pelham is the southernmost town in Westchester County, bordered by New Rochelle, Eastchester, Mount Vernon and, to the south, the Bronx and the Long Island Sound.It is also the county\u2019s oldest town, dating to 1654, when an English aristocrat, Thomas Pell, bought 9,160 acres from the Siwanoy tribe and named his manor for his tutor, Pelham Burton. When Pelham was incorporated in 1788, it encompassed parts of the Bronx; it was reduced to its current size in 1895. (The town should not be confused with Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens, Pelham Bay Park or Pelham Parkway, all in the Bronx.)The rest of the town is residential, its homes nestled on streets lined with well-used sidewalks. People know one another and, as Mr. Balafas put it, \u201cthere are lots of bump-intos, walking around.\u201dThe housing stock is primarily single-family homes \u2014 about 2,800 of them, said Michele Casandra, the town assessor \u2014 including colonials, Victorians, Tudors, ranches and Mediterraneans, many built in the 1920s. Quarter-acre lots are common near downtown; farther south, lots are larger and houses more spread out. \u201cAn acre for us is a great piece of property,\u201d Ms. Davidian said.There are also more than 600 units in six cooperative complexes and four condominium complexes, Ms. Casandra said, as well as a few hundred multifamily rental homes and about 200 rental units in 23 apartment buildings and mixed-use properties.On Sept. 11, Ms. Davidian said, there were 42 single-family homes on the market. Only three were less than $600,000, including a two-bedroom, 1,114-square-foot bungalow, built in 1923 on .06 acre, listed for $475,000. The highest-priced home was a six-bedroom, 7,019-square-foot Victorian, built in 1914 on .8 acre, listed at $2,988,000. There were also 17 condominiums and co-ops for sale, from a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op for $129,000 to a 2,182-square-foot, two-bedroom condo for $799,000.The median sales price for a single-family home during the 12-month period ending Sept. 11 was $921,000, up from $846,000 the previous 12 months.\u201cPelham\u2019s variety of housing attracts a diversity of people economically, ethnically and professionally,\u201d Ms. Davidian said. Together, they form a tight-knit community, in part because of Pelham\u2019s walkability and the \u201cbump-intos\u201d Mr. Balafas mentioned.\u201cWhat makes Pelham special,\u201d said Peter DiPaola, the town supervisor and a 65-year resident, \u201cis that it\u2019s a community that cares, neighbor to neighbor.\u201dMean SAT scores for the 2016 graduating class were 564 in critical reading, 567 in math and 570 in writing; statewide equivalents were 489, 501 and 477. On 2017 fourth-grade state assessment tests, 67 percent met English standards and 73 percent met math standards, versus 41 and 43 percent statewide.Patrons of the bagel shop, bakery, wine store and other businesses at Four Corners may not be aware of the complex\u2019s historical significance. Constructed in 1931, it was one of the first self-contained shopping centers in the country with its own off-street parking lot \u2014 an innovative alternative to curbside parking and a model that is now widespread. This structure was expanded in the 1940s and again in the 1990s, but it retains its original Tudor Revival features, including slate roofs, timbered-and-stucco exteriors, arched doorways and fanciful chimneys.A picture last Sunday with the Living In column, about Pelham, N.Y., was published in error.

{"Headline": "Billionaires, Bruised Egos and the Death of a Grand Project", "Date": "2017-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the Manhattan headquarters of his company, IAC/InterActive Corporation, Mr. Diller and the film and theater producer Scott Rudin, who he had enlisted to help plan the programming, provided an overview of the pier\u2019s dazzling design, the ambitious performances they envisioned and their outreach to local schools.But, Mr. Diller said, their grand vision was met by a chorus of petty questions: What would signage at the pier be like? Would VIPs get special treatment at performances? And what would they do about dogs?The talks seemed about to deliver what Mr. Diller had sought for years \u2014 a clear path to a go-ahead for the project, formally known as Pier 55, but called \u201cDiller Island\u201d by many. There was even a barge with a pile driver waiting in the river off the 14th Street location, ready to start work as soon as the details could be finalized.\u201cWe thought he was happy as a clam,\u201d said Tom Fox, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits that had stalled the pier\u2019s progress, who attended the meeting. \u201cI said, we\u2019re grateful for your generosity. It was a well thought out program. The only problem, Why does it have to be in the river?\u201dInstead, Mr. Diller said, after all the questions, \u201cI ended the meeting so depressed.\u201d He had grown \u201cdisillusioned\u201d about the project in the spring, when a federal judge revoked the permit for the pier, stopping preliminary work. When settlement talks began in July, he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d sitting down with the people who had used the courts to wage a war of attrition against the project.That feeling of pique only intensified the message he had been getting from his family \u2014 Alexander and Tatiana Von Furstenberg, the grown children of his wife, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. \u201cMy family essentially had an intervention with me in the last couple of weeks to say, We\u2019ve watched you be stressed and tortured by something that was only meant to be a good thing,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cThen my family said, Don\u2019t you think we should use our resources where they\u2019re wanted?\u201dAnd so, late on Tuesday afternoon, Sept. 12, Mr. Diller called Madelyn Wils, the president and chief executive of the Hudson River Park Trust, which oversees the development and operation of the park. Mr. Diller explained that he\u2019d had enough: Diller Island was dead.\u201cIt was kind of like an out of body experience,\u201d Ms. Wils recalled. She felt like her heart had stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re not quite sure you heard what you heard,\u201d she said.Its denouement demonstrates some of the dangers of turning over funding of city infrastructure to individuals with deep pockets but, perhaps, thinner skins.After Westway\u2019s demise, the state and city in 1992 agreed to fund the establishment of the park, but in a controversial move, they said that money for its maintenance would come from commercial development along the waterfront. It would be overseen by the Hudson River Park Trust, a public benefit corporation.Ms. Wils who joined the Trust in 2011, said that the government had agreed to build the park, which runs from Battery Park City to West 59th Street along Manhattan\u2019s edge, and poured about $550 million into its creation. But it still needs another $200 million to be complete. Absent additional money from the state or the city, the Trust has long had to scrounge for funds.On Oct. 29, 2012, as Hurricane Sandy was battering New York, members of the Trust quietly met with Mr. Diller, Mr. Rudin and Mr. Nichols to review plans from Thomas Heatherwick, a British designer, whose creativity captivated everyone. He later came up with the concept of an undulating pier floating on a forest of piles in the shape of a parallelogram.But changing the shape of the pier required the legislature to approve a technical change in the law governing the Trust. Eight months later, lawmakers voted for the change. But Ms. Wils did not reveal to them that the Trust had been working on a plan with Mr. Diller for two years.Nevertheless, the project was announced with fanfare in November 2014 and quickly won support from the local community board, the mayor and the governor. The cost of the project had climbed to an estimated $130 million.The opposition filed its first lawsuit in June 2015. Riverkeeper, an environmental organization, initiated the suit with the City Club of New York, a small civic group. They recruited Mr. Fox and Rob Buchanan, environmental activists, as joint plaintiffs. They objected to both the secrecy surrounding the planning for the project and on environmental grounds.Mr. Fox and Ms. Wils had once been allies. In a meeting with Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan in 1992, when Mr. Fox was advocating for the creation of a park along the Hudson to a skeptical audience, he recalled Ms. Wils, a member of the board, intervening. \u201cIn the middle of the meeting, Madelyn gets up and says, The man is trying to build a park. Why are we giving him a hard time?\u201dBut the two became adversaries.Mr. Durst, who secretly stepped in to finance the litigation when Riverkeeper dropped out, had also once been an ally. He had served as chairman of the Friends of the Hudson River Park and donated $1 million to the park. But he fell out with Ms. Wils and Ms. Taylor over their development plans and the way they ran the organization.As the Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the project, the opponents filed and lost one lawsuit after another in state court, suing the Trust, the Army Corps and the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Their strategy was to lob every possible legal argument at the project, until either they won or Mr. Diller cried uncle.The project suffered a blow in March when a federal judge ruled that the Army Corps had not properly assessed the impact of a 2.4-acre pier on a protected fish and wildlife sanctuary.The opposition filed an appeal in federal court.For much of the last six years, Mr. Diller said he had a sense of \u201cequanimity\u201d about the project he had come to embrace, the time it took to gain approvals, the litigation and the rising costs.But the price of Pier 55 was mounting, with construction costs rising about 8 percent a year. As the completion date slipped from fall 2018 to 2021, the cost grew to more than $250 million.The Trust and other proponents concluded that the only way to stop the legal battle was to negotiate. Mr. Diller said he thought coming to an agreement was wrong, but he joined the talks, which started in July.The opposition wanted the Trust to agree that any projects built over the river would be focused on the water. It also demanded that the Trust accelerate work on two reclamation projects and refurbishing Pier 97 at 57th Street, which sits near three towers owned by the Durst family.Finally, it wanted assurances that no Diller-owned entity would benefit financially from performances at the pier. Mr. Diller said he never intended to profit from the park nor was the nonprofit he established to operate Pier 55 legally able to.By the Sept. 5 meeting, it seemed that Mr. Diller\u2019s pier was a given.Richard Emery, a lawyer for the opponents who took part in the talks, was shocked to hear of Mr. Diller\u2019s sudden decision. \u201cIt was pretty darn clear that Barry was getting everything he wanted.\u201dAt the meeting, Mr. Emery said he asked the participants why the Whitney wanted to meet him the following day. Mr. Diller, Ms. Taylor and David Paget, the Trust\u2019s lawyer, expressed ignorance.The next day, officials from the museum told him that they were proposing a large art installation over the water, near the museum and a couple blocks south of the entryway to Pier 55. The location was in the same area where the opposition wanted the Trust to protect the estuary. The museum said it had told the Trust about its plans.\u201cThey weren\u2019t telling him about something that would affect his project,\u201d Mr. Emery said of the Trust. \u201cHe learned about it after the Whitney had met with the Trust many times, which had to be infuriating to him.\u201dMr. Diller says emphatically that he did not learn about the Whitney plan \u201cuntil after I made the decision to withdraw, so it obviously had no bearing.\u201dMs. Wils says the idea that the Trust misled Mr. Diller is absurd. Although Mr. Diller said he could not recall being briefed on the Whitney project, Ms. Wils said, \u201cBarry\u2019s attorney and other members of his staff were aware that the Whitney had sponsored a project.\u201dIn the end, his decision seems to have rested on a feeling that his grand gesture was being met with opposition and ingratitude and that by giving in to his opponents \u2014 in even minor ways \u2014 he was somehow acknowledging wrongdoing. And that he would not do.In an email he wrote telling his supporters that he was pulling out of the project, Mr. Diller wrote: \u201cI couldn\u2019t in good faith agree to a settlement agreement as I felt we had done nothing wrong and that to give victory to these people was in itself wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Oregon Trail", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "The PourThe latest winemakers to settle in the region are bringing new perspectives, fresh energy and heartfelt enthusiasm to the country\u2019s most exciting wine area.Supported by\u201cDo a little bit every day towards your dream.\u201dThe husband-and-wife team have operated their winery in just this fashion since acquiring 70 acres off a dirt road here in the hills of the northern Willamette Valley a decade ago. They have stitched together a do-it-yourself operation: Mr. Marcy, the winemaker, buys grapes from a network of 12 vineyards, all within an hour of the farm, and tends the vegetable crops, and Ms. Carver, an accomplished artist, looks after the business, including drawing labels, wrapping bottles in paper by hand, marketing, entertaining visitors and raising animals.The Big Table menagerie includes 16 Irish Dexter cattle that are raised for beef, two American Guinea hogs, a couple of horses, six beehives, chickens, assorted dogs and cats, and an old goat who roves the place as a sort of mascot.This is no show farm. Ms. Carver slaughters the hogs for home consumption. I can testify that a leg of Iberico-style ham from Bert, a former denizen, was delicious. To sell the beef commercially, the cattle must be sent to a licensed slaughterhouse, though Ms. Carver takes care of the abrupt conversion of male calves to steers. The chickens and vegetables may be served up for team lunches with the farm\u2019s two employees or meals for the harvest crew.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of continuity and grounding that comes with being connected to the place,\u201d Ms. Carver said.You can sense that in the wines, too, largely pinot noirs and chardonnays that are both charming and delicious, if not always perfectly refined. Their barnlike winery, which they designed and built themselves, was financed partly by crowdfunding. One hundred people gave $1,700 each, for which they received wine and a plaque in the winery. The last and most costly piece, clearing and planting their own vineyard, remains a dream. But they have identified approximately 5 to 15 likely acres on the farm.Big Table is one of many energetic, heartfelt operations that make Oregon such a fascinating place. I\u2019m not one to make grand pronouncements about wine. The subject is too complex \u2014 and the stakes, frankly, too low \u2014 to warrant the sort of bold simplifications that seem to win at politics but lose at any deeper understanding of even this small part of the world.But after spending 10 days here in late July, visiting winemakers, tasting an awful lot of bottles and, incidentally, speaking at the International Pinot Noir Celebration, I can\u2019t help but conclude that Oregon is right now the single most exciting winemaking area in the United States.That is not to say that great things are not happening in the rest of the country. I am fascinated by what producers are achieving all over California; in Walla Walla, Wash.; and in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Great wines are being made in Michigan, in Vermont, in Texas and beyond.Collectively speaking, nowhere else does the level of quality seem so high, the perspectives so diverse or the experimentation so fierce as it is in Oregon right now.Yet pinot noir is not the sole narrative of the Willamette Valley. After a few false starts with chardonnay, the quality in the last decade has gotten better and better, especially in wines with a lean, minerally, energetic style.Oregon has established itself so well that a thriving wine counterculture has arisen, which, if not exactly rebelling against the dominance of pinot noir, is seeking to offer alternatives that are delicious and cheaper.Brianne Day of Day Wines, whose fine pinot noirs from the Willamette are nuanced, also buys grapes like tannat and cabernet franc from the Applegate Valley in the south of Oregon to make almost instinctive blends that are balanced and delicious.During my visit, I tried dolcettos and nebbiolos, assyrtikos and aligot\u00e9s, gew\u00fcrztraminers and others from labels like Holden Wine Company, Franchere Wine Company, Smockshop Band and Hiyu Wine Farm. Many were terrific. Seek them out if you are in the mood to sample some surprising, provocative wines.Part of what I love about Oregon, and the Willamette Valley in particular, is the small scale. Most Willamette wineries are family operations, and the business of the valley is clearly agriculture, not tourism. It has yet to see the large-scale hotels, fancy restaurants and extravagant winery structures that make, say, Napa Valley seem more Disney than farmland.Big wine companies like Jackson Family Wines and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates have started to buy in. This is not a bad thing, but it does bring with it the possibility, at least, that big companies will want to push tourism, and that land values will rise quickly. In which case, dreams like Big Table Farm\u2019s may no longer be possible, even a little bit at a time.Advertisement"}

You don\u2019t know anybody. To me, if there was one thing this movie is about, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t know anybody.\u201dIt\u2019s an observation that raises the question of how well do audiences know Louis C.K., a man who has built his career out of relentlessly, albeit thoughtfully, mining collective discomforts and taboos.So it\u2019s not real? \u201cNo.\u201d he responded. \u201cThey\u2019re rumors, that\u2019s all that is.\u201dAs he spoke about \u201cthat stuff,\u201d Louis C.K., who turns 50 on Tuesday, did not come off as defensive, but he did speak forcefully. He conceded that making a movie that toys with did-he-or-didn\u2019t-he questions could strike some as a little flagrant.\u201cI made a movie that totally walks all over that electric fence,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s weird.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t weigh these things and go, \u2018I hope everybody\u2019s O.K. with this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s boring to do that, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. I don\u2019t think that everybody has to come to a consensus that it\u2019s O.K. for everybody.\u201dShot in 35 millimeter in glamorous black and white, and accompanied by a sweeping score, the movie is deeply evocative of \u201cManhattan,\u201d making it feel like a Woody Allen movie about Woody Allen. (Louis C.K. said other real-life figures, among them Roman Polanski, fed into the Allen-esque character, too.) He wrote \u201cI Love You, Daddy\u201d with Vernon Chatman, and began working on it two years ago, ending up with this story line out of the many he was considering. The tale folds in the agonizing that goes into parenting, a theme that has been a through line in the comedian\u2019s work (in stand-up as well as in series like \u201cLouie\u201d on FX). He said he saw \u201cI Love You, Daddy\u201d as a tragic tale.\u201cIt\u2019s about a guy who found out too late that he didn\u2019t do his job as a dad, and he couldn\u2019t use the information that he found, and the girl had no choice but to raise herself,\u201d he said. He added later that after seeing the film on the big screen, he felt that it was also \u201cjust kind of a sweet movie about the twilight of childhood and parenthood.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s never afraid to do something polarizing,\u201d Ms. Adlon said, and Ms. Falco concurred. \u201cI am so in awe of that bravery, \u201d Ms. Falco said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s so not who I am.\u201dAnd that willingness to play it unsafe, Mr. Day said, was what set Louis C.K. apart.\u201cThere\u2019s always a little bit of blood in the water with what he makes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to find that in Hollywood, because everyone wants to tread lightly.

His victory demonstrated in stark terms the limits of Mr. Trump\u2019s clout.Taking the stage after a solo rendition of \u201cHow Great Thou Art,\u201d an exultant Mr. Moore said he had \u201cnever prayed to win this campaign,\u201d only putting his political fate \u201cin the hands of the Almighty.\u201d\u201cTogether, we can make America great,\u201d he said, borrowing Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan and adding, \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody in the press think that because he supported my opponent that I do not support him.\u201d[See a county-by-county look at how Alabama voted.]In a race that began as something of a political afterthought and ended up showcasing the right\u2019s enduring divisions, the victory by Mr. Moore, one of the most tenacious figures in Alabama politics, will likely embolden other anti-establishment conservatives to challenge incumbent Republicans in next year\u2019s midterm elections.And more immediately, the party will be forced to wrestle with how to prop up an often-inflammatory candidate given to provocative remarks on same-sex marriage and race \u2014 all to protect a seat in a deep-red state. Mr. Moore\u2019s incendiary rhetoric will also oblige others in the party to answer for his comments, perhaps for years to come, at a time when many Republicans would just as soon move on from the debate over gay rights.Mr. Jones said in an interview Tuesday afternoon that he believed voters would reward a candidate focused on \u201ckitchen-table issues,\u201d and said Alabama\u2019s public reputation was at stake in the election. \u201cPeople are tired of being embarrassed in this state,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cPeople want to see someone who can get things done.\u201dBut Mr. Moore, 70, has proved himself to be a political survivor. He has been effectively removed from the State Supreme Court twice \u2014 the first in 2003, over his refusal to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments in the courthouse; the second last year, when he urged the state\u2019s probate judges to defy federal orders regarding same-sex marriage.And in recent days, both the president and Vice President Mike Pence had campaigned for Mr. Strange. Mr. Trump, an enormously popular figure in Alabama, cast aside the tradition of presidents treading carefully in contested primaries, as well as the warnings from his own advisers regarding a candidate trailing in the polls.Yet instead of delivering a tightly crafted testimonial at a rally on Friday, the president rambled for nearly an hour and a half about a range of topics, while openly questioning whether he was making a mistake coming into the state for Mr. Strange, who oriented his entire run around Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement and stood looking on with a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat atop his head.Mr. Strange conceded defeat on Tuesday night before a subdued audience at a hotel outside of Birmingham, acknowledging in a moment of striking candor that he did not fully grasp the forces at play in his loss.\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a political environment that I\u2019ve never had any experience with,\u201d Mr. Strange said. \u201cThe political seas, the political winds in this country right now are very hard to navigate. They\u2019re very hard to understand.\u201dHe thanked Mr. Trump effusively, praising the president as a \u201cloyal friend\u201d and attempting to absolve him of any blame for the result. \u201cIf this causes him any trouble,\u201d Mr. Strange said, \u201cit\u2019s not his fault.\u201dMr. Strange\u2019s defeat was the first time an incumbent senator with active White House support has lost since 2010, when Arlen Specter, the longtime senator of Pennsylvania, was beaten in a Democratic primary after switching parties.But his loss was not just a blow to Mr. Trump. Mr. Moore relentlessly linked the senator to Mr. McConnell, who has made a priority of protecting his caucus from intraparty challenges, but is an increasingly polarizing figure among grass-roots Republicans. Despite the money and staff he directed to the race, Mr. McConnell became as much a liability as he was an asset, leaving Republicans nervously wondering what that may portend in other primaries next year.On Tuesday night, Mr. McConnell said in a statement that he understood Mr. Moore had channeled \u201ca dissatisfaction with the progress made in Washington.\u201d Saying that he shared that frustration, Mr. McConnell said he was determined to help Mr. Moore win, and made no references to the bitter attacks on his leadership by Mr. Moore and his allies.Mr. McConnell and his allies were jolted with another reminder of their limited control earlier in the day, when Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a popular incumbent, announced he would not run for re-election. As the first senator to opt out of seeking another term in 2018, Mr. Corker opened the way for another rowdy Southern primary in which the national party\u2019s influence may be sorely tested.Stephen K. Bannon, an ousted White House adviser and an enthusiastic backer of Mr. Moore, crowed about Mr. Corker\u2019s retirement in brief remarks before Mr. Moore took the stage on Tuesday night. Mr. Bannon predicted a populist \u201crevolution\u201d would follow the Alabama results.Mr. Strange\u2019s demise was in some respects as much a local phenomenon as a national one, stemming from his appointment this year by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Strange, the state\u2019s attorney general at the time, was overseeing an investigation into Mr. Bentley\u2019s personal relationship with a close aide, suggesting to many in a scandal-weary state that there may have been a corrupt bargain. The newly appointed senator denied any wrongdoing, but never fully confronted the issue in a way that would eliminate the lingering cloud over the appointment.And by Monday, an adviser to Mr. McConnell, anticipating defeat, started to privately make the case that it was Mr. Bentley\u2019s scandal and the circumstances around the appointment that was most to blame for Mr. Strange\u2019s lackluster support.Mr. Strange\u2019s status as a proxy for the Republican establishment and a test of the president\u2019s sway came about almost by accident \u2014 a consequence of factors having little to do with Mr. Strange himself.The Senate Republican leader treated Mr. Strange as the political equal of his elected colleagues and ordered strategists in Washington not to work against him. Mr. McConnell and a host of other senators lobbied an initially reluctant Mr. Trump to get involved on Mr. Strange\u2019s behalf over the objections of some advisers. The confusing crosscurrents of the party were on vivid display when the president campaigned for Mr. Strange on Friday.As staff members from the party\u2019s campaign arm allied with Mr. McConnell looked on, Mr. Strange told the conservative audience that they should elect him so he could \u201cstand up to\u201d Mr. McConnell.And then the president took the stage and assured attendees he would back Mr. Moore were Mr. Strange to lose, comments that were soon made into an online ad by an anti-establishment conservative group.Mr. Strange made little attempt to find a new, more moderate universe of voters in the runoff who would recoil from the thought of Mr. Moore as their senator, a strategy fashioned next door in Mississippi when Senator Thad Cochran found himself in a runoff with a hard-line primary challenger in 2014. In fact, some strategists who had been with Mr. Cochran\u2019s campaign said they did not hear from Mr. Strange\u2019s advisers.The perils of presidential involvement were obvious to some, and conservative allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Bannon, had counseled him not to meddle in Alabama.But he was not the only prominent figure here to gamble on Mr. Strange. Senator Richard Shelby, a pillar of Alabama politics for over 45 years, dispensed with his usual caution to support a longtime friend. But he saw how the political winds were blowing well before Tuesday.On a get-out-the-vote conference call with Mr. Strange\u2019s supporters this month, he recounted an anecdote about the 1970 Democratic governor\u2019s race here between Albert Brewer, a racial moderate, and the segregationist George C. Wallace, a divisive figure in his time. After it became clear that Mr. Wallace had won, the University of Alabama\u2019s young, progressive president, F. David Mathews, mournfully turned to his family and said they would have to \u201cget used to living with George Wallace.\u201dNow, Mr. Shelby said, they may have to get used to living with Mr. Moore in the Senate, where he could be just as divisive.Jonathan Martin reported from Montgomery, Ala., and Alexander Burns from Homewood.

{"Headline": "Hal Tulchin, Who Documented a \u2018Black Woodstock,\u2019 Dies at 90", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Simone was one of many artists, mostly African-American, who appeared that summer at the Harlem Cultural Festival, a series of six free Sunday concerts. Stevie Wonder was there, as were other popular music acts, each of which could have attracted a big crowd on its own: the 5th Dimension, Abbey Lincoln, B. B. King, Sly & the Family Stone, Herbie Mann, Hugh Masekela, Gladys Knight & the Pips, David Ruffin, Mahalia Jackson and the Staple Singers.The series, partly overlapping with another music festival being held in upstate New York that summer, became known as \u201cthe Black Woodstock.\u201dBut unlike the Woodstock festival in Bethel, N.Y., a countercultural milestone that spawned an Academy Award-winning documentary film and a No. 1 soundtrack double album, the Harlem series was destined for near-obscurity. Little of Mr. Tulchin\u2019s project has been seen publicly.He tried, unsuccessfully, to interest networks in using his footage for a documentary; another plan to make a documentary ended a decade ago. Until he died at 90 on Aug. 29 in Bronxville, N.Y., he was still hoping that a film or a series would be made, his daughter, Sasha Tulchin, said.Mr. Tulchin used five portable videotape cameras to record the concerts and, according to his daughter, designed the set.\u201cIt was a peanuts operation, because nobody really cared about black shows,\u201d Mr. Tulchin bluntly told Smithsonian.com in 2007. \u201cBut I knew it was going to be like real estate, and sooner or later someone would have interest in it.\u201dMr. Tulchin\u2019s footage did not fully disappear. Some of it was used in two television specials shown that summer. And some of it was seen in two Nina Simone projects: the \u201cSoul of Nina Simone\u201d (2005), a combined CD-DVD, and \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone\u201d (2015), a documentary by Liz Garbus.\u201cThe material is amazing,\u201d Mr. Lauro said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe used all his expertise to film something extraordinary.\u201dMr. Lauro began working with Mr. Tulchin in 2004 and teamed up with the filmmakers Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon in a plan to turn the videotapes into a documentary film. But within a few years the deal had unraveled over financial issues.Harold Monroe Tulchin was born to Jewish immigrants from Ukraine in Elizabeth, N.J., on Dec. 23, 1926. His father, Leo, was a machinist and a supermarket manager, and his mother, the former Clara Fisher, was a homemaker. He graduated from the University of Iowa with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees and studied acting and directing at the Dramatic Workshop in Manhattan.From a job in programming with Sterling Television, a syndicator, he went to the advertising agency Young & Rubicam, where he worked for President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s 1956 re-election campaign, his daughter said. He then began directing live commercials for shows like \u201cThe $64,000 Question\u201d and \u201cThe Philco Television Playhouse.\u201d He became an expert in the use of videotape, especially in commercials.In the years after the Harlem festival, Mr. Tulchin directed TV specials with Wayne Newton, Noel Harrison and Lesley Gore, and a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll revival special starring Chubby Checker and Little Richard. He also formed a commercial production firm.In addition to his daughter, Mr. Tulchin is survived by his third wife, the former Janine Scarola; another daughter, Ava Seavey; three grandchildren; and two half sisters, Joanne Dolgow and Anita Gibbs. His marriages to Billie Jean Holt and Doreen Soraci ended in divorce.The documentary might still be made. A producer, Robert Fyvolent, said he had lined up a director and had an offer to finance a film that would ideally be released in 2019 for the 50th anniversary of the festival. In a telephone interview, Mr. Fyvolent said that until a month ago Mr. Tulchin was pitching ideas for marketing the concert footage, such as turning some of it into webisodes.\u201cHe was thinking outside the box,\u201d Mr. Fyvolent said, \u201cand had strong opinions about what he wanted to try.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coming Soon to AMC Theaters: Virtual Reality Experiences", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCULVER CITY, Calif. \u2014 It is easily Hollywood\u2019s hottest start-up.Steven Spielberg was an early investor. So were 21st Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. The venture\u2019s leadership team includes the former chief of Disney\u2019s theme park design division; the producer of the \u201cMen in Black\u201d movie series; and a live event kingpin.And now AMC Entertainment, the world\u2019s largest theater chain, has invested $20 million in the fledgling company and agreed to finance the rapid rollout of its product in the United States and Britain.\u201cWe were mesmerized by what we saw,\u201d said Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment. \u201cTheir vision is to change what V.R. has been \u2014 away from just a heightened level of video game and toward cinematic storytelling \u2014 and we think it\u2019s what consumers have been waiting for.\u201d\u201cIn many cases, we have surplus space, and we think Dreamscape will add energy and excitement to our theaters, especially during the week,\u201d Mr. Aron said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a replacement for movies. It\u2019s a complement.\u201d Tickets are expected to cost from $15 to $20.The Hollywood players behind Dreamscape give it immediate cachet. Joining Mr. Spielberg are people like Hans Zimmer, the movie music composer, and the director Gore Verbinski. But their involvement does not guarantee success. Mr. Spielberg, for one, has been down this road before, with mixed results. In the late 1990s, his DreamWorks SKG invested alongside Universal Pictures in a heavily promoted venture called GameWorks, which was supposed to use new technology to revolutionize the arcade business. GameWorks never lived up to its billing.Two members of the Dreamscape management team, Walter Parkes, a co-chairman, and Bruce Vaughn, the chief executive, are very familiar with those efforts. Mr. Parkes, a movie producer whose credits include the \u201cMen in Black\u201d series, worked for Mr. Spielberg as a senior DreamWorks executive at the time. Mr. Vaughn spent 23 years at Disney, most recently serving as chief creative officer of its Imagineering research and design unit.\u201cEven big-name brands can have a hard time getting people to go here instead of there,\u201d Mr. Vaughn acknowledged.\u201cThis is truly the birth of a new storytelling medium,\u201d Mr. Parkes said.As if to prove it, Mr. Parkes took a reporter through a prototype Dreamscape experience. The company uses more than a dozen cameras and sensors to transport people into various settings \u2014 home plate in a sold-out baseball stadium, the spider-filled ruins of an ancient temple or a futuristic, neon-lit city flooded with water.

Mr. Parkes said the company was also negotiating with various studios and filmmakers to create experiences that put people inside movie franchises.\u201cIf you enjoy our experience, you\u2019ll be more likely to see the movie, and vice versa,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Trump\u2019s Hands-Off Approach to Governing Does Not Apply", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration opened the door to allowing more firearms on federal lands. It scrubbed references to \u201cL.G.B.T.Q. youth\u201d from the description of a federal program for victims of sex trafficking. And, on the advice of religious leaders, it eliminated funding to international groups that provide abortion.While these initiatives lacked the fanfare of some of President Trump\u2019s high-profile proclamations \u2014 like his ban on transgender people in the military \u2014 they point to a fundamental repurposing of the federal bureaucracy to promote conservative social priorities.The aggressive regulatory effort, which runs counter to the Trump administration\u2019s less-is-more credo about government meddling, has led to policy changes related to gun ownership, gay rights, reproductive choices, immigration and other divisive political issues, according to a New York Times review of government documents and court records, as well as interviews with more than four dozen people involved in or briefed on the efforts.The overhaul is unfolding behind the scenes in Washington at agencies like the Health and Human Services Department, where new rules about birth control are being drafted, and in federal courtrooms, where the Justice Department has shifted gears in more than a dozen Obama-era cases involving social issues.The turnabout stems in part from lobbying by evangelical Christians and other conservative groups. In interviews, these groups said they have regular discussions on domestic and foreign policy with the administration \u2014 more so than during the presidency of George W. Bush, the last Republican to occupy the White House and someone who identified as a Christian conservative.\u201cEverybody has points of contact, and not just secretaries either,\u201d said Johnnie Moore, a Christian leader who owns a public relations firm and advises the White House on religious matters. \u201cIt is higher up people \u2014 directors or deputy directors. And it is all across the government.\u201dTop White House officials have led the outreach, including Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s Orthodox Jewish son-in-law, and Vice President Mike Pence, a staunch social and religious Christian conservative. Kellyanne Conway, a senior aide, counted some of these groups among her paying clients before joining the White House.Yet the new direction has also met some resistance among rank-and-file civil servants. Within the Justice Department, several long-serving lawyers have decided to retire or quit rather than help carry out the new policies, according to people briefed on the departures.While turnover is natural after an election, some of these departing lawyers worked at the department through previous Republican administrations \u2014 under Ronald Reagan and both Bushes \u2014 and they have privately told colleagues that recent changes twist the law in directions that make them uncomfortable.For example, a debate arose over immigration in recent weeks, when high-ranking Justice Department officials explored whether they could apply a law commonly used to prosecute businesses to instead punish so-called sanctuary cities, according to several former officials briefed on the issue.Mr. Trump has roundly criticized these cities, which limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and he has threatened to withhold federal funding to them. Some of the department\u2019s veteran lawyers opposed the more aggressive options as not legally justifiable.Some of these lawyers also faced the unpalatable task of undoing their work defending Obama-era regulations, such as those on birth control and transgender rights. Rather than help roll back those rules, the officials decided to leave the government, according to the people briefed on the departures, who were not authorized to speak publicly about personnel matters.\u201cAll of the things you count on the Justice Department\u2019s institutional bureaucracy for \u2014 thoughtful, deliberate attention to process, including all stakeholders \u2014 it seems to have been thrown out,\u201d said Sharon McGowan, a former senior career official who joined the Justice Department in 2010 and worked in the civil rights division until departing a few weeks into the Trump administration.Ms. McGowan, the only former career official who agreed to comment for this article, noted that some of her former colleagues are staying despite concerns.\u201cSome are absolutely staying because they feel like they\u2019re afraid of who\u2019d get put in their seat if they left,\u201d said Ms. McGowan, who now works at Lambda Legal, an advocacy organization focused on L.G.B.T. rights.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, while a White House spokesman said that the president \u201cis proud to promote a conservative agenda that has been far too long ignored by the Obama administration.\u201dDespite their bond, some religious conservatives have expressed disappointment in Mr. Trump or faced pressure to distance themselves from controversial positions. Some denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s response last month to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., and disagreed with his move to end the program that blocks young undocumented immigrants from being deported.For Mr. Trump, who only recently adopted socially conservative causes, an alliance with the religious right might seem an odd fit. And with his newfound deal-making with Democrats in Congress, it is unknown if his social priorities might change. But these conservative groups voted for him in large numbers, and as president, Mr. Trump has remained loyal: He appointed Neil Gorsuch, a favorite of social conservatives, to the Supreme Court, and he stocked his cabinet with others like Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The alliance has alarmed social liberals, who enjoyed considerable victories and an expansion of rights under the Obama administration.With the shift in Washington, many top conservative groups have increased their spending on lobbying. In the first half of this year, the National Rifle Association almost doubled what it spent in the same period last year, according to Senate data.Spending by the top anti-abortion lobbying groups increased as well. The Susan B. Anthony List spent $390,000 in the first half of this year and projected it would spend $400,000 in the second half, almost doubling the yearly total for 2016, which had been its biggest year.And, for the first time, the group has directed some of that money toward lobbying the White House and Health and Human Services Department, instead of targeting only Congress.Mallory Quigley, communications director for the group, which backs political candidates opposed to abortion, said that over the last eight years it \u201cnever even had an opportunity to start building relationships\u201d with the executive branch.In early March, Steven J. Lechner, the top lawyer for the Mountain States Legal Foundation, was feverishly preparing to argue a gun-rights case in court when he received a call from the Justice Department.The Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department had spent more than three years defending a policy that largely prohibits firearms on Army Corps of Engineers property. Mr. Lechner\u2019s group wanted to overturn the policy, setting up the court battle.But the Trump administration, the caller indicated, was rethinking the government\u2019s support for the prohibition.On the eve of oral arguments, the Justice Department filed an emergency motion stating that the Army Corps was \u201creconsidering the firearms policy challenged in this case,\u201d sending the case to mediation. The Justice Department\u2019s motion signaled a likely victory for Mr. Lechner, stating that \u201cthis reconsideration has the potential to fully resolve plaintiffs\u2019 objections.\u201dA spokesman for the Army Corps referred questions about the case to the Justice Department, but added that the agency is accepting public comments on a number of existing regulations, not just the firearms rule.The Army Corps case is among those identified by The Times \u2014 more than a dozen this year \u2014 in which the Trump administration took a right turn on contentious social issues in court. And because the Justice Department represents a wide array of federal agencies in legal matters, it is on the front lines of the shift on those issues.In each of the cases identified by The Times, the Justice Department either reversed an earlier position, announced that the government was reconsidering an existing rule, or became newly involved in a legal fight, court records show.Two of the cases focused on the Army Corps\u2019s firearm ban, while others pertained to voting issues. In at least nine cases, the department stated in court papers that the Trump administration was considering changing an Affordable Care Act rule that requires companies to provide employees with free insurance coverage for birth control.The Justice Department also recently filed court papers in a discrimination case before the Supreme Court, siding with a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake to a same-sex couple.But the department\u2019s advocacy has not been limited to the courtroom. It also has issued new initiatives and eliminated others.The final version of the new policy, outlined in an F.B.I. memo in the early weeks of the Trump administration, went further. It prohibits people from buying guns if they flee the state to avoid law enforcement, but only if they are \u201csubject to a current or imminent criminal prosecution or testimonial obligation.\u201dChanges have also occurred at the Justice Department office that handles juvenile programs. In May, the office sought applications from nonprofit organizations and state and local governments to apply for a long-running grant program that funds mentoring for child victims of sex trafficking. But there was a difference in this year\u2019s application: There were no references to sexual orientation or gender identity of the victims in the program descriptions.A year earlier, under the Obama administration, the program was described as focusing \u201con the needs of girls and boys, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (L.G.B.T.Q.) youth who are at risk or are victims of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic sex trafficking.\u201dThere were seven references to L.G.B.T.Q. in the document last year. There were none in the new version, though the Justice Department did not specifically exclude these youths from the mentoring.Similar changes were made to grant applications for youth homelessness programs through the Health and Human Services Department, which said that the revisions complied with federal law.That agency separately attempted to modify its data collection, but retreated after being confronted by liberal groups. When its surveys of older Americans were updated, the agency planned to exclude a question that appeared on previous surveys about sexual orientation. The data collected in the surveys is used to organize and finance programs that provide nutritional support and housing for older people.The order, focused on protecting religious liberties, took aim at Obama-era regulations intended to protect gay people from discrimination and ensure that women have access to birth control.Flanked by Vice President Pence and Paula White, a Christian televangelist who has been his spiritual adviser, the president called a group of Catholic nuns to the stage. The group, Little Sisters of the Poor, had been in a longtime legal fight with the Justice Department over the birth-control regulations.\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Mr. Trump said, after two smiling nuns shook his hand. \u201cThey sort of just won a lawsuit.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s order had no immediate effect on policy, and it did not resolve the lawsuit. But it did start a flurry of activity across the government \u2014 the administrative state that the Trump administration typically views with skepticism \u2014 prompting agencies to draft new policies that interpret the executive order and chip away at the Obama-era mandates.Specifically, the executive order directed Attorney General Sessions to issue guidelines for interpreting religious liberty protections in law. The order also instructed federal agencies to vigorously protect religious liberties and consider issuing new rules to address conscience-based objections to health care mandates.Since then, the Health, Labor and Treasury Departments have been engaged in rule-making to reconsider the birth-control regulation, according to briefs filed by the administration in pending court cases.The round of rule-making, social conservative groups say, signals the willingness of like-minded officials in the Trump cabinet and across the federal bureaucracy to take up their causes.Anti-abortion groups, for example, pointed to multiple allies in the administration.Tom Price, secretary of Health and Human Services, opposed abortion and free birth control as a Georgia congressman. Teresa Manning, who heads the department\u2019s Title X program, which provides family planning funding for poor people and those without health insurance, was formerly a lobbyist with the National Right to Life Committee and analyst for the conservative Family Research Council. Charmaine Yoest, the assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of public affairs, was once the head of Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group.Other high-profile abortion foes in the administration include Ben Carson at the Housing and Urban Development Department; Rick Perry at the Energy Department; Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations; Ms. Conway, the adviser to Mr. Trump; and Vice President Pence.Ms. Conway and Mr. Pence addressed the annual March for Life rally in Washington in January. Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, said it was the first time a sitting vice president had spoken to the rally.Arguably, none of the Trump cabinet members has been as influential as Mr. Sessions. A key architect of the president\u2019s socially conservative agenda, Mr. Sessions is playing a leading role in shaping Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on religious liberties.During a speech in July, Mr. Sessions strongly hinted at a decision to the liking of social conservatives.Greg Baylor, a senior lawyer with the group, which has been among those privately advising the Justice Department, called Mr. Sessions\u2019 remarks \u201cvery encouraging.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Sessions, a number of lesser-known officials on his staff are shaping the new direction, according to former officials briefed on the matter.Among them is Rachel Brand, the department\u2019s third highest ranking official behind Mr. Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Ms. Brand has deep conservative credentials. Once active in the Federalist Society, she worked for the George W.

{"Headline": "42 Minutes, \u00a32,600 Lost: The U.K.\u2019s Growing Gambling Problem", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Tony Franklin entered a betting shop in northwest London one morning last week and paid 300 pounds, or around $400, into a gambling machine \u2014 and lost that money within 16 minutes.Then he paid in another \u00a3300. Then a further \u00a31,000 six minutes later. And 20 minutes after that, a final \u00a31,000.Within 42 minutes, Mr. Franklin had lost \u00a32,600, the latest relapse in a decades-long gambling addiction that he reckons has cost him more than a million pounds, his marriage, several jobs and his relationship with his three children.\u201cI just don\u2019t know why I go in, and this is the problem,\u201d Mr. Franklin, 46, said a few hours later. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to lose.\u201dMr. Franklin has been trying to quit gambling for years. What usually drags him back in is a particular kind of gambling machine, known as a fixed odds betting terminal, that lies at the heart of a bitter debate about the future of British gambling. Campaigners and some researchers say the machine is an unusually addictive form of gambling that is sucking billions out of Britain\u2019s poorest communities, and some hope it will be banned after a government review next month.The bookmakers, though, pointed to a line in the report that said the rate of problem gambling had remained \u201cstatistically stable,\u201d because both figures are small compared with the British population as a whole.Today, there are roughly 33,000 such machines spread across Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops. They collectively provided a profit of more than \u00a31.8 billion last year, far more than those outlets made from bets on horse races, dog races and soccer matches combined.The machines allow users to place bets of up to \u00a3100, once every 20 seconds, on computerized casino games such as roulette.While researchers are divided on the subject, many gambling addicts say that the machines\u2019 singular features make them uniquely addictive and uniquely harmful, both accelerating the rate of loss and decreasing the waiting time between bets.\u201cIt\u2019s a gambler\u2019s dream,\u201d said Jason Haddigan, a former addict who wrote about his decades-long addiction in a new book, \u201cHow and Why I Conned the Bookies.\u201d \u201cYou get the buzz straightaway and you get hooked straightaway.\u201dBookmakers dispute these claims. There is \u201cno link between gaming machines in betting shops and problem gambling,\u201d said Gary Follis, a spokesman for the Association for British Bookmakers, citing the Gambling Commission\u2019s recent report, which suggested that problem gamblers tend to use several different gambling products.Bookmakers also argue that the campaign against fixed odds betting terminals is backed by people who make money from other kinds of gambling, and say that banning the machines would force many shops to close, leading to job losses.A 2006 federal law intended to make it more difficult to gamble on the Internet has, by almost any measure, been a spectacular failure.That argument strikes campaigners as myopic, given the social damage they say the machines are already causing to some of Britain\u2019s poorest communities.\u201cSocially, it\u2019s decimating communities,\u201d said Carolyn Harris, a Labour Party lawmaker who heads a parliamentary group that discusses the machines. \u201cThe less money you put in these machines, the more disposable income people will have to put into other businesses,\u201d she said, adding that banning them would \u201cboost the economy and create employment.\u201dPart of the problem facing Parliament is that different investigations into the machines\u2019 addictiveness have drawn different conclusions, making it easy for bookmakers to argue that there is not enough evidence to support changing the law.Critics of the gambling industry say these discrepancies have been subtly encouraged by the industry itself.As a result, GambleAware is now the largest single source of financing for British gambling research, while simultaneously attracting claims that it is too close to the companies it is supposed to be examining impartially.\u201cThere\u2019s no question of money coming in with strings attached,\u201d Iain Corby, GambleAware\u2019s deputy chief executive, said in an interview, adding later, \u201cWe are the good guys.\u201dBut the charity has attracted criticism because until recently, roughly half of its trustees were representatives of the gambling industry.The government is due to release a long-awaited review of fixed odds betting terminals in October, and campaigners hope it will recommend increased restrictions on their use.Yet others, including Mr. Franklin, say the government needs to reform not just machine gambling, but also the industry as a whole.The controversial machines \u201care just one part of a massive problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOne part of the cradle-to-grave electronic gambling extraction business that is causing untold unhappiness in this country.\u201dAn article on Sunday about gambling in Britain misstated the percentage increase in \u201cproblem gamblers\u201d cited in a report by the country\u2019s Gambling Commission. The report said the number rose by more than 53 percent from 2012 to 2015, not by almost 50 percent.Advertisement"}

Or the most politically flammable fringes?). Facebook says that more of those ads ran in 2015 than in 2016, but not how many more.Nor has Facebook reported whether the people who were targeted were from specific demographic or philosophical groups \u2014 all of which means we really don\u2019t know the full extent of the duping on Facebook, and maybe Facebook doesn\u2019t either.Facebook says it is working to prevent a repeat. And it was hardly the only platform that Russia is presumed to have used to disrupt the political debate in America; there were others in the mix as well, particularly Twitter, which has divulged even less than Facebook has.Mr. Shane\u2019s report helped fill in some blanks when he unearthed several of the phony accounts, like that of one Melvin Redick, a professed Pennsylvanian. On his Facebook page, Mr. Redick appears to be a loving dad of an adorable little girl, but as it turns out he doesn\u2019t actually exist. That account was early to spot and promote DCLeaks, the site that became a receptacle for hacked information about prominent Americans.So a picture starts to emerge. But it\u2019s a spotty one, only as good as the journalism that\u2019s working so hard to fill the canvas, and the scraps we\u2019re getting from law enforcement and the social platforms themselves.When I asked Facebook why it couldn\u2019t be more forthcoming with the public, the company responded with a statement saying, \u201cDue to federal law, and the ongoing investigation into these issues, we are limited as to what we can disclose publicly.\u201dFacebook, which didn\u2019t elaborate, appears to be saying it is legally restricted from the willy-nilly handing-over of information about its users to the government or, for that matter, the public. And it\u2019s certainly a challenge for Facebook to decide where the line is between sharing vital details about its use in a plot like election meddling, and exposing private data about its legitimate users.On Friday, I asked Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or Epic, an advocacy group, where he stood on the question.\u201cThe best case for that is that the First Amendment protects anonymous speech,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the United States government were to try to comprehend the identities of controversial speakers, we\u2019d be up on the front lines saying the government doesn\u2019t have the right to do that.\u201dBut in this case, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about non-U.S. persons engaging in political speech in U.S. elections, and it\u2019s a stretch to extend that kind of protection to this type of activity,\u201d he said.Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington, told me that the electronic communications privacy law did not extend protections to advertisements or posted messages that were readily accessible to the public.That\u2019s not to say that Mr. Mueller\u2019s involvement doesn\u2019t add to the sensitivity for Facebook. It does. But sooner rather than later Facebook owes it to the public to provide still more detail about the ads. And it owes it to its users to let them know if they have directly interacted with the equivalent of digital spies sent to influence them.Then there\u2019s democracy itself, and the new problems the social platforms are creating for it.The American electoral system includes a complicated campaign finance regime that was devised to keep Americans informed about who finances the media messages designed to sway them.The Russian effort was able to elude those laws through social media, where the system has clearly \u2014 and fundamentally \u2014 broken down.As of now, we don\u2019t even know the full extent to which the Russian ads violated the current legal requirements. That\u2019s something Mr. Mueller should be able to determine. But Facebook and other platforms need to get more information out there publicly, too, so the necessary discussion about potential remedies doesn\u2019t have to wait for the Mueller investigation to conclude. Hopefully they will.This much should be clear: Arguments that sites like Facebook are merely open \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 and not \u201cmedia companies\u201d that make editorial judgments about activity in the digital worlds they created \u2014 fall woefully flat when it comes to meddling in our democracy.The platforms have become incredibly powerful in a short amount of time. With great power has come great profit, which they are only too happy to embrace; the great responsibility part, not always so much.\u201cGiven the role they played in this election, they now have a major responsibility to help solve this problem,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said.After all, the 2018 midterms are just around the corner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toshiba Reaches Deal With Bain-Apple Group to Sell Chip Business", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba, the huge but struggling Japanese conglomerate, traded some of its size for financial security on Thursday by selling off most of its profitable microchip business.It was not the way the company, which has long been accused of being bloated and directionless, had hoped to slim down.Toshiba said it had signed a deal to sell 60 percent of the microchip unit, Toshiba Memory Corporation, to a group of international investors that includes Bain Capital and Apple. The deal, which followed months of tumultuous negotiations, will net Toshiba about $14 billion.Toshiba traces its roots to the 1870s, when its founders helped further Japan\u2019s industrial emergence, building the country\u2019s telegraph system and installing its first domestically made electric lights. If the company had collapsed, Japan would have lost a pillar of its economy and its tens of thousands of workers. It also would have lost the main contractor cleaning up the ruined Fukushima nuclear plant, which Toshiba helped build decades ago.While Toshiba\u2019s history in many ways embodied Japan\u2019s blazing economic rise, some people say the stumbles that led the company to sell chip unit reflected the country\u2019s more recent problems.In an era when the global technology industry is dominated by nimble specialists selling cutting-edge design and software, Toshiba has been defined by a stultifying management hierarchy, a dogged focus on hardware and a scattered portfolio of businesses.\u201cToshiba is one of Japan\u2019s last zombies,\u201d said Jesper Koll, the chief executive of WisdomTree Japan, an investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s the last of the big conglomerates that does not have a defined strategy.\u201dSimilar problems have hampered other Japanese groups, but Mr. Koll said that Toshiba had been particularly slow to address them. Others, like Hitachi, another refrigerators-to-power-plants conglomerate, he said, \u201cmade hard decisions\u201d to restructure and become more accountable to shareholders, while Toshiba delayed.The inaction helped Toshiba executives save face, at least for a while.Now, with the sale of a majority of the microchip unit, Toshiba is shrinking further.Two financial institutions controlled by the Japanese government that Toshiba had previously identified as major potential investors will not contribute money initially, the company said. The institutions, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, may invest at a later date.The investors were instead drawn entirely from the private sector.In addition to Apple, they include three other American businesses: Seagate Technology and Kingston Technology, two data storage companies, and a venture capital arm of Dell, the computer maker. The South Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix, and Hoya, a Japanese manufacturer of optical equipment, were also named as investors.Toshiba itself will retain just over 40 percent of the unit, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of the flash memory chips used to store data in smartphones and other digital devices.In negotiating the deal, Toshiba struggled to balance its need for cash and its desire to retain control of the microchip unit, which has been described as the crown jewel in its vast portfolio of businesses.Toshiba pioneered its core technology, NAND flash memory, and although it has fallen to second in global production, behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the business has generated the largest share of Toshiba\u2019s profits in recent years. Among the company\u2019s concerns was that its technology could fall into the hands of investors, like SK Hynix and Kingston, that are also its competitors.Although Japan dominated the global microchip market in the 1980s and 1990s, it has lost ground more recently. Tsugio Makimoto, a retired semiconductor engineer at Hitachi, said that in the past, big conglomerates were good at nurturing microchip businesses, because they had the money to finance research and build factories.Now, as the pace of technological change has quickened, \u201cmanagement speed and specialization are more important,\u201d he said.While Toshiba will retain only a minority of the chip unit\u2019s shares, it will still exercise significant control.The American investors, whose precise financial contributions were not disclosed, will receive preferred shares that do not carry voting rights, Toshiba said. SK Hynix would be limited to an ownership stake of no more than 15 percent for 10 years.Hoya is buying 10 percent. In a line that reflected nationalistic concerns about the sale, Toshiba made a point of noting that, \u201cWith Toshiba and Hoya\u2019s investments, Japan-based companies will hold more than 50 percent of the common stock.\u201d It added that Japanese owners would \u201ccontinue to hold a majority\u201d in the future.In proceeding with the deal, Toshiba brushed aside objections by one of its business partners, Western Digital, the American storage company. Western Digital could still move to block the sale\u2019s completion.A Western Digital subsidiary, SanDisk, shares ownership with Toshiba of a flash memory production operation in Japan. Because of that, the American company contends that its approval is necessary for Toshiba to sell the chip unit. Western Digital said this week that it would seek an injunction against the deal.If the legal battle is settled in Toshiba\u2019s favor, or if the two sides reach a settlement, it could make it easier for risk-averse government institutions like the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan to join the buyout conglomerate. That would take pressure off other investors and Toshiba\u2019s banks, which Toshiba said had agreed to provide 600 billion yen in fresh loans.Regardless of the legal outcome, Toshiba\u2019s relationship with Western Digital and SanDisk has been badly damaged, presenting a challenge for the chip unit\u2019s new owners.\u201cToshiba\u2019s flash memory success has a lot to do with its relationship with SanDisk,\u201d said Mr. Makimoto. \u201cThere are still a lot of issues to address before Toshiba can breathe easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sale of Brooklyn Housing Complex Would Benefit Trump", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe longtime owners of Starrett City, the sprawling Brooklyn housing complex overlooking Jamaica Bay, are selling the development for more than $850 million, and among those who stand to benefit is President Trump, a partial owner.Starrett City is the largest federally subsidized housing development in the country, and the sale will require the approval of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and state housing officials, raising potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Trump and his family. Mr. Trump owns a 4 percent stake in the complex, according to his federal financial disclosure forms; other members of the Trump family also own stakes in the partnership.The buyer is a joint venture of the Brooksville Company, a recently formed residential real estate firm, and Rockpoint Group, a private equity firm that invests in real estate. The pending deal, which is expected to close early next year, was announced to tenants, employees and elected officials on Wednesday.Mr. Trump\u2019s share of the proceeds \u2014 after the partners pay off their mortgage, transfer taxes and other transaction costs \u2014 could be about $14 million, according to real estate executives familiar with the details who spoke anonymously because they have no authority to disclose them.Carol Deane, the managing partner for the sellers, Starrett City Associates, said that the sales agreement \u201cprovides stability for our residents, and guarantees their apartments will remain affordable for many years to come.\u201d Under previous agreements with the state and federal governments, the owner of Starrett City is locked into rent-regulated housing programs for at least another 22 years.Andrew MacArthur, the founder of Brooksville, said that he and Rockpoint were \u201ccommitted to preserving the original vision of the complex as stable, quality affordable housing.\u201dProviding affordable housing in a city where rents have climbed outside the reach of many has been a major focus of both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who have struggled to keep pace with the loss of units converted to market-rate rents.Everything about Starrett City is supersized. It sits on 145 acres between the East New York and Canarsie neighborhoods, with 5,881 apartments in 46 buildings and 15,000 residents, as well as its own power plant, schools, shopping center, houses of worship and ZIP code.All of the apartments are rent regulated for low, moderate- and middle-income tenants. In 2016, HUD provided the owners of Starrett City with nearly $80 million in rent subsidies and a tax break worth more than $16 million.Starrett City rose on the site of a landfill in the early 1970s and it was originally designed as a union-sponsored housing cooperative called Twin Pines Village.With rising costs and a weak economy, the unions asked Starrett Housing Corp., a private real estate company, to take over construction.Disque Deane, an irascible real estate investor who kept a stuffed white Alaskan timber wolf in his office, led the partnership that owned the complex.\u201cThey put together a group of investors, 200 if I recall, of the richest people in the country, including Trump\u2019s father,\u201d said Robert C. Rosenberg, a former city housing commissioner who later ran Starrett City for many years.President Trump\u2019s father, Fred, acquired as much as a 20 percent stake. His interest was later split among his children and several corporate entities.The investors collectively put in $22 million, or roughly 6 percent of the $382 million cost of building the project. The state housing agency provided $360 million in financing. The investors benefited from existing tax laws that allowed them to use losses at one project to shield profits from other investments from taxes.At the same time, the complex also participated in a variety of housing programs, including Section 8, under which tenants pay 30 percent of their income with the government subsidizing the rest of the rent. The government, in turn, set a 6 percent cap on profits.\u201cI generated so many tax losses for them that they did better than any other tax shelter in the history of America,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause of Section 8, I had enough money to keep the place in good shape.\u201dIn a 2007 interview, Donald J. Trump called Starrett City \u201cprobably the greatest tax shelter ever made.\u201dThe complex opened in 1974 in a city wracked by racial tension and fiscal and economic distress. Starrett promised the city that 70 percent of the tenants would be white and 30 percent minority and maintained separate waiting lists to ensure those goals.Advertisements for Starrett City at the time offered an \u201cinvitation to better living,\u201d with \u201camazingly low rentals\u201d \u2014 $275 for a two-bedroom with a balcony and a \u201cmagnificent $3,500,000 pleasure dome,\u201d or sports center.The Open Housing Center challenged the quotas in court in 1979, resulting in a settlement in 1984, but no major changes to the waiting lists. A subsequent lawsuit forced the creation of a single waiting list for all applicants.According to census data, almost half the residents today are black, a quarter are white, 21.8 percent are Hispanic and about 3 percent are Asian.The complex was renamed Spring Creek Towers several years ago but few residents call it that.At the height of the debt-fueled real estate boom in 2006, major real estate investors bought meat-and-potatoes housing that they had once ignored like Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village on the East Side of Manhattan and the Riverton Houses in Harlem.They often paid exorbitant prices with cheap money from Wall Street and invested little equity. Often the new owners\u2019 plan was to oust long-term, rent-regulated residents in favor of new tenants willing and able to pay higher rents. But many of the deals collapsed under the weight of enormous debts.In 2007, Starrett City Associates sought to sell the complex to a partnership led by David Bistricer, who owned thousands of units across the city, for $1.3 billion. The partnership planned to convert the complex to market rate housing.On Wednesday, elected officials, including RuthAnne Visnauskas, commissioner of New York State Homes and Community Renewal, largely took a wait-and-see approach to the sale, though Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said that he will be \u201cwatching like a hawk to make sure any new owner follows every iota\u201d of the 2009 agreement on affordability.But Assemblyman Charles Barron was dismayed. He said it was a \u201cgross miscarriage of economic justice\u201d that President Trump would profit from the sale. He was also concerned about the tenants. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do this without a full vetting by the tenants,\u201d Mr. Barron said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a battle on this one.\u201dBrooksville and its financial partner Rockpoint say they will not be under the same financial pressure as buyers were during the last boom because they are putting up more than half of the $850 million sale price in cash.Douglas Harmon of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate company, helped put the deal together for Starrett City Associates. A decade ago, he said the deals were \u201chigh wire acquisitions\u201d that were not sustainable investments.The deals today are very different, Mr. Harmon said. \u201cTheir purchase is fueled by low leverage and in this historic low interest rate environment they can be satisfied with boring, bond-like investment returns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gillibrand, has paid more than $1 million this year through her political committees to a top online fund-raising firm, which has helped her reap $2.3 million this year in small donations for a 2018 re-election race in which she is the heavy favorite. She has also continued courting major donors, holding two fund-raisers last month in the Hamptons. At one, she was asked by a donor whether she was considering running for president. She said she was focused on 2018, but did not explicitly rule out a White House run, according to an attendee.Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who maintains deep ties to some of the party\u2019s most generous donors, has spent $164,000 through his political committee on staff members and consultants this year, and $46,000 in recent months to hold fund-raisers and other events at a Washington steakhouse. The PAC, which rents office space in Washington, this year collected big checks from longtime backers of the Clintons, including $50,000 from Howard Kessler, a Boston financier, and $25,000 each from the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin and from Douglas J. Band, a former Clinton aide and fund-raiser. The PAC has also donated more than $315,000 to Democratic candidates and committees in Virginia this year.Mr. McAuliffe \u2014 who is barred by term limits from running in the Virginia governor\u2019s race this year \u2014 said during an appearance Sunday on CNN that he got asked \u201call the time\u201d whether he was running for president. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens down the road. But I have no intentions of running for president,\u201d he said, explaining that his focus was on finishing his governorship and helping the party\u2019s gubernatorial candidates in 2018.Aides to Ms. Gillibrand and those of other prospective candidates contacted for this article similarly insisted that their fund-raising had nothing to do with setting the stage for 2020.It is considered bad form to start running for president \u2014 or even to unofficially explore the possibility \u2014 before the preceding midterm election. That is partly because presidential campaigns can divert valuable funds away from important down-ballot races for which it is more difficult to raise money.There are also tactical advantages to waiting, including keeping open the possibility of remaining in Congress in states that bar members from seeking re-election while also running for another office. And campaign finance regulations limit the types and amounts of money that declared presidential candidates can raise, while politicians who have not declared for the presidency can continue accepting larger contributions to a range of political committees, including state-level committees like the one used by Mr. McAuliffe.Mr. Sanders is still at it, crisscrossing the country stumping for populist candidates and causes. A political organization founded by his former campaign aides has raised nearly $5.3 million in the past year from donations that average $22. And, even as he faces his own 2018 re-election race in Vermont, his backers are signaling that they will support another presidential run.Ms. Warren has built a formidable online fund-raising operation, which has brought in $5.1 million this year for her 2018 re-election campaign and allowed her political action committee to donate $270,000 to other Democrats. Yet she also has joined a parade of would-be Democratic presidential contenders who have paid visits to the wealthy summer enclaves that serve as A.T.M.s for the party\u2019s candidates.\u201cI think Elizabeth is laying the groundwork for a run. She won\u2019t admit it, but it looks like that,\u201d said Guy Saperstein, a San Francisco lawyer and part owner of the Oakland Athletics. Mr. Saperstein, who tried to coax Ms. Warren into the 2016 presidential race with an offer of a $1 million super PAC contribution, met with her in June in San Francisco.\u201cWhy would she be out in California if she wasn\u2019t interested in running for president?\u201d Mr. Saperstein said. \u201cI mean, she says she\u2019s raising money for her re-election, but she won\u2019t have any problems with that.\u201dSo far, only Representative John Delaney of Maryland has said he will be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, announcing that he will not run for re-election in order to wage a long-shot campaign. He said in an interview that he was willing to underwrite his campaign from a personal banking fortune estimated at $90 million, but that he was working to raise money from a mix of small and large donors.\u201cThe role of the big donor, if you will, is less than it used to be,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cAny candidate running for president in 2020 needs to have a comprehensive strategy for running a well-funded campaign.\u201d\u201cThere were people there who may have a view about her and 2020, but we hosted the fund-raiser because we have admired Kamala for years, and we applaud her efforts to support House and Senate Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Ms. Harris is not up for re-election until 2022. Her political committee has donated $130,000 this year to Democratic candidates and committees, and she has raised additional money for other Democrats. Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, said the senator\u2019s \u201csole priorities are fighting for Californians and electing and re-electing Democrats to the House and Senate.\u201dMr. Biden, who already has deep ties to major Democratic donors, has been reaching out through his staff to arrange one-on-one meetings with some of the top donors in the party, according to donors who have been invited to meet with him.Mr. Biden also met privately in May with leaders of nine new or emerging groups opposing Mr. Trump and Republicans on various fronts, and supporting Latino, African-American and millennial candidates and causes.\u201cHe is thinking about how he plays in this moment as a former vice president,\u201d said Quentin T. James, the founder of a group called the Collective PAC that supports African-American candidates, who was at the meeting. \u201cI do think he has a desire to get back out there politically. If that means 2020, I don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Add wealth to fuel that desire, and your collection is likely to grow. But then what do you do with it?If you can\u2019t bear the thought of a life\u2019s acquisitions being sold off \u2014 or, at best, going to a museum to be displayed only occasionally \u2014 the urge may be to open a museum of your own.In many ways, Mr. Halim\u2019s museum, which aspires to offer an encyclopedic display covering 300 years through 1,100 timepieces and 150 pieces of stained glass, is a family affair.\u201cWe hired an architect, but after the building was built, we met with so many experts and consultants that finally we used our own experience constructing the museum,\u201d Mr. Halim, 74, said. \u201cWe manage apartment buildings and have 5,000 units under our management. We believe if you can manage our business, you can do anything.\u201dThat kind of confidence motivates many contemporary collectors to preserve and promote their holdings in ways that wealthy businesspeople a generation ago did not.Private museums \u201caren\u2019t new, but they\u2019ve grown significantly in terms of the numbers in the last 10 years or so,\u201d said Mac MacLellan, president of the central region at Northern Trust Wealth Management. \u201cThe interest in creating a private museum has increased as interest in art overall has increased. It runs from the very small to the very large. It\u2019s not as narrow a topic as you might think.\u201dFirst things first: Let\u2019s look at the tax break that people get when creating museums and filling them with their collections. To earn a charitable deduction for donating a collection to a museum one has created, a founder must show that it is a true public institution.\u201cA tax-exempt private museum has a duty to provide a benefit to the public,\u201d Mr. MacLellan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just slap your name on it and open a museum and keep it for yourself. You need to provide some educational programming and access. You\u2019re under extreme scrutiny by the I.R.S. and the public.\u201dHe said the tax break was often offset by the costs associated with building and maintaining a museum.Mark Walhimer, a consultant on museum planning who also helps accredit institutions for the American Alliance of Museums, said entrepreneurs who had created their own fortunes sometimes had trouble making the mental leap involved in giving their collections to the public.\u201cIt\u2019s the community\u2019s collection,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough for some founders. \u2018What do you mean it\u2019s no longer mine? It\u2019s the public\u2019s?\u2019 You can put your name on the museum. You can get credit for it. But it belongs to the public.\u201dA museum, of course, requires a building. That building helps define the museum\u2019s personality, but it also has continuing costs.\u201cA collector may say, \u2018I want this material to be seen in perpetuity,\u2019 but they don\u2019t realize that the type of expenses that are involved are significantly more than where they\u2019re holding the works now,\u201d said Gail Lord, a founder of Lord Cultural Resources, a cultural planning firm.\u201cThere are occupancy costs, which include heating, lighting, cooling and security, and insurance is a very significant cost,\u201d said Ms. Lord, who is also the firm\u2019s president. \u201c\u2018Open to the public\u2019 means there has to be a staff of some type who is going to be opening the doors and charging or not charging admission. You also need someone to provide information to fulfill the educational requirement.\u201dMr. Bidwell, 65, said the initial cost in 2013 was $2.5 million to $3 million \u2014 not including what the couple paid for the artwork \u2014 and that annual expenses were about $250,000. He said he knew that running the building and managing the museum and its exhibitions would be challenging, so he struck a deal with the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he is a trustee. The Bidwells makes their exhibition space available to the museum for half of the year.\u201cWe were a little na\u00efve about how much work this would be,\u201d Mr. Bidwell said. \u201cWhen we lend our galleries to the Cleveland Museum of Art, we challenge them to do exhibitions that are more daring than they normally would.\u201dSome experts said that acquiring and maintaining a building, however costly, was the easy part. Engaging effectively with the public, on the other hand, can be challenging.\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with many museums that have failed or are failing,\u201d Mr. Walhimer said. \u201cMost of it happens when there isn\u2019t community buy-in. It makes it difficult to fund-raise, to attract members, to promote exhibits.\u201dAnother consideration is what becomes of a museum after its founder dies.Mr. Bidwell said that in the case of Transformer Station, the building and the art would go to the Cleveland Museum of Art after 15 years.\u201cIn 10 years or so, we can walk away and relax a little bit, and it will go on as a lasting institution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did this because we\u2019re activist collectors and we like to work with artists, but we\u2019re not immortal.\u201dMr. Halim is taking a different approach. He believes that his three children and their spouses will remain involved the museum he has established. And he is trying to ensure that they will have the means to do so.He would not say how much he had spent on the building or provide a value for his collection, but he said he had given thought a lot about how the museum might sustain itself.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the museum is going to be self-supporting selling $17 tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe built a banquet hall for weddings, parties and business events to subsidize it. We hope the museum will break even.\u201dSome advisers said that most would-be museum founders might be better off considering the difficulty of supporting something so personal for a long time.Although the museum has a board of trustees, Mr. Lizzadro said he worried about his grandchildren\u2019s generation getting involved.\u201cFinding someone in the family who is really interested in what we\u2019ve been doing for 55 years \u2014 that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was no family involvement in it, I\u2019m not sure what would happen.\u201dOne possibility he has considered involves the foundation that controls the museum selling the collection and using the proceeds to finance other charitable endeavors. That might seem like a practical solution, but Mr. Walhimer, the consultant, said that selling a museum collection to finance other initiatives \u2014 or even to pay the operating costs of the museum itself \u2014 would violate the code of ethics that museums agree to in order to remain accredited.\u201cThe future is worrisome to me,\u201d Mr. Lizzadro said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching this thing too long. I don\u2019t want it to fall apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Embrace Plan for $1.5 Trillion Tax Cut", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, abandoning a key fiscal doctrine, agreed on Tuesday to move forward on a budget that would add to the federal deficit in order to pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years.The Republican lawmakers, under mounting pressure to score a legislative win on taxes, say a tax cut of this magnitude will stimulate economic growth enough to offset any deficit impact.Yet critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who considers himself a strict deficit hawk, said he remains deeply concerned about enacting tax cuts that add to the deficit. But he suggested that Republicans may not solely rely on traditional estimates of a bill\u2019s costs. Republicans have recently voiced concern that some estimates, including those from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, undervalue the effect of economic growth.In announcing the agreement, Mr. Corker insisted that he was not casting away his concern about the debt.\u201cMy support will be contingent on a final package that generates significant economic growth and does not worsen, but hopefully improves our fiscal situation,\u201d Mr. Corker said of the tax plan.An agreement on the size of the tax cuts between Mr. Corker and Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who has pushed for deeper tax cuts, helped seal the deal.Passing a budget resolution is a crucial step for unlocking an arcane procedural tool that would allow Republicans to push a tax overhaul through the Senate with a simple majority and without the support of Democrats. Republicans have said they want a bill passed by the end of the year.Even with Tuesday\u2019s deal, there is still a tough road ahead. The full Senate would need to vote on the budget and it would then need to align with the House version, which was voted out of committee earlier this year.That may prove a tricky task, since House lawmakers may be more reluctant to enact tax cuts that would add to the deficit.Still, any tax cut may wind up being temporary. Under existing Senate rules, Republicans can pass legislation with a simple majority only if the bill is not found to add to the deficit after a period of 10 years. That means all \u2014 or part \u2014 of the tax legislation could expire after a decade if official estimates of the costs do not align with Republicans\u2019 optimistic economic growth projections.Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee have been wrestling for weeks over how big a tax cut is feasible and have been under pressure to reach a budget deal this month so that the work on tax legislation can officially begin in October. Still, while the Republicans may coalesce around a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the details of the actual plan remain fraught with lawmakers divided on some key issues such as the corporate tax rate and which, if any, deductions will be eliminated or scaled back.Some details of the plan are expected to be released next week when the \u201cBix Six\u201d working group of Republican congressional leaders and the White House economic team outline their policy framework.President Trump said this month that the wealthiest Americans might end up paying a bit more in order to lower tax bills for the middle class. A White House official said on Tuesday that while the rich would not see a benefit from the tax plan no final decisions on top rates had been reached.Republicans have been wary of sharing too many details given the intense lobbying crush that is expected once it becomes clear which industries stand to win or lose valuable provisions currently ingrained in the tax code. Those include things like the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable donations.Financing tax cuts through deficit spending essentially means the government will borrow money to pay for tax reductions, rather than finding spending cuts to make up for the lost revenue.Such a move would add to an already-hefty debt load that is only expected to grow as an aging population drives additional spending on retirement and health programs. The C.B.O. estimates that within 10 years, the federal debt will rise to its highest percentage of gross domestic product since just after World War II.Republican lawmakers, who for years have complained about the country\u2019s deteriorating fiscal situation, are now turning to arcane budget arguments and making the case that tax cuts will unleash enough economic growth to compensate for lost revenue.\u201cJust going from 2 to 3 percent growth adds about $14 trillion of economic activity over a decade, $2 to $3 trillion of revenue to the federal government,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the Budget Committee.Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he continues to worry about the deficit. But he supports a budget that provides maximum flexibility to produce a tax overhaul that will move America forward.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in need of something that will stimulate the economy,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Whether a big tax cut can stimulate an economy already saddled with debt is at best uncertain and many experts think it will actually stifle growth.At a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, warned that deficit financed tax cuts could prove to be a drag on the economy.\u201cYou should always think of these tax reform proposals as a race between the effects of the tax changes and the effect on the budget,\u201d Mr. Marron said. \u201cThere is a cost to deficit financing.\u201dAnti-deficit groups say they plan to remind Republicans who railed against deficits during the Obama administration of their past criticisms.\u201cThe president and members of Congress have spent years warning of our large and growing national debt and have said their goal was to pursue tax reform that doesn\u2019t make that debt worse,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIt is extremely disheartening that the Senate budget may be abandoning that commitment.\u201dThe tax cuts, she added, \u201ccould result in debt as large as the economy in just over a decade and take us into uncharted waters after that.\u201dMichael A. Peterson, president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said that the national debt topping $20 trillion should not be an invitation for Republicans in Congress to exacerbate a problem that they were elected to fix.\u201cIrresponsible tax reform is counterproductive and anti-growth because increasing the national debt hurts the economy. Tax reform should grow the economy, not the debt,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cThis proposal fails the test of fiscally responsible tax reform.\u201dWary of any tax legislation that benefits the rich, Democrats have taken a firm stance against Republican policies that would add to the deficit and said they will not support a bill that does not pay for itself.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee, warned against a proposal that would provide a \u201csugar hit\u201d of economic growth and a painful hangover in the coming years.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, referring to previous Republican tax cuts. \u201cIt is a prescription for more trouble in the American economy in the long term.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018It Was a Frat House\u2019: Inside the Sex Scandal That Toppled SoFi\u2019s C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For months, the text messages came. Some were flirtatious, asking her to meet him late at night. Sometimes, the texts were sexually explicit.The messages were directed at Laura Munoz, an executive assistant at the online lending start-up Social Finance. The texts were from her boss, Mike Cagney, the company\u2019s chief executive, according to five people who spoke with Ms. Munoz or saw the messages. Given Mr. Cagney\u2019s stature at Social Finance, known as SoFi, Ms. Munoz was at a disadvantage.That became apparent when SoFi\u2019s board was informed of Mr. Cagney\u2019s communications with Ms. Munoz in late 2012. The board said it found no evidence of a sexual relationship. Ms. Munoz was then paid about $75,000 to leave the company, according to three people familiar with the proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. Ivo Labar, a lawyer representing Ms. Munoz, said matters were resolved between his client and SoFi.Around the same time, SoFi\u2019s board and executives also heard complaints from investors that Mr. Cagney had made misstatements to them over the start-up\u2019s student loan products, according to emails between investors, executives and the board that were obtained by The New York Times. Directors stood by Mr. Cagney in that instance, too.The board\u2019s support allowed Mr. Cagney to build SoFi into a fast-growing start-up that is trying to take on the big banks by offering lending, insurance and asset management online. The company has been valued at more than $4 billion.But within SoFi, Mr. Cagney, a married father of two, continued to raise questions among employees with his behavior. He was seen holding hands and having intimate conversations with another young female employee, according to six employees who saw the two together. At late-night, wine-soaked gatherings with colleagues, he bragged about his sexual conquests and the size of his genitalia, said employees who heard the comments.The company said its business was performing well, and that SoFi was becoming a \u201cmajor, innovative player in consumer finance.\u201d A SoFi spokesman said the company did not comment on personnel matters and disputed that its business had taken on too much risk. Through the spokesman, Mr. Cagney also said he \u201cvehemently denies\u201d any improprieties at after-hours events with colleagues.Yet Mr. Cagney\u2019s position had become increasingly delicate after the filing of the sexual harassment suit, which accused him of \u201cempowering other managers to engage in sexual conduct in the workplace.\u201dHis situation was also exacerbated by claims about his approach to SoFi\u2019s business, which uses money from Wall Street investors to fund student loans, personal loans and mortgages. At several points, Mr. Cagney ignored warnings from colleagues that he was being too aggressive with the business, according to more than a dozen employees who were involved in the conversations.That included a time when Mr. Cagney decided to put customer service representatives in charge of lending determinations, despite them having no experience in the area. Another time, he told investors that SoFi had $90 million in debt financing for a loan product; the company did not in fact have the money, according to the internal emails reviewed by The Times.SoFi\u2019s board, which includes representatives of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and the influential hedge fund Third Point Capital, now faces questions about whether it needed more checks and balances on Mr. Cagney.Companies like SoFi show how boards are incentivized to prioritize cash flow and growth over governance, said David F. Larcker, a professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business who specializes in corporate governance. \u201cThe board now has a duty to correct for things that have gone wrong,\u201d he said.The board said that it found \u201cno allegation or evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship\u201d between Mr. Cagney and Ms. Munoz and referred all other questions to SoFi.Mr. Cagney, who was born in New Jersey, started his career in finance in 1994 at Wells Fargo, where he climbed the ranks to the trading desk. He later left the giant bank to begin a financial software company, and then his own hedge fund, Cabezon, in 2005. On the side, he attended Stanford\u2019s business school.In 2011, Mr. Cagney began SoFi with several co-founders. The start-up, established as venture capitalists were getting excited about financial technology, raised nearly $100 million in its first year. In total, SoFi has now taken in $1.9 billion from investors including SoftBank, Discovery Capital and Baseline Ventures.Even with other co-founders, Mr. Cagney quickly established himself as the company\u2019s center of gravity. SoFi\u2019s offices, with glassed-in conference rooms and cheap Ikea furniture, were set up in San Francisco\u2019s Presidio, the park near the Golden Gate Bridge, because Mr. Cagney\u2019s hedge fund already had its offices there. His home was less than a mile away.Mr. Cagney exhibited an aggressive attitude at the office that he may have learned as a trader at Wells Fargo. He sometimes shouted obscenities and excoriated employees in front of others when they made mistakes.Mr. Cagney hired deputies who had similar characteristics. One was Nino Fanlo, a former executive at Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who became SoFi\u2019s chief financial officer in 2012.Mr. Fanlo, 57, sometimes kicked trash cans in the office when angry. He also commented on women\u2019s figures, including their breasts; said that women would be happier as homemakers; and once told two female employees he would give them $5,000 if they lost 30 pounds by the end of the year, according to more than a dozen people who heard the comments and witnessed the weight-loss offer.Mr. Fanlo said it was \u201cpatently false\u201d that he did not respect women and that his team at SoFi had many women who received promotions and professional accolades. He also attributed his shouting and kicking of trash cans to frustration about deals and start-up pressures.\u201cYou\u2019re under extraordinary pressures at a company that is growing that fast,\u201d Mr. Fanlo said.More than two dozen former SoFi employees said they were uncomfortable with Mr. Cagney\u2019s pursuit of women in the office. In 2012, he sent the text messages to Ms. Munoz, the executive assistant, until her colleagues took the issue up with executives and the board, according to the five people who spoke with Ms. Munoz about the matter.Even as Mr. Cagney was texting Ms. Munoz, he also chased another young female employee. Six employees said they saw Mr. Cagney and the employee holding hands and talking intimately. One day in 2013, when Mr. Cagney was flirting with her at the office in front of colleagues, she grew enraged and left, according to three employees who witnessed the episode. Soon after, she left the company.Around that time, SoFi\u2019s board asked Mr. Cagney to not engage in inappropriate conduct with employees, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations. The situations were awkward in the office given that Mr. Cagney\u2019s wife, June Ou, began working at SoFi in 2012, rising to become the company\u2019s chief technical officer. Her desk was near Mr. Cagney\u2019s. Ms. Ou did not respond to a request for comment.SoFi\u2019s business works in the following way: It loans money to students, home buyers and individuals with high credit scores. The company funds those loans with money from hedge funds and banks, who buy the loans through securities or bonds that SoFi creates.As early as 2012, Mr. Cagney ran into trouble with some of his investors. That year, the company said it had secured $90 million in debt financing for one of its loan products, called Refi A. But some investors who had bought the securities noticed their returns were not in keeping with SoFi\u2019s estimates and voiced concerns to executives and to a board member, according to the emails obtained by The Times.About 10 SoFi executives met to discuss the situation; it was then that some of them learned Mr. Cagney had not actually secured the $90 million for the loan product, according to people who were at the meeting. Some attendees said they were dismayed at the possibility that they had made material misstatements to investors.In October 2012, SoFi bought back the Refi A securities from investors for what they had paid, plus the investment return they had anticipated, or gave them the option to put their money into a different product. Mr. Cagney said in an investor letter that the product had been \u201cimperfect,\u201d but did not offer any details about the $90 million. The SoFi spokesman said that \u201cno consumers were harmed in the process.\u201dIn 2015, SoFi began offering mortgages. In meetings with the compliance officer overseeing the program, Mr. Cagney was told that SoFi was not doing enough to document the income of borrowers and was rushing to offer loans more quickly than competitors did, according to a person involved in the mortgage business. A SoFi spokesman said the company complied with all laws.Mr. Cagney also led a push into personal loans last year. To strengthen that business, he asked customer service representatives to review and approve loans, a job that had previously been done by the company\u2019s underwriters, said two people involved in the loan business. Many employees opposed the change because customer service representatives do not have the experience of approving loans, but the move helped SoFi double the amount of loans it issued in just a few months.That created another problem: SoFi did not have enough money to fund all the loans it was giving out. Mr. Cagney told employees that because of the funding shortfall, it could take as long as 30 days for some new customers to get the money they borrowed. But the employees who dealt with the customers were told by a supervisor to say that people would still get the money within 72 hours as promised.\u201cWe had to lie to them and tell them that we were a little behind or that the transfer got lost \u2014 just something to keep them off our backs,\u201d said Marie Lombard, who worked from 2014 to 2016 at SoFi\u2019s operations center in Healdsburg.Mr. Cagney eventually took customer service representatives off the underwriting decisions.A SoFi spokesman said that customer service representatives did not approve loans and that the company\u2019s proprietary software made those decisions. He added that SoFi always communicated timing changes on its loans to borrowers and that delays have never run as high as 30 days.Mr. Cagney\u2019s risk-taking outside of SoFi also created problems. In January 2015, his hedge fund, Cabezon, suffered big losses on a currency trade. In the aftermath, SoFi\u2019s board agreed to buy Cabezon for $3.25 million and give the hedge fund\u2019s employees jobs at SoFi. That caused resentment at SoFi among some workers.A SoFi spokesman said the company bought Mr. Cagney\u2019s hedge fund partly because the board was concerned about Mr. Cagney\u2019s ability to focus on both companies.At the time, SoFi was growing rapidly. Since 2011, when it had five people in a one-room office, the company has grown to 1,200 employees and lent more than $20 billion to about 350,000 customers. Earlier this year, the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners led a new round of fund-raising that gave SoFi another $500 million and valued the company at $4.3 billion.Mr. Cagney\u2019s co-founders nonetheless left the company one by one, and Mr. Fanlo departed this summer. (Mr. Fanlo said that he left to pursue a new opportunity.)In 2015, an anonymous email was sent to everyone in the company, complaining in detail about the work environment and nepotism in hiring, according to five employees who received the email. SoFi said that it takes every complaint seriously.At the start-up\u2019s office in Healdsburg, Yulia Zamora, who worked as an underwriter there from 2015 to 2016, said it often seemed as if there were no rules. She said she was propositioned by a supervisor numerous times.\u201cIt was a frat house,\u201d Ms. Zamora said. \u201cYou would find people having sex in their cars and in the parking lot. It was a free-for-all.\u201d\u2019In recent days, Mr. Cagney canceled a trip to Singapore to attend a board meeting at SoFi\u2019s offices in San Francisco on Monday. At the meeting, Mr. Cagney argued for his job \u2014 but eventually lost out to board members who viewed him as a liability, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting.Advertisement"}

Condemnations have been swift and direct.\u201cOn top of all of the domestic violence, and corruption and legal issues, he was a terrible Council member,\u201d said Christine C. Quinn, the former Council speaker who served with Mr. Monserrate. \u201cHim coming back, it\u2019s just arrogance on a scale that rivals President Trump.\u201dThe seat became vacant over the summer with the unexpected announcement by its current holder, Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, that she would not seek re-election. The news surprised political observers who had considered Ms. Ferreras-Copeland a leading candidate to be the next Council speaker, and gave Mr. Monserrate, who had already been running to challenge her in the Democratic primary, elbow room to push his campaign.Mr. Moya has received endorsements from powerful Democrats including Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Ferreras-Copeland and labor groups, and has amassed more money in campaign contributions. He has been campaigning from morning to night in recent days, at subway stops and door-to-door.But Mr. Monserrate, 50, has raised more than twice as many donations from people living in the district: 285 to 110, according to data from the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board. And Mr. Monserrate recently received $87,000 in public matching funds to fuel the final days of his campaign.The margins are likely to be small in the largely Hispanic district that stretches from East Elmhurst and La Guardia Airport in the north to LeFrak City, the sprawling apartment complex along 57th Avenue. Only a few thousand votes are cast in a Council primary. And Mr. Monserrate benefits from name recognition and some longstanding relationships in the community.\u201cThey support him because they know him,\u201d lamented Andre Maloy, 55, a lifelong East Elmhurst resident and campaign volunteer for Mr. Moya. He said he voted for Mr. Monserrate in the past, but resented his return. \u201cIf you steal from me once, I\u2019m not going to give you the keys to my house.\u201dMr. Monserrate has sought to muddy the waters by falsely accusing Mr. Moya of living in a condominium in Long Island City, outside the district. (Mr. Moya lives in Corona with his aging parents, helping to care for them; his father has Parkinson\u2019s disease.) During a raucous debate on Wednesday, Mr. Monserrate accused Mr. Moya, without evidence, of criminal activity.\u201cOh Hiram,\u201d Mr. Moya said at one point, turning to the moderator. \u201cIf jail can\u2019t make this man tell the truth, I certainly can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cA storm is brewing,\u201d Mr. Monserrate, sporting a close-cropped Caesar haircut, warned.\u201cNo storm is brewing,\u201d Mr. Moya replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat you in LeFrak, I\u2019m going to beat you in East Elmhurst, I\u2019m going to beat you in Corona, I\u2019m going to beat you like I did in 2010.\u201dMr. Moya, in an interview, said that he wanted to address the issues facing the area, including high property taxes, a lack of parking, construction worker safety, and the future of Willets Point, a scrapyard area near Citi Field that has been long scheduled for development.Mr. Moya, a boxing and soccer enthusiast, beamed as he talked about the Spanish soccer star David Villa, who recorded a robocall in Spanish for his campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s like if Derek Jeter were calling to baseball fans,\u201d Mr. Moya said.Mr. Monserrate declined to be interviewed or photographed for this article.But to his supporters, Mr. Monserrate deserves another chance.Ms. Lewis also believes that a polling place, long present at LeFrak City, was moved for this primary as a way of suppressing the vote for Mr. Monserrate in an area where he has support among black residents. The city\u2019s Board of Election declined to comment, citing a pending lawsuit filed by Ms. Lewis\u2019s group and residents.Near LeFrak City, Miguel Rodriguez, a 26-year-old Uber driver, looked at a Monserrate flier hanging outside a Columbian bakery.\u201cI heard about Moya; there\u2019s lots of Latinos supporting him,\u201d he said, adding that he had not yet made up his mind about Mr. Monserrate. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at it and see.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated what Hiram Monserrate was convicted for in 2009.

{"Headline": "In Geneva, \u2018Dirty Money\u2019 of Another Kind \u2014 Flushed Down the Toilet", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFlushing money down the toilet is usually only a metaphor, reserved for spendthrifts or those casual with their cash. But not in Geneva.Prosecutors in the Swiss city are investigating the attempted disposal of around 100,000 euros, or about $120,000, at a bank branch and restaurants nearby. The \u20ac500 bills had been cut up and flushed, but they clogged pipes and were eventually discovered in a trash can and inside the toilets.The public prosecutor\u2019s office in Geneva said that the money appeared to have been disposed of by two Spanish citizens, whom it declined to identify, and that unless there was evidence that the cash had been obtained illegally or was destined for criminal activity, no charges could be brought.\u201cThe fact that you put the money into toilets is weird, but not criminal,\u201d said Vincent Derouand, a spokesman for the public prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201cThe only thing you have to check is if it\u2019s of legal provenance or not,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had yet to find evidence of links to criminality.According to investigators, the money was found in four locations in May and June: in a toilet at the Rue de la Corraterie branch of the Swiss bank UBS, and in the bathrooms of three restaurants on Place du Molard, a square in the heart of the city\u2019s historic center.The area is filled with restaurants and bistros, traditional chocolate shops and international clothing stores. Around the corner is one of the city\u2019s most famous attractions, the Horloge Fleurie, a giant clock made of colorful flowers.At the Caf\u00e9 du Centre, a restaurant on Place du Molard, cleaners found several \u20ac500 notes in the toilet and in a trash can, according to Blaise Gumi, the restaurant manager. Mr. Gumi said that several thousand euros had been found, but that he did not know the precise amount. He declined to comment further.Though Switzerland has its own currency \u2014 the franc \u2014 many businesses, shops and restaurants accept euros (usually returning change in francs). Finding wads of cash in toilets is not a common occurrence, however, and the story drew attention in the national news media.UBS, whose Rue de la Corraterie branch is a short walk away, on the edge of a quiet area known as the \u201cQuartier des Banques,\u201d or neighborhood of banks, declined to comment.The Geneva police said the investigation was focused on damage to the toilets of the restaurants where the money had been found. The prosecutor\u2019s office said a lawyer for the two Spanish suspects had paid for damage to the restaurants\u2019 plumbing, but added it could not provide further information because it was a private arrangement.The lawyer could not immediately be contacted, and the restaurants declined to comment on the damage.The disposal of the large sum of cash came around a year after the European Central Bank said it would phase out the \u20ac500 in a bid to curb money laundering and combat financing of terrorist acts. The bill will no longer be printed, and, from the end of 2018, central banks in the 19 nations of the eurozone will no longer replace \u20ac500 notes that are returned.Hannah Olivennes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Older Americans Stand to Lose if \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Are Deported", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move, Mr. Sheik said, would compound an already \u201cdisastrous situation in terms of shortages of supply.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is a big issue we\u2019re focusing on.\u201dIn health care, on the other hand, the economic impact could be significant, depriving patients of help they depend on and driving up costs for families and taxpayers.Surveys of DACA beneficiaries reveal that roughly one-fifth of them work in the health care and educational sector, suggesting a potential loss of tens of thousands of workers from in-demand job categories like home health aide and nursing assistant.At the same time, projections by the government and advocacy groups show that the economy will need to add hundreds of thousands of workers in these fields over the next five to 10 years simply to keep up with escalating demand, caused primarily by a rapidly aging population.Josue De Luna Navarro, a DACA beneficiary, came to the United States from Mexico when he was 9 years old. He became interested in a career in health care after his father nearly died from complications relating to heart disease.Now a 21-year-old senior at the University of New Mexico, Mr. Navarro works as a health assistant at a clinic in Albuquerque and plans to apply to medical school after he graduates.He worries that if DACA is revoked, he will not be able to work at all. \u201cWithout that work permit, my career in medicine will be very, very difficult,\u201d he said.Under the Obama-era program, recipients had to apply to renew their status every two years. The Trump administration said on Tuesday that some beneficiaries would be able to renew their status up until Oct. 5. Others could face deportation beginning in March, unless Congress intervenes beforehand.Experts say the effects of undoing the program could quickly ripple out from DACA beneficiaries to other workers.\u201cIt destabilizes that work force,\u201d said Robert Espinoza, vice president for policy at PHI, a group that advocates on behalf of personal care workers. \u201cIf you are seeing family members, children, neighbors being deported, threatened, and so on, the ability to be present on the job is undermined.\u201dThe health care field\u2019s reliance on immigrant labor makes it particularly vulnerable. According to census data Mr. Osterman analyzed, more than one-quarter of home health aides in 2015 were immigrants. The proportion in certain states is far higher, reaching nearly one-half in California and nearly two-thirds in New York.\u201cWe know from surveys that T.P.S. recipients are highly represented in the work force in certain areas,\u201d said Tom Jawetz, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank that favors more liberal immigration policies. \u201cIn particular, many \u2014 especially Haitians \u2014 work in home health care.\u201dThis may be welcome on some level: The department estimates that the typical home health aide made less than $25,000 in 2016, for a job that can be physically and emotionally grueling.The economic problem is twofold, however. First, the government, through Medicaid, often pays the salaries of home health workers, meaning that escalating wages could blow a hole in the federal budget. (Medicaid, through the decisions of the state and federal governments, effectively caps compensation for home health workers, but the caps could rise more quickly in a world of plunging labor supply.)Second, an acute shortage of home health workers could force many older and disabled Americans out of their homes and into care facilities, where costs are roughly two-to-three times the cost of home care for a full year. The government typically picks up that tab as well.Still, it is the personal toll that may be greatest: A patient\u2019s quality of life tends to be far higher when they can continue living in their own home.For patients and families who rely on immigrant workers, \u201cif that person is gone, can\u2019t get renewed, it\u2019s not a cute thing,\u201d Professor Osterman said. \u201cA home health aide is what lets you stay at home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalonia Showdown Tests Spanish Leader\u2019s Instinct for Survival", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is the great survivor of Spanish politics. He has withstood electoral defeats, a banking bailout and party corruption scandals, not by demonstrating political boldness but rather by being cautious and often waiting for others to fail.\u201cRajoy has always shown the phlegmatic approach of a clever administrator rather than the vision of a great political leader,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher. \u201cBut I think he is now going to pay a high price for his inactivity and unwillingness to take charge of this issue and for believing instead that Catalonia was a problem that would somehow die on its own.\u201dAlmost immediately, roughly 40,000 people poured into the streets in protest. Catalan leaders suggested that Mr. Rajoy was taking the country back to the dark days of Franco and fascism.\u201cThe Spanish government has overstepped the red line that separated it from authoritarian and repressive regimes,\u201d said Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, after the arrests on Wednesday.Those detained were eventually released, but they are expected to be charged with civil disobedience and the misuse of public funds to organize an illegal vote. On Friday, the Spanish government announced that it would send more police officers to Catalonia to maintain order and block a referendum; additional officers are being billeted in ferries off the Catalan coast. And over the weekend, Madrid announced that it would centralize the command of all police operations in Catalonia, including the region\u2019s autonomous police force.There is disagreement over who is responsible for the escalation of the conflict. But there is a growing consensus in Madrid that Mr. Rajoy missed opportunities to negotiate with Catalonia\u2019s leaders and also to take advantage of the political divisions within the autonomous region. Instead, his critics said, he stonewalled the Catalans, who were initially more focused on issues of money than of sovereignty.Mr. Rajoy has years of experience in negotiating with Catalans. In 1996, he was among the leaders of the conservative Popular Party who traveled to Barcelona to strike an agreement with their Catalan counterparts to allow Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar to become prime minister of Spain.In his autobiography, Mr. Rajoy said the Catalan deal opened \u201cone of the most brilliant periods in the recent history of contemporary Spain.\u201dBut in 2012, in the midst of Spain\u2019s banking crisis, Mr. Rajoy rejected a request from Catalonia\u2019s regional government to negotiate better fiscal terms for a region that accounts for almost a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy. The leadership of the main conservative party of Catalonia then joined the drive to split from Spain.Five years later, Catalan leaders are saying that they are no longer interested in tax concessions but want to manage their own state. The separatists hold most of the seats in their regional parliament (without having won a majority of votes). Opinion polls show support for independence waning, but a majority in favor of voting over Catalonia\u2019s future.\u201cRajoy\u2019s focus has always been on keeping the loyalty of his own electorate, based on the rule of law but now also with the use of more force in Catalonia,\u201d said Jaime Pastor, a Madrid-based professor of politics at UNED, a distance-learning university. \u201cThat can perhaps help keep him in power in the short term, but it can only deepen the territorial fracture of Spain.\u201dIndeed, Spain\u2019s main opposition Socialist party, which had backed Mr. Rajoy\u2019s stance toward Catalonia, now appears less certain in its support.On Tuesday, Margarita Robles, the party\u2019s parliamentary spokeswoman, criticized Mr. Rajoy for relying on purely legal rather than political tools to confront the separatists. She asked him to clarify exactly what emergency steps the government was willing to apply in Catalonia.\u201cThe Socialists are caught between wanting to be seen as a solution for Catalonia and wanting to use this conflict as the opportunity to remove Rajoy,\u201d Mr. Ramoneda, the columnist, said.Analysts say Mr. Rajoy had no choice but to toughen his stance. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Rajoy or someone else in charge, nobody can allow separatists to dynamite the rule of law,\u201d said C\u00e9sar D\u00edaz-Carrera, a politics professor at the Complutense university in Madrid.In 2014, however, Catalonia\u2019s vote was nonbinding, and Mr. Rajoy held a parliamentary majority, which meant his political survival was not on the line.Even as Mr. Rajoy faces criticism from the Socialists, he is under pressure from hard-liners within his own Popular Party, who want him to activate emergency powers to take full administrative control over Catalonia, rather than use piecemeal steps to stop Catalans from financing and organizing their referendum.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s administration is also reliant on the support of lawmakers from Ciudadanos, a party that was initially started in Catalonia in opposition to the separatist movement.While Mr. Rajoy might have squandered previous opportunities to negotiate an end to the Catalan conflict, he is now at least giving a \u201cmeasured response\u201d to separatists who are willing to violate Spanish law, according to Luis Garicano, a leading member of Ciudadanos.\u201cI don\u2019t think any state in Europe or the United States would accept somebody preparing a unilateral declaration of independence without reacting against that,\u201d Mr. Garicano said. \u201cHe is at least keeping the demons of nationalism under control, while the Catalan separatists are unleashing forces that they cannot control.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Constitution Wasn\u2019t Built for This", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionExactly 230 years ago, on Sept. 17, 1787, a group of men in Philadelphia concluded a summer of sophisticated, impassioned debates about the fate of their fledgling nation. The document that emerged, our Constitution, is often thought of as part of an aristocratic counterrevolution that stands in contrast to the democratic revolution of 1776. But our Constitution has at least one radical feature: It isn\u2019t designed for a society with economic inequality.There are other things the Constitution wasn\u2019t written for, of course. The founders didn\u2019t foresee America becoming a global superpower. They didn\u2019t plan for the internet or nuclear weapons. And they certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined a former reality television star president. Commentators wring their hands over all of these transformations \u2014 though these days, they tend to focus on whether this country\u2019s founding document can survive the current president.But there is a different, and far more stubborn, risk that our country faces \u2014 and which, arguably, led to the TV star turned president in the first place. Our Constitution was not built for a country with so much wealth concentrated at the very top nor for the threats that invariably accompany it: oligarchs and populist demagogues.From the ancient Greeks to the American founders, statesmen and political philosophers were obsessed with the problem of economic inequality. Unequal societies were subject to constant strife \u2014 even revolution. The rich would tyrannize the poor, and the poor would revolt against the rich.The solution was to build economic class right into the structure of government. In England, for example, the structure of government balanced lords and commoners. In ancient Rome, there was the patrician Senate for the wealthy, and the Tribune of the Plebeians for everyone else. We can think of these as class-warfare constitutions: Each class has a share in governing, and a check on the other. Those checks prevent oligarchy on the one hand and a tyranny founded on populist demagogy on the other.What is surprising about the design of our Constitution is that it isn\u2019t a class warfare constitution. Our Constitution doesn\u2019t mandate that only the wealthy can become senators, and we don\u2019t have a tribune of the plebs. Our founding charter doesn\u2019t have structural checks and balances between economic classes: not between rich and poor, and certainly not between corporate interests and ordinary workers. This was a radical change in the history of constitutional government.At the time, many Americans believed the new nation would not be afflicted by the problems that accompanied economic inequality because there simply wasn\u2019t much inequality within the political community of white men. Today we tend to emphasize how undemocratic the founding era was when judged by our values \u2014 its exclusion of women, enslavement of African-Americans, violence against Native Americans. But in doing so, we risk missing something important: Many in the founding generation believed America was exceptional because of the extraordinary degree of economic equality within the political community as they defined it.Unlike Europe, America wasn\u2019t bogged down by the legacy of feudalism, nor did it have a hereditary aristocracy. Noah Webster, best known for his dictionary, commented that there were \u201csmall inequalities of property,\u201d a fact that distinguished America from Europe and the rest of the world. Equality of property, he believed, was crucial for sustaining a republic. During the Constitutional Convention, South Carolinan Charles Pinckney said America had \u201ca greater equality than is to be found among the people of any other country.\u201d As long as the new nation could expand west, he thought, it would be possible to have a citizenry of independent yeoman farmers. In a community with economic equality, there was simply no need for constitutional structures to manage the clash between the wealthy and everyone else.The problem, of course, is that economic inequality has been on the rise for at least the last generation. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of Americans took home about 8.5 percent of our national income. Today they take home more than 20 percent. In major sectors of the economy \u2014 banking, airlines, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications \u2014 economic power is increasingly concentrated in a small number of companies.While much of the debate has been on the moral or economic consequences of economic inequality, the more fundamental problem is that our constitutional system might not survive in an unequal economy. Campaign contributions, lobbying, the revolving door of industry insiders working in government, interest group influence over regulators and even think tanks \u2014 all of these features of our current political system skew policy making to favor the wealthy and entrenched economic interests. \u201cThe rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest,\u201d Gouverneur Morris observed in 1787. \u201cThey always did. They always will.\u201d An oligarchy \u2014 not a republic \u2014 is the inevitable result.As a republic descends into an oligarchy, the people revolt. Populist revolts are rarely anarchic; they require leadership. Morris predicted that the rich would take advantage of the people\u2019s \u201cpassions\u201d and \u201cmake these the instruments for oppressing them.\u201d The future Broadway sensation Alexander Hamilton put it more clearly: \u201cOf those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people: commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\u201dStarting more than a century ago, amid the first Gilded Age, Americans confronted rising inequality, rapid industrial change, a communications and transportation revolution and the emergence of monopolies. Populists and progressives responded by pushing for reforms that would tame the great concentrations of wealth and power that were corrupting government.On the economic side, they invented antitrust laws and public utilities regulation, established an income tax, and fought for minimum wages. On the political side, they passed campaign finance regulations and amended the Constitution so the people would get to elect senators directly. They did these things because they knew that our republican form of government could not survive in an economically unequal society. As Theodore Roosevelt wrote, \u201cThere can be no real political democracy unless there is something approaching an economic democracy.\u201dWith economic inequality rising and the middle class collapsing, the deep question we must ask today is whether our generation has wise patriots who, like the progressives a century ago, will adapt the institutions and laws of our country \u2014 and save our republic.Ganesh Sitaraman, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, is the author of \u201cThe Crisis of the Middle-Class Constitution: Why Economic Inequality Threatens Our Republic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lobbyists Rally to Save Tax Breaks Under Threat in Trump Plan", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans\u2019 release of a sweeping plan to rewrite the tax code has set off a scramble among Washington lobbyists and trade groups to protect valuable tax breaks and other long-ingrained provisions.The plan\u2019s scant details make it hard to know what, exactly, is on the chopping block. But within hours of the plan\u2019s unveiling on Wednesday, flash points emerged over measures that supporters said could hurt the housing market, raise borrowing costs and increase the tax burden on families in high-tax states.The response put Trump administration officials on the defensive as they embark on a campaign to sell the plan.\u201cThe lobbyists shouldn\u2019t have input, but the people in Congress should have input, and we\u2019ll be working with them closely as we turn this into a bill and get it to the president to sign this year,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox Business Network on Thursday.Opposition from the real estate industry was swift and vocal, with trade groups strongly criticizing elements of the plan that they say will make home-buying less attractive and weaken the housing market. While the plan specifically calls for preserving the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents are warning that a proposal to double the standard deduction will make taxpayers less likely to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage deduction.The deduction is a key incentive for people to buy homes, since it reduces their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on a mortgage. Real estate agents worry that doubling the standard deduction may provide a richer tax break than itemizing and claiming the mortgage deduction.\u201cWe have always said that tax reform \u2014 a worthy endeavor \u2014 should first do no harm to homeowners,\u201d said William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors.A proposal to limit the deductibility of corporate interest has prompted jockeying among powerful groups that rely on debt to help finance their operations, including real estate companies, private equity firms, financial companies and other businesses.The Build Coalition, a group of associations from the telecommunications, manufacturing and agriculture industries that formed to protect the corporate interest provision, warned that Republicans would be acting counter to their promise to spur business investment by following through on the proposal. Businesses that rely heavily on debt to finance their investments will see costs go up, they say, driving down profitability, investment and job creation.\u201cAltering that would make it more difficult for American companies to compete in the global economy and harm job creation and long-term economic growth,\u201d said Mac O\u2019Brien, a spokesman for the group. \u201cFortunately, the discussion on tax reform is far from over.\u201dSimilar concerns are emanating from Wall Street, with the American Bankers Association warning that a limitation on borrowers\u2019 ability to deduct interest expenses could \u201cadversely impact economic growth.\u201dRepublicans have only slightly tipped their hand as to the overall structure of the tax rewrite. The plan would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and create a new 25 percent tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and family farms.It would also lower the top individual tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while raising the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent as it also doubles the standard deduction. The plan would eliminate many corporate \u201cloopholes\u201d and deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction. But it would also get rid of many provisions that are currently costly to the rich, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.The most politically fraught proposal is eliminating the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers who itemize to write off their property, state and local taxes. The measure is particularly prized in blue states with high property taxes, but is also widely used in some Republican districts in Virginia, New Jersey and California.Eliminating the deduction, which the real estate industry also opposes, would save more than $1 trillion over a decade and make room for the tax cuts. But Republican members of Congress in affected states have already expressed concern about the provision, and a plan that repeals the deduction could be impossible to pass.\u201cThe state and local tax piece is very concerning, because we\u2019re already a donor state to Washington, and this would exacerbate that problem,\u201d said Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, referring to the amount the state pays in taxes. \u201cAnd so I want to see \u2014 based on income categories \u2014 how a hypothetical family of four with a certain amount of income, with a $8,000 property tax and state income tax bill, how they are affected.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also expressed doubt on Thursday that the deduction would die easily.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.\u201cThat\u2019s been a long-heralded and expected set of tax rules, and it\u2019s really, really tough to change that,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Changes to core components of the tax plan could force Republicans to slim down the size of the tax cuts.\u201cRepublicans from high-taxed states are, in our view, unlikely to go along with the elimination of the SALT deduction,\u201d said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking company Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, referring to the state and local tax deduction. \u201cKeeping the SALT deduction, or even merely reducing it, would ultimately result in smaller tax cuts or a larger budget deficit, which we think would be a tough sell to congressional budget hawks.\u201d\u201cOur No. 1 concern is that this delivers massive, massive tax cuts to millionaires and corporations,\u201d said Michael Linden, an adviser to the progressive Not One Penny campaign, which is fighting to make sure the tax overhaul is not a boon for the rich.The group, which includes liberal organizations such as MoveOn, Tax March and the Working Families Party, has already spent more than $1 million advertising in congressional districts across the country to urge lawmakers from both parties to oppose tax cuts for the rich, and it expects to become more active.\u201cWe\u2019ll be ramping it up,\u201d Mr. Linden added. \u201cThis campaign has been bubbling below the surface for the last several months, but now it\u2019s going to take center stage.\u201dFor its part, the Trump administration is maintaining that surging economic growth produced by the tax cuts will prevent the plan from adding to the deficit, and that it will benefit middle-class families.However, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser acknowledged in an interview with ABC News that it was too soon to make promises. It remains possible that some middle-class families could see their tax bills increase under the plan.\u201cThere\u2019s an exception to every rule,\u201d said Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything. You can always find a unique family somewhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does It Cost to Create a Cancer Drug? Less Than You\u2019d Think", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat does it really cost to bring a drug to market?The question is central to the debate over rising health care costs and appropriate drug pricing. President Trump campaigned on promises to lower the costs of drugs.Following approval, the 10 drugs together brought in $67 billion, the researchers also concluded \u2014 a more than sevenfold return on investment. Nine out of 10 companies made money, but revenues varied enormously. One drug had not yet earned back its development costs.The study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, relied on company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine research and development costs.\u201cIt seems like they have done a thoughtful and rigorous job,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, director of the program on regulation, therapeutics and the law at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\u201cIt provides at least something of a reality check,\u201d he added.The figures were met with swift criticism, however, by other experts and by representatives of the biotech industry, who said that the research did not adequately take into account the costs of the many experimental drugs that fail.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like saying it\u2019s a good business to go out and buy winning lottery tickets,\u201d Daniel Seaton, a spokesman for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, said in an email.Dr. Jerry Avorn, chief of the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, predicted that the paper would help fuel the debate over the prices of cancer drugs, which have soared so high \u201cthat we are getting into areas that are almost unimaginable economically,\u201d he said.A leukemia treatment approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration, for example, will cost $475,000 for a single treatment. It is the first of a wave of gene therapy treatments likely to carry staggering price tags.\u201cThis is an important brick in the wall of this developing concern,\u201d he said.Dr. Vinay Prasad, an oncologist at Oregon Health and Science University, and Dr. Sham Mailankody, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, arrived at their figures after reviewing data on 10 companies that brought a cancer drug to market in the past decade.Since the companies also were developing other drugs that did not receive approval from the F.D.A., the researchers were able to include the companies\u2019 total spending on research and development, not just what they spent on the drugs that succeeded.One striking example was ibrutinib, made by Pharmacyclics. It was approved in 2013 for patients with certain blood cancers who did not respond to conventional therapy.Ibrutinib was the only drug out of four the company was developing to receive F.D.A. approval. The company\u2019s research and development costs for their four drugs were $388 million, the company\u2019s S.E.C. filings indicated.One objection was that the researchers, led by Joseph A. DiMasi, did not disclose the companies\u2019 data on development costs. The study involved ten large companies, which were not named, and 106 investigational drugs, also not named.But Dr. DiMasi found the new study \u201cirredeemably flawed at a fundamental level.\u201d\u201cThe sample consists of relatively small companies that have gotten only one drug approved, with few other drugs of any type in development,\u201d he said. The result is \u201csubstantial selection bias,\u201d meaning that the estimates do not accurately reflect the industry as a whole.Ninety-five percent of cancer drugs that enter clinical trials fail, said Mr. Seaton, of the biotech industry group. \u201cThe small handful of successful drugs \u2014 those looked at by this paper \u2014 must be profitable enough to finance all of the many failures this analysis leaves unexamined.\u201d\u201cWhen the rare event occurs that a company does win approval,\u201d he added, \u201cthe reward must be commensurate with taking on the multiple levels of risk not seen in any other industry if drug development is to remain economically viable for prospective investors.\u201dCancer drugs remain among the most expensive medications, with prices reaching the hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient.Although the new study was small, its estimates are so much lower than previous figures, and the return on investment so great, that experts say they raise questions about whether soaring drug prices really are needed to encourage investment.\u201dThat seems hard to swallow when they make seven times what they invested in the first four years,\u201d Dr. Prasad said.The new study has limitations, noted Patricia Danzon, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.It involved just ten small biotech companies whose cancer drugs were aimed at limited groups of patients with less common diseases.For such drugs, the F.D.A. often permits clinical trials to be very small and sometimes without control groups. Therefore development costs may have been lower for this group than for drugs that require longer and larger studies.But, Dr. Danzon said, most new cancer drugs today are developed this way: by small companies and for small groups of patients. The companies often license or sell successful drugs to the larger companies.The new study, she said, \u201cis shining a light on a sector of the industry that is becoming important now.\u201d The evidence, she added, is \u201cirrefutable\u201d that the cost of research and development \u201cis small relative to the revenues.\u201dWhen it comes to drug prices, it does not matter what companies spend on research and development, Dr. Kesselheim said.\u201cThey are based on what the market will bear.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the company that acquired a drug maker. It was AbbVie, not Janssen Biotech (which jointly develops the drug). Additionally, the article incorrectly described what AbbVie acquired. It was the company Pharmacylics, which developed the drug Imbruvica, not the drug itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Passes $700 Billion Pentagon Bill, More Money Than Trump Sought", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a rare act of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, the Senate passed a $700 billion defense policy bill on Monday that sets forth a muscular vision of America as a global power, with a Pentagon budget that far exceeds what President Trump has asked for.Senators voted 89-9 to approve the measure, known as the National Defense Authorization Act; the House has already adopted a similar version.The vote marked the 56th consecutive year that Congress has passed the defense policy bill \u2014 a point of personal pride for Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, and who has spent the past week shepherding the bill on the Senate floor as he battles brain cancer.In arguing for the increased funding, Mr. McCain cited a string of recent deadly accidents involving the military, including a collision last month between an oil tanker and the destroyer John S. McCain, named for the senator\u2019s father and grandfather. Ten sailors were killed and five others injured.\u201cWe are gambling with the lives of the best among us and we\u2019re now seeing the cost \u2014 the tragic but foreseeable costs of an overworked, strained force with aging equipment and not enough of it,\u201d Mr. McCain said.The 1,215-page bill sets policy on a range of military matters as diverse as whether the Air Force can buy new fighter jets and pay raises for service members. It provides $640 billion for basic Pentagon operations \u2014 $37 billion more than President Trump sought \u2014 and another $60 billion for war operations overseas in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere.The measure also includes a string of provisions to streamline the management of the Defense Department; along with boosting military spending, overhauling the Pentagon has been a high priority for Mr. McCain.\u201cHe\u2019s someone who has lived with underfunding of the military, seen the impact on readiness, seen the strains that impact the force,\u201d said Anthony N. Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.The bill also reflects Mr. McCain\u2019s expansive vision of the role of the United States in world affairs. It authorizes $500 million to provide security assistance, including weapons, to Ukraine; $100 million to help Baltic nations \u201cdeter Russian aggression\u201d and another $705 million for Israeli cooperative missile defense programs \u2014 $558.5 million more than the administration\u2019s request.But while the proposal outlines a hefty defense budget, whether the Pentagon gets the money will be determined by congressional appropriators, and Democrats have pledged to block major increases in military spending without a similar boost for domestic programs.Before the bill can be sent to the president for his signature, it must be reconciled with the House version. They are different in a critical respect; the House-passed bill authorizes the creation of a new Space Corps, to manage satellite and other space-related programs, while the Senate bill does not.The proposed corps has drawn opposition from the Air Force, which manages most of the military\u2019s space-related programs, as well as the White House.The defense bill, approved by the Armed Services Committee by a unanimous vote of 27-0 in June, is one of the few must-pass measures to go through Congress, which makes it a prime target for lawmakers trying to attach amendments to it. Senators had proposed more than 500 amendments, but the vast majority were not attached to the bill.Among the amendments kept out of the measure was a controversial proposal by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat, to block Mr. Trump\u2019s directive barring transgender troops from serving in the military. On Friday, Mr. McCain and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services panel, joined Ms. Gillibrand in introducing a separate bill that would allow transgender troops to serve.An earlier version of this article misidentified a group of nations authorized to receive funding to \u201cdeter Russian aggression\u201d under a defense policy bill. The bill authorizes $100 million for Baltic nations, not Balkan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Democracy Is Drowning in Money", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews Analysis | World ReviewSo what does all that money buy? No one seriously thinks that the quality of American representative democracy has doubled in value. Has it instead become doubly corrupt?The United States has long maintained a freer approach to political financing than other Western democracies, in part because the country is big, campaigns are long and political advertising on television is essential and expensive. In many European countries, strict limits are placed on campaign spending or contributions, campaigns are kept short and paid political advertising on television is restricted or outright banned.The flood of money unleashed by the Citizens United decision has swept away the effectiveness of those controls, according to Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit organization dedicated to campaign reform. He dismissed as \u201cillusory\u201d the argument that contributions from supposedly independent groups known as \u201csuper PACs\u201d don\u2019t corrupt the political process because they don\u2019t work directly in concert with the campaigns they support.\u201cThe bottom line is we have very serious problems with the functioning of our democracy caused by the unrestrained flow of influence-seeking money into the elections,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said.But is it corruption? Do the gigantic sums doled out to campaigns \u2014 and later lavished on elected representatives as they are lobbied for their votes \u2014 amount to attempts to buy political power? Or is it, as the Supreme Court agreed in the Citizens United case, an exercise in constitutionally protected free speech?While the United States is fairly strict in cracking down on practices such as bribery and kickbacks, Mr. Wertheimer said, the American system has opened the door to a whole other kind of corruption.\u201cThe corruption in the U.S. does not stem from officeholders putting money in their pocket,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is systemic corruption of the process itself. When you are dealing with billions and billions of dollars, much of that focused on buying influence, it overwhelms the system, and it is much harder to defend against and maintain representation for ordinary Americans.\u201dBut he agrees that the vast sums spent on political campaigns in the United States are amplifying the sense among ordinary Americans that they\u2019re being marginalized, politically and economically. The notion that \u201call politicians are corrupt\u201d is an old one, and present in other democracies, Mr. Mounk said. But the idea that the rich are getting richer while everyone else falls behind is becoming more prevalent in the United States.This perception is borne out by research from Martin Gilens, a politics professor at Princeton University, which shows that American economic policies over the last 40 years \u201cstrongly reflect the preferences of the most affluent, but bear virtually no relationship to the preferences of poor or middle-income Americans.\u201d\u201cSome argue that there is no causal relation, but as numerous former congressmen have testified, that is not the case,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said. \u201cHuge amounts of money are not being given for charitable purposes, but to obtain benefits.\u201dThe American system\u2019s addiction to money has other noxious side effects. According to Reuters, members of Congress can spend as much time fund-raising as legislating \u2014 up to five hours a day \u2014 during tough campaigns.Of course, it takes more than money to win elections. In both the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, the candidates who spent the most money lost. And for every candidate who loses, millions, even billions, of dollars in contributions are spent for naught.Nor are all contributions potentially venal; they come in all forms \u2014 in support of causes and issues, as well as corporate interests and industrial lobbies.Too sharp a focus on money also overlooks the other ways politicians can be influenced. \u201cThere are indirect ways of buying favor which work in more subtle ways,\u201d Mr. Mounk said. \u201cYou are influenced by the people around you \u2014 who you spend time with, who you have dinner with.\u201dEach culture has its own system of political influence or, some might say, corruption. Throwing around money is the American way. In Russia, the Kremlin doles out business to its favorite oligarchs, who in turn are in thrall to their political masters, a system that Mr. Mounk says is the most pernicious of all.In France, where paid political advertising on television is prohibited, campaign spending and contributions are limited, and public campaign funding is available, voters this year punished a presidential candidate who had placed his wife in a no-show job on the public payroll, a questionable but not uncommon practice among France\u2019s political elite.In the United States, however, the immense sums of money swirling around politics and the proliferation of super PACs have yet to stir protests from voters, and efforts to fix campaign-spending laws have stalled in Congress. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the threat to a healthy democratic system isn\u2019t real, Mr. Wertheimer said.\u201cThe amounts are unprecedented and provide an extraordinary advantage to the very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are dealing with huge amounts of money \u2014 and when there are no laws to contain them \u2014 they overwhelm the process in a way that small sums can\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Points to Welfare Overhaul as a Model for Health Care. The Comparison Has Limits.", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As they propose to give each state a wad of federal cash to replace the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance, Senate Republicans have a ready comparison to press their case: the overhaul of welfare adopted two decades ago.But the authors of the Senate\u2019s latest bill to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health law face one glaring flaw with the analogy: Few people would applaud a dramatic plunge in health insurance coverage the way they cheered the steep declines of the welfare rolls after the 1996 welfare law went into force.For Republicans, the comparison makes for a compelling political argument.\u201cIn 1996, we block granted money for welfare reform, and it worked like a charm,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an architect of the health care plan. \u201cWe put governors in charge of the program. We held them accountable.\u201dPresident Trump got into the act when he praised block grants on Twitter.But health care is not welfare, and voters may not accept the analogy. The welfare law, signed by President Bill Clinton, ended the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation\u2019s poorest children and gave states vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal money.So too would the Senate Republican bill eliminate the entitlement to Medicaid and health insurance subsidies for many low-income people and would give the money to states, along with sweeping discretion over how to use it for health care or coverage.\u201cWe give states the flexibility to come up with their own solutions,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a co-author of the health care bill with Mr. Graham. With that flexibility, he said, states will find that the money for health care block grants is adequate, just as they have found the welfare block grants.Federal money for the basic welfare block grants has been set at $16.5 billion a year since 1996. If that sum was adjusted for inflation, it would be $25.5 billion.\u201cDo you ever hear a governor come to Washington and complain about not having enough money for their welfare program?\u201d asked Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the former senator who helped devise the latest Senate health bill. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Why? Because we gave them the money and the flexibility to be able to design a program that worked for them.\u201dBut it was easier for states to do more with less when they had fewer people to worry about. After the welfare law was enacted, the number of welfare recipients plunged more than 50 percent in five years, to 5.7 million in 2001, from 12.3 million in 1996.An equivalent drop in the number of people with health insurance or insurance subsidies would probably not be viewed as a great success.The goal in 1996 was to help people move from welfare to work. With health insurance, the goal is to increase enrollment. And no one advocates time limits for insurance like the time limits on cash assistance.Mr. Graham said his bill, providing $1.2 trillion for states to share from 2020 to 2026, would allow federalism to flourish. It \u201cgets the money and power out of Washington,\u201d he said, and \u201cpatients in this country will do better.\u201dBut Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said the welfare program, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, showed the risks of fiscal federalism.\u201cThose extolling the TANF block grant should check the record,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cFederal dollars have declined by one-third in real terms, states have diverted funds for other purposes, and as a result the number of poor children served by the program has shrunk to an all-time low. If we follow this model for health care, many millions of Americans will lose their health insurance.\u201dRonald T. Haskins, who helped write the 1996 welfare law as an aide to House Republicans, said it had clearly achieved one of its main purposes. \u201cIt has controlled spending,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was $16.5 billion in 1997, the first year of TANF, and it\u2019s still $16.5 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are saving 30 to 35 percent, billions and billions of dollars, because there is no adjustment for inflation or population growth.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Haskins said: \u201cIf you want to make sure people get health care or coverage with a block grant, that\u2019s questionable. Over the years you will have to do more with less. States will have less money. That normally means they\u2019ll have less coverage.\u201dOne goal of the 1996 law was to require adult welfare recipients to work. To the consternation of conservatives, the flexibility provided by the welfare block grant has allowed some states to avoid the work requirements.Conservatives worry that the Graham-Cassidy bill could allow states to set up and operate \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care systems with federal block grant funds. Mr. Graham did nothing to allay this concern when he said last week on the Senate floor, \u201cIf California wants to go to single-payer health care, it can.\u201dThat possibility alarms insurers. In a letter to Senate leaders last week, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a lobby for the industry, said the Graham-Cassidy bill could undercut the private market by \u201callowing government-controlled, single-payer health care to grow.\u201dUntil the recession began in late 2007, the welfare overhaul was generally viewed as a success. Large numbers of single mothers took jobs in a strong economy as states revamped their welfare programs to emphasize work.But the number of welfare recipients did not increase much when the economy softened and poverty inched up in the recession. Since 1996, the proportion of poor families with children who receive cash assistance has plummeted by about two-thirds.\u201cThe program has provided a temporary safety net to fewer and fewer poor families,\u201d said LaDonna A.

{"Headline": "California Today: What It Means to Be a \u2018Sanctuary State\u2019", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles.For months, lawmakers in Sacramento have debated what it would mean for California to become a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d with strict regulations over how much law enforcement agencies could do to help federal immigration authorities. On Monday, Gov. Jerry Brown and Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the state Senate who introduced the legislation, reached an agreement that seemed to appease both supporters and critics.The compromise bill prohibits law enforcement agents from asking about a person\u2019s immigration status or participating in any program that uses them as immigration agents.But the legislation stops short of many of the changes Mr. de Le\u00f3n initially included in the days after President Trump\u2019s election, including preventing immigration agents from interviewing inmates in jails and allowing them access to law enforcement databases. The bill also exempts the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation from many of the restrictions, though it does require them to offer more protections for immigrant inmates.The amendments also expand the types of criminal convictions that allow local law enforcement agents to transfer and share information about inmates.For Mr. de Le\u00f3n, the legislation was the most high profile attempt to expand protections for undocumented immigrants in the Trump era. But from the beginning, the California Sheriff\u2019s Association opposed the effort, saying it would increase public safety risks. And Gov. Brown voiced reservations in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month. Immigrant rights activists staged protests for the legislation, arguing it was necessary to defend people from expanded deportation efforts and assuage fears in immigrant communities.The bill still needs to be approved by the Assembly before the legislature adjourns at the end of this week, where it is expected to pass.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)You\u2019ve heard of bomb-sniffing dogs. But a yellow labrador retriever has been putting his nose to the ground on Santa Cruz Island in an effort to sniff out a different kind of threat: a species of invasive ant.The dog, Tobias, is working with the Nature Conservancy group, helping them in their search for Argentine ants that researchers attempted to wipe out in 2009 after they were found disrupting local wildlife.So far the labrador has been unsuccessful in his search, which suggests that the scientists\u2019 effort eight years ago paid off.Though he was unruly at first, his new owners soon found that he was extremely skilled at hunting down toys, and began to train him to sniff out certain species. Along with the ants, he has also helped to detect quagga mussels, another invasive species, in Montana.According to his biography on the organization\u2019s website,\u201cHe brings total commitment to each search and is rewarded with his Wubba toy.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

The latest Republican proposal, by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, was no different.Proposals include allowing cheaper imports from other developed countries; allowing the government to negotiate the price of Medicare-covered drugs; speeding approval of cheaper generics; requiring notification by drug companies before they raise prices; and restricting drug ads aimed at consumers.Other ideas not in bill form include banning patents for pills that simply modify existing medicines without significant clinical benefits and adjusting prices according to a drug\u2019s effectiveness.\u201cThere\u2019s clearly no single solution out there that will solve this rapidly rising spending,\u201d said Dr. Peter Bach, who leads the lab. But, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of fundamental disagreement about the direction this needs to move.\u201dMr. Trump drew new attention to the issue last month by tweeting that Merck\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth Frazier, \u201cwill have more time to lower ripoff drug prices!\u201d after Mr. Frazier quit the president\u2019s manufacturing council to protest his remarks about white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.Even so, the vote prompted speculation that a price deal might be within reach. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about garden-variety, generic drugs that can be easily imported from another country that has regulatory procedures that make them safe?\u201d Senator Lee said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201dThe drug lobby has spent $28 million so far this year to air six ads depicting heroic researchers about 4,600 times on national TV, according to iSpot.tv, an ad tracker.Drug makers say that high prices reflect heavy investment in innovation and drug development. They reject the notion that the industry wields too much influence in Washington. The top 10 publicly traded United States drug companies made $67.8 billion after taxes last year, regulatory filings show.\u201cThese are important issues with significant ramifications,\u201d said Holly Campbell, a spokeswoman for the drug trade group. \u201cSo we will continue to be engaged with the administration to advance solutions that improve the marketplace and make it more responsive to the needs of patients.\u201dGerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University, said Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order \u201cdid not talk at all about branded drugs or about specialty drugs,\u201d including for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, that have seen especially steep price increases. \u201cIf that represents the administration\u2019s thinking, then my guess is there is not much effort.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s feud with congressional Republicans, especially the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, means \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get any strong direction or leadership out of the White House\u201d on drug prices, said Vishnu Lekraj, who follows pharma stocks for Morningstar, an investment research firm.Yet even small measures might be too large for Congress. \u201cIt is sort of remarkable to see just how far the system can bend before meaningful reform is taken,\u201d said Dr. Sarpatwari. \u201cIf there ever was a time to strike while it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s now.\u201dJay Hancock is a reporter for Kaiser Health News.The Kaiser Health News reporters Elizabeth Lucas and Sydney Lupkin contributed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Faces Deal-Making Challenges as Congress Returns", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump the deal maker heads into the autumn of his first year in as weak a negotiating position as any president in modern times \u2014 desperate for a victory yet hardly near consensus on any major priority, still able to dominate the national conversation but so far incapable of translating that into action.A summer of tumult marked by staff shake-ups, legislative failures, intraparty feuds, a racially inflammatory controversy and a nuclear-edged war of words has left him at odds with his own Republican Party and supported by barely a third of the American public. The list of daunting challenges has only grown with little sense of how he plans to tackle them beyond Twitter storms and declarations of determination.\u201cLegislatively, September may be the longest month of the year, with several must pass items that face an uphill climb,\u201d said Doug Heye, a longtime Republican strategist. The president\u2019s decision to push the immigrant program to Congress \u201conly makes that harder, on an issue that for years Republicans have struggled to make any headway on. The question is whether this was a strategic decision by the White House.\u201dWhile his approval ratings remain mired around 35 percent, Mr. Trump\u2019s allies argue that he had a better summer than the Washington conventional wisdom would suggest and that he has a path forward. They contend that after the fights of early August, the president took on the mantle of a national leader with a vigorous and visible response to Hurricane Harvey, and that cleaning up the devastation may prove both a rallying point and a strategic leverage.\u201cIt may sound counterintuitive, but the president heads into September with a bit of wind at his back,\u201d said Michael Dubke, who served as his White House communications director. \u201cHarvey was handled well, tax reform is back on track, the debt ceiling showdown will be pushed to a later date and while there are no good choices in North Korea, the president\u2019s national security team is second to none.\u201dRepublicans are talking about tying hurricane relief money to the debt ceiling increase, sweetening a vote that their own conservatives typically resist with action that they presumably would find more appealing. If that gets the perennially difficult issue off the table, the president\u2019s allies said, it could make it possible for him to focus on the tax code. It may still be difficult for Mr. Trump to win as much money for his border wall as he wants, but even partial financing could be portrayed as a victory.The president\u2019s decision to target Mr. Obama\u2019s program for young illegal immigrants, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, will open the fall on a divisive note. But his advisers hope that delaying the effect by six months will force Congress to step up and put the program on a firm constitutional foundation.While Republicans feel burned by Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. McConnell and some of their colleagues, some said they have little choice but to find a way to come together.\u201cWe have to work with the president,\u201d Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC last weekend. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to get in a fight with the president. It\u2019s not a mistake to disagree when you disagree; it is a mistake to suggest that somehow this president, who was elected just as the Constitution prescribed, and has the responsibility to lead the country, that somehow we need to not work with this president.\u201dOn Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump will host a group that has been dubbed the Big Six to discuss his tax overhaul \u2014 Mr. McConnell; House Speaker Paul D. Ryan; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s national economics adviser; and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairmen of the tax-writing committees. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump will host another White House meeting with Mr. McConnell, Mr. Ryan and their Democratic counterparts, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.His first seven months in office have yet to produce any big deals, a failure highlighted most notably by the collapse of an effort to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program and replace it with a Republican-authored version. Allies said Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to negotiations, however, is to hold out for the best deal possible until the last moment, so it is too soon to judge.\u201cMy style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cI aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I\u2019m after. Sometimes I settle for less than I sought, but in most cases I still end up with what I want.\u201dBut those who have studied his career in real estate and business said that it has been marked by as many failed deals as successful ones. He bought an airline that failed. He bought a football team in a league that collapsed. He filed for bankruptcy protection multiple times.\u201cIf you look at his record, there are a lot of deals that didn\u2019t work out,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Antonio, a Trump biographer. \u201cSo if you think about the true record of performance, he is very good at promotion and creating the idea that he is a deal maker, but not very good at making actual successful deals.\u201dIn the end, some Democrats argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s very weakness may yet prove to be a boon. Since legislating entirely with fellow Republicans has yet to yield the results Mr. Trump had hoped, he may have more incentive to work with Democrats on areas where they could find agreement, particularly infrastructure and the tax code. Democrats would also like to work on legislation stabilizing the Obama health care markets.\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the president has come to see that one-sided governing led by extremists is a recipe for failure,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey and co-chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus that includes 43 House members from both parties frustrated by inaction.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not just our side of the aisle that has raised issues,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut we have a responsibility to govern, and I believe that.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Shepherd, Who Both Painted and Preserved Wildlife, Dies at 86", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid Shepherd, a British artist whose love of painting wildlife led him to become a leading conservationist as well, died on Sept. 19 in Sussex, England. He was 86.\u201cDavid\u2019s passion for wildlife and the role of man in its demise infuriated and inspired him,\u201d Karen Botha, the chief executive of the fund, said in a statement. \u201cHe was dedicated, tenacious and outspoken, a champion of animals and the people who worked to protect them.\u201dRichard David Shepherd was born on April 25, 1931, in Hendon, a London suburb. His father worked in the hospitality business, and his mother was a farmer and horse breeder. His early career aspirations had nothing to do with art.He was fond of showing his first painting \u2014 birds over a turbulent sea \u2014 and telling the story of how it got him turned away from the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Then, at a cocktail party, he met Robin Goodwin, a professional painter, who invited Mr. Shepherd to bring his work to his studio for an evaluation.\u201cI wish I had had a tape recorder in my pocket, because he said something like, \u2018Oh, my God, anybody who paints as badly as that, I\u2019ve just got to teach him,\u2019\u201d Mr. Shepherd recalled in the 2015 interview. \u201cHe took me on as a challenge.\u201dOne of his earliest professional assignments, in 1953, was to paint pictures of airplanes in London as they sat on the airport runway.\u201cI was learning the hard way, in all weathers, and the noise, and the dirt, and the perpetual wind that shook the canvas,\u201d he said in \u201cThe Man Who Loves Giants.\u201d \u201cAnd they had a habit of towing the airplanes away when you were halfway through painting their portraits.\u201dHe did well enough, however, that next came jobs for the Royal Air Force recreating World War II scenes, for which he flew in vintage planes and rode in tanks over battle sites. In 1960 the Air Force flew him to Africa to paint more airplane portraits, but soon he was painting elephants\u2019 portraits instead.He also received his first glimpses of poaching and other horrors visited upon wildlife, and he was not able to stay detached.\u201cEmotion is involved in a huge way, with a capital E, when you\u2019ve seen an elephant, as I have, walking along on the road having blown his foot off, having trodden on a land mine,\u201d he said.Mr. Shepherd became an energetic fund-raiser for conservation causes, dedicating proceeds to the work from sales of some of his prints. In 1984 he formed his foundation, which has, among other things, created an elephant orphanage in Zambia, financed antipoaching campaigns in places like Uganda and worked to preserve a snow leopard habitat in Mongolia.Mr. Shepherd\u2019s survivors include his wife, Avril, whom he married in 1957; four daughters, Mandy, Melanie, Wendy and Melinda; nine grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.In addition to his portraits of animals, Mr. Shepherd painted some famous people, including Queen Elizabeth II. For that assignment he had been advised simply to wear his painting clothes. He did, realizing only after he was in the room with his subject that perhaps he seemed inappropriately slovenly, since he had a habit of wiping his brushes off on his right pant leg. The queen, though, adjusted graciously.\u201cIt was one of the happiest commissions I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simple Investing for Nonprofits", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe boards of small nonprofit organizations must make major investment decisions, but they are often flying in the dark.There is a simple answer, which works for many small institutions as well as for individuals saving for retirement. It is to put money into low-cost stock and bond funds, allocate the money appropriately and rebalance periodically. But the boards of nonprofits don\u2019t always find this straightforward approach appealing for a variety of reasons, many of them psychological.For one thing, not every nonprofit has board members who want to take responsibility for decisions that could affect their institution\u2019s financial health. Even members with financial expertise may feel ill equipped to make an investment decision in a stressful market.Hiring outside money managers to handle these burdens comes at a price and with no guarantee of success. Assembling a team of superb money managers, as Yale, Princeton and other universities have tried to do, may not be realistic for nonprofits that don\u2019t have an enormous endowment.That\u2019s why Larry Kochard, who oversees the University of Virginia\u2019s $8.6 billion endowment and sits on the board of the $18 million Virginia Environmental Endowment, says the simple solution, equity and bond index funds, makes sense for smaller institutions.Finding good outside advisers is possible for institutions without deep pockets, he said, but it is very difficult. \u201cThe odds of a small endowment finding the right managers are very slim,\u201d Mr. Kochard said.For the most part, he advocated modest goals, saying: \u201cIf we are watching our allocations and spending and rebalancing, we are meeting our obligations.\u201dMs. Shuman also favors index funds for nonprofits, but warns that the success of index funds over the past several years has largely been driven by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\u201cThey drove a disproportionate return,\u201d she said, and if these stocks decline, the indexes will fall, too. She recommends Vanguard\u2019s managed equity and international funds for low-cost but actively managed alternatives.When considering whether to hold hedge funds, which often do not allow immediate liquidation of investments, many nonprofits may need to examine whether they can afford to forgo access to their money for long periods.That\u2019s not always an issue, however. Before Patti Birch died in 2007, for example, she directed that her Patti and Everett B. Birch Foundation spend down all of its funds in the years ahead. The foundation\u2019s president, Vartan Gregorian, said it still gave money to \u201cthe arts, women\u2019s rights, religious and ethnic tolerance, freedom of speech and strengthening American democracy,\u201d all causes that were important to Ms. Birch. Mr. Gregorian is also president of the Carnegie Corporation.The foundation\u2019s remaining funds are all being held in low-risk short-term bonds, said Mark Imowitz, whose firm, Imowitz Koenig and Company, handles the finances.\u201cPatti was not worried about having great appreciation in her investment assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was natural to keep them in low-return funds since the money was being spent down.\u201dMany nonprofits have to think much longer term, however, and don\u2019t have the luxury of holding all of their assets in a single low-risk asset class.Roughly 80 percent of it is allocated to Commonfund\u2019s multistrategy equity fund, which includes a smattering of hedge funds, and it underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by 2.5 percentage points in the three years through April, Mr. Kempner said. The fund has improved lately, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a manager underperforms their benchmarks, you should not just immediately trade managers. You have to understand what is wrong and how can they plan to fix it \u201cFees vary widely and are not always transparent. Commonfund, which manages about $24 billion in nonprofit money for about 1,400 clients, charges an average fee of 0.3 percent directly, according to Keith Luke, Commonfund\u2019s president. But because the managers selected by Commonfund for nonprofit portfolios also charge fees and because there are additional expenses, the overall fee paid by nonprofits is about 1 percent on average, he said.Commonfund \u201cis like an institutional mutual fund,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cWe create a commingled investment vehicle of managers who pick stocks across all strategies.\u201d\u201cThere is scaled pricing,\u201d he said, \u201cand the larger the portfolio, the smaller the fee.\u201d For sizable portfolios \u2014 about $20 million \u2014 the overall fee would be less than 0.14 percent with Vanguard, he said.Geraldine Fabrikant is a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Overhaul to Be Unveiled This Month May Be Less Than Advertised", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A day after Republican leaders said that their tax overhaul plan would be released in just two weeks, the Republican chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee had a different message: not so fast.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah sought on Thursday to temper anticipation that a fully developed tax plan would be ready for public consumption by the end of the month, insisting that his committee would use a bipartisan process to craft legislation. The remarks, made at the beginning of a hearing about the individual tax code, suggest that the promise to rewrite the tax code by the end of the year may not be attainable.\u201cAny forthcoming documents may be viewed as guidance or potential signposts for drafting legislation,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.After the hearing, Mr. Hatch was also muted about the prospects of a tax bill being enacted this year. Noting that it had been more than 30 years since the last big tax bill, he said, \u201cNobody\u2019s convinced this can get done in a very short period of time.\u201dThe comments underscore the disconnect between some Republicans who feel a sense of urgency to push through a tax bill within three months and others who prefer a more deliberative approach. A major rewrite of the tax code has not occurred in over 30 years.For its part, the Trump administration is moving full speed ahead as the president rushes to secure his first significant legislative achievement.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, President Trump repeated that a detailed plan would be unveiled the week of Sept. 25. He also said that because of economic growth it would not add to the deficit and that some Democrats were likely to back it.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to be very successful, and I do believe we\u2019ll have some Democratic votes,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump also reiterated what he said earlier this week, declaring that the tax plan would not benefit the wealthiest Americans.\u201cThis is not a plan for the rich,\u201d Mr. Trump added.Most analyses of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plans and the proposals produced by Republicans have disproportionately benefited the rich, and Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion this week that they could pay more has left many tax experts scratching their heads.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, explained on Thursday that even if the top individual tax rate does go down, the elimination of deductions that benefit the rich would mean that their tax bills would not be reduced.\u201cOur objective is for them not to have an income tax reduction,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a Politico policy discussion.Mr. Mnuchin promised that detailed information about proposed tax rates and changes to deductions would be revealed later this month.The distribution of tax relief is likely to be a factor that determines whether Democrats support tax legislation and the overall chances of something being passed.So far, Democrats are skeptical about Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions.\u201cIt\u2019d be great if what I\u2019m hearing about the goals for individual tax reform actually lined up with the details of the plans that are reportedly in the works, but that just isn\u2019t the case,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee, said.He pointed to the potential loophole for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses that emerged from the tax outline Mr. Trump released in April and the Republican plan to repeal the estate tax as evidence that the coming tax overhaul was not really going to help the middle class. \u201cThe Republican plan I see coming together right now doubles down on the rotten unfairness in our tax code,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Down Payment With a Catch: You Must Be an Airbnb Host", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIf only we had the down payment\u201d may be one of the most frequent complaints among aspiring home buyers in cities across the country.Yifan Zhang, a 29-year-old entrepreneur who often hears this lament among her friends, has come up with a service that tries to help.When she bought a townhouse in Seattle with her husband last summer, she knew that the spare bedroom could generate extra income on Airbnb. But when she learned just how much they could collect each month \u2014 enough to cover the mortgage, and sometimes more \u2014 her entrepreneurial instincts kicked in: Why not front would-be home buyers money for a down payment, and then collect a share of their Airbnb rental income in return?\u201cIt\u2019s for the people who don\u2019t have the parents to help, or the high income to save while paying rent,\u201d said Ms. Zhang, who founded Loftium with Adam Stelle, another entrepreneur, and who has already had about 200 Airbnb guests in her townhouse. \u201cThey are just stuck trying to save for a decade or more before they give up.\u201dExecutives at Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance giant, also noticed that some young people perceived homeownership as an impossibility, said Jonathan Lawless, vice president of customer solutions at Fannie Mae.\u201cMany renters struggle to generate savings in the current environment of high rental rates and student debts,\u201d Mr. Lawless said. \u201cAs opposed to what happened in previous generations, there is almost a fear associated with it because they have this really big debt.\u201dLoftium expects to appeal to young workers and families who are looking to buy their first home for roughly $600,000 or less. The program is being introduced on a small scale in Seattle, but Loftium said it believed there were about 40 other cities where it could give prospective buyers the boost they needed. It hopes to branch out to four more cities \u2014 perhaps Chicago, Denver or Raleigh, N.C. \u2014 within a year.\u201cA lot of the people who like this idea are already living with roommates or their parents, so this is a better situation for them,\u201d said Ms. Zhang, who, with her husband, lived with roommates in San Francisco before leaving for Seattle. Hosts will have the right to cancel up to three guests per year, should they feel uncomfortable with them for any reason.Loftium will determine the size of the down payment it is willing to put up using an algorithm that predicts how much income a room can generate.Generally speaking, the homeowners pay back Loftium through a revenue-sharing agreement \u2014 it is not structured as a traditional loan \u2014 in which the company collects roughly two-thirds of the monthly income. If the room isn\u2019t booked nearly enough to generate the expected income, that\u2019s Loftium\u2019s problem, not the homeowner\u2019s.\u201cWe are trying to put as little risk on the homeowner as possible,\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cThat money up front is yours as long as you abide by the contract.\u201dShould a baby arrive \u2014 or the homeowners want to stop renting the room for any reason before the contract ends \u2014 they must pay their share of the nights remaining, plus 15 percent of that amount, within a week, the 16-page contract says.If the homeowner doesn\u2019t pay what\u2019s owed, Loftium reserves the right to put a second lien against the property, which means the company would be second in line to be paid back (behind the mortgage lender) after the home is sold, refinanced or foreclosed on.So who is eligible for such an arrangement? Loftium is relying on the mortgage company to vet borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans, but it will run its own background checks. Buyers will also need to qualify for a mortgage that meets standards put out by Fannie Mae, which finances nearly a third of all new mortgages in the United States, according to Inside Finance.While Fannie hopes to work with Loftium in several more cities, it first needs to ensure that demand is strong enough, homeowners are abiding by their contracts and they are paying their mortgages. Changes in local laws, which could place new restrictions on Airbnb-esque arrangements, might also dim the program\u2019s prospects.\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy it because of its looks,\u201d Ms. Zhang said of her property. \u201cWe were thinking about budget and location.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Platonic Romance on the Psych Ward", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveAnita and I met five years ago as roommates at a hospital just outside of New York City. According to the brochure in our patient intake folders, the hospital\u2019s scenic grounds boasted rolling lawns, open meadows, forests and a gazebo.But why would we care about the landscaping? The brochure reminded me of a commercial I had seen for Hulu while watching Hulu. We didn\u2019t need an advertisement for the hospital. We were locked inside.I was 28, stuck in yet another manic episode in yet another psychiatric ward. Anita was 24, experiencing her first manic episode. A lack of sleep had left her with purple crescents under her eyes. We sat on our uncomfortable twin beds and shared stories that would make new roommates in most situations uncomfortable.Anita told me that in the ambulance she had suspected she was being driven to a secret location where a team of progressive political operatives would prime her for a presidential campaign. \u201cI knew the recent election was over,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was for a future campaign.\u201dShe looked down while confiding all this, so I offered my own embarrassing story: \u201cOnce I was crossing the street and hallucinated that my eyes had fallen out. I held up traffic while I patted the ground, searching for my eyes.\u201dAnd that was our introduction, because in a psych ward, friendships are reverse-engineered; you start with the deep stuff and get to the shallow stuff later.Anita worked in finance. I was in graduate school for poetry. Our first day together, we shared a blanket on the couch in the common room, called ourselves feral shelter cats (\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d we assured the nurses), applied mental health criteria to saints and celebrities, and laughed until we forgot why we were laughing.\u201cDid you two come in together?\u201d a patient asked.\u201cWe just met,\u201d I said.The patient turned up the television to drown out our laughter.Anita said, \u201cI asked them if they put us together because I\u2019m supposed to learn from you.\u201dI laughed harder. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dMore than four years later, Anita and I are still friends. And at the risk of sounding sentimental, she has learned from me, and I from her. When it feels as if entire universes exist between the real world and me, I call Anita, because I know she has felt that way, too. But at the hospital, the staff discouraged us from getting too close.\u201cNo touching!\u201d the nurse scolded after seeing Anita lean her shoulder against mine. Anita had thought it would relax me, and it did until the nurse yelled. Another nurse discouraged patients from sharing phone numbers and email addresses.\u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone stays in touch anyway,\u201d another patient said. For a year, this patient had worked on the ward. Now she was undergoing electroconvulsive therapy.\u201cAnita and I will keep in touch,\u201d I said.\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d the staffer-turned-patient said. \u201cNo one ever does.\u201dI almost believed her. This was my sixth hospitalization, and I hadn\u2019t yet sustained a friendship with a former patient. Several times I had tried. The first week would start strong, but then the chemistry would fizzle just as my brain chemistry seemed to fizzle.Medicated, I missed mania. I idealized mania, focusing only on its good qualities: self-confidence, unbridled enthusiasm, quick thinking. Medicated, I felt dull. I would only disappoint. But this friendship felt too important to lose.I warned Anita of the potential setbacks: \u201cEven when we forget words or feel groggy and boring, we still have to talk.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will.\u201dA week later, the doctors released her from the hospital. It felt like a breakup that neither person wanted.\u201cI\u2019ll call,\u201d she promised.The next few days, I thought about our time together: using black crayons as eyeliner after the nurses confiscated our makeup, cracking jokes that even the doctors laughed at and making \u201cWish you were here (instead of me)\u201d cards during art therapy.I was watching a manic patient scrub the already clean woodwork when another patient interrupted: \u201cHey, Anita\u2019s here for you, but they\u2019re taking her away.\u201dI bolted around the corner for the doors. Nurses were leading her out.\u201cAnita!\u201d I shouted.\u201cJeannie!\u201d She stretched out her arm as if she were a melodramatic actor in a soap opera, but the serious look in her eyes told me she wasn\u2019t acting. The nurses hurried her along. \u201cJeannie! They won\u2019t let me see you!\u201dAfter the doors locked behind her, I felt alone and listless.Minutes later I received a call from her on the patient phone. She explained the hospital\u2019s rule against former patients visiting current patients.\u201cLet me know when you get out,\u201d she said.In the weeks after I left the hospital, my vocabulary shrank as my medication dosage increased. Anita and I took turns calling each other.\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe this feeling,\u201d I told her.\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a feeling.\u201dWe struggled to be ambassadors of optimism. \u201cThings will get better,\u201d we took turns saying, even though we doubted it for ourselves. We discussed side effects of medication and our attempts to hide our bipolar diagnosis from acquaintances and even some friends. We also bonded over our mutual hatred of group therapy.Our doctors and health insurance companies had basically demanded that we attend partial hospitalization programs. Think: full-time group therapy, ranging from dance therapy to anger management. Reluctantly, I took a leave of absence from my poetry program and she took a leave of absence from her job.In the evenings, she and I talked about how silly much of it seemed. I raged against dance therapy, while Anita believed she was secretly being given academic tests during her sessions, which felt unfair, as her medication fogged her thinking. Soon enough, she returned to inpatient, and this time she hated it.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same without you there,\u201d she said afterward.A few months later I would return, too, because my medications had stopped working. It didn\u2019t matter that my psychiatrist had increased my antipsychotic dosage. A meteor, an asteroid and a cat toy were signs from the universe, and I\u2019d gained 20 pounds.But this time I couldn\u2019t tolerate the other patients: the actor who complained about high-fructose corn syrup in the ketchup (\u201cGet over it!\u201d I finally shouted), the stockbroker who snapped at the nicest nurse, the musician with Asperger\u2019s.I asked the nicest nurse if she could overrule the hospital policy about former patients visiting.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be good for treatment,\u201d she said.\u201cAnita\u2019s or mine?\u201d I asked.\u201cNeither.\u201dWhen my new roommate arrived, she apologized for her depressed mood. She had been a patient when Anita and I were roommates. Last time, this patient felt suicidal; this time, she had stabbed herself in the chest. She lifted her shirt to show me her scars.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be as much fun as Anita,\u201d she said. \u201cOr much fun at all.\u201d\u201cNo, no,\u201d I told her. \u201cThis place isn\u2019t supposed to be fun.\u201dAnd then it hit me: Maybe that\u2019s why the rule exists.Anita and I used to lie to our friends that we met at some event in grad school. Now we tell them the truth: \u201cWe were roommates in the psych ward.\u201d Then we laugh. \u201cNo, really,\u201d we say, because things have gotten better.Neither of us has been hospitalized for years. In this time, we have earned multiple graduate degrees. (Graduate school can be an excellent place for someone with a mental illness to hide out.) She secured a job that I don\u2019t fully understand, something about pharmaceutical investments. I\u2019m a creative writing professor.None of this came easily. We credit doctors, therapists, friends, family, the Affordable Care Act and, of course, each other. I still slip into mania and depression. Depression feels like a room with no exits. Mania, I won\u2019t lie, feels great \u2014 at least that\u2019s how I remember it. Last week, I contemplated tapering off my meds, or lowering them.\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d Anita told me.Mania rarely lasts for longer than a month, she reminded me. It usually dips into a mixed or depressed state. If depression is a room with no exits, a mixed state is a room with no exits and an anxious crowd.I explained that I wasn\u2019t getting any writing done. Maybe one manic month, I told her, would be worth it for my writing.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just finish a book?\u201d she asked.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count,\u201d I said.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m not writing now.\u201d\u201cCould you take a break?\u201d she asked.\u201cThat sounds miserable.\u201d\u201cThen can you try writing something short?\u201d\u201cI could try,\u201d I said, not even thinking I would write about us.\u201cSee what happens if you try.\u201dmodernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Allegations, a Call for Essex County College\u2019s Board to Resign", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe demands, from a group of pastors representing about 20,000 congregants in Essex County, which includes Newark, came at a news conference held before a raucous four-hour meeting of the board.The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which grants accreditation to area colleges, warned in November that the 51-year-old two-year college was in danger of losing its accreditation because it did not comply with the group\u2019s standards on governance structure, lacked financial controls and conflict of interest rules and had trouble retaining students.The institution is also facing declining enrollment and financial difficulties, as well as possible sanctions from the United States Department of Education for submitting late audits, said Anthony Munroe, the college\u2019s president, who has been in office for a little more than three months.Mr. Munroe said the college\u2019s official reply to the commission was submitted Thursday evening, one day before it was due and immediately after the board voted unanimously to approve it. The commission will send monitors to the school in October.But even the college\u2019s early response to the commission\u2019s warnings caused controversy. The response was lacking, said the clergy members, because the school had yet to name a chief financial officer to help address concerns about its financial controls and governance.Critics have blamed Joyce Harley, the school\u2019s vice president of administration and finance, for much of the turbulence, saying that she is doing the bidding of Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., the Essex County executive.Ms. Harley formerly worked as Essex County administrator, appointed by Mr. DiVincenzo, who also backed her, unsuccessfully, to become president of the college. Although the college is supposed to be independent, Mr. DiVincenzo appoints many of the board members.The college has had three presidents since the resignation of the highly regarded and longtime former president A. Zachary Yamba in 2010. Mr. Yamba\u2019s supporters say the college owes him money from the months after he came out of retirement to try, unsuccessfully, to stem chaos at the institution where the main campus building is named in his honor.There are also several lawsuits from employees claiming wrongful termination and whistle-blower protection, some of which name Ms. Harley as a defendant.\u201cWhat you have here is a cancer in your organization and you have to do something about it or it will take over your entire body,\u201d said the Rev. H. William Rutherford, III, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Orange.Critics say it was Ms. Harley who scuttled the most recent attempt by Mr. Munroe to hire a chief financial officer, a charge she does not deny.\u201cI did not find that candidate worthy,\u201d said Ms. Harley who said she decided to speak during the public comment section of the board meeting because so many accusations had been hurled at her. \u201cThis was not the right place for that particular person,\u201d she added.Ms. Harley accused Mr. Munroe of altering the qualifications of the job description while also changing the school\u2019s governance structure so that the chief financial officer reported directly to him instead of the vice president of administration and finance.\u201cI did not ask for the C.F.O. to report to me. The board put that structure up,\u201d Ms. Harley said. \u201cThose are the rules. I follow the rules.\u201dThe idea that the financial officer would report to anyone other than the president is indicative of the depth of the problems the college is facing, the religious leaders said.Ms. Harley did not directly respond to calls for her resignation but quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during her remarks.\u201cWhen you stand up and you speak up and you speak truth to power, you will often be vilified and demonized,\u201d she said.Mr. DiVincenzo, who clergy leaders thought would attend the news conference or the board meeting, instead issued a statement saying the college was at a \u201ccritical crossroads\u201d while denying any wrongdoing.\u201cAlthough I nominate members to the board of trustees, I have never interfered with college business,\u201d Mr. DiVincenzo said. \u201cThis is a landmark institution that has nurtured the American dream for generations of students. It cannot and will not fail.\u201dMr. DiVincenzo\u2019s comment about the college\u2019s importance was the only thing the two sides seem to agree on.Speaker after speaker spoke of the college\u2019s survival as a civil rights issue because of the opportunity it provides to the 15,000 mostly black and Latino students who attend. Many Essex County College students hope to move on to a four-year institution such as Rutgers University.\u201cI believe in what this institution stands for,\u201d said Mr. Munroe, the former president of Malcolm X College in Chicago.He called the challenges serious but said that he has begun to put into effect both short-term and long-term solutions.\u201cYou hired me to do a job. Allow me to do my job,\u201d Mr. Munroe said to thunderous applause in a speech at the end of the meeting.Tarrick Tucker attended the college from 2012 to 2016 and graduated with an associate in science degree in paralegal studies.\u201cThe school, to me, meant chance after chance after chance. The people I\u2019m losing on the streets need this chance,\u201d Mr. Tucker said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Goes All In on a Tax Overhaul Whose Details Remain Unwritten", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is doubling down this week on his bid to remake the tax code, meeting with Democrats, tying tax legislation to hurricane recovery and dispatching his economic team to Capitol Hill almost daily to prod lawmakers into action.But he is bringing to the game a relatively weak team \u2014 a chief economic adviser whom he has openly disparaged and a Treasury secretary whose counsel he has dismissed \u2014 and is promoting quick passage of a new tax code that has yet to be written as members of his party bicker over the details.The urgency was evident on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump urged Congress to \u201cmove fast,\u201d and Republican leaders seemed ready. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told House Republicans that the administration and congressional Republicans would release a detailed framework of their plan during the week of Sept. 25, with the goal of taking up legislation in late October.But Republicans remain divided on key details: whether they can meet Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for a 15 percent corporate tax rate; which small businesses and partnerships would qualify for a new low business tax rate; whether tax cuts in the package should be paid for by closing loopholes; and whether hedge fund and private equity managers would continue to see their huge fees taxed at the low rate of capital gains instead of at income tax rates.Democrats have said they will reject any package that they see as skewed toward the rich, especially if it repeals the estate tax, as the president wants.Then there is a tough interim step: Republicans must pass a budget resolution to unlock the procedural tool that would let them move a bill through the Senate with a simple majority. Congressional leaders are bracing for a fight over that budget blueprint.But Mr. Trump made clear on Wednesday that he was ready to deal. At a bipartisan gathering of House members at the White House, the president said that he wanted a tax bill that benefited the middle class. He tried to ease concerns that he was preparing to give a windfall to the rich.\u201cThe rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are.\u201dHe added about their tax rates, \u201cIf they have to go higher, they\u2019ll go higher.\u201dRepresentative Kurt Schrader, Democrat of Oregon, emerged from the meeting encouraged.\u201cI took that as a signal that he\u2019s not concerned about the upper 1 percent or 5 percent, he\u2019s concerned about hopefully middle-class Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cProof\u2019s in the pudding. We\u2019ll see how it comes out.\u201dThat gathering was one of a series of bipartisan efforts to push the tax overhaul. He held a dinner Tuesday night with senators from both parties where tax matters dominated the conversation. On Wednesday night, the president was set to dine with Congress\u2019s top Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.Their stature stands in contrast to the experienced players who shepherded the last major tax overhaul in 1986.Last week, Mr. Trump blindsided Mr. Mnuchin during negotiations over lifting the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit \u2014 an issue that is central to the job of Treasury secretary. Mr. Mnuchin was pushing for an 18-month extension of the debt limit before Mr. Trump interrupted him and sided with Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, who wanted a three-month extension.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted this week that Mr. Trump had \u201cconfidence\u201d in Mr. Mnuchin, but the rift over the debt limit left many observers wondering if his public stances on taxes could still be trusted.\u201cMnuchin might be the smartest man in the world, but he doesn\u2019t have any substantive tax credentials other than being a businessman,\u201d said Ronald A. Pearlman, the Treasury Department\u2019s assistant secretary for tax policy in the mid-1980s. \u201cIn terms of conceptualizing a new corporate tax system, I can\u2019t imagine he brings a lot to the table.\u201dIn public, those who have been working closest with Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin have been quick to defend them after slights from the president.\u201cThey\u2019ve been terrific on tax reform,\u201d Mr. Brady, the Texas congressman, said. \u201cThey bring policy expertise to the table within their agencies, they bring real-life expertise to the table.\u201dLawmakers from both parties have invoked President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 tax act as a model of comprehensiveness and bipartisanship that they should be striving for, but those who lived through that experience say that bold promises of rewriting the tax code in the next few months sound na\u00efve.Reagan\u2019s tax act was two years in the making and in many ways a response to the ill effects of the tax cuts that he had passed in 1981. His Treasury Department released hundreds of pages of policy details before Congress began bipartisan brokering.Former Senator Robert Packwood, the Oregon Republican who was the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1986, recalled the close relationship between Reagan; James A. Baker III, his Treasury secretary; and Richard G. Darman, who was Mr. Baker\u2019s deputy.\u201cHe had a lot of government experience, and he was sensational at being able to speak for the administration,\u201d Mr. Packwood said of Mr. Darman. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an insider in Treasury like a Darman that everybody would have faith in on the congressional side.\u201dTo be sure, there were clashes and second-guessing within Reagan\u2019s team and with Congress in the early 1980s. The fact that those issues were overcome suggests it is not too late for the Trump economic team to find its footing.Mr. Pearlman noted that it remains early in the process, and that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Cohn remain major players. Moreover, the daily distractions are not likely to faze those who are crunching the numbers.\u201cMy guess is that the staff will work as if nothing is going on,\u201d Mr. Pearlman said.Some Democrats said they had been impressed by the intelligence and business perspective of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, in spite of their occasional bursts of New York bravado. And Democrats who attended Wednesday\u2019s White House meeting credited Mr. Trump for his professed openness to working with them.Still, Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who went to the meeting, worried that their input was coming too late in the process.\u201cThe first bipartisan meeting where tax reform was a serious topic was the one convened by President Trump. That was a good thing,\u201d Mr. Welch said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it is going to cure the partisan nature of the secret process that has been long underway.\u201dRepresentative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, recalled Mr. Cohn\u2019s coming to his office this year and vowing to rip the tax code up by its roots and revolutionize the system.\u201cI said to him: \u2018I want you to know something. Six secretaries of the Treasury have sat there and told me exactly what you\u2019ve told me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Neal said.Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Mars Vision: A One-Size-Fits-All Rocket. A Very Big One.", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe key is a new rocket \u2014 smaller than the one he described at a conference in Mexico last year but still bigger than anything ever launched \u2014 and a new spaceship.Speaking on Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia, Mr. Musk said he had figured out a workable business plan, although his presentation lacked financial figures to back up his assertions.But he did not convincingly explain then how SpaceX, still a company of modest size and revenues, could finance such an ambitious project.\u201cNow we think we have a better way to do it,\u201d he said Friday.The new rocket and spaceship would replace everything that SpaceX is currently launching or plans to launch in the near future. \u201cThat\u2019s really fundamental,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The slimmed-down rocket would be nine meters, or about 30 feet, in diameter instead of the 12-meter behemoth he described last year. It would still be more powerful than the Saturn 5 rocket that took NASA astronauts to the moon. Mr. Musk called it B.F.R. (The \u201cB\u201d stands for \u201cbig\u201d; the \u201cR\u201d is for \u201crocket.\u201d) The B.F.R. would be able to lift 150 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, Mr. Musk said.For Mars colonists, the rocket would lift a spaceship with 40 cabins, and with two to three people per cabin, it would carry about 100 people per flight. After launching, the B.F.R. booster would return to the launching pad; the spaceship would continue to orbit, where it would refill its tanks of methane and oxygen propellant before embarking on the monthslong journey to Mars.But with the smaller size, the B.F.R. would also be useful much closer to Earth, Mr. Musk said. He said it would be able to take over the launching duties of SpaceX\u2019s current Falcon 9 rocket, taking many satellites to orbit at once, as well as ferry cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. A variation of the spaceship could be used to collect and dispose of relics of satellite and other debris cluttering low-Earth orbit, he said.Because all parts of the rocket and the spaceship are to be fully reusable, the cost of operating them would be low.Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates human exploration and settlement of the planet, liked the changes that Mr. Musk has made. \u201cThis is a much more practical approach than he presented last year,\u201d Dr. Zubrin said. \u201cIt means he is serious.\u201dThe same spaceship could also land on the moon. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cWe should have a lunar base by now.\u201dEven on Earth, the rockets, traveling at up to 18,000 miles per hour, could make long-distance trips short \u2014 New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes, for example. Any two points on Earth would be less than an hour apart, Mr. Musk said.After the presentation, Mr. Musk took to Instagram to elaborate on the price of those round-the-world rocket flights: \u201cCost per seat should be about the same as full fare economy in an aircraft. Forgot to mention that.\u201dMr. Musk maintained a highly optimistic schedule for his Mars dreams. He said the company had already started work to build pieces of the new rocket.A cargo mission, without any passengers, could launch as early as 2022. \u201cThat\u2019s not a typo, although it is aspirational,\u201d he said. \u201cFive years feels like a long time to me.\u201dTwo years later, the next time that Mars and Earth would swing by each other, SpaceX would launch four B.F.R.s to Mars \u2014 two carrying cargo, two carrying people.In the lead-up to Mr. Musk\u2019s talk on Friday, the main entrance to the Adelaide Convention Center was closed and locked, with a swell of people outside waiting to get in.\u201cHe\u2019s such an iconic character,\u201d said Paris Michaels, the chief executive of Air@Wave Communications in Sydney, who attended the congress. \u201cI planned the day around making this event. I\u2019m taking a later flight home, even though I\u2019m averaging two hours\u2019 sleep this week.\u201dFrom Mars orbit, astronauts could control robotic explorers like rovers and flying drones.Mars Base Camp is more of a suggestion to NASA of what the agency could do rather than a corporate strategy that Lockheed Martin would pursue by itself.\u201cThis isn\u2019t Lockheed Martin\u2019s vision, and it\u2019s not the only vision of how to get to Mars, but we put it out here so that we can globally begin the dialogue,\u201d Robert Chambers, an engineer working on the Mars Base Camp concept, said during the presentation.Unlike Mr. Musk\u2019s dreams, Mars Base Camp would not require unproven business plans or novel technologies far beyond what already exists or is already in development. \u201cWe know how to do this,\u201d Mr. Chambers said.The spacecraft, which looks as one might expect a traditional NASA expeditionary mission to Mars to look, would incorporate both the Orion crew capsule that Lockheed Martin is building for NASA deep-space missions and the agency\u2019s plans to put a space station high above the moon. This week, the Russian space agency announced that it would like to collaborate with NASA on this lunar space station, called the Deep Space Gateway.Lockheed Martin is one of six companies that NASA selected to develop a prototype of a habitat module that could be used for the Deep Space Gateway. Lockheed Martin officials said their vision for Mars Base Camp did not depend on their design\u2019s being selected.The Mars Base Camp proposal would also fit within the NASA budget, Lockheed Martin officials said.This year\u2019s update unveiled a reusable, hydrogen-fueled lander that would take astronauts to the Martian surface on a follow-up mission. Up to four astronauts could live on the Martian surface for two weeks at a time in the lander.Reflecting the interest of many to return to the moon before going to Mars, Lockheed Martin officials said the lander could also be used to travel to different parts of the moon from the Deep Space Gateway.Adam Baidawi reported from Adelaide, and Kenneth Chang from New York.Advertisement"}

The four-bedroom, four-bath house, built in 2014, has treetop views and limited vistas of the downtown skyline of Sandton, a business hub nearby, from the second floor.A long driveway leads to the parking court in front of the main entrance, said Lynda Greeff, a saleswoman with Pam Golding Properties Gauteng, which has the listing. There is a two-car garage on either side of the staircase to this entrance.The house, which is in a gated community, has an open layout and a double-height foyer. To the left of the foyer is a quarter-turn staircase with stainless-steel railings and an alcove leading to a guest suite with a balcony and an en-suite bath. To the right is a study with sliding glass doors that open to the yard.There are floor-to-ceiling glass walls throughout the house. In the living and dining areas, which are separated by a gas fireplace, the walls stack back and can be opened to the lawn and a solar-heated pool at the center of this walled property.The kitchen has glossy laminate cabinetry, Caesarstone counters, a center island with room for stools and a Smeg cooktop and stove; it is connected to a pantry and a laundry room.Upstairs, a central den opens to the master suite and two bedrooms, all of which are carpeted. The master bedroom has a gas fireplace; a separate dressing room with built-in cabinetry; a balcony overlooking the yard and pool; and a bathroom with a double vanity, a spa tub and an oversized shower. The other two bedrooms also have built-in cabinetry, balconies and en-suite baths. There are wall-mounted air-conditioners throughout the house.The garage level includes a wine cellar and access to both garages. There is another outside entrance to a separate bedroom and full bath, Ms. Greeff said.Bryanston, a diverse and affluent suburb, has about 29,000 residents, as well as \u201cexcellent private schools and some amazing shopping centers,\u201d said Francois Rohlandt, a property consultant for Pam Golding Properties Gauteng who shares the listing with Ms. Greeff. This house is about six miles from the Sandton business district and five minutes from supermarkets, pharmacies, boutiques and restaurants. Central Johannesburg is about 14 miles away, or about a 30-minute drive, and O.R. Tambo International Airport is about a 35-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cHome prices are very undervalued\u201d in Johannesburg, said Ronald Ennik, the principal of Ennik Estates, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest it\u2019s been in 20 years.\u201dIn northern suburbs like Hyde Park, Sandhurst, Westcliff, Bryanston, Rosebank and Sandton, Mr. Ennik said, \u201cbuyers are really few at the top end,\u201d and there is \u201can oversupply of stock.\u201dAs Mr. Finnemore put it, \u201cThe more affordable and middle housing bands are tending to outperform the higher-end, luxury segment of the market.\u201dThe problems aren\u2019t entirely recent either, said Lew Geffen, the chairman of Lew Geffen Sotheby\u2019s International Realty: \u201cThe Johannesburg market has been a roller coaster since 2012.\u201d When the 2008 global recession began to ease five years ago, he said, the property market was buoyant, but that did not last.In early 2016, Mr. Geffen said, the market changed course to favor buyers over sellers, in \u201ca reflection of the depreciation of the local currency, a loss of investor confidence as a result of a sharp decline in political leadership faith and the resultant stagnation of the national economy.\u201dAt the same time, many Johannesburg homeowners moved to Cape Town, fueling its property market to the detriment of Johannesburg\u2019s, Mr. Ennik said. But in the past three or four months, with the recession over and the rand and interest rates stabilizing, he said, the market is steadying and \u201cfinally beginning to come right.\u201dA number of new commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums are being built, he said, with new development fetching 30 percent more than resales of existing properties.And more inventory is coming on the market \u201cat the correct price level,\u201d Mr. Geffen said, so it\u2019s easier to sell. But at the high end of the market, he added, people are still cautious about taking on properties that will be costly to maintain.WHO BUYS IN JOHANNESBURG Buyers from Africa \u2013 Nigeria, Angola, Ghana, Uganda, Gabon, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Congo and Mozambique \u2014 make up \u201can increasing proportion\u201d of foreigners buying in the Johannesburg metropolitan area, Mr. Finnemore said. There has also been an increase in buyers from China and India, Mr. Ennik said.Those from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, he added, typically work for multinational companies in the area.But as Mr. Geffen noted, the \u201cpercentage of foreign second-home purchases is so small as to be statistically irrelevant in Johannesburg,\u201d which has mostly primary residences and investor and corporate properties.BUYING BASICS\u201cLimitations on foreign property ownership in South Africa pertain solely to agricultural land,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy for foreigners to purchase property in urban areas.\u201dHowever, the maximum financing available to nonpermanent residents is 50 percent, Mr. Ennik said.Lawyers who specialize in property transfer are selected by the seller but represent both parties.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIES Zulu, English, Afrikaans, Sesotho; rand (1 rand = $.075)TAXES AND FEESProperty transfer taxes are paid on a sliding scale, depending on the price of the property. Local taxes differ from area to area.The annual taxes on this property are 2,236 rand (about $168) a month.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Has Changed His Mind \u2014 a Heck of a Lot", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWow, Donald Trump is all over the place.On Tuesday he had dinner with a few moderate Democrats and completely retooled his tax policy before dessert. This is the man who is having such a famous fling with the minority leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, that they no longer need identifying. Really, \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d are as famous as Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z. Victoria and Albert. Antony and Cleopatra.But about the tax policy dinner. The Democratic senators described their discussion as so harmonious it sounded \u2026 kind of boring. \u201cVery collegial and very businesslike,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota on a radio interview back home with talk show host Joel Heitkamp. (Yes, they\u2019re siblings. North Dakota is a very small state. Only 750,000 people. Yet as many senators as California or New York. Do you think that\u2019s fair? Never mind, I digress.)Democrats have been demanding that no tax cuts go to the wealthy, and over beef medallions, Trump gave the impression that was exactly what he wanted, too. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia reported that \u201cthe president was adamant from the get-go: \u2018This is not a tax cut for the rich, and I repeat that, this will not be a tax cut for me or any rich people.\u2019 That kind of started off the conversation and it went pretty good from there.\u201dNow Manchin and Heitkamp are two of the most conservative senators from their party. But still, this seems like an awful lot of agreeing. Trump has spent the last month howling about the need to cut the corporate tax rate in half, and he\u2019s been adamant about getting rid of the estate tax, which is imposed only on inheritances of more than $5 million.Do you think he\u2019s changed his mind? That the Democrats misheard? That the spinach was spiked with hallucinogens?On Wednesday Trump not only ditched his tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy plans, he claimed the rich might take a hit. \u201cIf they have to go higher they\u2019ll go higher,\u201d he told a bipartisan congressional group with the adorable name of the Problem Solvers Caucus. This seemed like good news except for the part about the president appearing to be sort of off his rocker.The only actual written-down Trump tax plan is a one-pager that includes what Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, calls a new \u201clunar-crater-size loophole\u201d on income for the wealthy. Plus the corporate tax cuts and the estate tax repeal.Hard to know when there will be something more substantial, with all this presidential hopping around. The Republicans claim they\u2019ll have a real tax bill done soon. A while back, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn promised a detailed version would be done \u201cby the end of the summer.\u201dI guess if you wanted to be stupendously technical, that could mean they\u2019ve still got until next week, when the autumnal equinox occurs as the sun crosses the celestial Equator. Perhaps the president will watch it happen, shielding his eyes with a new two-page bill.It\u2019s ironic that an administration so money-centric has so many inept cabinet members handling financial policy. Even in a group full of negative star power, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stands out. Last week, when the Republicans were angrily reacting to the Trump-Democrat deal on raising the debt limit, he asked the irate legislators to do it \u201cfor me.\u201d This plea went over well in the sense that nobody actually pummeled Mnuchin with tomatoes.Still, Trump is ready to roll. Details, schmeetails. \u201cWith Irma and Harvey devastation, Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cGo Congress, go!\u201d Negative thinkers pointed out that the hurricane devastation required federal spending, not revenue reduction. Also that \u201cis needed\u201d was grammatically \u2026 tragic.Plus, again, the no-plan thing. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to understand \u2014 the administration is urging Congress to vote fast on a proposal that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. The center made a rather heroic effort to figure out what the consequences would be if you cobbled a proposal out of all the tax stuff Trump has mentioned, and concluded it would add about $8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.There\u2019s a plus side to all this craziness. It\u2019s better to have a president who flips around like a jumping bean to one who has a disciplined, well-thought-out strategy for handing corporate America and hedge fund owners more tax breaks.You don\u2019t want all that much consistency when you\u2019ve got a chief executive whose recent triumph in regulatory reform was to roll back the requirement that new highways be protected against flooding \u2014 10 days before the first hurricane.And of course there are people like Senator Wyden who dreamed of doing something useful and bipartisan this term, and all the chaos makes them feel sad and hopeless.Still, things could be worse. Pass the biscuits.Nicholas Kristof is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is There a Cryptocurrency Bubble? Just Ask Doge.", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftVery bubble. Much scam. So avoid.Mr. Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, was an early fan of cryptocurrency, a form of encrypted digital money that is traded from person to person. He saw investors talking about Bitcoin, the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, and wanted to find a way to poke fun at the hype surrounding the emerging technology.So in 2013, he built his own cryptocurrency, a satirical mash-up that combined Bitcoin with the Doge meme he\u2019d seen on social media. Mr. Palmer hoped to use Dogecoin to show the absurdity of wagering huge sums of money on unstable ventures.Today, Mr. Palmer, 30, is one of the loudest voices warning that a similar fate might soon befall the entire cryptocurrency industry.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to crypto now is what happened to Dogecoin,\u201d Mr. Palmer told me in a recent interview. \u201cI\u2019m worried that this time, it\u2019s on a much grander scale.\u201dBut there remains no bigger mania among tech investors than cryptocurrency, which some see as an eventual replacement for traditional, government-issued money. Even with the recent declines, the price of Bitcoin has more than tripled this year; another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has gained more than 2,300 percent. The success of these currencies has minted a new class of \u201ccrypto-millionaires\u201d and spawned hundreds of other digital currencies, called altcoins. In addition, it has given rise to an entire category of start-ups that take advantage of cryptocurrency\u2019s public ledger system, known as the blockchain.(If you\u2019re having trouble picturing it: Imagine that a friend is building a casino and asks you to invest. In exchange, you get chips that can be used at the casino\u2019s tables once it\u2019s finished. Now imagine that the value of the chips isn\u2019t fixed, and will instead fluctuate depending on the popularity of the casino, the number of other gamblers and the regulatory environment for casinos. Oh, and instead of a friend, imagine it\u2019s a stranger on the internet who might be using a fake name, who might not actually know how to build a casino, and whom you probably can\u2019t sue for fraud if he steals your money and uses it to buy a Porsche instead. That\u2019s an I.C.O.)Despite the obvious risks of these ventures, investor appetite has been ravenous. A group of Bay Area programmers this year used an I.C.O. to raise $35 million for their project, an anonymous web browser called Brave, in less than 30 seconds. There have been 140 coin offerings in 2017 that have raised a total of $2.1 billion from investors, according to Coinschedule, a website that tracks the activity.Mr. Palmer predicts that while some I.C.O.s may finance the creation of new and exciting enterprises, many will go up in smoke. He sees echoes of the first dot-com boom, when investors poured money into new and risky ventures only to get burned when the market came to its senses.\u201cPeople are treating cryptocurrency now like penny stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a securities market.\u201dWhen Mr. Palmer\u2019s interest in digital money began, just four years ago, cryptocurrency was the sole province of math geeks and early adopters.\u201cIt was fun, nobody took it seriously,\u201d he recalled. \u201cPeople threw it around like change because it wasn\u2019t worth anything.\u201dAs the price of Bitcoin climbed, investors got interested in other cryptocurrencies. With no explanation, the price of Dogecoin doubled, then tripled. Two months after it was introduced, Mr. Palmer\u2019s joke was worth $50 million, and some early Dogecoin adopters, who called themselves \u201cshibes,\u201d were sitting on lucrative stockpiles.The success of Dogecoin attracted unsavory characters. One scammer raised $750,000 from Dogecoin supporters for a cryptocurrency start-up that never materialized. A hacker broke into Dogewallet, a website where users stored their coins, and stole thousands of dollars worth of the currency. Soon, the Dogecoin Reddit forum was full of angry scam victims and get-rich-quick schemers, and the once tight-knit Dogecoin community started to disintegrate.\u201cWe tried to do everything right,\u201d said Ben Doernberg, a former board member of the Dogecoin Foundation. \u201cBut when you have a situation where people stand to put in a dollar and take out a thousand dollars, people lose their minds.\u201dMr. Palmer, a laid-back Australian who works as a product manager in the Bay Area and describes himself as \u201csocialist leaning,\u201d was disturbed by the commercialization of his joke currency. He had never collected Dogecoin for himself, and had resisted efforts to cash in on the currency\u2019s success, even turning down a $500,000 investment offer from an Australian venture capital firm.\u201cMy mission in all of this is to help people better understand things, rather than just thinking about profit,\u201d he said.Mr. Palmer worries that the coming reckoning in the cryptocurrency market \u2014 and it is coming, he says confidently \u2014 will deter people from using the technology for more legitimate projects.\u201cThe bigger this bubble goes, the bigger negative connotation it\u2019s going to have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like the dot-com bust, but on a much more epic scale.\u201dFollow Kevin Roose on Twitter @kevinroose.Advertisement"}

(Dad is fine, as is his house, so we were lucky.)Along the way, Equifax started listening. It agreed to waive freeze fees for a while and automatically refund the money that people had spent on freezes before it made that decision. It also adjusted the PINs and agreed to issue new ones to anyone who wanted one. Still, many readers reported that they were having trouble getting PINs in the first place, and the company wasn\u2019t making it easy for people who did want new PINs to get through on the phones and keep their current freezes intact while changing the PINs.It\u2019s hard to think of a single thing that\u2019s gone right in the wake of this breach, and in my 12 years of writing personal finance columns for The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, I can\u2019t recall any consumer transgression this widespread and potentially consequential that did not kill or injure.Equifax is now a company desperately in need of some kind of public face \u2014 a human being who can apologize in an unscripted manner.

Johan Gustafsson, then a 36-year-old engineer, set off with a friend to see the continent, \u201cnot just read about it in books,\u201d he later said. His biggest concern was traffic accidents.Twenty-four hours after he arrived in Timbuktu, Mali, Mr. Gustafsson was taken hostage from his hotel at gunpoint. He and two other tourists were herded into the back of a pickup truck. A fourth man, a German tourist, resisted and was shot dead on the spot.That was Nov. 25, 2011, the beginning of an almost six-year ordeal for Mr. Gustafsson, who was held for ransom in the Sahara by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, the North African branch of Al Qaeda, until he was freed this year.More than two months after Mr. Gustafsson was driven out of the desert, he shared his story of captivity for the first time at a museum in Stockholm.During the first harrowing months in the desert, he and the others were blindfolded, bound and moved countless times. The threat of execution hung over them. In one of the many ransom videos they were forced to make, they had to wear orange \u201cGuant\u00e1namo\u201d suits, like those worn by the detainees at the United States military prison in Cuba, and to plead for their lives.\u201cI tried to explain that I am Swedish,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat we also think Guant\u00e1namo is unlawful and counterproductive.\u201dFour months into captivity, the hostages made a strategic decision to convert to Islam. \u201cIt was to save my life,\u201d he said. After the conversion they were no longer isolated, shackled or forced to plead for their lives in the many ransom videos that were made.\u201cI see that as the most clear evidence that it actually helped change my situation,\u201d he said.Mr. Gustafsson told his captors that his government would never pay. When he was released, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister said it was the result of years of diplomatic efforts, not ransom.But Magnus Ranstorp, a counterterrorism and security expert with the Swedish Defense University, said it was unlikely that some form of exchange did not take place.\u201cThe only thing we know for sure is that not a single hostage has been released without payment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a charitable organization.\u201dA retired European intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that 3.5 million euros, or about $4.2 million, had been paid and negotiated through the South African charity Gift of the Givers Foundation for the release of Mr. McGown.While the United States and Britain adhere to strict no-ransom policies, countries like France and Germany have taken bags full of cash disguised as humanitarian aid to the desert.From his view inside their camps, Mr. Gustafsson said it was evident his captors had resources.\u201cThey\u2019re well financed nowadays,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say they didn\u2019t used to be, but now they are, and it\u2019s not difficult to figure out that that is actually the money that has been paid by European governments.\u201dAl Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb rose to prominence more than a decade ago largely because of extraordinary ransom payments, which started in 2003 with the abduction of 32 European tourists who were freed after governments paid an estimated \u20ac5 million, or about $6 million.After their conversion to Islam, the hostages prayed, ate and sat with their kidnappers. There was no need for prison walls when the Sahara stretched for hundreds of miles in every direction.For the next five years, they moved hundreds of times, living outdoors and being guarded by about a dozen rotating men and boys.Mr. Gustafsson said life in the desert was a cross between \u201ca prison sentence and Robinson Crusoe.\u201d\u201cWe are a group of young guys hanging out in a sandbox, living through the same things \u2014 sand storms, problems with the car. If we don\u2019t have water, it\u2019s the same for all of us.\u201dBetween prayers, he occupied himself with exercising and learning the languages of his captors \u2014 local languages, Arabic, French.Mali, a former French colony, has seen decades of tension between the south, where the economic and political power is concentrated, and the minority populations in the north. In the beginning of 2012, a Tuareg separatist movement calling for a new state, \u201cAzawad,\u201d swept down from the north.In January 2013, French forces moved into the north. There were fighter planes in the air, and the kidnappers were constantly on the run, decamping at the first hint of a surveillance plane or anything suspicious, said Mr. Gustafsson. The hostages stopped counting the moves after they got to 100.Mr. Gustafsson saw the flights above as an opportunity to escape, and he tried it once, walking into the desert, thinking that they might not dare follow him.But after he wandered in the desert for two nights, his captors tracked him down. \u201cI think actually I would have walked to my death,\u201d he said.His kidnappers were a motley crew with varying levels of piety. The leaders belonged to a tough, power-hungry religious sect based in Algeria. They had quietly infiltrated Mali over the past 15 years, trying to impose Shariah law and recruiting radicalized migrants from nearby countries who were in it for the cause \u2014 and the adventure.The local recruits from Mali, mostly Arabs and Tuaregs from the desert and desert cities, were motivated by financial opportunity, according to Mr. Gustafsson, as well as a hatred toward the power wielded in the south. They were illiterate, but knew everything about surviving in the desert.Although Mr. Gustafsson was freed in June, it was only recently that he stopped saying \u201cIn the name of God\u201d before every meal. Other habits acquired in the desert will take longer to change. He still sleeps with his head under the covers to \u201ckeep out the sand,\u201d and he doesn\u2019t bury his hands under the pillow where scorpions might burrow.\u201cOf course it changes you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s difficult to put your finger on. But I\u2019m getting out of it. I\u2019m learning to switch.\u201dWill he ever go back to the Sahara? He said he would, if it were safe.\u201cI\u2019m not going to miss those guys, but I\u2019m going to miss the desert, the vastness, the night skies,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you live there, you learn the landscape. You know where the wind comes from at different times of the year. You know how the storms move. All of this is just so majestic.\u201dRukmini Callimachi contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Now it\u2019s trying a different approach.Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.A beefier hardware team should also help Google bring much more of the design in-house. It should also help it realize some of its bigger smartphone hardware ambitions, which include things like making its own SoCs and building machine learning coprocessors.FlashbackGoogle was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later.The decision to buy Motorola was \u201cthe extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that\u2019s not a fixer-upper.\u201dStandard & Poor\u2019s move, which cut China\u2019s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999.

It is believed the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk.The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.\u201cSo, as you may have read, I was fired by the president of the United States.\u201dThe HighlightAt the start of the podcast, Mr. Bharara recounted his interactions with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to his dismissal as a United States attorney.

{"Headline": "How Big Banks Became Our Masters", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTen years on from the financial crisis, it\u2019s hard not to have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Financial scandal and wrangles over financial rule-making still dominate the headlines. The cyberhacking at Equifax compromised personal records for half of the adult population of the United States. At SoFi, a one-time fintech darling that offers student loans and other types of credit, the chief executive was forced to resign after revelations of sexual harassment and risky lending practices (the company misled investors about its finances and put inexperienced customer service representatives in charge of credit evaluations). The White House and Republicans in Congress in the meantime are trying to roll back hard-won banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.All of it brings to mind an acronym familiar to financial writers like myself \u2014 BOB, or \u201cbored of banking.\u201d Even some of us that cover the markets for a living can find ourselves BOB. Over the last 10 years, there has been so much financial scandal, so many battles between regulators and financiers, and so much complexity (more liquidity and less leverage with your tier one capital, anyone?) that a large swath of the public has become numb to the debate about how to make our financial system safer.That\u2019s a dangerous problem, because despite all of the wrangling and rule making, there\u2019s a core truth about our financial system that we have yet to comprehend fully: It isn\u2019t serving us, we\u2019re serving it.Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, envisioned financial services (and I stress the word \u201cservice\u201d) as an industry that didn\u2019t exist as an end in itself, but rather as a helpmeet to other types of business. Yet lending to Main Street is now a minority of what the largest banks in the country do. In the 1970s, most of their financial flows, which of course come directly from our savings, would have been funneled into new business investment. Today, only about 15 percent of the money coming out of the largest financial institutions goes to that purpose. The rest exists in a closed loop of trading; institutions facilitate and engage in the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets that mainly enriches the 20 percent of the population that owns 80 percent of that asset base. This doesn\u2019t help growth, but it does fuel the wealth gap.This fundamental shift in the business model of finance is what we should really be talking about \u2014 rather than the technocratic details of liquidity ratios or capital levels or even how to punish specific banking misdeeds. The big problem is that our banking system would no longer be recognizable to Adam Smith, who believed that for markets to work, all players must have equal access to information, transparent prices and a shared moral framework. Good luck with that today.While the largest banks can correctly claim that they have offloaded risky assets and bolstered the amount of cash on their balance sheets over the last decade, their business model has become fundamentally disconnected from the very people and entities it was designed to serve. Small community banks, which make up only 13 percent of all banking assets, do nearly half of all lending to small businesses. Big banks are about deal making. They serve mostly themselves, existing as the middle of the hourglass that is our economy, charging whatever rent they like for others to pass through. (Finance is one of the few industries in which fees have gone up as the sector as a whole has grown.) The financial industry, dominated by the biggest banks, provides only 4 percent of all jobs in the country, yet takes about a quarter of the corporate profit pie.Perhaps that\u2019s why companies of all stripes try to copy its model. Nonfinancial firms as a whole now get five times the revenue from purely financial activities as they did in the 1980s. Stock buybacks artificially drive up the price of corporate shares, enriching the C-suite. Airlines can make more hedging oil prices than selling coach seats. Drug companies spend as much time tax optimizing as they do worrying about which new compound to research. The largest Silicon Valley firms now use a good chunk of their spare cash to underwrite bond offerings the same way Goldman Sachs might.The blending of technology and finance has reached an apex with the creation of firms like SoFi, which put the same old models on big data steroids. It\u2019s an area we\u2019ll likely hear much more about. A couple of weeks ago, at the Senate Banking Committee hearings on fintech, lawmakers once again struggled with how to think about these latest lending crises. But it\u2019s not data or privacy or algorithms that are the fundamental issue with our financial system. It\u2019s the fact that the system itself has lost its core purpose.Finance has become the tail that wags the dog. Until we start talking about how to create a financial system that really serves society, rather than just trying to stay ahead of the misdeeds of one that doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll struggle in vain to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Main Street.An Op-Ed essay on Wednesday about big banks included an outdated description of the online lending start-up Social Finance, or SoFi. It no longer uses crowdsourcing to fund loans.Rana Foroohar, an associate editor and global business columnist at The Financial Times, is the author of \u201cMakers and Takers: How Wall Street Destroyed Main Street.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The False Promises in President Trump\u2019s Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe president\u2019s claim also defies history. Wages have long stagnated, despite tax cuts in the 1980s and 2000s, while profits, shareholder returns and executive pay have soared. Profits, whether lifted by favorable economic conditions, by tax cuts or by both, have not translated into employee raises and have instead been used for other purposes. One is to buy back stock, which lifts share prices and, by extension, executive compensation. Following a huge one-off corporate tax cut in 2004, big piles of corporate cash were also used to pay dividends to shareholders, settle legal issues and finance severance packages for layoffs.Then, too, there is the budget issue. Mr. Trump has proposed cutting the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, a point he emphasized on Wednesday despite warnings from his economic advisers that a cut that sizable would cause the deficit to explode. Separately, he and his advisers have also proposed ending taxation on the foreign profits of American corporations, even though such profits are often actually earned in the United States and simply relabeled as foreign through the use of complex accounting maneuvers.Over all, the cuts, paired with loophole closers, would cost at least $3.4 trillion in revenue in the first 10 years and $5.9 trillion over the following decade. The question is how House Republicans will deal with those potential deficits. Many of them have built their reputations as fiscal hawks. Even if they were inclined to set aside their professed aversion to deficits to pass a big tax cut, their scope for deficit financing has now been narrowed by the floods in Houston, which will force them to borrow and spend for relief and recovery efforts. That is a responsible thing to do in an emergency. Borrowing to cut taxes \u2014 akin to taking cash advances on a credit card \u2014 is not responsible, in good times or bad.The fixation on tax cuts is regrettable, because corporate tax reform is a worthy goal. Done right, it would lower the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent or so, bringing it more in line with the rates of other developed nations. It would also raise revenue by eliminating special-interest loopholes and enacting a small per-trade tax on financial transactions to account for the growth of financial markets in the nation\u2019s economy. As yet, there is no sign that Republicans are prepared to take that sensible path.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Help, Tab Media Targets Young and Cheeky on Campus", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American news operations of Tab Media are on a Brooklyn side street in a nondescript brick building that also houses an acupuncture studio and a mortgage lender.Most of the 13 editors working out of the office are younger than Taylor Swift. A white picnic table strewn with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts cups and magazines like Teen Vogue and The New Yorker doubles as a meeting hub. A box of wine is perched on a kitchenette microwave.The d\u00e9cor fits the mission. Tab, a British import that recently received financing from backers including Rupert Murdoch and the Knight Foundation, is largely unknown to the general public but is gaining currency on college campuses around the country. It relies on a network of unpaid student journalists who write about youth and campus culture. It also has a small cadre of writers commenting, usually snarkily, on issues of interest to young women.\u201cThe mind-set we\u2019re looking for is super hungry, anti-establishment and a little subversive,\u201d said Joshi Herrmann, who, at 28, is both editor in chief and office elder.Ambition is also part of the mix. Since starting in the United States two years ago, Tab has set out to become a touchstone for the 18-to-22-year-old demographic it believes is underserved by other news organizations.Jack Rivlin, who founded Tab Media with two other Cambridge University students in 2009 and now splits his time between New York and London, envisions the enterprise as a generation-defining media brand \u00e0 la MTV.Other publications should beware, said Mr. Rivlin, 28, who jokes that he has only recently begun to grow facial hair: \u201cI want to eat their lunch.\u201dIn Tab\u2019s Williamsburg office \u2014 there\u2019s another in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 story ideas slingshot around the room, from the Pennsylvania State University hazing trial to wedding training programs at high schools to potential Dream Act-related deportations. There was also an idea from one correspondent to report on local sex parties by participating in several.Tab uses traditional journalism tools like Freedom of Information Act filings, door-to-door sleuthing and libel training. But it also digs deep into Reddit, excavates meme chains and cultivates gossip.Tab Media has two parts: The Tab, which publishes the college-centric content, and Babe, a website for young women that specializes in \u201cgood news reporting, trash trends, personal stories\u201d and stories about men with certain unappealing qualities and \u201cthe pettiest celebrity drama.\u201dEach month, 40 million people watch videos that the two outlets post on social media, according to data the company compiled from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. Ten million people a month visit Tab sites, with roughly two-thirds going The Tab and the rest to Babe, according to Tab\u2019s Google Analytics data.In the past year, 2,300 students globally have written for the organization, nearly 1,000 of them regularly. The Tab has outlets at every Ivy League university and plans to expand to more than 100 American campuses.Mr. Rivlin and The Tab\u2019s other founders came up with the idea for company while working for the Cambridge student newspaper, a stuffy publication that none of their friends read, he said.The Tab\u2019s name is a play on \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201cCantab,\u201d a nickname for Cambridge alums. The enterprise initially drew criticism for its \u201cTab Totty\u201d feature, which showcased photos of scantily clad female undergraduates. While that feature was quickly eliminated, two of The Tab\u2019s British outlets still run a \u201cRear of the Year\u201d competition.But the website, which soon spread to other British campuses, also featured exclusive stories about a student who fought for ISIS and a Cambridge student in white tie burning cash in front of a homeless man. In the United States, much larger media organizations made reference to The Tab\u2019s reporting on campus protests, and the publication delivered a scoop last year by reporting on Malia Obama\u2019s decision to attend Harvard.Mr. Herrmann, who first wrote for The Tab at Cambridge and later for The London Evening Standard, said that many of the volunteer writers sign up out of curiosity but eventually pursue media careers.That is partly because The Tab offers its reporters training about sourcing, social media and privacy and sends out regular emails with journalism job listings. Editors at the two headquarters are paid, but few of the reporters are, and only for significant projects.Roughly 70 percent of Tab Media\u2019s revenue \u2014 $600,000 in August, the company said \u2014 comes from sponsored stories commissioned by companies like Spotify and Unilever and written to resemble news articles. The rest comes from display advertising from companies like Netflix and Ikea.The company completed a round of financing this year that brought in $6 million for website improvements, training and special projects. The lead investor was News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.Mr. Rivlin said he and George Marangos-Gilks, one of the other founders, pitched the site to the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, using a 100-page book of printed Tab stories. Mr. Rivlin attended the meeting wearing shoes borrowed from a friend\u2019s father.

{"Headline": "On the College Campus of the Future, Parking May Be a Relic", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith just one parking space for every five people, on a campus of roughly 65,000, the University of Wisconsin-Madison has one of the lowest parking ratios of any major university in the country.To reduce the number of cars on campus, parking permits are off limits to students, who are instead encouraged to walk, bike or take the bus.Because visitors to the 936-acre campus often have a hard time finding parking, the university\u2019s latest master plan, nearing completion, recommends an additional 2,200 spaces over the next 20 to 40 years. But Gary A. Brown, the director of campus planning, is reluctant to add any spaces right away. When Mr. Brown looks into the future, he sees a campus even more reliant on ride-hailing services like Uber and car-sharing services like Zipcar, as well as the likely emergence of autonomous vehicles, trends that could substantially decrease parking demand.\u201cThe autonomous vehicle thing came up in the middle of our discussion on the master plan \u2014 at some point, that\u2019s going to impact how much parking we need,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we might not be building parking as fast, or if so, maybe we\u2019re going to design it differently so you can repurpose it for other uses.\u201dMore universities are beginning to consider where transportation is headed as they wrestle with parking woes, often one of the thorniest issues on campus. Over the last 20 years, many campuses have shifted their emphasis to manage the demand, rather than build more garages, out of a desire to reduce their carbon footprint, put valuable land to higher uses and avoid construction costs that can run $20,000 to $30,000 a space.The transportation technology \u201crevolution\u201d should only accentuate that trend, said Andy Cohen, a co-chief executive at Gensler, an architecture, design and planning firm with offices around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s a major issue for universities, especially where there are a lot of commuters,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThink about how massively the infrastructure\u2019s going to change, say, for a community college,\u201d which will probably need to provide sizable pickup and drop-off areas, instead of parking garages.In trying to meet current parking needs, without overbuilding for the near future, universities are faced with a tricky calculus. They typically use bonds to finance new garages, and pay for the bonds over 20 or 30 years with parking revenue, Mr. Brown said. \u201cYou want to make sure that that revenue will be generated,\u201d he said.Increasingly, campuses are focusing on managing demand instead, charging more for the most convenient spaces, running shuttles, subsidizing public transit passes, and adding bike and car-sharing services. Typically, universities have more parking availability than they think \u2014 they just are not using it efficiently, said David Lieb, a consultant with Walker Parking Consultants. His firm recently undertook a project for a large Midwestern university concerned about a parking shortage, and found that of 26,000 spaces on campus, about 7,000 farthest from the campus center were empty at peak hours.Tom Yardley, a principal with Nelson-Nygaard, a transportation planning firm, also tries to sell campuses on effective parking management, because it \u201ccan make a greener campus and create more open space,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the campuses that are attracting the most talent and the most interest from students.\u201dHis firm is working with a community college in Ohio with roughly 30,000 students, as it weighs whether to share investment in a new garage with neighboring institutions and businesses.\u201cThey\u2019re nervous about building a garage on their own because the autonomous-vehicle future could make garages into a bit of a liability by making them redundant,\u201d Mr. Yardley said. \u201cHow it looks could be quite different, maybe space that could be flexed to different uses.\u201dMr. Cohen advocates garage designs that use level rather than sloped floors and higher floor-to-ceiling heights so that the structures can be more easily converted to other uses, such as offices. The designs might increase the cost of a garage by 10 to 15 percent, he said, but the investment would pay off down the road with an easier retrofitting project.Some universities are building mixed-use garages, which can be a more efficient use of land and help ensure maximal use of spaces. Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill., has built two mixed-use garages in recent years, as part of a plan to move parking to the periphery of campus and free up more interior land for green space.\u201cWe believe that it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have space that is just for cars,\u201d said Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations. \u201cYou want to use the space in a thoughtful way.\u201dAt the University of South Carolina, in Columbia, the private-sector construction of thousands of apartments just off campus, with nearly as many parking spaces, has created an opportunity to rethink the need for aging garages on prime land in the center of campus, said Derrick Huggins, the vice president of facilities and transportation. A parking study underway will help officials determine how much parking space they really need, as more students are now able to walk, bike or take public transit to campus, he said.\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been working on for five years \u2014 the phenomenon of how this close proximity of private housing is impacting our campus,\u201d Mr. Huggins said.Santa Clara University, a Jesuit school in California with about 8,000 students, closed down some roads and parking lots in the center of its campus to create pedestrian malls. The university built a new parking structure farther out to replace those spaces, but it is working on reducing the number of cars on campus with incentives to use bikes, car shares and rail, said Tim O\u2019Keefe, the manager of business technology in university operations.\u201cI think it\u2019s a little premature to think about a reduction in parking spaces,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet seen a huge paradigm shift in the number of people coming to campus in alternative modes of transportation.\u201dHowever, last year, the university became among the first to begin testing a self-driving campus shuttle. Run by a start-up called Auro Robotics, the electric shuttle carried three passengers at a time, along with a safety engineer, in case of glitches.People with mobility impairments used the shuttle regularly, but it otherwise lacked consistent ridership, partly because it moved fairly slowly and covered a loop of just one mile, Mr. O\u2019Keefe said. The service stopped for the summer, but the university is talking with Auro about continuing with the shuttle, possibly with an expanded range.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Piles on Debt, Consumers Seek a Piece of the Action", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQIQIHAR, China \u2014 Over the past eight years, to the world\u2019s growing alarm, China\u2019s big state-owned companies and powerful local governments have borrowed trillions of dollars to get what they want.Now, it\u2019s Li Jing\u2019s turn.Ms. Li, a 33-year-old car saleswoman here in the middle of China\u2019s declining industrial zone, is one of the growing millions of Chinese using mortgages and credit cards to finance a middle-class lifestyle. Over the past two years, she and her husband have bought and remodeled a $120,000 apartment and purchased two new cars for $30,000 apiece.To help pay for it all, they took out a 10-year mortgage that absorbs nearly a third of their monthly income \u2014 once considered an unusual amount of debt in a country that used to depend almost solely on cash.\u201cI view the mortgage as a form of savings,\u201d Ms. Li said, \u201cbecause in 10 years, I\u2019ll own the whole apartment.\u201dChinese central bank data shows that consumer loans have grown almost 50 percent since the start of last year, when the government began encouraging more lending to households. That lending could grow considerably higher: The International Monetary Fund said it expected China\u2019s household debt as a percentage of its economic output to double by 2022 compared with a decade before.There are signs that China is moving on the fringes to contain mortgage lending, in part to tame housing costs. In the past week, banks in Beijing began raising mortgage interest rates. In a lengthening list of China\u2019s largest cities, banks are under instructions to discourage the use of personal loans for real estate speculation. Six large cities established new home sales restrictions in recent days to cool off prices.\u201cChina will get less of a kick out of consumer debt in the coming 18 months than it did in the past 18 months,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, an economist with Oxford Economics, a British research firm.Some economists also worry that consumer loans may be a backdoor way for bloated companies to maintain or even expand their capacity. China\u2019s domestic automakers \u2014 many of which are state owned and suffer from too many underused factories \u2014 have unleashed a blizzard of zero-interest car loans in the past two years, often through their own financing subsidiaries. In that time, the majority of Chinese consumers began to pay for cars with credit instead of cash, according to J. D. Power and Associates, a global consulting firm.To be clear, most economists consider China\u2019s consumer credit splurge to be a good thing. Chinese families are nowhere near the borrowing levels of spendthrift Americans, whose household debt is equal to more than three-quarters of the annual economic output of the United States. In China, that measure is still less than half.Traditionally, China\u2019s state-controlled banking system focused on lending money to big state-owned companies. Economists view household lending as an appealing alternative to having banks shovel more money into unprofitable, debt-ridden state firms that cannot be closed because they provide jobs to millions of workers.So far, consumer lending has helped Chinese consumers weather the gradual slowdown in the country\u2019s economic growth in recent years. That is particularly true in places like Qiqihar, a city of five million in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The local economy took a hit last year when a large steel mill closed a big blast furnace and overstaffed communal- and state-owned enterprises pushed out more than 40,000 workers.But even here, 500 miles north of China\u2019s border with North Korea, the local economy seems to be rebounding from a slump two years ago, when the national economy was looking shaky. Walk out the front door of the recently completed high-speed rail station in Qiqihar and no fewer than 45 cranes are visible, erecting apartment towers and office buildings. The city\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first half of this year, up from 5.6 percent in the same period last year and nearly matching the national growth rate of 6.9 percent thus far this year.Borrowing has been a big help, residents say. Whereas apartments once sold for cash only, many people now offer down payments of between 20 percent and 30 percent and take out mortgages for the rest.\u201cCertainly more people tend to borrow when purchasing apartments,\u201d said Fu Shiqiang, a real estate agent. \u201cThey may want to get a bigger apartment or do business.\u201dZhao Ying, another property agent, said he used a credit card at supermarkets and shopping malls and bought a $21,000 Toyota Vios sedan last year with a zero-interest loan. He said he had bought his current apartment with cash but would do things differently next time.\u201cI will definitely get a mortgage,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. \u201cIt is very convenient, and I could use the leftover money to do some business or investment.\u201dMs. Li, the car saleswoman, and her husband built their wealth the traditional way. They bought an inexpensive, two-bedroom apartment in 2003 when they married. Her husband was given a small apartment by his employer. They bought a third apartment as an investment.Real estate prices have surged since then, and Ms. Li and her husband have cashed in. They sold all three units and bought a spacious, three-bedroom apartment for themselves and spent $30,000 to remodel it. They also bought a Volkswagen Tiguan and a Honda Accord.Their mortgage helps support that lifestyle. Ms. Li, who said nearly a third of her customers buy with credit, knows that they are not alone.\u201cWhen I got my first car in 2006, almost no one in my local community had one,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cNow the roads are packed, and it\u2019s really hard to find a place to park.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo said during a late-night tour on Wednesday of the No. 6 line beneath Manhattan during which he announced plans to increase littering fines. \u201cIt\u2019s a food wrapper. But when you add up this littering, it\u2019s tons of trash being left in the system.\u201dPolice officers issued 669 tickets for littering in 2012 compared with 101 tickets so far in 2017, according to data provided by the Police Department. And as the number of tickets issued has decreased, track fires have increased.\u201cThis is an issue of public safety,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a nuisance.\u201dThe governor directed the state Department of Environmental Conservation to raise the penalties for littering starting on Wednesday. But enforcement will fall largely to the Police Department, which is responsible for patrolling the subway system\u2019s 472 stations.The Police Department said on Thursday that before 2013, a significant number of littering summonses were issued to riders who had discarded depleted MetroCards on the ground. Littering tickets began to decrease, in part, when the transit authority began charging $1 for new cards in March 2013, incentivizing riders to refill their old cards instead, the police said.\u201cThe mayor\u2019s been clear that the city is a willing and ready partner to help cut down on littering in the subway system, through both education and stepped up enforcement,\u201d Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor, said on Thursday.But getting riders to change their behavior is just one part of the challenge.Track issues as a result of standing water conditions have increased by 56 percent so far this year compared with the same period last year, Mr. Cuomo said. Cleanup crews have removed 2.3 million pounds of trash from the subway tracks since December.During Mr. Cuomo\u2019s tour of the subway, which lasted into the wee hours of Thursday, he touted the progress he said had been made in implementing the transit authority\u2019s emergency plan. He also unveiled a public awareness campaign to dissuade riders from littering that will be launched alongside the steeper penalties.Wearing white gloves and a gray rain jacket \u2014 but no hard hat \u2014 Mr. Cuomo descended onto the subway tracks and followed more than a dozen workers in orange fluorescent vests as they cleaned the tracks with shovels and vacuums.He sidestepped pools of standing water and mounds of litter: discarded water bottles, newspapers, candy wrappers, old Metro Cards. Several commuters emerging from the No. 4 line looked on curiously at the man walking the tracks.\u201cIt\u2019s so clogged they can\u2019t even find the water drain,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, pointing at one of the many puddles of murky water.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Same-Sex Marriage Vote May Proceed, Court Rules", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe survey \u2014 which is voluntary, unlike in-person elections in Australia \u2014 was challenged in two separate cases brought by advocates of same-sex marriage and members of Parliament. Run by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the vote will be unique in Australian history: Nothing in the law requires it to take place before Parliament may act, and lawmakers are not bound by its results.Though the court has announced its decision, it could be weeks before it releases the reasoning behind it. Legal experts suggest that the core argument was whether the government unlawfully appropriated funds for the postal vote without parliamentary approval. The government used an appropriations clause that allows its finance minister to spend up to 295 million Australian dollars \u2014 or around $236 million \u2014 if the expenditure is \u201curgent\u201d or \u201cunforeseen.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 case against the government centered on those two words, claiming that the postal vote did not fulfill either obligation.\u201cThat\u2019s really the core argument \u2014 whether this can nonetheless be authorized by this other provision,\u201d said George Williams, dean of law at the University of New South Wales. \u201cThe High Court has said that the federal government can\u2019t spend taxpayers\u2019 money without the approval of Parliament,\u201d he said, referring to another recent decision by the court. \u201cThe government twice sought that approval for a national plebiscite, but Parliament rejected those attempts.\u201dThe High Court, which regularly deliberates on cases for months, announced its decision less than 24 hours after hearings finished. The decision was expedited because of the government\u2019s desire to start mailing the survey to registered voters next week.The national debate resumed swiftly after the ruling.\u201cWill the prime minister now accept my invitation to write a joint letter to all Australians recommending voting \u2018yes\u2019 to marriage equality?\u201d Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, asked in Parliament.\u201cMr. Speaker: I\u2019m interested in the assumption that the leader of the opposition makes that joining his signature to mine will actually increase the \u2018yes\u2019 vote,\u201d said Mr. Turnbull, deflecting the question to jeers.\u201cMuch to his disappointment,\u201d said Mr. Turnbull of his counterpart, \u201cnow every Australian will have their say.\u201dMr. Abetz linked to a sign-up page for the Coalition for Marriage, a group opposing any changes to the Marriage Act. That group\u2019s spokesman, Lyle Shelton, described the postal ballot as a referendum on freedoms and \u201cradical\u201d sex education.Australia\u2019s attorney general, George Brandis, dismissed that characterization of the vote, saying, \u201cIt is a survey to determine the opinion of the Australian people on the question that is asked, and that question is, \u2018Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?\u2019 That is the only question to which the Australian people are being asked their advice.\u201d\u201cThe postal survey is going ahead, but whatever the outcome, Parliament should uphold rights and allow same-sex marriage,\u201d Elaine Pearson, the Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cFundamental rights should never be put to a popular vote.\u201d\u201cThis postal plebiscite is completely unnecessary,\u201d said Anna Brown, the director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Center, before the hearings began on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s costly, divisive and already causing harm to our community. The rights of any group of Australians being subject to a public vote sends a terrible message to our community.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision places the vote into sharp focus. During the last federal election, Mr. Turnbull said that Australian voters would be able to have a direct say on the issue, before any laws were enacted.But it is likely that he will face continued pressure to take the issue to a parliamentary \u201cfree vote,\u201d letting lawmakers vote their conscience on same-sex marriage, rather than requiring them to decide along party lines. Such a free vote has been endorsed by Bill Shorten, head of the opposition, and some liberal members of the prime minister\u2019s coalition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Shkreli Syndrome: Youthful Trouble, Tech Success, Then a Fall", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurs, it turns out, do not just move fast and break things, as Facebook\u2019s longtime credo put it. They are also more likely than others to cross the line.According to research by the economists Ross Levine and Yona Rubinstein, people who become entrepreneurs are not only apt to have had high self-esteem while growing up (and to have been white, male and financially secure). They are also more likely than others to have been intelligent people who engaged in illicit activities in their teenage years and early 20s.And those indiscretions have not been limited to using drugs or skipping school, but have included antisocial acts like taking property by force or stealing goods worth less than $50.In light of the recent troubles of Mr. Shkreli and other scandal-ridden entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, the former Uber chief executive, and Parker Conrad, a founder and ousted chief executive of the multibillion-dollar human resources software firm Zenefits, the question is whether youthful rule-breaking might have foreshadowed not only their rise, but also their fall.The problem is that the psychological forces that drive teenagers to break rules may not be so easily channeled later on.Laurence Steinberg, a Temple University professor and an expert on the psychological development of adolescents, cited a phenomenon known as \u201cmoral disengagement,\u201d in which people rationalize behavior at odds with their own principles. A teenager who steals a pair of sneakers, for example, may tell himself that the manufacturer was overcharging consumers.\u201cYou think the regulations are uncalled-for,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though you might be breaking them, you\u2019re really not doing a bad thing, because they were bad regulations.\u201dSuch behavior is often encouraged in Silicon Valley. For years, many technology investors applauded Uber\u2019s practice of operating without the approval of local regulators, and then exploiting the company\u2019s popularity among riders to bring about changes to the rules.Or consider the early days of the financial technology and payments company Square, which used a credit card account one of its founders set up for one business to handle payments for other businesses that lacked such accounts.While such rule-breaking may be legitimate in certain circumstances \u2014 the major credit card companies eventually altered the restrictions on the use of business credit card accounts, allowing Square to get off the ground \u2014 the financial rewards for operating this way can reinforce a tendency toward shiftiness.There are two factors that make it even more tempting to fudge ethical questions: the relative lack of oversight at start-ups, and the enormous risk of failure.In effect, entrepreneurship takes people who, as a group, are prone to breaking actual rules and putting them in a setting that constantly encourages them to do so.These days, many venture capitalists spend as much time assessing what kind of troublemaker an entrepreneur may be as they do assessing a business\u2019s revolutionary potential.\u201cWe do want them to be rule-breakers,\u201d said David Golden, who helps run the venture capital arm of Revolution, the investment firm of the AOL co-founder Steve Case. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be felons.\u201dMr. Golden admitted, however, that such judgments can be flawed. He cited a software company that Revolution agreed to finance in 2014, only to discover that the founder had misrepresented certain companies as customers. (The firm did not go through with the investment, he said.)To eliminate subjectivity, some people have tried to quantify an optimal willingness to break rules. Before he started his venture capital fund, Switch Ventures, Paul Arnold collected data on roughly 12,000 start-ups with the goal of identifying the profiles of entrepreneurs that were most strongly associated with success.Mr. Arnold\u2019s most striking finding involved start-ups where at least one founder had worked at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.He studied nearly 1,000 such companies and discovered that start-up founders who left McKinsey after about three to four years tended to be extremely successful, but that those who stayed a lot longer were close to average. He concluded that the first group had the platonically ideal capacity for rule-breaking: They were sufficiently fluent in rule-following to hold a job at McKinsey but \u201cdidn\u2019t like the strictures and kind of resisted it.\u201dBut even Mr. Arnold, whose intuition on these questions was honed not just by statistics but by life experience \u2014 he was a two-time high-school dropout who was often in trouble for things like smoking marijuana before eventually finding his way to law school \u2014 admitted that he might have missed the warning signs with Mr. Kalanick.\u201cThe Uber story is that the initial rule-breaking was innovation,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cBut it was a slippery slope. They broke the next one and the next one, and were doing less and less ethical things.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky topic.\u201dLauren Herstik contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Trade Troubles Could Point to a Need for Cash", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDANDONG, China \u2014 After sunset, when American spy satellites can no longer see as well, the main bridge connecting China to North Korea comes to life.The data also suggests something else. The trucks are increasingly coming back empty. And that could present a potential weak point that the Trump administration and others could exploit, if China is willing to go along, as they look for ways to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.Even as China sells more goods to North Korea, it is buying less from there, according to trade data and experts on the relationship between the two. North Korea\u2019s finances are hidden by a veil of secrecy. But that worsening trade imbalance appears to be deepening North Korea\u2019s need for credit from China or for cold, hard cash from somewhere else.\u201cMy best guess is that North Korea is receiving trade credits from those providing it with goods and services \u2014 that is to say, China,\u201d said Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who studies China\u2019s financing of rogue regimes like those in North Korea and Venezuela.\u201cAs neighbors, China and North Korea maintain normal trade,\u201d said Huang Songping, the spokesman of China\u2019s customs administration, at a briefing in July.Despite North Korea\u2019s estrangement from most of the rest of the world, it still needs foreign currencies to get by. North Korea has a currency (called the won, like South Korea\u2019s), but the money is worthless outside its borders.Even here in Dandong, within sight of North Korea, eight merchants said in separate interviews that they do not accept the North Korea currency. Foreign exchange windows at local banks refuse to handle it.That has left North Korea heavily dependent on its trade with China.For years, Chinese purchases of coal and other goods gave North Korea a steady source of money.That source no longer looks so steady. North Korea bought $2 worth of goods from China in July for each $1 of sales to China, as China has essentially halted purchases of North Korean coal since mid-February. For the first seven months of the year, North Korea ran a trade deficit with China of nearly $1 billion, almost four times the amount of a year ago.Some in Congress have begun talking about legislation that would target leading Chinese banks\u2019 use of dollar-based payments systems as a way to hit North Korean trade. But financial specialists say they worry about unforeseen payment difficulties, which were a big worry during the global financial crisis in 2008.\u201cWhat the legislators do not know, and it\u2019s a little scary, is what these restrictions would mean for China,\u201d said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former North Korea specialist at the United States Treasury who is now at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington research group.To avoid that, Chinese banks could simply lend extra money on easy terms to state-owned Chinese enterprises, which in turn could keep selling goods to North Korea without demanding payment.Continuing trade on credit may explain why North Korea shows few indications of a money pinch, such as surging prices for rice and other essentials.\u201cFrankly, you just haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Kent Boydston, an analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.North Korea has other ways to get cash, though estimating those amounts is tricky work.It could attract foreign investment toward developing natural resources. But China shows few signs of making such big investments, and it supported United Nations sanctions in early August that would halt purchases of iron ore, coal and other assets.North Korea gets money from its citizens overseas, who must remit most of their paychecks to the government. But with the United Nations tightening that source as well, there has been little sign of a huge recent increase in these revenues, said Melanie Hart, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington research group.Shoppers and shopkeepers in Dandong \u2014 who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of Chinese government reprisals \u2014 said North Korean workers were a common sight, though there had been little sign of an influx. One said many lounge singers and bar hostesses here are young women from North Korea. Their monthly pay is about 3,000 renminbi, or $460, but they keep only about a quarter of that.China\u2019s decision early last month to ban imports of North Korean seafood seems to be having an effect. At an open-air seafood market in Dandong, only one vendor in a row of four said she had North Korean merchandise: a handful of live crabs. Other vendors complained they had to buy more-expensive Chinese shellfish for sale instead.For now, the trucks continue to cross the World War II-era steel frame bridge here at night to North Korea.A nearby resident, looking at the trucks and the occasional young men who run up to drivers with packages to deliver to friends and family in North Korea, said the scene had not changed for a long time.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.Advertisement"}

Neither of them led teams or organizations, but there was always this emphasis on kindness and manners and just being a good person.I always have that in the back of my head, regardless of who I\u2019m talking to. The world\u2019s a small place, life\u2019s short, and so you should only be nice to people. I don\u2019t raise my voice at work. I don\u2019t have tantrums.Did you know what you wanted to do when you went to college?I kept an open mind early on. I took some pre-med classes, life-science classes and also business classes. I started reading a lot of books about business and Wall Street, and I really liked Finance 101. I decided to go into investment banking.I took some extra courses so I could graduate in three years. Once I decided what I wanted to do, I wanted to start quickly. After a few years, I joined 3G Capital, an investment firm. They have a culture of making bets on people who they think have potential and who can grow over the long run.What was your first management role?I joined 3G when I was 24, but I didn\u2019t really have much of a management role there. I became C.F.O. when we acquired Burger King, so that was my first time managing people. I had just turned 30.Alex Behring, who heads up 3G, gave me some great advice early on. He said that you have to manage the people, not the business. When I first arrived, I was trying to do a lot myself and it was a little overwhelming. And then I remembered what he said and started letting the people manage the business, and I managed the people.What were other early lessons for you?If you want to change something or if you want to really influence or impact someone, you need to be in that person\u2019s market and be with them face to face. You can\u2019t run a multinational business from your desk. You can\u2019t just get on the phone and tell the people that you need to do things differently.If you make the trip, that\u2019s a big investment of time for you. People appreciate that, and they\u2019re going to be more open to your feedback. You\u2019ll also have more credibility because you\u2019ve seen their business and been in their market.What\u2019s unusual about your culture?No one in the building has an office. We have an open floor plan. It creates an environment that allows us to move faster. Behind my desk, I have my goals on the wall, and anyone can see them. They\u2019re marked green if I\u2019m doing well, yellow if not so well and red if we\u2019re not on track. Everyone knows mine, and everyone does the same with their own goals.We also did away with titles about a year ago because we were spending so much time talking about them, and people were comparing themselves to others who were promoted. Inevitably you get this cascading effect where you kind of lower the bar of what it takes to be promoted. Our titles are now more descriptive rather than based on certain ranks.You became C.E.O. at a pretty young age. Any vertigo moments early on?I was a little nervous at first, but I tried to be really rational about it. If the results are bad, people could blame my age, but I\u2019m going to have a problem anyway. If the results are good, everyone\u2019s going to be happy. So we should just make sure the results are good.That said, because I\u2019m younger than many people I work with, I realize that I still have so much to learn from people who have been there and have been involved in the business longer than I have.How do you hire?I like people who are passionate, who have persevered and who are clearly humble and not arrogant. It\u2019s O.K. to be confident, but not arrogant. I like people who genuinely are looking for a project and not a job. We\u2019re looking for people who want to be part of something bigger. We don\u2019t want people who see us as a steppingstone.I also like people who say they\u2019re willing to do anything. They just want to get in the door. I had that attitude earlier in my career. I didn\u2019t care what I was going to do. I just wanted to be involved in interesting projects, working with interesting people.What are your best questions?One question I ask is, \u201cAre you smart or do you work hard?\u201d You want hard workers. You\u2019d be surprised how many people tell me, \u201cI don\u2019t need to work hard, I\u2019m smart.\u201d Really? Humility is important.What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?The first is just work hard. Don\u2019t take anything for granted. Then I tell them that they\u2019re going to interact with a lot of people who have different qualities and traits. So copy the best of what you like in people and don\u2019t copy the bad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Toiling in Rural China, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Xi Jinping Joins Party\u2019s Top Tiers", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Chen\u2019s antipoverty campaign applied policies sure to appeal to Mr. Xi\u2019s belief that the Communist Party can be an overseer of economic change, marshaling investment and resources for the national good.Since Deng Xiaoping and his allies broke up Mao\u2019s rural communes in the early 1980s, Chinese farmers have mostly tilled small plots of land under long-term leases from village governments. But fewer and fewer young people see a future in agriculture, which offers lower, less steady pay than factories or menial jobs in towns and cities.\u201cIn recent years earnings from farming were low, everyone let land go fallow,\u201d said Tao Yongpan, an official at Mount Niangniang, a cluster of villages in the Liupanshui area of western Guizhou that served as an inspiration for policies promoted by Mr. Chen. \u201cSoil erosion was serious and farmland was left idle. Rural production was on the slide.\u201dSome economists have urged the Chinese government to privatize farmland, arguing that would encourage better land use and unleash market forces to lift productivity.But the party has been reluctant to shed its ideological commitment to collective ownership \u2014 in effect state control \u2014 of farmland. Officials and some experts also worry that privatizing the land would make farmers more vulnerable to exploitation and create kindling for social unrest.In Guizhou, Mr. Chen instead promoted a solution that has gained favor under Mr. Xi: merging small family fields into cooperatives that pool villagers\u2019 land, money and labor. Other provinces and politicians have for years experimented with this approach, which is meant to boost production through economies of scale. But Mr. Chen pushed it hard and gave it his own twist.Rural families became shareholders in the cooperatives, paying in by handing over some or all of their leased land. The cooperatives then used the larger acreage to produce commercial crops like tea and walnuts, paying villagers a share of returns and sometimes wages for farm work. Often local companies also invested in these enlarged farms, bringing finance and management experience, but also taking profits.\u201cBefore the land was all fragmented,\u201d said Huang Zhineng, a manager at Mount Niangniang. \u201cWith unified management, the same land can lift incomes. It\u2019s a great model for poverty eradication.\u201dIt is a policy that also fits into Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of entrenching the party\u2019s hold on power and restoring a spirit of socialist collectivism that harks back to Mao\u2019s era.But that same month, Mr. Xi also said he would participate in the coming leadership congress as a delegate from Guizhou, although he has no career links there. Officials in Guizhou celebrated the striking gesture of support for Mr. Chen.In villages in Guizhou, though, residents are waiting to see if Mr. Chen\u2019s policies can bring lasting profits. Many welcomed the changes. Others were wary.\u201cIt\u2019s a good way forward for us,\u201d said Qiu Shuixian, 37, a farmer in Zhongxin Village in the Liupanshui area, where one cooperative has pooled land to grow red rice, a local specialty, and another newer cooperative produces fruit, walnuts, flowers and honey.\u201cThere\u2019s no profit in farming the land ourselves,\u201d Mr. Qiu said.But others said it was risky to devote so much land to crops like walnuts or red rice, which might fail in bad years or not find buyers. Some said they felt pressured to sign over farmland to the cooperative. One resident recalled Mao\u2019s time, when peasants were forced into huge communes that failed and resulted in mass starvation.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hand it over,\u201d Chen Wenzheng, 64, said of his family\u2019s plot. \u201cI wanted to grow some for myself as insurance. But then everyone handed theirs over, so what can you do?\u201dLuo Xiaopeng, a retired rural policy official who has long worked in antipoverty projects in Guizhou, said Mr. Chen\u2019s policies were designed to show quick results but could backfire. For example, farmers could be cajoled into risky, expensive ventures that take their land and fail after a few years. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is getting a grip of the fundamental problems in the Chinese countryside,\u201d he said.But Mr. Chen won\u2019t be around to see the long-term impact of his efforts. He has moved onto his next test.As the new party secretary in Chongqing, he has a tricky assignment.Bo Xilai, another party secretary of Chongqing seeking promotion, fell in scandal in 2012.

{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Lofty Vision for Europe Gets Mixed Reviews", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 No one has ever accused Emmanuel Macron of lacking in audacity. He broke a lot of rules and expectations of deference to become, at 39, the president of France, the closest thing a Western democracy has to a civilian monarch.The response since then has been underwhelming and points to the steep challenge ahead for Europe to get moving on difficult issues like migration, security, debt and institutional reform.Ms. Merkel, re-elected but weakened, will have even more trouble than before to embrace most of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas, which inevitably will cost money.Other European leaders, especially in the north and the east, look to a smaller and more diverse European Union as the best answer to rising nationalism and populism.\u201cAll these proposals that we\u2019ll have a minister of the eurozone and all of this further integration,\u201d Mr. Babis said, should make Mr. Macron and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, \u201cthink of why Brexit happened.\u201dEven if the mood music is wrong, Mr. Macron is nonetheless pushing the traditional French concept of more Europe and more integration.Only \u201ca more integrated Europe\u201d is the path to \u201creal sovereignty,\u201d he argued in the speech on Tuesday. \u201cThe only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.\u201dRather than retrenchment, he sees a revived European Union as the best antidote to increasing nationalism, populism and Euroskepticism from the far right and far left, as evidenced even in core bloc countries like France and Germany.The European Union, he said, should embrace a joint budget for those using the euro \u2014 \u201ca real budget at the heart of Europe,\u201d he said; construct a shared military force; and harmonize taxes and the minimum wage to stay globally relevant.He wants a common European asylum agency and border police, a eurozone finance minister responsible to the European Parliament and a European Monetary Fund to aid member states in budget trouble.Mr. Macron wants to restore France to its traditional leadership role in Europe, as the intellectual driver of a partnership with larger, richer Germany.But it is not the same Germany. Ms. Merkel needs to negotiate a new governing coalition, which could take until the end of the year and will almost surely include the liberal Free Democrats, who are very much opposed to key Macron ideas like a shared eurozone budget.Ms. Merkel herself has said that idea of a eurozone finance minister is a good one. But the German idea is of a taskmaster who will make member states keep to budget discipline; the French idea is considerably more flexible, seeing a minister who spends rather than cuts.After Mr. Macron\u2019s speech, Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that \u201cthe chancellor welcomes the French president delivering a speech with so much verve and passion for Europe,\u201d but that it was \u201ctoo early for a detailed appraisal of the proposals.\u201dA Free Democratic legislator and the vice president of the European Parliament, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, called the speech \u201cbrave\u201d but emphasized that \u201cthere will be no eurozone budget\u201d with the Free Democratic Party.\u201cIf there were such a thing,\u201d he added, \u201cno country would ever be responsible for getting its own house in order.\u201dEurope has a different difficulty, he said: \u201cEurope\u2019s problem is not a lack of public money, but a lack of reforms.\u201dThe Free Democratic leader, Christian Lindner, who is pushing to get his party the finance minister post in a new government \u2014 possibly Mr. Lambsdorff \u2014 has spoken of \u201cred lines,\u201d which include a eurozone budget that would allow transfers of funds to other countries.Mr. Macron said pointedly in his speech, \u201cI don\u2019t have red lines, I only have horizons,\u201d calling on Germany and other bloc nations to join in working groups to brainstorm over his ideas.Many of the issues Mr. Macron highlighted, like defense and border security, are already in the mainstream, but he is pushing them forward, Mr. Wolff said.\u201cWill the Germans and other European countries take him up on that? On some points, yes,\u201d but on others not immediately, especially on those that cost money or mean major institutional change, he said.The member states of Central Europe, in particular, remain deeply skeptical of eurozone construction.Mr. Macron likes to \u201cindicate a general direction and leave the actual destination sufficiently unclear,\u201d so that any outcome can be declared as a victory, Mr. Goldhammer said. \u201cBut eventually,\u201d he added, people will \u201cbegin to wonder if they\u2019ve actually moved anywhere.\u201dMr. Macron is feeling out allies in other bloc countries, including European legislators, on the model of the grass-roots En Marche movement that brought him to power.Mr. Macron, a young man at the start of a five-year term, clearly feels he has time. At a European digital summit meeting in Estonia, Mr. Macron will press his ideas during an informal Thursday night dinner with European leaders.And some of his ideas have found favor on what might normally seem stony ground.In the end, Mr. Fuest noted, \u201cMacron\u2019s speech constitutes an invitation to Germany to brainstorm over Europe\u2019s future, and Germany should accept this invitation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Cancer Patients a Break on Student Loans", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSuch a deferment would have helped me immensely in March 2015. I was an adjunct professor, at the University of Maryland, and after months of crippling abdominal pain, I scheduled surgery during my the school\u2019s spring break to have several ovarian cysts removed. Although my blood test results for ovarian cancer had come back positive, my doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital had assured me that the test was notoriously unreliable. Also, I was much too young to be dealing with malignant tumors: The median age for an American ovarian cancer patient is 63. I was an otherwise healthy 36-year-old.Chances were very good that I did not have cancer.But I did.On March 20, five days after that surgery, my oncologist called with the worst possible pathology report: I had mixed clear cell carcinoma, a rare, aggressive form of cancer. Mine arose from endometriosis, a disease that causes a woman\u2019s uterine lining to go rogue and grow throughout her abdominal cavity. We needed to schedule a second surgery as soon as possible.This \u201cdebulking\u201d surgery, an extensive procedure to remove all possible additional cancer, was scheduled for April 2. My doctor had no idea how far the cancer had spread. Depending on the next round of pathology reports, my surgery could be followed by three to 12 months of chemotherapy and radiation.I would have to curtail my work as a freelance journalist, and there was no way that I could return to my job at the university, at least not that semester. I had less than two weeks to prepare, and my administrative to-do list looked like this:1. Call the university human resources department.2. Figure out how to file paperwork for a medical leave.3. Call my boss in the English department. Apologetically tell him I was leaving midsemester. Help him find a replacement. Finish grading my students\u2019 papers.4. Figure out what I was going to do about my student loan payments.Would you believe that Nos. 1-3 were infinitely easier than No. 4?I was shocked that my student loan servicer wouldn\u2019t allow me to defer my payments without penalty. I had cancer. I was about to lose more than half my income for who knew how long. All I could do was put my loans into forbearance, causing them to accrue additional interest.My cancer diagnosis meant my master\u2019s degree from Syracuse University was going to cost far more than the $50,000 I was already on pace to pay for it.The proposed House bill would end that kind of worry for future cancer patients. Each year, more than 70,000 Americans ages 15 to 39 are given a cancer diagnosis. That number is growing; according to the American Cancer Society, while the rates at which older Americans and children get cancer are actually down, young adult cancer rates are rising. People born in 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer and quadruple the risk of rectal cancer compared with people born around 1950, the society reports.At the same time, the average borrower owes $34,000 in student loans, up 62 percent in the past decade. So there are more cancer patients with heavier student loan burdens.As for me, I just hit the two-year survivorship mark, knock on wood. I still look back on the task of staying current with my loan payments as one of the most stressful parts of my treatment and recovery, and I hate to think of others\u2019 having the same experience While I know that giving cancer patients a break on their student loans may seem a minor issue, I also know that it\u2019s not at all minor to patients.And it will demonstrate that Congress has a heart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twice Beaten, Thrice Shy? Not for Sal Albanese, Mayoral Hopeful. Again.", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe candidate sat in a dark suit and yellow monogrammed tie on an R train headed to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to campaign with an old friend. Little gave away that the man was nearly at the end of another quixotic campaign to become mayor of New York, except for a small navy button with his first name: Sal.A young man, in a T-shirt and shorts on the same orange seats, leaned over as the train rumbled under Brooklyn.\u201cI just looked you up on Google,\u201d said the man, Kyle McKenzie, 26, who introduced himself as gay and said he would not be supporting Mayor Bill de Blasio for re-election, despite voting for him four years ago. \u201cYou were for gays before it was cool.\u201dAnother rider, a student at New York University, extended a piece of paper with his phone number and email. \u201cI just picked up a volunteer,\u201d the candidate said, pocketing the paper as he stepped from the train.\u201cI have won elections,\u201d he added, ruefully.Just not for a while.Sal F. Albanese, a lawyer and former city councilman, is on his third run for City Hall, unbowed by defeat.Now Mr. Albanese, 68, who has made transit and political reform his signature issues, is looking at his most unencumbered shot yet at City Hall, if only because he is taking on an incumbent mayor when no established Democrat saw fit to do so.Alone on the stage with Mr. de Blasio during last month\u2019s primary debate, Mr. Albanese made his appeal to Democrats as the only viable alternative. But despite his long history in New York politics, familiar largely to older residents of Bay Ridge whom he represented from 1982 to 1997, he remains unknown to most voters.He has little time and even fewer resources to change that before the Sept. 12 primary. The Albanese campaign has no dedicated office or full-time staff apart from a pair of consultants, and little money in the bank after it furiously raised and spent the required $175,000 to qualify for last week\u2019s debate.Resources are so slim, in fact, that Mr. Albanese cannot take out a television commercial to introduce himself, or attack the mayor.Since the debate, some donations have come in, he said, but nothing approaching the $5 million that Mr. de Blasio has in his campaign coffers. Instead, Mr. Albanese has crisscrossed the city holding modest campaign events, recording videos to post on the internet and tapping a network of people whom he met long ago.\u201cI remember him from back when very few people were coming out to the blocks,\u201d said Richard Green, who founded the Crown Heights Youth Collective, a community group, in the 1980s and was showing Mr. Albanese around the neighborhood a day after the debate.A lot of Mr. Albanese\u2019s campaigning is like that, peppered with talk of the past.\u201cAre you Sal?\u201d a kindergarten teacher, Judy Coppola, asked as he walked in Bay Ridge. Mr. Albanese, who worked as a teacher in city schools before running for the Council, stopped to talk.\u201cI always said, \u2018What happened to him?\u2019\u201d Ms. Coppola said after he walked on.During his time in the City Council, Mr. Albanese got his law degree and was known as a reformer and political maverick, a liberal from a conservative district who wrested the seat from a Republican and held it for 15 years. He voted against the budgets negotiated by the Council speaker, and was rewarded, he said, with a cubbyhole office for his entire tenure.As a councilman, Mr. Albanese sponsored a living wage bill that survived a veto by Mayor Giuliani and stood up for gay rights at political and some personal risk in 1986. \u201cI had a bodyguard for two days when I voted for gay rights,\u201d recalled Mr. Albanese, who described himself as \u201cculturally Catholic\u201d but not a regular at church.But whereas many of his positions dovetail with those of the mayor, Mr. Albanese is a Democrat of an older style, political observers said. \u201cHe exemplifies, in some ways, a part of New York City that no longer exists: the angry, white, blue-collar Catholic,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who overlapped with Mr. Albanese when both were students at York College in Queens.After losing his bid for mayor in 1997, Mr. Albanese worked in finance at Invesco and Mesirow Financial, mostly focused on public pension plans. He became of counsel at a small law firm, Allegaert Berger & Vogel LLP, where he has represented union clients among others since his 2013 mayoral bid. His current campaign is based out of his bare-walled office at the firm.Mr. Albanese is opposed to President Trump \u2014 \u201cI find they guy abhorrent; it\u2019s surreal that he\u2019s president\u201d \u2014 but he said he would avoid the sort of \u201cpersonal grudge match\u201d that he said Mr. de Blasio has embraced. He said he would take a similar approach with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, seeking to work with the governor on areas of agreement like congestion pricing to fund the city\u2019s subways. Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have been in an open feud for years.It is a line of attack he used in the debate and with voters from Staten Island to Crown Heights.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen de Blasio over here,\u201d a man seated on a bench outside Jackie Robinson Park in Brooklyn told Mr. Albanese.Mr. Albanese said that, if elected, he would visit neighborhoods frequently, a notion that appealed to the man, Tony Shaw, 50, who conceded that he had not heard of Mr. Albanese before.\u201cI\u2019m not that well known,\u201d the candidate said.\u201cI\u2019m going to check you out,\u201d Mr. Shaw responded.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yellen and Cohn Said to Be on Shortlist to Lead Federal Reserve", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has created a list of about a half-dozen candidates to be the next leader of the Federal Reserve, including its current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, according to two administration officials and a third person with knowledge of the process.The list also includes Jerome H. Powell, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; and the Stanford University economist John B. Taylor, the officials said. Preliminary interviews with some candidates have already begun with an eye toward presenting finalists to President Trump later this year.Ms. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February, has been unusually successful in achieving the Fed\u2019s goals of minimizing unemployment and moderating inflation. But Mr. Trump, while praising her performance, has said that he may decide not to reappoint her.\u201cI like her and I respect her, but I haven\u2019t made that decision yet,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters this month.Uncertainty about Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is already causing some unease in financial markets. Ms. Yellen has charted a steady course for monetary policy in the coming years: gradual increases in interest rates and a gradual reduction in the Fed\u2019s bond holdings. But some of the candidates Mr. Trump is considering, including Mr. Warsh and Mr. Taylor, have argued that the Fed should raise rates and reverse its postcrisis buildup of bonds more quickly.The Fed chairman also plays a leading role in financial regulation and will have to navigate calls by Republican leaders, including Mr. Trump, to roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Yellen was a principal architect of those more stringent regulations and has said the financial system is much stronger as a result. Mr. Trump has criticized many of the banking rules, saying they are excessive and impeding economic growth. The candidates to replace Ms. Yellen all share those concerns to varying degrees.Given the high stakes, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision has become a source of intrigue in political and economic circles this year. There is also a growing sense of urgency: Both Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, were nominated in October, leaving ample time for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings. Mr. Trump has said he does not plan to make a decision until later in the year, leaving little time for the Senate to act given the tight calendar. Aides say he is not yet focused on the search. Additional candidates could ultimately be considered.The administration officials and the other person with knowledge of the search requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the job in question. A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and Mr. Cohn, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh did not respond to requests for comment. A Fed spokeswoman said Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell declined to comment.The next Fed chairman is likely to begin the four-year term in an atmosphere of relative tranquillity during one of the longest economic expansions in American history. But the Fed is confronting a number of difficult issues. One question is whether it can do more to increase economic growth. Another is whether the Fed will be ready for the next economic downturn.Mr. Trump has deputized four officials to lead the selection process for the Fed\u2019s next chairman, said one person familiar with the search: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; two of Mr. Cohn\u2019s aides on the National Economic Council, Jeremy Katz and Andrew Olmem; and John DeStefano, the White House personnel director.Mr. Cohn, who initially participated in conversations about the potential nominees for Fed governor seats, has removed himself from the discussions about the central bank\u2019s next chairman, given that he is a potential candidate for the job, said several people with knowledge of his involvement.Mr. Cohn left the No. 2 position at Goldman Sachs to join Mr. Trump\u2019s administration as head of the National Economic Council. He quickly developed an easy rapport with the president, who is said to value Mr. Cohn\u2019s knowledge of markets and finance. Mr. Cohn has played a major role in the administration\u2019s push for a tax-cut bill; he also has been a moderating voice in internal debates on issues like restricting free trade.In a July interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump described Mr. Cohn and Ms. Yellen as candidates for the Fed job. The next month, Mr. Cohn publicly criticized the president\u2019s response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, creating tension. But the two men have reestablished a comfort level, and Mr. Cohn remains a candidate.Mr. Cohn is a strong advocate for easing financial regulation, which he argues is unnecessarily impeding economic activity. But he has rarely spoken publicly about monetary policy; the other four candidates whose names are known all have significant experience with monetary policy.Mr. Warsh, who served on the Fed\u2019s board between 2006 and 2011, was a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory council and has informally advised him on a range of economic issues. That may be a significant advantage, given the president\u2019s demonstrated preference for people he knows and trusts. Mr. Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the daughter of Ronald Lauder, a friend and occasional adviser to the president.Mr. Warsh is a lawyer by training and a banker by trade before entering public service in 2002 as a member of President George W. Bush\u2019s National Economic Council. After leaving the Fed, he joined the Hoover Institution, a public-policy think tank run by Stanford, as a visiting fellow. He has been a vocal critic of the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus campaign under both Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, arguing it has been ineffective and may have dangerous side effects.At a Hoover conference in May, he said the Fed needs to be \u201caggressive and powerful\u201d in responding to financial crises, but remain \u201cmore traditional\u201d when the market is not in crisis.Mr. Taylor, a colleague of Mr. Warsh\u2019s at Hoover, has offered a similar critique of Fed policy. Mr. Taylor served in the Treasury Department during the Bush administration but he is best known as an academic economist. He wrote a formulaic approach to monetary policy, known as the \u201cTaylor Rule,\u201d which suggests that the Fed should be raising rates more quickly. He also has closely advised House Republicans on legislation that would require the Fed to adopt such a policy rule.Mr. Powell, the only Republican on the Fed\u2019s board, is regarded as a centrist voice on both monetary policy and regulatory issues. In internal discussions and public remarks, he has sometimes pushed back against the most ardent supporters of the Fed\u2019s postcrisis stimulus campaign. Similarly, he has sometimes raised questions about changes in financial regulation. But on both fronts he has consistently voted with the majority.A Treasury Department official under President George H.W. Bush, Mr. Powell then built a fortune as a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, before he was nominated to the Fed by President Obama in 2012. His experience at the Fed, and his connections both in the financial world and in the Republican Party, could make him an attractive candidate. But his track record suggests he may be less likely than some of the other candidates to press for dramatic changes in monetary and regulatory policies.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For One Family in Houston, an Overwhelming Start to Recovery", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 She couldn\u2019t sleep. Not now.Kris Ford-Amofa lay next to her husband in a spare bedroom at her sister\u2019s house, thinking once more about the brown water that had slithered under the front door of the first home she had ever owned. The water that swirled around her three children as the family fled, wading up City Green Trail to seek refuge at a neighbor\u2019s house. The water that had buckled their living room floor, rotted the drywall and made them homeless. The floodwater that was not covered by their insurance.Where did she even start? On Thursday, she got up early, set two phones on the kitchen table \u2014 one for Federal Emergency Management Agency, and one to call Enterprise about a rental car \u2014 and started dialing, launching into her third day on the job as a disaster-recovery coordinator for her upended family.With no preparation and few road maps to guide them, tens of thousands of hurricane survivors like the Amofas are now stumbling through their first bewildering days after Harvey. The rains may have passed, but now they are consumed with worry about their children\u2019s futures, precarious family finances and what remains of the homes they fled.They need to find their way out of shelters and relatives\u2019 extra bedrooms. Find new schools for their children. Find hotel rooms when everything is booked, find rental cars when everything is taken and find the time to gut their homes, call contractors and hack through layers of bureaucracy, all while bills pile up and bosses call them back to work.An hour and a half into her morning, Kris, 43, was nowhere. Growing up in rural Louisiana, she knew floods and tropical storms. She had fled Hurricane Rita in 2005. Still, she was not equipped for this.She had filed a claim with FEMA, but was told she needed to send a declaration and release form. She didn\u2019t have her laptop, and she couldn\u2019t find the right paperwork with her phone.\u201cWhere do I find the form?\u201d she asked. \u201cI see the name of the form. There wasn\u2019t a link.\u201dA pause.\u201cI need to speak to someone. I hit option three to speak to someone.\u201dShe listened for a minute, head in hand.\u201cThis is not the help line?\u201d\u201cWe need a boat asap!!!\u201d Kris had written on Facebook. \u201cThe helicopters are not picking up by us!!! Please anybody!!!\u201dHarvey had made landfall on the Central Texas coast late Friday. Now it was Monday, and the waters were still rising across Houston. On the Amofas\u2019 street, the water was topping car windows and reaching the height of small children. And it was flowing inside the beige-brick home on the northeast side of town where Kris and her husband, Yaw Amofa, 47, had lived for less than a year.The family thought they would be safe. Kris had a second floor. The federal government said the area was at \u201cminimal hazard\u201d for flooding. So they bought milk, eggs, loaves of bread, and hunkered down for the weekend, joined by Kris\u2019s younger sister, Miesha Jolly, 36, and Miesha\u2019s three children.It had taken Kris and Yaw six years of work to buy the house. Six years of saving up, fixing their credit, attending personal-finance classes and debating whether they should invest so much money and risk into a single $180,000 purchase.Yaw, an immigrant from Ghana, said it was their American dream. The family moved from southwest Houston to this new subdivision on the edge of the woods, a slice of suburbia so newly built that the family\u2019s address did not yet show up on some online maps.When they moved in, they hung a sign on the living-room wall: \u201cHome \u2014 where life begins.\u201dNow, they needed a way out. Miesha\u2019s husband was trying to return from his job on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. That left three adults and six children in the house \u2014 including Miesha\u2019s 4-month-old daughter, her 2-year-old son, and Kris\u2019s oldest son, Jason, 17, who has autism and walks with difficulty.As the waters rose past car doors and seeped into the home, the family called 911, the Coast Guard, the Cajun Navy volunteers who were zipping around the city in bass boats and Jet Skis. The children waved white T-shirts out the window.Nobody came. The children tried to stanch the water with towels and sweatshirts. Phones blared with tornado warnings. Then, the power went out. The water in the living room started crawling up the stairs toward the bedrooms.At 9:14 p.m. Sunday, Kris posted on Facebook: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to make a move cause the water is coming through the doors and under the base boards like a river!!\u201dAround noon the next day, they threw a few clothes and papers into backpacks. The family, who link hands for grace before meals and attend a Baptist church, tried to gather strength. \u201cJesus remove this fear from me to actually get on it,\u201d Kris wrote to her 378 Facebook friends.And then they set off through the flooded street. Kris\u2019s younger son, Joshua, cried that he didn\u2019t want to leave and clung to the driver\u2019s side-view mirror of their new 2017 Nissan Pathfinder, now swamped with water.They pried his hands away and waded down the driveway. The water was up to the children\u2019s chests.With one arm, Kris guided her older son, Jason. He loves water, and she had to make sure he didn\u2019t stray into the currents bobbing with garbage and portable toilets unmoored from construction sites. With her other hand, Kris helped carry Miesha\u2019s 2-year-old son, Trey, tucked into a plastic garbage can that was padded with backpacks.They strapped Miesha\u2019s 4-month-old daughter, Quinn, into her car seat, set it into a plastic bin and entrusted the baby to the two oldest girls: Kris\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, Raechel, and Miesha\u2019s 11-year-old, Lejla. The girls floated the baby up the street as she smiled at the rain spattering her face.They took shelter in a still-vacant house up the block, but decided the water was rising too fast. They went on, and ended up at the home of a neighbor, who was cooking hot dogs and hamburgers for the makeshift evacuation shelter that was sprouting up in his home and garage.After a few hours, a rickety boat pulled up, and everyone except Kris\u2019s husband climbed aboard. They threaded through the flooded trees toward a Walmart parking lot where a co-worker of Miesha\u2019s picked them up, fixed them rice and quesadillas and rolled out air mattresses for the night.Miesha\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, Lejla, dreamed about floodwaters swallowing her baby sister.Three days later, Kris\u2019s husband, Yaw, felt as if he was behind schedule. Although the waters had receded, the Amofas could not stay in their home. The first floor was soaked, and already smelling of mildew. The families were camped out together at Miesha\u2019s house in northeast Houston, which had stayed dry: four adults, six children and a dog.All morning Yaw and his brother-in-law had tried unsuccessfully to find contractors and drywall experts to inspect the damage. They had received conflicting information about whether they should start tearing up the walls, or wait for a professional to inspect the house.Time, heat and water were Yaw\u2019s enemies now, conspiring beneath the carpets to rot and putrefy. A family down the block was already ripping out their soaked floorboards. His next-door neighbor\u2019s leather couch was already bearded with white mold. When Yaw returned to clean up and inspect the house, he decided he couldn\u2019t wait.\u201cYou can already smell,\u201d he said, standing in a puddle in his living room. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re breathing. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your house.\u201dSo, without masks, he and a neighbor marked a line on the walls and started sawing away with wood-handled kitchen knives. Drywall crumbled like soggy meringue. They yanked out insulation, which dripped like wet wool, and threw it onto the front yard, Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cNatural Mystic\u201d playing in the background.\u201cThings are not the way they used to be,\u201d Yaw sang.Yaw had worked at Home Depot before getting his civilian job in customer services with the Houston Police Department. But he was out of his league here. He had studied philosophy, not construction, years ago as an exchange student living in New Jersey.\u201cIt\u2019s hitting me right now,\u201d he said, \u201cthe depth of the work we have to do. And this is just the beginning.\u201dHe said they needed to pull up the floors, throw away the furniture, tear out the cabinets, inspect the wiring, call contractors, figure out how to pay for it all. Would they be eligible for any federal aid or loans? Could they take on the additional debt?Kris was racked with regret that her family \u2014 like most those who suffered flood damage \u2014 did not have flood insurance. She had always tried to stick to a budget, down to choosing the pancake syrup that gives her the best value. It could be months before she knows Harvey\u2019s toll on their finances.Her boss at the suburban hospital where she posts payments had told her to take as much time as she needed. But Yaw said he had to go back to work on Tuesday and he didn\u2019t know how he would find time to do it all.Yaw\u2019s neighbor walked in with a gift: a dust mask. Yaw snapped it on and turned back to the wall.\u201cWhere did I put my knife?\u201dEverything felt like eternity.When a friend took Kris to Walmart to buy new clothes for the children, they queued up outside in a row of people who shared photos of the damage, recounted boat rescues and National Guard convoys, and short-handed their fortunes: Water just up to the driveway. In the garage. First floor. Lost everything.When Kris and her sister went to the just-reopened H.E.B. for groceries, they waited in a line that stretched around the store\u2019s perimeter.When she checked out, Kris said, the cashier told her that a package of hamburger buns put her over the limit of two bread items per person.When she called around to look for hotel rooms, she learned that there were none nearby. When she called for rental cars, she learned that the companies couldn\u2019t find anything in Houston, but perhaps she could pick up in Dallas?The to-do list went on: Call the mortgage company. Call FEMA. Call work. Call the car lender. Call the car insurance company. Call the utility company. Call FEMA again. Call her friends from church. In one day, she made 22 telephone calls.But amid the frustration, she experienced moments of blessing. Friends paid for two carts full of clothes, food and other supplies at Walmart. Three strangers paid for her groceries one morning. Her sister Miesha, an inseparable companion, said Kris, Yaw and their children could stay with them as long as they needed.Their children were treating their displacement like an extended slumber party. Lejla and Raechel, the oldest girls, sang songs together and looked after the younger ones. Jason, who does not speak, hummed to himself on Miesha\u2019s couch and listened to classical music, his favorite, on YouTube.Thursday was ending, and Kris felt as if she had barely moved forward. She had finally found the FEMA form and sent it in, but was no closer to filling the most pressing need of a rental car so she and her husband could get around and get to work.She had always been fiercely independent. Growing up in a tiny town in central Louisiana, she had to take care of the house and her younger siblings. She had left home and hitched a ride to Houston after she finished high school in 1992. Now, she realized as she sat at the kitchen table, exhaustion washing over her, that Harvey had stolen her self-reliance.\u201cI have no control over anything right now,\u201d she said, her voice rising in frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve never sat waiting for somebody to take care of me. I\u2019ve always done it myself. Now, I have to wait all the time for somebody or something. I have to wait, wait, wait.\u201dHer sister, fresh from styling her hair for the first time in days, sat down at the kitchen table.The women talked about their childhood and their parents, about how the older sister had moved across this sprawling metropolis to be closer to the younger, how they chat on the phone as they drive to work, and about the rainy afternoon that they guided each other out of the flood.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Medicare for All or State Control: Health Care Plans Go to Extremes", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In one Senate office building, some of the leading lights of the Democratic Party gathered Wednesday to embrace what was once a proposal only of the far left: a huge expansion of Medicare, large enough to open the popular, government-run health program to all Americans.In another Senate office building, a smaller but equally adamant group of Republican senators stood together to take one last stab at dismantling the Affordable Care Act. They proposed instead to send each state a lump sum of federal money, along with sweeping new discretion over how to use it.Important elements in both parties are trying to move beyond President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, which has always been a complicated, politically difficult mix of government and private health insurance. But they are moving in radically different directions.The proposals appeared to have only one thing in common: Neither is likely to be enacted any time soon.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the onetime candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed what he called \u201ca Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system,\u201d and he said 16 Democratic senators supported it. Those included Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California \u2014 all names on the list of possible candidates for president in 2020.\u201cInstead of wasting hundreds of billions of dollars trying to administer an enormously complicated system of hundreds of separate insurance plans, there would be one insurance plan for the American people with one single payer,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, the ringmaster of an event that felt like a political rally, with banners and placards, consumers and patients, labor union members, nurses in red T-shirts and an audience full of fans who applauded, whooped and hollered.The ideological makeup of senators who support the health plan.Heading in the other direction were several Republican senators, led by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who would take money spent under the Affordable Care Act and give it to states in the form of block grants.While Mr. Sanders was joined by possible presidential contenders, Mr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy were accompanied by two lower-profile senators, Dean Heller of Nevada and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.\u201cThe only thing stopping us from having this idea debated on the floor of the United States Senate is lack of leadership,\u201d Mr. Graham said, pleading for help from President Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.An hour later Mr. Trump issued a statement saying, \u201cI sincerely hope that Senators Graham and Cassidy have found a way to address the Obamacare crisis.\u2019\u2019Under the Graham-Cassidy proposal, money would be distributed to states based on a complex formula. The regional cost of living would be one factor, but the sponsors acknowledged that higher-spending states like Massachusetts would receive less than under current law.The block grant would replace federal money now being spent under the Affordable Care Act for the expansion of Medicaid, for premium tax credits and for subsidies that reimburse insurers for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people.The Graham-Cassidy bill would repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirements for most Americans to have coverage and for larger employers to offer it. And it would make deep cuts in Medicaid.But time is running out on the bill. After Sept. 30, the Graham-Cassidy legislation would lose procedural protections that allow passage in the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes often required for major legislation.Even with those protections, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had seen no evidence that the bill had the votes needed to win approval in the Senate in the next two weeks. And he noted that it had not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, which could take a week or two to estimate how much the bill would cost and how many people would lose or gain coverage.Mr. Sanders said he was prepared for a long battle to establish health care as a right. (That was supposedly a goal of the Affordable Care Act.) His bill could serve as a political manifesto and a possible campaign platform for progressive candidates.That so many Democrats are embracing it is a milestone. About 60 percent of House Democrats have endorsed a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill introduced by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan.But Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate are steering clear, saying their immediate concern is to protect coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which still faces attacks from Republicans.Mr. Sanders\u2019s bill would expand Medicare, one of the nation\u2019s largest, most popular entitlement programs. The federal government would establish an annual budget for covered health care services. Medicare\u2019s benefit package would be expanded to include coverage of dental care, vision services and hearing aids. The bill would also cover \u201ccomprehensive reproductive, maternity and newborn care, including abortion,\u201d according to a summary prepared by Mr. Sanders\u2019s office.The federal government would establish a standard list of covered drugs, and the secretary of health and human services would negotiate prices with drug companies.Mr. Sanders did not say how he would pay for his bill. He issued a list of a dozen financing options, which included higher tax rates for high-income people and \u201can annual 1 percent federal wealth tax on the net worth of the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent of U.S. households.\u2019\u2019The Sanders bill would eliminate deductibles and most other out-of-pocket costs for consumers, but the government \u201cmay impose limited co-payments for prescription drugs in order to encourage the use of lower-cost generic drugs.\u201dUnder the bill, Medicare \u2014 now available to people 65 and older and to some younger people with disabilities \u2014 would be expanded over four years. In the first year, Medicare would be opened to children through age 18 and to adults from 55 to 64. The eligibility age would be reduced to 45 in the second year and to 35 in the third year, with \u201cevery resident of the United States\u201d entitled to benefits in the fourth year.That would bring huge changes to the health care system, affecting many people who are content with the coverage they have. More than 150 million people under the age of 65 have employment-based coverage. The Sanders bill would separate health insurance from employment, shrinking the role of employers and insurance companies.Employer-sponsored plans could not duplicate benefits provided by Medicare, but could offer extra benefits.Mr. Sanders predicted that \u201cinsurance companies, drug companies and Wall Street won\u2019t like this legislation,\u201d and he was right.David Merritt, an executive vice president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a lobby for insurers, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s called single-payer or Medicare for all, government-controlled health care cannot work. It will eliminate choice, undermine quality, put a chill on medical innovation and place an even heavier burden on hard-working taxpayers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Aberdeen, Scotland", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate20 PhotosA TOWNHOUSE IN A SCOTTISH CASTLE$626,000 (\u00a3475,000)The current version of the castle was built in 1993 and sits on about seven acres of pasture and wooded hills. It includes seven separate units, each \u201cowned solely and independently,\u201d said Fiona Gormley, the director of residential sales for Savills Aberdeen, which has the listing.This particular unit is 3,555 square feet and occupies three floors of the castle\u2019s south wing. The interior is mostly contemporary, though it retains some original details, including high ceilings, wood floors, paneled wood doors and tall windows.The large entrance hall is on the ground floor, along with a laundry room and stairs down to two vaulted stone cellars.The living room, dining room and kitchen are on the second floor. The living room has a fireplace and views of the southern grounds of the property, including an ice house and a dovecote, or pigeon house, dating to the 15th century, before the original castle was built. The formal dining room has a large window that also has southern views, and the kitchen has modern, fitted cabinets, period windows and room for a casual dining area.The four bedrooms, one of which is currently used as a study, are on the third floor. Three of them share a bathroom; the master bedroom has an en-suite bath.The home includes a private half-acre backyard and a two-car garage, and shares a central courtyard garden with another unit.MARKET OVERVIEWBefore 2014, sales had been robust and prices were rising 10 to 30 percent a year, agents said. There was often competition for homes, which sometimes sold for 10 to 15 percent over the asking price, Mr. Leith said. \u201cNow there are more sellers than buyers,\u201d he added, \u201cand prices are typically between 5 percent and 15 percent lower than valuations.\u201dBut last year, the market began to show signs of bottoming out, agents said, and in the second quarter of 2o17, there were 1,451 home sales in the Aberdeen area, a 14.3 percent increase compared to a year earlier, according to the Aberdeen Solicitors Property Centre, a local group that tracks the market. Even so, prices were down 4.2 percent in the same period, compared to a year earlier, according to the group\u2019s index.Homes in the center of the city that are priced below \u00a3300,000 (or about $395,500) are the most in demand, Mr. Leith said: \u201cAs prices have fallen, more people have opted to stay central and avoid a commute, when they can now buy an appropriately sized property closer to work.\u201dThe higher end of the market is \u201cwhere activity is most subdued,\u201d said Robert Davidson, a partner in Peterkins, a Scottish law firm. \u201cThe number of people in the area on larger salaries, most of which were paid to those employed in the oil and gas sector, have fallen significantly.\u201dApartments and smaller houses around Aberdeen\u2019s large universities are the properties most likely to sell, Mr. Davidson said. \u201cFlats can be attractive to parents looking for accommodation for their children while at university, coupled with an opportunity for investment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also a good time for first-time buyers to purchase, so cheaper properties are where most of the activity in the market is.\u201dWHO BUYS IN ABERDEENMost buyers are Scottish citizens taking advantage of the low prices to buy a home for the first time or to trade up to a bigger one, agents said. \u201cThere are virtually no vacation-home transactions, and very few investors active at the moment,\u201d Mr. Leith said.International buyers have virtually disappeared from the market since the decline of the energy sector, agents said. Many were oil and gas industry employees, Mr. Davidson said, most of whom have left the area.BUYING BASICSBuyers typically hire a lawyer to handle the property transaction, research the title and help process the mortgage, if necessary. The process has been simplified over the years, Mr. Leith said, but buyers must \u201cbe sure that all finance is in place pretty much at the outset, so that they can come up with the cash on the appointed day.\u201dThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Scotland, and mortgages are widely available to qualified buyers, including foreigners.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESEnglish, Gaelic, Scots; pound sterling (1 pound = $1.32)TAXES AND FEESFor this property, there is an annual landscape maintenance fee of about \u00a3200 ($264) and another annual fee of \u00a3250 ($330) for driveway maintenance, Ms. Gormley said. The council tax \u2014 the local version of a property tax \u2014 is about \u00a32,290 ($3,019) a year, she said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has held fund-raisers and rallies in several states around the country.The fund-raiser is expected to draw some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most wealthy supporters from New York\u2019s finance and real estate worlds. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump turned to many of the same people to finance his campaign.Attending the fund-raiser were Mr. Trump\u2019s two grown sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Steve Wynn, the casino executive. Also there, according to participants, were John Catsimatidis, a wealthy New York businessman; Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Trump; and Howard M. Lorber, the chief executive of Vector Group.The restaurant appears to be a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, though it has fallen on hard times in recent years \u2014 its owner filed for bankruptcy protection in March. He held a similar fund-raiser at its 58th Street location during the presidential campaign, and it has also played host to other candidates and celebrities throughout the years.But despite the presidential endorsement on Tuesday night, Le Cirque has struggled to impress food critics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shopping Spree in Hong Kong: The Past and the Future", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a shopping mall here that caters to mainland Chinese tourists, Jayce Zhao veered into a Hublot boutique to inquire about a $24,275 watch that he had seen advertised on Instagram.If he wore a more traditional timepiece, he added, a friend might ask skeptically, \u201cWhy do you have your father\u2019s or grandpa\u2019s watch?\u201dMr. Zhao\u2019s choice to shop in Hong Kong \u2014 for years a global leader in retail watch sales \u2014 is in some ways a throwback to an era that analysts say is coming to an end. Wealthy people from the Chinese mainland are traveling more widely overseas and increasingly shopping at home, they say, making this semiautonomous Chinese city less essential as a retail destination.But Mr. Zhao also represents the future: He is part of a new generation of wealthy mainland Chinese men \u2014 one with more varied watch tastes than their elders \u2014 that industry experts say is now coming into its own.Ms. Hou said the shift required brands to have a new \u201cproduct logic,\u201d advertising through social media and emphasizing the uniqueness, authenticity and craftsmanship of their watches.Some watch brands and fashion companies already are adapting well, she said, but many others \u2014 especially ones that primarily cater to older Chinese buyers \u2014 have been slow to catch on. \u201cNow is really a time to refresh the whole watch category to see who will survive\u201d in the Chinese market, she said.As for Hong Kong, it \u201cwas once the place where Chinese consumers would come to shop,\u201d said Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who is based in Switzerland. \u201cNow they can buy in China or elsewhere when they travel.\u201dThe Chinese government has been reducing official import duties on some luxury goods, including watches, and cracking down on people who buy such items overseas and then don\u2019t declare them to airport customs inspectors on their return.And 2016 sales totals for Swiss watches in mainland China declined just 3.3 percent, buoyed by 9.1 percent growth in the second half of the year, the study said. (In contrast, Hong Kong sales of Swiss watches declined 25.1 percent last year.)To nurture that growth, said Jules Boudrand, Deloitte\u2019s head of corporate finance advisory for western Switzerland, there was a clear need for Swiss watch brands to engage with younger audiences across the entire Chinese market and adapt to their changing tastes. He noted that some brands were now advertising through WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging app, and recruiting young Chinese celebrities as brand ambassadors.Kings Lau, a Deloitte analyst who specializes in southern China, said that young Chinese buyers were especially interested in \u201caffordable luxury\u201d smartwatches with personalized design features. \u201cFor the young, it\u2019s more and more important that their watch provides an identity\u201d rather than a marker of social status, Mr. Lau said.At Tag Heuer, the core customer base in Greater China (a sales category that includes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) are still people 35 to 50 years old, said Leo Poon, the company\u2019s general manager for the region. But its number of 20- to 35-year-old buyers has roughly doubled since 2014, now providing about 20 percent of the region\u2019s sales at storesas well as more than 55 percent of all online sales.The company recently dropped its prices in greater China, Mr. Poon said, and has been seeking a younger customer by marketing its watches around sports like surfing and basketball.\u201cWe are not creating a classic watch,\u201d the kind of timepiece that was prized by older Chinese buyers and usually had a gold case and a white band, Mr. Poon added. \u201cWe\u2019re creating something different.\u201dMr. Tornare of Zenith Watches said Chinese male buyers 20 to 35 years old were still willing to pay for mechanical watches, often at prices of $5,000 to $12,000. But, he added \u2014 echoing some of Ms. Hou\u2019s comments \u2014 they are far more discerning than their parents about timepieces and their tastes increasingly resemble that of their peers in Europe and the United States.\u201cThey don\u2019t need to show they\u2019re wealthy because they\u2019re second generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were born wealthy. They just want to buy what they like.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At $1,000, Apple\u2019s iPhone X Crosses a Pricing Threshold", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company will also enter new territory on price: The latest phone will start at about $1,000, compared with the $769 minimum for its current top phone, the iPhone 7 Plus.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new threshold,\u201d said Debby Ruth, a senior vice president at the tech consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates. I really do think it\u2019s going to make people pause.\u201dFrom the iPhone\u2019s introduction a decade ago, Apple has always priced it as a premium product \u2014 a more refined and polished alternative to the legions of cheaper smartphones available in the market.But this time, the company is pushing into luxury territory. The new phone will cost as much as the company\u2019s entry-level MacBook Air laptop. \u201cThey\u2019re doubling down on their strategy: They are going much more to the high end,\u201d Ms. Ruth said.Investors are betting that Apple\u2019s move up the price ladder will pay off with much higher profits, especially in mature markets like the United States and Western Europe, where many of the buyers will be people upgrading from older iPhones. The company\u2019s stock has risen by nearly 50 percent over the past year as anticipation has built about the 2017 models.Apple\u2019s strategy carries risks, however, especially in developing countries where smartphone sales are growing briskly but its market share is a blip compared with devices running Google\u2019s Android software.In Brazil, for example, Apple devices will account for just 8 percent of the 125 million active smartphone subscriptions this year, according to Forrester, a research firm.Steep taxes, higher retail profit margins, and added costs from a botched attempt at building iPhones in Brazil have pushed the price of an iPhone 6s, a two-year-old model, to more than $1,000 at Casa Bahia, a store in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. In late August, the retailer was selling Apple\u2019s most basic smartphone, the iPhone SE, for more than $600, while a Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini, which runs Android, was just $136.At another Rio store recently, Vanessa Perreira, 25, a university student, was browsing the 65 models on display, looking at the offerings from Samsung and LG but ignoring the six from Apple. She once owned an iPhone, she lamented, but could not afford to continue buying them. \u201cPrice is the most important factor for me,\u201d she said.Still, the iPhone is coveted by wealthier Brazilians, many of whom buy the phone while traveling abroad to avoid their country\u2019s high costs. \u201cThere will always be users in Brazil that will be interested in buying it,\u201d said Tina Lu, a senior analyst with Counterpoint Research.China\u2019s reception to the $1,000 iPhone will be even more crucial to Apple. The Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, contributed $8 billion to Apple\u2019s revenue last quarter, but sales have been sluggish.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.Apple\u2019s market share has declined slightly in China over the past year, according to Counterpoint. High-end phones from Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo have gained ground, in part by undercutting Apple on price.The new iPhone has the potential to reverse that trend. More than any other tech product, the iPhone has long denoted status in China. If a new iPhone looks the same as the previous one \u2014 and won\u2019t be recognized by others as new \u2014 it often doesn\u2019t sell well.\u201cIf the phone\u2019s appearance changes, I think people are going to be crazy about it, because we\u2019ve seen the iPhone with a similar look for such a long time now,\u201d said He Peihuan, a Shanghai-based financial analyst.Apple has also faced pressure from the Chinese government. State-run media outlets have called attention to a feature that tracked a user\u2019s most commonly visited locations and also criticized the company\u2019s after-sales policies. And government employees and leaders at state-run companies try to avoid being seen using foreign technologies like the iPhone.For all that, Zhang Xiang, a phone reseller and repairman in Shanghai, said that he still expected strong demand for the new iPhone. \u201cI think when people can afford it and want a high-end phone with good features, they\u2019ll still choose to buy an iPhone,\u201d he said.One important factor offsetting the next iPhone\u2019s expected high price is the increasing prevalence of financing options for buyers around the globe. In the United States, most phone carriers allow customers to spread the cost of a new phone over two years, and the new phone would add less than $10 a month to the payments a customer would make on an iPhone 7 Plus.\u201cThere\u2019s not that much difference in the monthly fee you have to pay,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst at Gartner, a research firm.Similar installment purchase plans are emerging in China, Brazil and other countries, making Apple\u2019s products more affordable there.\u201cI\u2019ve seen some banks providing installment plans for the iPhone with very low, or even no interest, so ordinary people could get an iPhone that way,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.That would play into Satish Meena\u2019s theory of iPhone adoption in developing countries.Mr. Meena, a senior forecast analyst at Forrester who is based in New Delhi, said that in places like India and Brazil, where millions of new smartphone users are entering the market, the first phone that people buy is a cheap Android. The second tends to be a fancier Android. Finally, they upgrade to an iPhone.\u201cThe iPhone is your dream phone,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a chart accompanying this article misstated the number of active smartphone subscribers in various countries. The figures for each country are for millions of subscribers, not thousands.Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro and Paul Mozur and Carolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Soldiers\u2019 Homes, Left to Just Fade Away", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "The veterans agency has 430 vacant buildings, including 200 that are more than 90 years old. Now it is trying to get rid of many of them.Supported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 When the towers of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers began rising after the Civil War, they were seen as soaring monuments to the nation\u2019s benevolence. But after more than a century of use, they became more of an albatross.The roof leaked. The wards were sheathed in lead paint and asbestos. The old wiring was a fire waiting to happen.The home was too antiquated to use, too grand to demolish. So a new veterans hospital was built next door at a fraction of the cost of renovation. The Department of Veterans Affairs, seeing no reason to waste money on hiring a wrecking ball, simply locked the doors of the soldiers home, which veterans had fondly referred to as Old Main, letting it slowly crumble away through what one local preservationist called \u201cdemolition by neglect.\u201dThe home has been sealed for 28 years.The Department of Veterans Affairs has 430 vacant buildings, including 200 that are more than 90 years old. Upkeep on this mothballed fleet costs at least $7 million a year. The secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David J. Shulkin, bent on streamlining the massive health care system, recently announced a push to get rid of the buildings within two years, either by leasing, selling or demolition. But the story of Milwaukee\u2019s old soldiers\u2019 home, and the veterans theater next door, shows that it will be far from simple.On a recent visit to the old hospital on a hill west of downtown, peeling paint hung like Spanish moss in the shadowy corridors, a snow of fallen ceiling plaster moldered on the floors, plastic netting swathed exterior walls to shield visitors from falling brickwork, and at the top of a trembling 19th Century ladder, the remnants of a nest suggested the highest tower had been occupied by a well-fed raccoon.\u201cIf it were easy, we\u2019d be doing it already,\u201d Paul Macpherson, who oversees leasing of unused buildings for the department, said as he stood on the weather-buckled boards of the 136-year-old theater\u2019s stage and looked at its 800 seats. \u201cBut who wants an old theater in the middle of a V.A. campus? We struggle to put deals together.\u201dThe veterans health care system is an attic of the nation\u2019s good intentions, cluttered with Victorian surgeons quarters and tuberculosis wards, World War I shell shock asylums, New Deal libraries, Cold War bowling alleys and even a monkey house built to keep disillusioned Union veterans entertained.For many buildings, there is no easy makeover, and few obvious buyers. Paying for upkeep is hard to justify at a time of soaring patient demand. So is paying for demolition. So hundreds of buildings stand preserved, at least for now, in a bureaucratic amber of indecision.\u201cWe believe in honoring the V.A.\u2019s history, but the best way to do that is to provide the best care today,\u201d said Gary Kunich, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Veterans Affairs medical center. He was giving a tour of a new, state-of-the-art spinal injury clinic built near Old Main that cost $27 million. Renovating the old soldiers home would have cost nearly twice that, he said, adding, that knocking it down would also cost millions. \u201cWe\u2019d rather spend the money here.\u201dOld Main was a model of modernity when it was authorized in 1865 by one of the last official acts of President Abraham Lincoln. It became home to about 1,000 former soldiers who rose at reveille each morning and dressed in blue uniforms, then filed into companies organized by disability. One visitor at the time praised the wards as \u201clarge and cheerful: well ventilated and well lighted.\u201dAs the building aged into obsolescence, though, it stubbornly resisted solutions. A proposed lease to the City of Milwaukee for offices and apartments, fell apart a decade ago amid protests from local veterans groups.As Old Main and the theater next-door deteriorated, the department considered calling in the bulldozers. But that plan stopped in 2011 when local preservationists got Old Main protected as a national historic landmark.\u201cThe bones of this building are great. You could never afford to build something like this today,\u201d said Joe Alexander, company\u2019s chief executive, as he toured the dark halls in a white hard hat.Just behind him, the company\u2019s finance expert, Jonathan Beck, added, \u201cThe trick was putting together the money.\u201dThe $33 million renovation will be paid for through a complex amalgam of low-income housing tax credits, federal housing vouchers, historical-preservation tax credits, grants and private donations, he said. Cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs: nothing.Preservationists and veterans hailed the deal.\u201cThis is a building of seminal importance to the story of the nation. It is where the story of caring for veterans starts,\u201d said Jim Draeger of the Wisconsin State Historic Preservation Office.But the same approach has not worked on architectural oddities like the Ward theater next door, which cannot qualify for the same grants and tax incentives aimed at solving homelessness. Closed since the 1980s, the elegant brick and stone theater has hardly changed for generations. Tangles of old film and manila rope haunt the area beneath he stage. Century-old vaudeville and minstrel posters plaster walls in the light booth. The 800 wooden seats, still fitted with wire hat racks, wait under a thick layer of dust.Over the decades, repeated efforts to revive the theater failed, including one fund-raising plan aimed at landing a big donation from the neighborhood kid turned celebrity Liberace, who made some of his first appearances at the theater\u2019s piano.The cost of simply keeping it locked became apparent a few years ago when the Department of Veterans Affairs had to spend $3 million to repair leaking roofs and windows. At that time, a life-size stained glass portrait of President Ulysses S. Grant that once graced the east wall was decamped to storage. It is unclear if it will ever return.Plenty of other buildings are stuck in a similar purgatory. In Tuskegee, Ala., a campus erected to serve African-American veterans from the Civil War and World War I has been closed for more than 30 years. The department said a rural location and poor repair have kept buyers away. The same is true of the campus in tiny Knoxville, Iowa, (population 7,200) which has 34 empty buildings including a dairy barn.Mr. Beck, who worked for the National Trust for Historic Preservation before putting together the financing to save Old Main, said a number of other department properties have potential as housing for the homeless, and Old Main could serve as a model.\u201cBut people will have to act,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these places get too far gone, it\u2019s too expensive. Then there are no good options.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the location of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. It is west of downtown Milwaukee, not east.Advertisement"}

The conservatives were expected to win, again.\u201cThat is unacceptable in 2017,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt is the woman\u2019s decision about when they choose to have children.\u201dHer main achievement, however, may be disrupting an election that had been seen as a surefire win for the conservative National Party.\u201cIn the last two elections, it\u2019s been relatively clear that the governing party would be the National Party,\u201d said Andrew Geddis, a professor at the law school of the University of Otago. Now, he added, \u201cwe might finally have a real election.\u201dA rising star in Labour since joining Parliament in 2008 as its youngest sitting member, Ms. Ardern is unconventional, accessible and ambitious.In an interview with The New York Times last month, she answered questions carefully but also joked about the stress of her new position. The number of days until the election, she said, is written in her diary \u201clike a horrific countdown to Armageddon.\u201dHer colleagues describe her as intensely focused. She grew up as a Mormon in a rural town working part-time jobs and earned a degree in communications from the University of Waikato. She worked her way up the Labour Party ranks, and along the way, she said, she discovered a passion for child welfare and economic equality.Grant Robertson, the party\u2019s finance spokesman and a close friend, recalled sharing a small office with Ms. Ardern in 2005 when they were both advisers to Helen Clark, the prime minister at the time who was the country\u2019s first elected female leader.Ms. Ardern was \u201cunflappable,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cShe was a person that took seriously everything she did in her working life, and I didn\u2019t get a sense she was there to aim for a particular position. She was just doing the job that had been put in front of her.\u201dIn March, she was elected deputy to the Labour Party\u2019s leader, Andrew Little. But after polls showed the party was set to fail with Mr. Little at the helm, he made a surprise move: He stepped aside and named Ms. Ardern as his replacement.When Ms. Ardern found out about the resignation, she was in a car on the way from the airport. An hour later, she officially had the top spot.There was so little time to transition that she had to \u201cget on with it,\u201d she said.Some political experts question whether Ms. Ardern has the experience needed. She has spent her career in the opposition and has not championed a bill in Parliament.\u201cThe question will be whether she can add the substance and steel that New Zealanders may look for in a leader of their country,\u201d Professor Geddis said.Ms. Ardern said that she relishes the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m actually enjoying the chance to demonstrate that I have in my heart and always will be a policy wonk,\u201d she said.But only a day into her leadership, a television commentator argued that employers had the right to ask women about their childbearing plans, prompting her steely response, which was applauded by women around the world.There have been other incidents as well. Earlier in the campaign, Paula Bennett, New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister, said that Ms. Ardern, unlike the prime minister, Bill English, did not have the substance and \u201cthe kind of brain to pull this country together,\u201d which prompted another backlash.Then Gareth Morgan, a leader of the Opportunities Party, said on Twitter that Ms. Ardern needed to prove she was more than \u201clipstick on a pig.\u201dThe comment was widely condemned, including by the prime minister. Mr. Morgan defended himself, saying that the phrase was a \u201ceuphemism for a meaningless face-lift or makeover.\u201dMs. Ardern said that she had tried to walk a fine line, standing up against sexism while also trying to share personal details that might help people understand who she is.\u201cI think probably one of my first interviews in Parliament, someone questioned me at length about my marital status,\u201d she said.\u201cThey want to know a bit about them \u2014 what kind of humans they are, what kind of values they have,\u201d she said.And in New Zealand, she added, even the nation\u2019s most powerful figures are expected to be down to earth.

{"Headline": "Sara Netanyahu, Wife of Israeli Prime Minister, to Face Fraud Charges", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s attorney general said Friday that he intended to bring fraud charges against Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing her of misusing some $100,000 in public funds in her management of the prime minister\u2019s official residence.But the nation\u2019s top prosecutor also closed, citing a lack of evidence, a host of other inquiries into Mrs. Netanyahu. These included allegations that she had used state funds to pay for outdoor furniture and electrical work for the Netanyahus\u2019 private home in Caesarea, had public employees care for her dying father, and improperly redeemed more than $1,000 in bottle deposits for cash.Mrs. Netanyahu, who will have the opportunity to try to block an indictment at a hearing, is accused of conspiring with a member of the prime minister\u2019s staff to conceal the fact that the residence employed a government-paid cook so she could order hundreds of catered meals from expensive restaurants and charge them to the state. Government rules prohibit charging the government for meals when a cook is on the premises.Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he would seek an indictment of Mrs. Netanyahu on charges of aggravated acquisition through fraudulent means, fraud and breach of trust. The most serious charge carries a possible sentence of five years in prison.For an Israeli public that has been riveted by the two-year, consistently leaky corruption investigation of the prime minister, his family and his top aides, the announcement met a fairly muted response. Mrs. Netanyahu has long battled a reputation for cupidity, and she and her husband have frequently turned allegations against them to their political advantage.Mr. Netanyahu posted messages on Facebook calling the accusations against his wife \u201cabsurd.\u201d He assailed the state\u2019s chief witness against her, a former household custodian, as \u201ca serial liar\u201d peddling a \u201cdelusional and mendacious story.\u201d\u201cThe very preoccupation with the food of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who works around the clock on behalf of the state and its security, and the food of his family, is pathetic and obsessive,\u201d he complained. \u201cNo prime minister before was subject to that kind of nosiness, even though the meal expenses of other prime ministers were identical and often far higher.\u201cHow much longer will this obsessive preoccupation with the Netanyahu family go on?\u2019\u201dAnother case involves cutthroat back-room deal making: Mr. Netanyahu was recorded seeking favorable coverage from a newspaper publisher in exchange for curtailing the circulation of a free competitor that is considered supportive of him.\u201cAll the charges that you see now, the fact that Sara is part of the story \u2013 it\u2019s about the gray area between the personal and political, the personal and the national, between the office and the home,\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, a former spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu who leads a right-leaning research group, the Institute for Zionist Strategies. \u201cHis weak point is this gray area. He might find himself out of office only because he thought that it\u2019s not important enough to supervise and take responsibility for what\u2019s happening in those gray areas.\u201dBut Zalman Shoval, a member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party and a former ambassador to the United States, said it would take a weightier case against the prime minister himself to move public opinion. \u201cPeople are beginning to be a bit philosophical about this whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, all will depend at the end of the day on whether there\u2019s something serious in it.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s political opponents were measured in their responses to the attorney general\u2019s announcement.\u201cAs bad as it seems, it doesn\u2019t change the entire picture,\u201d said Nachman Shai, a legislator from the opposition Zionist Union. \u201cHe\u2019s the prime minister.

Mr. Jost speculated that high-risk pools, which tended be very expensive to insure before the current health care law took effect, may be acceptable to some states.The measure also does not stipulate any way to make sure that states and insurers follow through with their declared intentions.Mr. Kimmel is correct that the bill authorizes block grants through Dec. 31, 2026, with no mention of funding after that year. Independent policy groups estimate that all states will begin to see a reduction in funding beginning in 2027.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t, however, mean that its continued funding is tied to CHIP,\u201d Mr. Levitt said.The two did not discuss pre-existing conditions during the five-minute interview, except for a passing mention in reference to President Trump\u2019s stance. When Mr. Kimmel asked about annual or lifetime payout caps, Mr. Cassidy suggested they were unnecessary but stopped short of a promise.\u201cYeah, as it turns out, the caps don\u2019t contribute \u2014 having a cap does not contribute that much to the expense,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said in May. \u201cYou can eliminate that cap and it does not really impact the cost of the policy.

{"Headline": "What Trump Can Do to Prevent the Next Crash", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank\u2019s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen.Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it\u2019s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking \u2014 often vaguely \u2014 about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself.The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low \u2014 and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as \u201cconsumer prices\u201d but now have a bigger influence on the economy.Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction.To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai.Today, global financial assets (including just stocks and bonds) are worth over $250 trillion and amount to about 330 percent of global gross domestic product, up from $12 trillion and just 110 percent in 1980. Traditionally, economists have looked for trouble in the economy to cause trouble in the markets. But the ocean of money in financial markets is now so large, it\u2019s possible that ripples on its surface could trigger the next big downturn.Since 1990, every major economic shock has been preceded by a collapse in prices for houses, stocks or both, including Japan\u2019s crash in 1990, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the dot-com crash of 2000-01, and the global financial crisis of 2008.The Fed has changed with the world before. After the Great Depression, it focused on fighting unemployment. Amid crippling consumer price inflation in the 1970s, it shifted its focus to fighting this scourge. Now, amid looming market bubbles from China to Norway, central bankers are tentatively starting to recognize that they can\u2019t ignore asset price inflation. At the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policy-making body, financial stability rarely came up before 2012 but has come up at 27 of 39 meetings since.Of course, even market insiders can\u2019t spot when asset prices are ready to crash, so skeptics say the Fed can\u2019t be expected to either. Better to let bubbles pop and \u201cmop up\u201d after. However, the painfully slow recovery from 2008 shows how ineffective mess-mopping can be: Losses after the crash tend to be much bigger than gains on the way up. The Fed need not try to predict the market\u2019s peak; it needs only to identify signals of crises, so that it can act early to forestall them, controlling asset price inflation by raising rates or reducing cash infusions into the economy.At least equally telling is the pace of increase in debt. When asset prices collapse, the owners suffer instant pain. But when debt used to buy those assets collapses, the resulting defaults ripple through banks and become a drag on the economy. The longest and deepest recessions tend to follow real estate busts, because homes are almost always purchased on credit, and during booms, so many buyers are tempted to borrow excessively for that dream house.Nonetheless most economists \u2014 even conservative deficit hawks who worry about the Fed \u201cblowing bubbles\u201d \u2014 still look mainly for economic threats to the financial markets, rather than the threat that overgrown markets pose.They thus don\u2019t recognize fully that the world has changed, and the tail now wags the dog. Many mainstream economists still argue that the economy can\u2019t be overheating if consumer price inflation is quiet, and they want to keep rates lower for longer, hoping that easy money will stoke growth in the economy, and jobs, for the poor and the working class.However, since 2008, easy money has produced an unusually weak economic recovery alongside an unusually long and strong run-up in prices for stocks, bonds and housing. The rich own the fattest share of these assets, so wealth inequality is increasing. In addition, easy money is fueling monopoly power by helping entrenched companies borrow.Liberals who question the value of promoting monopolies and the superrich might also question their fondness for easy money. Instead, to stabilize financial markets, most favor upholding tough post-2008 regulations \u2014 but regulation alone can\u2019t contain the ocean of money in financial assets. From Australia to Canada to Sweden, central banks are keeping rates low because consumer price inflation is weak, thus fueling housing bubbles. Regulatory attempts to contain those bubbles are failing.Central bankers are starting to recognize that when loose monetary policy is driving up asset prices to potentially unstable levels, it sows the seeds of a recession and hurts everyone. But only a minority are prepared to lean against the wind now. Asset prices from stocks to real estate have never been this expensive simultaneously.In general, government agencies, including the Fed, change their ways only after crises. The big threat is that the Fed will fully commit to preserving financial stability only after instability in the markets has triggered the next crisis. Mr. Trump should be looking for governors who are willing to commit now.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Newhouse, a top executive at Vanity Fair\u2019s parent company, Advance Publications. He added, \u201cWe\u2019re in no rush.\u201dMr. Carter said he had an idea for who might succeed him \u2014 he would not name names \u2014 and that he would offer suggestions to Vanity Fair\u2019s publisher, Cond\u00e9 Nast. \u201cI want to make it really easy for the next person,\u201d he said. \u201cI care about this magazine. I don\u2019t want it to go anywhere other than up.\u201dFrom a spacious corner office, amid cigarette smoke and midcentury furniture, Mr. Carter nurtured the musings of Christopher Hitchens, the true-crime yarns of Dominick Dunne, the portraiture of Annie Leibovitz and the wit of Fran Lebowitz and James Wolcott, to name a few of the artists and writers in the Vanity Fair stable.One Carter innovation, the Vanity Fair Oscar party, remains the entertainment world\u2019s most exclusive soiree, attracting a sea of boldface names to an Old Hollywood-style bacchanalia. Even drab Washington fell under his sway: His annual bash after the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner became the capital\u2019s hottest ticket.In his townhouse on Wednesday, however, Mr. Carter opted for self-effacement. \u201cI\u2019m very uncomfortable talking about myself like this,\u201d he said at one point. Asked whether he would still attend the magazine\u2019s Oscar party, Mr. Carter shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need me there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like a glorified ma\u00eetre d\u2019.\u201dHe said that he had considered leaving Vanity Fair earlier this year, but that Mr. Trump\u2019s election had spurred him to stay. Plus, in July, he hit the 25-year mark at the magazine, which he said \u201chad a tidy aspect to it.\u201d\u201cEditors, you know, we don\u2019t really do anything,\u201d Mr. Carter added. \u201cTo the owner, you\u2019re sort of like a patch of mold on the kitchen ceiling. You\u2019re not quite sure about it, but as long as it doesn\u2019t start dripping, you can just let it be.\u201dMr. Carter is leaving as Cond\u00e9 Nast, like all magazine publishers, grapples with an erosion of advertising and pressure online. The company has invested heavily in digital initiatives while cutting staff. \u201cThe romance of the magazine business will continue,\u201d Mr. Carter said, \u201cbut it will be harder to maintain.\u201dMr. Carter later ran The New York Observer before moving, in 1992, to Vanity Fair, which venerated some of the same celebrities he criticized in Spy. Some grudges healed easier than others.\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for my wife, I probably wouldn\u2019t be speaking to him 25 years later,\u201d the mogul Barry Diller, a favorite Spy target, said on Thursday. Mr. Diller\u2019s wife, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, knew Mr. Carter and persuaded the men to reacquaint. \u201cI\u2019ve come to know and adore him,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cHe wants a new adventure, and he deserves it.\u201dWill exiting the magazine leave him antsy? \u201cPeople think I\u2019m really antic,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have any idea how idle I could get. I love tinkering around with my cars, going out in my canoe, fishing and reading. I could do that for five months and not bat an eye.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cI\u2019m completely prepared that it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d He will continue to write; already, he plans to pitch a story during his stay in France to the editor of The New Yorker, David Remnick.\u201cHe\u2019ll probably say no,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201c\u2018How do you spell your name again, Graydon?\u2019\u201dMr. Carter recently started seeing a psychiatrist for the first time, prompted by the changes in the country and his own life. \u201cAt Spy, we would tack on the epithet \u2018survivor\u2019 to somebody, as if it was a negative term,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you realized, after a while, it\u2019s actually a positive term. Just surviving in life, in this life, is difficult enough.\u201dThat world is fading. \u201cI\u2019m by nature a very wistful person,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cAnd I miss the black-and-whiteness of the 20th century.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s tweeted about me 42 times, all in the negative,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cSo I blew up all the tweets and I framed them all. They\u2019re all on a wall \u2014 this is the only wall Trump\u2019s built \u2014 outside my office. There\u2019s a space left for one more tweet to complete the bottom line. So if he does, I\u2019m just going to call our framer, and say we need one more.\u201d\u201cIt should be a little bright spot in his administration,\u201d Mr. Carter added, puckishly. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s smart, he won\u2019t say anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hudson Rail Tunnel Is Focus of Meeting Between Trump and State Officials", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump huddled for about an hour with top officials from New York and New Jersey at the White House on Thursday, including Senators Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand and Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo and Chris Christie, to discuss the future of a multibillion-dollar tunnel between the two states.The so-called Gateway project, to build a train tunnel under the Hudson River, is considered the linchpin of transportation infrastructure in the region and a top priority for many officials from the two states. It would provide a critical additional link between New Jersey and New York\u2019s Pennsylvania Station.Thursday\u2019s guest list signaled the project\u2019s importance: In addition to the senators and governors, about a dozen members of Congress also attended the White House gathering. Mr. Trump was joined by Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary; Gary D. Cohn, his economic adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the budget director; and John F. Kelly, his chief of staff.\u201cThe meeting was positive. The president was receptive and wants to get back to us on Gateway,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement.The White House, too, said the meeting had been \u201cproductive.\u201dMr. Cuomo was less bullish. \u201cWhile the White House meeting was productive, it was inconclusive,\u201d he said.Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, said in an interview that the meeting \u201ccould not have been more positive.\u201d He added that the only specific numbers discussed were a $30 billion price tag and a 50-50 split between the federal government and the states in picking up those costs, which has been a point of contention in the past.That deal was clearly on the president\u2019s mind.\u201cHe must have mentioned bipartisanship six or seven times, and how important he thought yesterday\u2019s deal was,\u201d said Mr. King, one of a handful of Republicans present.At one point, Mr. King said the president turned to him to ask how the deal was \u201cplaying.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018Very well,\u2019\u201d Mr. King recalled, adding that he told the president, \u201cThis project would be a perfect example of bipartisanship.\u201dAfter the broader meeting broke up, Mr. Schumer stayed behind for a private session with the president, according to a person familiar with that meeting.The Obama administration had ranked Gateway as the most important transportation infrastructure project in the country. Amtrak, which owns the existing, century-old rail tunnel under the Hudson, has warned that damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 could force the closing of one of that tunnel\u2019s two tubes. If that happens, train traffic between New York City and points west would be reduced by 75 percent, Amtrak officials said.\u201cThis is a vital and critical project for the entire Northeast,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said of the Gateway tunnel, before the White House gathering.Mr. Cuomo has suggested that state and local authorities pick up half the cost, and that the federal government pay the other half. \u201cMy position is very simple: It\u2019s critical. It\u2019s vital. It\u2019s overdue. It\u2019s been talked about for too long. You should have had a shovel in the ground from the day you said go,\u201d he said, calling it \u201can act of negligence\u201d that the project has been delayed.One person briefed on the meeting \u2014 the New York and New Jersey officials came without aides \u2014 said Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Christie and Mr. Trump did most of the talking.Charles W. Moorman, a co-chief executive of Amtrak, said on Tuesday that he was hopeful that the Trump administration would commit to covering half of the cost of the project, which includes improvements to tracks and a bridge on the New Jersey side of the river. The overall project has an estimated cost of as much as $29 billion. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Mr. Christie, a Republican, have agreed that their states and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would cover the other half of the price tag.\u201cI\u2019m not concerned that we\u2019re not going to get the political support that we need,\u201d Mr. Moorman said, referring to the backing of the governors and the New York and New Jersey delegations.Emma G.

{"Headline": "Herbert Kalmbach, Who Figured in Watergate Payoffs, Dies at 95", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHerbert W. Kalmbach, Richard M. Nixon\u2019s personal lawyer and a conduit for hush money from the 1972 presidential campaign to the Watergate burglars, died on Sept. 15 in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 95.Mr. Kalmbach was briefly imprisoned and temporarily lost his law license for illegally raising vast bundles of cash, much of it furtively exacted from corporations and individuals.He oversaw a secret $500,000 stash to finance sabotage and spy operations against the Democrats run by the Nixon political operative Donald H. Segretti. He funneled $220,000 to pay off the seven defendants who had bungled the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex. And he steered $100,000 to an unsuccessful campaign to defeat George C. Wallace\u2019s comeback as governor of Alabama in 1970.Mr. Kalmbach also conveyed to the Nixon re-election war chest $2 million from the milk industry, which was promised federal subsidies. The money, from a dairy cooperative organization, came disguised illegally as small contributions.In another episode, after withdrawing $100,000 earmarked for the anti-Wallace effort from a safe deposit box, he hand-delivered the cash to a stranger in the lobby of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York, identifying himself as \u201cMr. Jensen of Detroit.\u201dMr. Kalmbach later testified that when John W. Dean III, the president\u2019s counsel, instructed him to meet him in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, to discuss the hush money, he was cued to wave his arms boisterously during their conversation so that they would not appear to be conspiratorial.\u201cIt was like a Grade B thriller,\u201d Mr. Kalmbach said.On Feb. 25, 1974, he pleaded guilty to violating the Federal Corrupt Practices Act by raising $3.9 million for a secret Republican congressional campaign committee. The money included a $100,000 contribution from an ambassador who was promised an even more prestigious post.\u201cThe fact that I had been directed to undertake these actions by the No. 2 and No. 3 men on the White House staff,\u201d Mr. Kalmbach said, \u201cmade it absolutely incomprehensible to me that my actions in this regard could have been regarded in any way as improper or unethical.\u201dHerbert Warren Kalmbach was born on Oct. 19, 1921, in Port Huron, Mich. When he was only 14, he contrived an airplane de-icer, which was reproduced in Popular Mechanics magazine. After serving in the Navy, he taught celestial navigation at the United States Naval Academy.He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1949 and a law degree in 1951 from the University of Southern California and was admitted to the bar in 1952. He became friendly with Nixon later in the 1950s after being introduced by H. R. Haldeman, Nixon\u2019s future chief of staff.His wife, Barbara Forbush Kalmbach, a former Rose Bowl princess, died in 2005. He is survived by a daughter, Lauren Kinsey, and a son, Kurt. Another son, Kenneth, died in 1980.After Nixon was elected president in 1968, Mr. Kalmbach rejected an offer to be deputy commerce secretary. Instead, he profited enormously as a real estate lawyer representing corporate clients who hoped to cash in on his personal relationship with the president. Mr. Kalmbach had handled Nixon\u2019s income tax returns and matters involving his home in San Clemente, Calif.It was unclear whether the payments were made with the president\u2019s direct approval.Mr. Kalmbach was asked during the Senate Watergate hearings if, as a lawyer, he would have advised a client to do what he did.\u201cIf the client had come to me in this situation, which is wholly separate from any situation that I could believe anyone would be faced with, I would have asked him to exercise caution and make inquiries,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut in my situation, Senator, I was dealing with the counsel to the president of the United States. It was a matter of absolute trust in the man\u2019s integrity and honesty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Car Buyers, Larger Inventories May Mean Good Deals", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserThe end of summer is often a good time to find deals on new car purchases \u2014 and that is especially true this year, given that car sales have slowed and dealers are eager to make sales.\u201cAugust, and September, is when you see some of the better discounts,\u201d said Ronald Montoya, consumer advice editor at the car website Edmunds.com. That is because dealers want to move cars off their lots, he said, to make way for the delivery of new model years.On Friday, six major automakers reported mixed results for August, in part because of Hurricane Harvey\u2019s impact on the Houston area, a significant market for new car sales, according to Bloomberg.\u201cThis has been a slower year than last year,\u201d Mr. Montoya said, \u201cand inventory is stacking up.\u201dInventories of used cars, the result of an increase in consumers turning leased cars in to dealers when their lease terms end, are also rising, providing competition for new car sales. A new car now sits on a dealer lot for an average of 74 days before being sold, the most since July 2009, when it was 80 days, according to JD Power & Associates.\u201cConsumers can use that to their advantage,\u201d said Jill Gonzalez, an analyst at the financial website WalletHub.The shift to something more like a buyer\u2019s market is a plus for consumers because new cars have generally become quite expensive. According to data from Experian Automotive, the average new vehicle loan reached a record $30,534 in the year\u2019s first quarter, and the average monthly payment on a new vehicle loan reached $509, also a record. The high prices have pushed buyers to extend the terms of car loans to five and even eight years, increasing overall interest costs.For the many buyers who need to finance a car purchase, rates for new cars are still favorable, according to an analysis by WalletHub. For new cars, the average rate for manufacturer financing on a three-year auto loan is 1.74 percent, the lowest since the end of last year.That means consumers shopping for a new vehicle for themselves, or perhaps for one a student could drive to school, may be able to find favorable terms on both the purchase price and the cost of financing.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be some deals available,\u201d said Claes Bell, an analyst with Bankrate.com. \u201cSlowing sales and rising inventory are good for consumers.\u201dStill, consumers may have to hunt for the best financing deals in the coming weeks. An Edmunds analysis found that automakers were a bit stingier with zero-percent offers in August than they were a year ago.Labor Day weekend is traditionally a busy weekend for car shopping, and dealers will probably be offering cash-back incentives and low-interest rate financing, to attract buyers.But consumers should be cautious when shopping on long holiday weekends. Zero-percent offers apply only to those who have excellent credit, so you may be tempted to sign up for a loan that is more expensive than you\u2019d like. And sale lots are likely to be crowded with other shoppers, Mr. Montoya said, meaning you will probably have to wait longer to take a test drive.Keep in mind that some offers will probably extend past the holiday, so you could spend time over the weekend researching prices and schedule a visit after the crowds have dispersed. Several carmakers are offering special deals and discounts this year that last through Tuesday.Here are some questions and answers about car shopping:Families have traditionally opted for used cars for new drivers because they were cheaper and less pristine, so getting a few dents was not a big deal. But these days, Mr. Montoya said, newer cars come with more safety features that can help protect teenagers who lack experience behind the wheel. A compromise might be a used car that\u2019s just a year or two old, which will cost less while still having up-to-date safety features. Or, he said, a new-car lease may be worth considering if safety is paramount, since interest rates on new-car leases may be favorable, helping to keep monthly payments low.Car manufacturers tend to offer the lowest rates, followed by credit unions, WalletHub\u2019s analysis found, while rates at national and local banks tended to be higher. So it makes sense to shop around, Ms. Gonzalez said.Buyers should not be immediately discouraged if they are not approved for an interest-free loan, Ms. Gonzalez said. If you don\u2019t qualify for zero-percent financing for three years, for instance, ask if you can pay no interest for just one year. \u201cThose terms are negotiable,\u201d she said.If your credit really needs improvement, however, consider waiting to buy a car if you can, she advised. Focus on saving as much cash as you can for the six months for a down payment, and paying off other debt to help raise your credit rating, to help you qualify for a better interest rate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Unveils Budget Blueprint Allowing $1.5 Trillion in Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Budget Committee unveiled a 2018 budget blueprint on Friday that would open the door for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, even as an independent analysis concluded that the plan as offered would far exceed that price tag and overwhelmingly benefit corporations and the rich.The budget resolution could also pave the way to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling, a hot-button Republican proposal that has languished for decades.Passing a budget resolution would be a critical step for President Trump and Republican lawmakers in moving forward with their plan to overhaul the tax code. The parliamentary language in the resolution would allow Republicans to pass tax cuts that cost as much as $1.5 trillion over the next decade with only 50 votes in the Senate, not the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Republican leaders concede that without a budget, there will be no tax cut.But the analysis released on Friday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center could change the politics of tax cutting and make even 50 votes a struggle in a Senate with 52 Republicans. The report estimated that the tax cuts that Republicans are considering would cost the government $2.4 trillion over 10 years \u2014 which would worsen budget deficits by considerably more than $1.5 trillion \u2014 while showering benefits on the wealthy.In the first detailed assessment of the plan\u2019s financial impact, the analysis found that the average tax bill for all income groups would decline by nearly $1,600 in 2018, boosting after-tax incomes by 2.1 percent. Those in the top 1 percent \u2014 with incomes above about $730,000 \u2014 would receive about half the total tax benefit. They would see an average tax cut of $129,000, increasing after-tax incomes by 8.5 percent.Those with incomes between about $49,000 and $86,000 would see an average tax cut of $660, raising their after-tax income by 1.2 percent.The analysis said the Republican plan also would provide enormous benefits to corporate America, with a $2.6 trillion cut in business taxes over the next decade. Individual income tax revenue would actually increase by $470 billion over that period, largely as a result of changes in personal deductions and exemptions as well as an increase in the bottom tax rate to 12 percent from 10 percent.\u201cTax collections would shift dramatically from businesses to individuals,\u201d said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center.The loss of deductions would hit the upper middle class the most, and more than a third of the taxpayers who earn $150,000 to $300,000 would see their taxes go up next year, the report found. They would be hit particularly hard by the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.The major findings in a preliminary analysis of the House Republican tax plan.And all of that would have to be squeezed into a $1.5 trillion budget hole, forcing lawmakers either to scale back cuts, phase them in, find more loopholes to close or identify other taxes to raise.The budget resolution released on Friday does foresee a balanced budget within 10 years \u2014 but only by assuming trillions of dollars in unspecified spending cuts and projecting higher economic growth than is forecast by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Republicans are counting on a surge of economic growth to pay for their tax plan, and the Tax Policy Center analysis does not account for those \u201cdynamic\u201d effects. The group\u2019s analysts said that they planned to release another report soon that does account for growth, but that they expected those results to be similar.In a preview of the partisan battles over the tax legislation to come, Democrats seized the analysis as evidence that talk of populism from Republicans is not to be trusted.\u201cThis report on Trump\u2019s tax scam is more hard evidence that the president and his out-of-touch millionaire advisers are executing a middle-class con job,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cWhile this administration continues to peddle false claim after false claim, nothing can hide the truth that the only individuals benefiting from this plan are the president, his family and his highflier friends.\u201d\u201cThis analysis is based on guesswork and biased assumptions designed to promote the authors\u2019 point of view \u2014 rather actual detail from a bill that has not yet been written by the committees,\u201d said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.The budget resolution, essentially a blueprint for federal revenues and spending for the 2018 fiscal year that begins on Sunday and beyond, lays the groundwork for approving a tax bill using special procedures that would shield it from a Democratic filibuster. Republicans used the same strategy in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Budget Committee, called the budget resolution \u201cthe first important step in providing Congress with the tools it needs to enact tax reform that will grow America\u2019s economy and strengthen hardworking families and small businesses.\u201dDemocrats cast the plan as fiscally irresponsible and harmful to the middle class.\u201cThe Senate Republican budget is the clearest sign yet that Republicans are intent on pursuing a tax plan that would blow a huge hole in the deficit and stack up debt, leading to cuts in programs that middle-class Americans rely on,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cThis budget would green-light a tax scheme that could very well put Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on the chopping block.\u201dSenator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and the Budget Committee\u2019s ranking member, denounced the blueprint as \u201cone of the most destructive budgets in modern American history.\u201d\u201cThis budget is the Robin Hood principle in reverse,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the Republican budget takes from the middle class and those in need, and gives huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country.\u201dThe budget resolution instructs the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to develop the tax legislation by Nov. 13.The resolution also instructs two other panels, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee, to draft legislation by that date that would reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the next 10 years.That language would free up the chairwoman of the Senate panel, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to pursue her long-sought goal of opening of the Arctic wildlife refuge to oil exploration.Republicans and Democrats have battled for decades over the refuge. But with a supportive president and unified Republican control of Congress, the budget instructions could finally break the stalemate, with the drilling language tacked on to the tax bill.\u201cThis provides an excellent opportunity for our committee to raise $1 billion in federal revenues while creating jobs and strengthening our nation\u2019s long-term energy security,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said in a statement that did not mention drilling.Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a longtime opponent of opening the refuge, was less circumspect.\u201cThere is bipartisan opposition to drilling in our nation\u2019s most pristine wildlife refuge,\u201d he said, \u201cand any effort to include it in the tax package would only further imperil the legislation as a whole.\u201dIn order to pass legislation using the procedures that would protect it from a filibuster, both the House and the Senate will need to agree on a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year.The House Budget Committee approved its own budget resolution in July, and although it had been stalled, the full House is expected to vote on it next week. The House budget calls for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit, and it instructs congressional committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings.The Senate Budget Committee plans to consider its budget resolution next week as well.Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

If it follows this practice after dealing with the costs of settling legal claims arising from the security breach, Equifax\u2019s top managers will essentially escape financial accountability for the blunder.I asked Equifax whether its board would stop excluding legal settlement costs from executive compensation calculations so that management would be required to absorb some of the pain.Equifax is not alone in excluding certain costs of doing business from the financial factors it uses to determine executive pay. Such practices have become prevalent among large United States companies.Equifax uses two main performance measures to decide incentive pay. One, called corporate adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, is not calculated using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. It is figured by excluding certain costs \u2014 such as those related to acquisitions \u2014 that normally flow through a company\u2019s profit-and-loss statement. This has the effect of making Equifax\u2019s earnings per share look better in this measure than they actually do under accounting rules.Equifax says in regulatory filings that it uses the adjusted earnings figure because it best represents the company\u2019s profit growth. Top managers at the company get a larger or smaller annual incentive award based on increases in this measure over the course of a year.Acquisition expenses make up the bulk of the costs Equifax has excluded from its profit calculation in recent years. But Equifax has also excluded costs associated with impaired investments and legal settlements from the figure.In regulatory filings, Equifax said its exclusion of legal charges from certain financial results \u201cprovides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results\u201d and is consistent with the way management reviews and assesses the company\u2019s historical performance.When settlements are small, of course, excluding the legal costs associated with them is a nonevent. And in recent years that has been the case at Equifax, with settlements equaling around 1 percent of net income.But the scope of Equifax\u2019s recent security breach is so far-reaching that legal settlements arising from it will most likely be enormous. And this brings up another question: whether Equifax executives should return past pay because of the security failure. Certainly, last year\u2019s proxy filings indicate that the pay received by the company\u2019s top three executives was based in part on their accomplishments in keeping consumers\u2019 data secure.Consider Richard F. Smith, the chief executive and chairman of the Equifax board, who received $15 million in total compensation in 2016, up from $13 million in 2015. One rationale for his pay package, the proxy said, was Mr. Smith\u2019s \u201cdistinguished\u201d work in meeting his individual management objectives for 2016. Among those objectives was \u201cemploying advanced analytics and technology to help drive client growth, security, efficiency and profitability.\u201dOr take John Gamble, Equifax\u2019s chief financial officer. He also received a rating of \u201cdistinguished\u201d on his individual objectives, the proxy said, because he continued \u201cto advance and execute global enterprise risk management processes, including directing increased investment in data security, disaster recovery and regulatory compliance capabilities.\u201d Mr. Gamble received $3.1 million in 2016.John J. Kelley III, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, also achieved a \u201cdistinguished\u201d rating from the Equifax board last year. One reason: He continued \u201cto refine and build out the company\u2019s global security organization.\u201d Mr. Kelley received $2.8 million in compensation last year.Will these executives be asked to return any of this pay given that their ratings on security are now looking a little less distinguished?Equifax declined to answer this question.What the Equifax mess seems to show, yet again, is the heads-I-win, tails-you-lose deal between executives and shareholders that is so prevalent at major corporations today.As for Equifax\u2019s exclusion of litigation costs in its profit measure, Mr. Ciesielski, the accounting expert, said that should be allowed only for events that are outside of management\u2019s control. \u201cA hurricane, an earthquake, falling space debris \u2014 all those things are exogenous, outside of management\u2019s control and ultimately more forgivable,\u201d Mr. Ciesielski said. \u201cBad management leading to customer harm is exogenous and forgivable? That\u2019s a lot harder to accept.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

While turnover is typical in the early days of a Silicon Valley start-up, people had hinted at misbehavior among the executive ranks. The chief executive, Mike Cagney, seemed particularly controversial.We had no inkling that this history would be bad enough to force Mr. Cagney to give up his position as the C.E.O., as it did on Monday of this week, and to consume our lives for weeks. At the time, we simply put SoFi reporting on our to-do lists and then, like all reporters, got sidetracked by breaking news.In August, we got our opportunity to return to SoFi when a lawyer sent us the complaint for a lawsuit against the company, charging that an employee had been fired for reporting sexual harassment allegations to management.Former employees quickly began to reach out, saying the problems were not isolated to Healdsburg, or to sexual harassment. These employees were uncomfortable with Mr. Cagney\u2019s willingness to pursue female employees, but also with his desire to grow the lending business by taking big risks. Both of us covered the financial crisis in New York, and we knew that risky lending can cause a lot of pain \u2014 for borrowers, for the lenders themselves and for society more broadly \u2014 when borrowers discover that they can\u2019t pay back their loans.A story like this necessitates a ton of phone calls, and it\u2019s typical to get a whole range of responses. So we were surprised by the consistency of the anecdotes shared by everyone from executives to customer service representatives, from all periods of SoFi\u2019s history. In total, we reached more than 30 SoFi veterans, along with many investors who knew the company well.We had to talk to so many people, in part, because almost everyone we spoke to was willing to speak with us only on background, not for attribution, so as not to jeopardize their current jobs. When using unnamed sources, you can print only information that can be verified by multiple people, given that readers can\u2019t evaluate the reliability of the sources themselves.And it\u2019s important to note that many of the people who reached out to us believed in the importance of SoFi\u2019s basic effort to challenge the financial industry and provide better choices for consumers who need to borrow money. They said they were speaking to us, in many cases, because they wanted to save the company from executives who were putting that at risk.Exploring all of this as a team helped us at several points. We could both draw on different sets of sources and cover ground more quickly. We also served as checks on what leads to follow and which ones to ignore.But none of this made the reporting easy, especially coming as it did during August. Nathaniel was on vacation, and then Katie on her honeymoon. Many calls were made from pools and beachside balconies. In an unexpectedly lucky twist, visa delays put the kibosh on an overseas reporting trip Nathaniel had scheduled for the first week in September.When we went to the company on Saturday, to begin our fact-checking process, we assumed we had a long haul ahead of us to finish our story: The company needed to hear every detail we would run and have an opportunity to respond. But on Monday afternoon it became clear that the company\u2019s board was meeting \u2014 and was looking at the allegations we were bringing to them.We are already getting more emails and phone calls that point to where the story might go from here \u2014 both with SoFi and the issue of bad behavior in Silicon Valley more broadly. These issues aren\u2019t going away anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Business Got Brazil Hooked on Junk Food", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "FORTALEZA, Brazil \u2014 Children\u2019s squeals rang through the muggy morning air as a woman pushed a gleaming white cart along pitted, trash-strewn streets. She was making deliveries to some of the poorest households in this seaside city, bringing pudding, cookies and other packaged foods to the customers on her sales route.As she dropped off variety packs of Chandelle pudding, Kit-Kats and Mucilon infant cereal, there was something striking about her customers: Many were visibly overweight, even small children.She gestured to a home along her route and shook her head, recalling how its patriarch, a morbidly obese man, died the previous week. \u201cHe ate a piece of cake and died in his sleep,\u201d she said.Mrs. da Silva, who herself weighs more than 200 pounds, recently discovered that she had high blood pressure, a condition she acknowledges is probably tied to her weakness for fried chicken and the Coca-Cola she drinks with every meal, breakfast included.A New York Times examination of corporate records, epidemiological studies and government reports \u2014 as well as interviews with scores of nutritionists and health experts around the world \u2014 reveals a sea change in the way food is produced, distributed and advertised across much of the globe. The shift, many public health experts say, is contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago.The new reality is captured by a single, stark fact: Across the world, more people are now obese than underweight. At the same time, scientists say, the growing availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods is generating a new type of malnutrition, one in which a growing number of people are both overweight and undernourished.\u201cThe prevailing story is that this is the best of all possible worlds \u2014 cheap food, widely available. If you don\u2019t think about it too hard, it makes sense,\u201d said Anthony Winson, who studies the political economics of nutrition at the University of Guelph in Ontario. A closer look, however, reveals a much different story, he said. \u201cTo put it in stark terms: The diet is killing us.\u201dEven critics of processed food acknowledge that there are multiple factors in the rise of obesity, including genetics, urbanization, growing incomes and more sedentary lives. Nestl\u00e9 executives say their products have helped alleviate hunger, provided crucial nutrients, and that the company has squeezed salt, fat and sugar from thousands of items to make them healthier. But Sean Westcott, head of food research and development at Nestl\u00e9, conceded obesity has been an unexpected side effect of making inexpensive processed food more widely available.\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect what the impact would be,\u201d he said.Part of the problem, he added, is a natural tendency for people to overeat as they can afford more food. Nestl\u00e9, he said, strives to educate consumers about proper portion size and to make and market foods that balance \u201cpleasure and nutrition.\u201dObesity rates in the United States, the South Pacific and the Persian Gulf are among the highest in the world \u2014 more than one in four Americans is obese. But over the last 35 years, obesity, defined as having a body mass index over 30, has grown the fastest in countries throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia.By Audrey Carlsen | Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Data not available for French Guiana and Western Sahara.In places as distant as China, South Africa and Colombia, the rising clout of big food companies also translates into political influence, stymieing public health officials seeking soda taxes or legislation aimed at curbing the health impacts of processed food.The same trends are mirrored with fast food, which grew 30 percent worldwide from 2011 to 2016, compared with 21 percent in the United States, according to Euromonitor. Take, for example, Domino\u2019s Pizza, which in 2016 added 1,281 stores \u2014 one \u201cevery seven hours,\u201d noted its annual report \u2014 all but 171 of them overseas.\u201cAt a time when some of the growth is more subdued in established economies, I think that strong emerging-market posture is going to be a winning position,\u201d Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, recently told investors. Developing markets now provide the company with 42 percent of its sales.For some companies, that can mean specifically focusing on young people, as Ahmet Bozer, president of Coca-Cola International, described to investors in 2014. \u201cHalf the world\u2019s population has not had a Coke in the last 30 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s 600 million teenagers who have not had a Coke in the last week. So the opportunity for that is huge.\u201dIndustry defenders say that processed foods are essential to feed a growing, urbanizing world of people, many of them with rising incomes, demanding convenience.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of all factories and go back to growing all grain. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s not going to work,\u201d said Mike Gibney, a professor emeritus of food and health at University College Dublin and a consultant to Nestl\u00e9. \u201cIf I ask 100 Brazilian families to stop eating processed food, I have to ask myself: What will they eat? Who will feed them? How much will it cost?\u201dIn many ways, Brazil is a microcosm of how growing incomes and government policies have led to longer, better lives and largely eradicated hunger. But now the country faces a stark new nutrition challenge: over the last decade, the country\u2019s obesity rate has nearly doubled to 20 percent, and the portion of people who are overweight has nearly tripled to 58 percent. Each year, 300,000 people are diagnosed with Type II diabetes, a condition with strong links to obesity.Brazil also highlights the food industry\u2019s political prowess. In 2010, a coalition of Brazilian food and beverage companies torpedoed a raft of measures that sought to limit junk food ads aimed at children. The latest challenge has come from the country\u2019s president, Michel Temer, a business-friendly centrist whose conservative allies in Congress are now seeking to chip away at the handful of regulations and laws intended to encourage healthy eating.\u201cWhat we have is a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food once produced by the farmers around you and the producers of ultra-processed food designed to be over-consumed and which in some cases are addictive,\u201d said Carlos A. Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cIt\u2019s a war,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one food system has disproportionately more power than the other.\u201dMrs. da Silva reaches customers in Fortaleza\u2019s slums, many of whom don\u2019t have ready access to a supermarket. She champions the product she sells, exulting in the nutritional claims on the labels that boast of added vitamins and minerals.\u201cEveryone here knows that Nestl\u00e9 products are good for you,\u201d she said, gesturing to cans of Mucilon, the infant cereal whose label says it is \u201cpacked with calcium and niacin,\u201d but also Nescau 2.0, a sugar-laden chocolate powder.She became a Nestl\u00e9 vendor two years ago, when her family of five was struggling to get by. Though her husband is still unemployed, things are looking up. With the $185 a month she earns selling Nestl\u00e9 products, she was able to buy a new refrigerator, a television and a gas stove for the family\u2019s three-room home at the edge of a fetid tidal marsh.He said sagging incomes among poor and working-class Brazilians had actually been a boon for direct sales. That\u2019s because unlike most food retailers, Nestl\u00e9 gives customers a full month to pay for their purchases. It also helps that saleswomen \u2014 the program employs only women \u2014 know when their customers receive Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, a monthly government subsidy for low-income households.\u201cThe essence of our program is to reach the poor,\u201d Mr. Barbosa said. \u201cWhat makes it work is the personal connection between the vendor and the customer.\u201dNestl\u00e9 increasingly also portrays itself as a leader in its commitment to community and health. Two decades ago, it anointed itself a \u201cnutrition health and wellness company.\u201d Over the years, the company says it has reformulated nearly 9,000 products to reduce salt, sugar and fat, and it has delivered billions of servings fortified with vitamins and minerals. It emphasizes food safety and the reduction of food waste, and it works with nearly 400,000 farmers around the world to promote sustainable farming.In an interview at Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new $50 million campus in suburban Cleveland, Mr. Westcott, head of food research and development, said the door-to-door sales program reflected another of the company\u2019s slogans: \u201cCreating shared values.\u201d\u201cWe create shared value by creating micro-entrepreneurs \u2014 people that can build their own businesses,\u201d he said. A company like Nestl\u00e9 can bolster the well-being of entire communities \u201cby actually sending positive messages around nutrition,\u201d he said.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s portfolio of foods is vast and different from that of some snack companies, which make little effort to focus on healthy offerings. They include Nesfit, a whole-grain cereal; low-fat yogurts like Molico that contain a relatively modest amount of sugar (six grams); and a range of infant cereals, served with milk or water, that are fortified with vitamins, iron and probiotics.Dr. Gibney, the nutritionist and Nestl\u00e9 consultant, said the company deserved credit for reformulating healthier products.But of the 800 products that Nestl\u00e9 says are available through its vendors, Mrs. da Silva says her customers are mostly interested in only about two dozen of them, virtually all sugar-sweetened items like Kit-Kats; Nestl\u00e9 Greek Red Berry, a 3.5-ounce cup of yogurt with 17 grams of sugar; and Chandelle Pacoca, a peanut-flavored pudding in a container the same size as the yogurt that has 20 grams of sugar \u2014 nearly the entire World Health Organization\u2019s recommended daily limit.Dr. Popkin finds the door-to-door marketing emblematic of an insidious new era in which companies seek to reach every doorstep in an effort to grow and become central to communities in the developing world. \u201cThey\u2019re not leaving an inch of country left aside,\u201d he said.On the streets of Fortaleza, where Nestl\u00e9 is admired for its Swiss pedigree and perceived high quality, negative sentiments about the company are rarely heard.The home of Joana D\u2019arc de Vasconcellos, 53, another vendor, is filled with Nestl\u00e9-branded stuffed animals and embossed certificates she earned at nutrition classes sponsored by Nestl\u00e9. In her living room, pride of place is given to framed photographs of her children at age 2, each posed before a pyramid of empty Nestl\u00e9 infant formula cans. As her son and daughter grew up, she switched to other Nestl\u00e9 products for children: Nido Kinder, a toddler milk powder; Chocapic, a chocolate-flavored cereal; and the chocolate milk powder Nescau.\u201cWhen he was a baby, my son didn\u2019t like to eat \u2014 until I started giving him Nestl\u00e9 foods,\u201d she said proudly.Ms. de Vasconcellos has diabetes and high blood pressure. Her 17-year-old daughter, who weighs more than 250 pounds, has hypertension and polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder strongly linked to obesity. Many other relatives have one or more ailments often associated with poor diets: her mother and two sisters (diabetes and hypertension), and her husband (hypertension.) Her father died three years ago after losing his feet to gangrene, a complication of diabetes.\u201cEvery time I go to the public health clinic, the line for diabetics is out the door,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a family here that doesn\u2019t have it.\u201dMs. de Vasconcellos previously tried selling Tupperware and Avon products door to door, but many customers failed to pay. Six years ago, after a friend told her about Nestl\u00e9\u2019s direct sales program, Ms. Vasconcellos jumped at the chance.She says her customers have never failed to pay her.\u201cPeople have to eat,\u201d she said.In May 2000, Denise Coitinho, then director of nutrition for the Ministry of Health, was at a Mother\u2019s Day party at her children\u2019s school when her mobile phone rang. It was Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief of government relations. \u201cHe was really upset,\u201d she recalled.The source of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s concern was a new policy that Brazil had adopted and was pushing at the World Health Organization. If adopted, the policy would have recommended that children around the world breast-feed for six months, rather than the previous recommendation of four to six months, she said.It is hard to overstate the economic power and political access enjoyed by food and beverage conglomerates in Brazil, which are responsible for 10 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output and employ 1.6 million people.In 2014, food companies donated $158 million to members of Brazil\u2019s National Congress, a threefold increase over 2010, according to Transpar\u00eancia Brasil. A study the organization released last year found that more than half of Brazil\u2019s current federal legislators had been elected with donations from the food industry \u2013 before the Supreme Court banned corporate contributions in 2015.The single largest donor to congressional candidates was the Brazilian meat giant JBS, which gave candidates $112 million in 2014; Coca-Cola gave $6.5 million in campaign contributions that year, and McDonald\u2019s donated $561,000.So the stage was set for a mammoth political battle when, in 2006, the government sought to enact far-reaching food-industry regulations to curb obesity and disease. The measures, growing out of the earlier breast-feeding policy, included advertising alerts to warn consumers about foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats, as well as marketing restrictions to dampen the lure of highly processed foods and sugary beverages, especially those aimed at children.Taking a page from the government\u2019s successful efforts to limit tobacco marketing, the new rules would have barred brands like Pepsi and KFC from sponsoring sports and cultural events.\u201cWe thought that Brazil could be a model for the rest of the world, a country that puts the well-being of its citizens above all else,\u201d said Dirceu Raposo de Mello, then director of the government\u2019s health surveillance agency, widely known by the Portuguese acronym Anvisa. \u201cUnfortunately, the food industry did not feel the same way.\u201dThe food companies took a low profile, mustering behind the Brazilian Association of Food Industries, a lobbying group whose board of vice presidents included executives from Nestl\u00e9; the American meat giant Cargill; and Unilever, the European food conglomerate that owns brands like Hellmann\u2019s, Mazola oil and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. The association declined to comment for this article.During the early days of public hearings, the industry seemed to be negotiating the rules in good faith but behind the scenes, health advocates say corporate lawyers and lobbyists were quietly waging a multipronged campaign to derail the process.Industry-financed academics began appearing on TV to assail the rules as economically ruinous. Other experts wrote newspaper editorial pieces suggesting that exercise and stricter parenting might be more effective than regulations aimed at fighting childhood obesity.The industry\u2019s most potent rallying cry, analysts say, was its strident denunciation of the proposed advertising restrictions as censorship. The accusation had particular resonance given the nearly two decades of military dictatorship that ended in 1985.At one meeting, a representative from the food industry accused Anvisa of trying to subvert parental authority, saying mothers had the right to decide what to feed their children, recalled Vanessa Schottz, a nutrition advocate. In another meeting, she said, a toy industry representative stood up and assailed the proposed marketing rules, saying they would deprive Brazilian children of the toys that sometimes accompany fast-food meals. \u201cHe said we were killing the dreams of children,\u201d Ms. Schottz recalled. \u201cWe were dumbfounded.\u201dChastened by the industry criticism, Anvisa in late 2010 withdrew most of the proposed restrictions. What remained was a single proposal requiring that ads include a warning about unhealthy food and beverages.Then came the lawsuits.Over the course of several months, a disparate collection of industry groups filed 11 lawsuits against Anvisa. The plaintiffs included the national association of biscuit manufacturers, the corn growers lobby and an alliance of chocolate, cocoa and candy companies. Some of the lawsuits claimed that the regulations violated constitutional protections on free speech, while others said the agency did not have the standing to regulate the food and advertising industries.Mr. Raposo de Mello, the former Anvisa president, says he was stunned by Mr. Adam\u2019s change of heart, given the attorney general office\u2019s longstanding support for Anvisa. Seven years later, with most of the 11 lawsuits still unresolved, the regulations remain frozen.\u201cThe industry,\u201d Mr. Raposo de Mello said, \u201cdid an end run around the system.\u201dIn the meantime, the food and beverage industry became more aggressive as it sought to neutralize Anvisa, which it viewed as its greatest adversary.In 2010, in the midst of the battle against the agency\u2019s proposed regulations, a group of 156 business executives took its grievances to the campaign of Dilma Rousseff, who was running for president.Marcello Fragano Baird, a political scientist in S\u00e3o Paulo who has studied the food lobby\u2019s campaign against the nutrition regulations, said Ms. Rousseff assured the executives she would shake up Anvisa. \u201cShe promised them she would \u2018clean house\u2019 once elected,\u201d he said, adding that he learned about the encounter through interviews with participants.Ms. Rouseff won, and soon after her inauguration, she replaced Mr. Raposo de Mello with Jaime C\u00e9sar de Moura Oliveira, a longtime political ally and a former lawyer for the Brazilian subsidiary of the food giant Unilever.A spokesman for Ms. Rouseff declined to make her available for an interview.In 2012, Anvisa hosted a traveling anti-obesity exhibit at its offices. Titled \u201cLose Weight Brazil,\u201d the exhibit extolled exercise and moderation as the keys to tackling obesity, but largely ignored mainstream scientific evidence about the dangers of consuming too much sugar, soda and processed food.The exhibition\u2019s sponsor? Coca-Cola.More than 1,000 miles south of Fortaleza, the effects of changing eating habits are evident at a brightly painted day care center in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city. Each day, more than a hundred children pack classrooms, singing the alphabet, playing and taking group naps.When it was started in the early 1990s, the program, run by a Brazilian nonprofit group, had a straightforward mission: to alleviate undernutrition among children who were not getting enough to eat in the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods.These days many of those who attend are noticeably pudgy and, the staff nutritionists note, some are worryingly short for their age, the result of diets heavy in salt, fat and sugar but lacking in the nourishment needed for healthy development.\u201cWe are even getting babies, which is something we never saw before,\u201d said Giuliano Giovanetti, who does outreach and communications for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis for our society because we are producing a generation of children with impaired cognitive abilities who will not reach their full potential.\u201dNearly 9 percent of Brazilian children were obese in 2015, more than a 270 percent increase since 1980, according to a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. That puts it in striking distance of the United States, where 12.7 percent of children were obese in 2015.The figures are even more alarming in the communities served by the center: In some neighborhoods, 30 percent of the children are obese and another 30 percent malnourished, according to the organization\u2019s own data, which found that 6 percent of obese children were also malnourished.The rising obesity rates are largely associated with improved economics, as families with increasing incomes embrace the convenience, status and flavors offered by packaged foods.Busy parents ply their toddlers with instant noodles and frozen chicken nuggets, meals that are often accompanied by soda. Rice, beans, salad and grilled meats \u2014 building blocks of the traditional Brazilian diet \u2014 are falling by the wayside, studies have found.Compounding the problem is the rampant street violence that keeps young children cooped up indoors.\u201cIt\u2019s just too dangerous to let my kids play outside, so they spend all their free time sitting on the couch playing video games and watching TV,\u201d said Elaine Pereira dos Santos, 35, the mother of two children, 9 and 4 years old, both overweight.Isaac, the 9-year-old, weighs 138 pounds and can wear only clothing intended for adolescents. Ms. dos Santos, who works at a hospital pharmacy, shortens the pants legs for him.Like many Brazilian mothers, she was pleased when Isaac began to gain weight as a toddler, not long after he tasted his first McDonald\u2019s French fry. \u201cI always thought fatter is better when it comes to babies,\u201d she said. She happily indulged his eating habits, which included frequent trips to fast-food outlets and almost no fruits and vegetables.But when he began having trouble running and complained about achy knees, Ms. dos Santos knew something was wrong. \u201cThe hardest part is the ridicule he gets from other children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we go out shopping, even adults point and stare\u201d or call him gordinho, roughly translated to \u201clittle fatty.\u201dAt the S\u00e3o Paulo nursery, health care workers keep tabs on the children\u2019s physical and cognitive development, while nutritionists teach parents how to prepare inexpensive, healthy meals. For some children, the center\u2019s test kitchen provides their first introduction to cabbage, plums and mangos.One of the fundamental challenges is persuading parents that their children are sick. \u201cUnlike cancer or other illnesses, this is a disability you can\u2019t see,\u201d said Juliana Dellare Calia, 42, a nutritionist with the organization.Although staff members say the program has made significant strides in changing the way families eat, many children will nonetheless face a lifelong battle with obesity.

{"Headline": "Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday began an ambitious push to slash taxes and salvage what remains of his embattled legislative agenda in Congress this year, proposing a politically challenging array of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that would constitute the most sweeping changes to the federal tax code in decades.Mr. Trump, smarting from the latest defeat this week of his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, cast the tax plan as an economic imperative and the fulfillment of a promise to his working-class supporters to deliver benefits in the form of lower taxes, better jobs and higher wages.\u201cThis is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor and as wages start going up at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in many years,\u201d Mr. Trump told hundreds of supporters in a speech at the Indiana State Fair Grounds.But the president offered no measure of the plan\u2019s cost and scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations, including the elimination of taxes on large inheritances and deep reductions in the rates paid by businesses large and small.After months of secret talks among Republicans, the nine-page proposal produced by the so-called Big Six working group prompts as many questions as it provides answers. Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul \u2014 or if it will favor the richest Americans.On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That would allow people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits and deductions. It would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified amount, and create a new $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, such as the elderly.Provisions such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, a levy on inherited wealth that Mr. Trump has derided for years, would be gone under the Republican proposal.The proposal calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a shift that supporters say is needed to make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world.The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.\u201cThis will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,\u201d Mr. Trump said.While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year. The push began at a House Republican retreat on Wednesday at Fort McNair in Washington, where Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, walked members through the blueprint and talked about the importance of coming together to fix the tax code.Later, in a hopeful sign for Republican leaders fretting privately about keeping their rank and file together, the conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members have derailed the party\u2019s initiatives with hard-line demands, issued a statement of support calling the plan \u201cforward looking\u201d and pledging to back the party\u2019s budget designed to ensure its passage.The political stakes are high for a president who is desperate to score a legislative win before his first year in office draws to a close. Mr. Trump, who has eschewed the advocacy tours that his predecessors have used to build support for their top domestic priorities, made a rare direct appeal to voters during his speech, imploring them to call their representatives and senators and demand action on the tax proposal. \u201cLet them know you\u2019re watching,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cLet them know you\u2019re waiting.\u201dIn an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But behind the scenes, Republican congressional leaders and senior White House officials have discussed bypassing Democrats and using special budget rules that would allow them to get the bill through Congress on a simple majority vote. And Mr. Trump paired his scripted talk of bipartisanship with an impromptu threat to Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, saying he would personally work to defeat the senator\u2019s re-election bid next year if he does not fall into line on the tax plan.\u201cIf Senator Donnelly doesn\u2019t approve it \u2014 because, you know, he\u2019s on the other side \u2014 we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Mr. Trump said as Mr. Donnelly looked on from the audience.Conservatives cheered the plan as a bold and long-awaited step to spur economic growth, while Democratic leaders condemned it as an irresponsible boon to the rich. And some budget watchdogs expressed worry about the long-term impact of a plan they said could cost more than $2 trillion over a decade.The New York Times on Wednesday obtained the Trump administration's proposed tax framework that includes what would be the most sweeping changes to the tax code in decades.Mr. Trump, who has broken with precedent for modern American presidents by refusing to release his tax returns, insisted that wealthy people like him would not benefit \u2014 an assertion that seemed improbable for a man who runs a family-owned real estate empire and whose children stand to inherit vast sums.\u201cTax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Mr. Trump said, framing a proposal that would affect hundreds of millions of Americans in terms of his own self-interest. \u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing, and it\u2019s not good for me, believe me.\u201dDemocrats scoffed. \u201cIf this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIt violates Trump\u2019s tax pledge that the rich would not gain at all under his plan by offering sweetheart deals for powerful C.E.O.s, giveaways for campaign coffers and a new way to cheat taxes for Mar-a-Lago\u2019s loyal members.\u201dAs with the individual side, some of the thornier business tax issues remain unaddressed. It will be left to Congress to create safeguards that prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through businesses, which would tax their income at a lower rate.Most itemized deductions, including those widely used for state and local tax expenses, would also be eliminated, along with most of the tax credits that businesses use. However, the plan would preserve the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving and keep incentives for education and retirement savings plans, as well as preserve the tax credits for research and development and low-income-housing on the business side.Another big change for companies would be a limitation of the deductibility for corporate interest expenses, in exchange for the opportunity to immediately expense business investments. The ability to immediately write off these expenses would last only five years, and the limitations for deducting interest have yet to be determined.Perhaps the most significant, yet murky, shift is the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. In theory, this means that companies would not be taxed on their overseas earnings. But to prevent erosion of the tax base, Republicans plan to impose some form of tax on foreign profits. The transition to the new system would also include a one-time repatriation tax at yet-to-be-determined rates to encourage companies to bring offshore profits back home.Administration officials did not provide a cost estimate for the plan. Members of the Senate Budget Committee have agreed on a budget resolution that would allow for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.Republicans say economic growth will compensate for lost revenue. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that a growing economy would pay for the tax cuts.\u201cThis tax plan will be deficit reducing,\u201d Mr. Toomey said.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Indianapolis, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.

{"Headline": "Work Toward Bipartisan Fix for Health Markets Begins in Senate", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Senate health committee said Wednesday that he hoped the panel would reach a consensus by the end of next week on a small, bipartisan bill to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent prices from skyrocketing next year under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThe blame will be on every one of us, and deservedly so,\u201d if senators fail to reach agreement, said the chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.Mr. Alexander laid out elements of a possible compromise at a hearing on Wednesday: Republicans would agree to continued payment of subsidies to insurance companies to compensate them for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Democrats would agree to give states freedom to relax some insurance requirements in the Affordable Care Act.\u201cTo get a result,\u201d Mr. Alexander said, \u201cDemocrats will have to agree to something \u2014 more flexibility for states \u2014 that some may be reluctant to support. And Republicans will have to agree to something, additional funding through the Affordable Care Act, that some may be reluctant to support. That is called a compromise.\u201dThe senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, said: \u201cThreading this needle won\u2019t be easy. But I do believe an agreement that protects patients and families from higher costs and uncertainty, and maintains the guardrails in our current health care system, is possible.\u201dThe tone was cordial, a sharp departure from seven years of partisan conflict. However, senators expressed different opinions on how long the subsidy payments should be guaranteed, and whether states should be able to allow the sale of insurance policies that did not provide all the benefits required by the 2010 law.Insurance commissioners from four states \u2014 Alaska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Washington \u2014 and the former insurance commissioner of Pennsylvania told the committee that Congress must immediately provide money for the \u201ccost-sharing\u201d subsidies that enable insurers to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income people.\u201cThis issue is not an insurer bailout,\u201d Julie Mix McPeak, the Tennessee insurance commissioner, testified, rebutting an argument made by President Trump and some Senate Republicans. The cost-sharing payments ensure that \u201csome of our most vulnerable consumers receive assistance for co-pays and deductibles,\u201d and they have the effect of reducing proposed increases in premiums, she said.\u201cWe are rapidly approaching a Sept. 20 deadline for states and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to make final determinations on 2018 rate filings,\u201d said Ms. McPeak, who is the president-elect of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to stop the cost-sharing payments. A federal judge ruled last year that the payments were being made illegally because Congress had not explicitly provided money for them.Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington, told senators on Wednesday, \u201cYou must take bold action now to shore up these markets.\u201d He said Congress should guarantee payment of the subsidies at least through 2019.The cuts planned by the Trump administration \u201cwill be devastating to our population,\u201d Ms. Wing-Heier said.A subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday approved a bill that would provide funds for the navigator program and other outreach and enrollment activities. The bill had bipartisan support, and it was significant because the annual open enrollment period, when people sign up for insurance, starts in eight weeks, on Nov. 1.The bill would not prevent Mr. Trump from making the cuts he wants to make. But it does show a substantial gap between Congress and the president.The former Pennsylvania insurance commissioner, Teresa D. Miller, said insurers in her state were seeking rate increases that average 8.8 percent for 2018. But, she said, the increases would average 36 percent if the Trump administration does not pay cost-sharing subsidies and does not enforce a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires most Americans to have insurance.The Affordable Care Act allows federal officials to grant waivers from some of the law\u2019s requirements, to clear the way for innovative state health insurance programs. The current waiver process is \u201cvery cumbersome,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cThe more we could streamline that process, the better it would be.\u201dBut, she said, it is important to preserve the \u201cguardrails\u201d that protect consumers. The federal law stipulates that state programs must provide coverage that is at least as affordable as that available under the Affordable Care Act, and must cover \u201cat least a comparable number\u201d of people.John D. Doak, the Oklahoma insurance commissioner, said the problems in his state began years before Mr. Trump took office.\u201cWe have seen a reduction in competition down to only one carrier on the marketplace, drastic rate increases, constricting networks, higher deductibles and market instability,\u201d Mr. Doak said. \u201cThese problems were not caused by uncertainty about cost-sharing reduction payments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She stressed that other projects were moving forward, but said, \u201cthis leaves a big hole for the park to fill and deals a blow to so many in the neighborhood and the city who were looking forward to enjoying the pier.\u201dLike Mr. Diller, Ms. Wils blamed a \u201csmall handful of people\u201d for their role in derailing \u201ca project with such broad community support.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo said it was \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that a project with the \u201cpotential to have a positive and lasting impact on the state is not moving forward at this time.\u201dHudson River Park, a series of piers and upland areas running from Chambers to West 59th Streets, was created in 1998 under Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both Republicans, in what was hailed as an innovative city-state partnership. The idea was to transform the largely derelict Hudson River waterfront into a continuous strip of green, with a bicycle path and piers for recreation. The city and the state would finance its construction, but the park would be maintained with revenue from commercial development within its borders.Building a park largely atop piers has proved complex and costly, however, with maintenance of existing structures a constant battle.One of the commercial piers intended to generate revenue for the park is Pier 40, a popular athletic complex with commercial parking for 1,800 cars at the foot of Houston Street. But instead of creating revenue Pier 40 has turned into a drain on the park\u2019s finances, with its 3,500 corroded steel pilings in need of $100 million in repairs.Diller Island promised to bring a dose of celebrity and sex appeal to the park. The idea was to replace the decaying Pier 54, which was closed after it started to collapse, with a high-profile, high-design project. (The shuttered 875-foot pier was where survivors of the Titanic were brought in 1912.)\u201cI always thought that it was a very generous offer,\u201d she said Thursday, referring to Mr. Diller\u2019s gift. But, she said, \u201cI thought that a new pier in a sensitive part of the estuary in days of climate change was very wrong headed. I was also concerned that large private money resulting in the control of design and programming was not a particularly democratic notion.\u201dElsewhere in the park, construction is scheduled to begin next year on Pier 26, between North Moore and Hubert Street in TriBeCa, with lawns, native plantings, a small soccer field and two-story walkway. The trust will also create a wetland tidal pool next to the pier in the river for educational purposes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subway Commute Snared by Debris, Switch Problem and Power Malfunction", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Manhattan, it was debris on the track. In Queens, it was a switch problem. In Brooklyn, it was a power malfunction. Taken together, the various woes snarled at least eight lines on New York City\u2019s dilapidated subway on Thursday, upending the travels of furious riders who were forced to wait on packed platforms for trains that never came or were too full to squeeze inside.The problems on Thursday morning, which appeared to be the most serious in recent weeks, came after Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, introduced a revelatory concept to the subways a few months ago: a promise of clear, factual, over-the-loud-speaker explanations of what exactly was going wrong. The move was in response to a flurry of complaints that the agony of delays was compounded by riders being left in the dark.At about 7:12 a.m., debris was reported along the track on the Seventh Avenue line \u2014 used by the 1, 2 and 3 trains \u2014 in Manhattan, just north of the 50th Street station. The power was turned off when a southbound No. 3 train was forced to activate its emergency brakes after running over the debris, according to Marisa Baldeo, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Authority. Passengers on the disabled 3 train were stuck underground for nearly an hour until power was restored and the train was able to reach the Times Square station.Another train that was directly behind the train that hit the debris rolled backward to the 72nd Street station, where its passengers disembarked.The transit agency was investigating what the debris was. But a spokesman, Kevin Ortiz, said a protective cover for the third rail played a role in triggering the problem. The issue affected service on the Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 lines. In the incident in Queens, a switch problem at Queensboro Plaza upended service on the N, R, Q and W lines. And in Brooklyn, a brief problem with an electrical circuit near the Brooklyn Bridge forced trains to slow down. The afternoon commute did not escape unscathed with signal problems at the 34th Street-Penn Station stop causing delays on the No. 1 line.Mr. Lhota, in an interview, said that some of the agency\u2019s new measures, including stationing response teams closer to where failures may occur, reduced the morning delays. \u201cDo I think what happened today is acceptable? No. Do I think we can do better? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what I think is important is that in two and a half hours we were able to get it up and running. Five years ago or more it would have taken all day.\u201dJohn Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, said in a statement on Thursday: \u201cGovernor Cuomo produced a short-term plan to address delays, but he now needs to step up with a long-term plan to modernize the transit system and a reliable funding source to make it possible. If the governor doesn\u2019t follow through on his promises to modernize the transit system, the \u2018Summer of Hell\u2019 could easily become a \u2018Decade of Despair\u2019 for millions of New Yorkers.\u2019\u2019For some riders, delays have become almost an expected part of their commuting experience. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of passive acceptance at this point,\u201d said Nicholas Sawicki, 23, who waited on the 168th Street platform Thursday morning amid a group of unhappy commuters for 40 minutes. \u201cYou still have to get to work and everybody understands that the subway has just been collapsing in on itself.\u201dIt usually takes Mr. Sawicki, an assistant at a magazine, 22 minutes to commute from Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan to his office in Midtown. On Thursday, it took about an hour and a half, he said, with half of that time spent inside the jammed 168th Street station making his way to the elevators to transfer from the 1 train to the C train. Announcements by transit workers were more clear than usual, he said, and they helped him figure out the next steps on his snarled commute. But they did little to appease frustrated riders.\u201cThe overhaul of the entire system is such a monumental task, and talk is especially cheap in election years,\u201d Mr. Sawicki said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that has been ignored for 60 plus years,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are the inheritants of that ignorance.\u201dAt the 72nd Street station at Broadway in Manhattan, a train conductor advised stranded riders to take a bus or the B or C trains near Central Park. Some commuters preferred to give up on public transit entirely and walked instead.As the morning wore on, social media was rife with the familiar comments, photos, videos and the hashtag \u201cfixthesubway.\u2019\u2019An earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

He wonders where to get them, how long they\u2019ll last, when they\u2019ll next be in season. This is because two years ago, Leong bought a work by the Los Angeles-based artist Max Hooper Schneider called \u2018\u2018Genus Watermeloncholia\u2019\u2019: a bioengineered square watermelon in a glass case filled with water. The watermelon is connected to an LED sign that is positioned so that it appears to be transmitting the watermelon\u2019s depressive thoughts: \u2018\u2018This is all a mistake,\u2019\u2019 for instance. Leong doesn\u2019t quite know why he bought it, only that he was curious how the work might look in his apartment, with its sculpture of a miniature tank by Lutz Bacher mounted to seem as if it\u2019s driving up the wall over the entrance to his bedroom, or Stefan Tcherepnin\u2019s life-size Cookie Monster statue, which dominates the guest room.Since buying the work, however, Leong has lived with the watermelon in his apartment for a total of only six weeks. The original melon degraded quickly, and another replacement, ordered from Pennsylvania, was damaged during shipping. It turns out square watermelons aren\u2019t easy to track down. He\u2019s looked into having one shipped from Japan, where they are cultivated as a kind of curiosity. The artist and his gallery have also talked to growers in California and Australia, among other places. Recently, Leong showed me where the work used to be installed, inspecting the spot forlornly, as if something essential had gone missing. At that point, he\u2019d been waiting eight months for a new watermelon.Not long after my visit, I got an excited email: The artist\u2019s gallery had confirmed that an Amish farmer named Ernest in Lancaster County, Pa., had some square watermelons on the vine. They\u2019d be ripe in a couple of weeks. Leong planned to buy a few backups, hoping they might get him through next spring. He admitted to me that it\u2019s \u2018\u2018comical\u2019\u2019 to be spending so much time thinking about a watermelon \u2014 but that was also why he was attracted to Schneider\u2019s work in the first place: \u2018\u2018I was drawn to the humor of it,\u2019\u2019 he says.CONTEMPORARY ART has long been a status symbol, and collecting it has always been elitist by its very nature. But the idea of art as pure financial currency is a relatively new concept, one introduced by the vast, speculative, cash-infused network that the art world has become in the last few years. What we know and understand as the art world feels increasingly like a wasteland, one of shell corporations and free ports, in which collections are housed in tax shelters masquerading as private museums, expensive paintings are invested in and resold for fast profit and monetary worth is always threatening to overshadow philosophical value.Some collectors, however, have responded to the resulting existential malaise by deliberately collecting art that is difficult to live with, refusing the notion of art-as-investment and embracing work that is not easy on any level, art that until recently would only have found a home in a well-financed institution that had the resources to maintain it. These are works that are difficult not merely in a conceptual sense but in reality as well, works that require as much time and energy as they do money, works that are ephemeral and unwieldy and often extremely messy. This is the sort of art that can die, rot, dry up or just disappear.For these collectors, the effort that such works demand is a matter of pride, and living with them an act of resistance \u2014 even though many of them don\u2019t fully understand what they\u2019ve gotten themselves into until they begin the complicated process of trying to share space with their new acquisition. If collecting art has come to be seen as the ultimate projection of status and convenience, difficult art inverts the relationship between owner and owned \u2014 living with challenging work is a daily exercise in humility, a willing rejection of time, money and the practical comforts of the domestic setting. The director John Waters says, \u2018\u2018Contemporary art\u2019s job is to wreck, to ruin what came before,\u2019\u2019 and this is art that is capable, quite literally, of destroying one\u2019s life.Waters, who has made dark comedy out of cannibalism, coprophagia and castration and has been collecting since the 1960s, is drawn to art that would \u2018\u2018hate me if I let it.\u2019\u2019 For nearly 20 years, he has devoted a portion of his Baltimore home to a room-size installation by Gregory Green. Known for his \u2018\u2018Bomb Rooms\u2019\u2019 \u2014 intricate, hyper-detailed constructions that resemble a terrorist\u2019s hide-out abandoned in a hurry \u2014 Green was a cult figure in the \u201990s, but after 9/11 his career stalled. The work Waters owns, which occupies a small, windowless chamber that he calls his \u2018\u2018John Wayne Gacy Attic,\u2019\u2019 is titled \u2018\u2018Work Table # 7, Baltimore\u2019\u2019 (1998). It seems to include everything required to make gunpowder \u2014 mostly materials that can be purchased at a hardware store. (The key ingredients have been replaced with yellow cake mix and salt.) Waters drove Green around Baltimore to purchase supplies (bundles of wire, a kitchen timer, a metal can of denatured solvent alcohol), and to the thrift shop, where Green bought a map of Baltimore\u2019s baseball stadium, which stands in for the hypothetical target. There is also a sprinkling of pubic hair, harvested from Green\u2019s then-wife.The room is roped off and Waters doesn\u2019t enter it \u2014 the installation remains untouched, even by his house cleaners. But sometimes there are issues. The director hosts an annual Christmas party, attended for years by Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley and Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Baltimore\u2019s former mayor. Prior to the festivities, their security details do routine checks of the house, and inevitably an agent new to the task stumbles upon the room upstairs. \u2018\u2018You should see their faces,\u2019\u2019 Waters says. \u2018\u2018I always have a Gregory Green catalog right next to it, just in case: \u2018Hey, this is art! This is art!\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019THE IDEA OF LIVING with art that is inconvenient arguably came to prominence with the rise of conceptualism in the 1960s and the first wave of people who attempted to buy such work, which has always posed theoretical challenges: How to install a concept? And, more important, what exactly are you buying? In the 1970s, the legendary collectors Herb and Dorothy Vogel, civil servants who amassed and stored more than 4,000 important contemporary works in their one-bedroom apartment in New York, bought Robert Barry\u2019s seemingly impossible-to-own \u2018\u2018Closed Gallery\u2019\u2019 piece, in which the artist had three dealers shutter their galleries for the duration of his show, each sending out notices that contained statements like, \u2018\u2018During the exhibition, the gallery will be closed.\u2019\u2019 The Vogels paid $250 for the piece, and received the three invitations in a single frame.But as conceptual art has matured, it\u2019s also encompassed a wider variety of forms and possibilities, becoming more elaborate, more popular and more costly. Conceptual art may never have a life on the secondary market, but that\u2019s part of the point; the very challenge of containment, of realization, is part of its value. How, after all, do you live with art that is either ephemeral or exists merely as an idea? How do you realize, in physical form, a notion? Purchasing an idea contradicts an industry that is predominantly concerned with owning and displaying objects.Of course, the inverse of owning an idea is owning something that may in fact be tangible, but also too unruly, too impractical, to live with comfortably. In 2004, a \u00adDallas-based collector and philanthropist named Deedie Rose bought an enormous sculpture, \u2018\u2018Warped Floor,\u2019\u2019 made of fired clay plates and sand, by the Minimalist sculptor Meg Webster. Awkwardly shaped, the color of an unripe peach and about the size of a Manhattan studio apartment, the piece seems to evoke an eroded river basin; when Rose saw it at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York, it had been installed on an armature, hovering in the air, so she hadn\u2019t fully comprehended how big it was: nearly 500 square feet and six feet deep. She intended to put it outside, in the ground, and even flew a bewildered Webster out to Texas to oversee its installation by a construction crew. The artist returned home after a week of trying to make the work fit alongside Rose\u2019s pump house. Eventually, a team of tile setters spent 10 days in the blazing Texas sun fitting the giant piece into the ground. \u2018\u2018It was the darnedest thing you\u2019d ever seen,\u2019\u2019 Rose says, cheerily.Why give your house over to something like this? For San \u00adFrancisco-based Norah and Norman Stone \u2014 who own many pieces that are not, as they say, \u2018\u2018domestic-size\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the work is simply more important than logistics. They\u2019ll buy a piece they like and figure out the details later. (Their endgame, according to Norah, is to donate most of their collection to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In the meantime, they\u2019ve drilled a cave into a hillside in the Napa Valley, where they display some of their especially unwieldy works.)This uninhibited approach occasionally results in strange dilemmas, as was the case with one of the Stones\u2019 purchases, a 1993 installation by Jason Rhoades, \u2018\u2018Jason Rhoades and Jackie Rhoades-13 Booth Cologne County Fair.\u2019\u2019 Filling a former staff bedroom, it is a kind of autobiography of the artist\u2019s life up to that point: a room jammed with artwork and objects from his childhood, like his 4-H club tie and cap, and the accouterments of his mother\u2019s occupation as a decorator of state-fair booths. (\u2018\u2018I guess he did some outdoor things, because there\u2019s an air gun as part of this installation,\u2019\u2019 Norah Stone says, a little perplexed.) Rhoades also placed a charcoal grill inside the piece, on which he cooked links of sausages during the installation, leaving one on the grill in homage to some of his major influences, like Dieter Roth and Joseph Beuys, who also incorporated perishable food into their art. But after a year or so, the Stones were showing the work to a visiting museum conservator when they noticed that the sausage had grown spores of black mold that could spread through the whole house if not contained. Rhoades had to return to reinstall the piece in a different room, covering the perishable portions in a glass case, letting the sausage rot in there. The meat came to resemble a dirty gym sock, draped across the grill. The couple considers the organic, if rancid, aspect of the piece a profound part of its meaning. The work has, Norman says, \u2018\u2018the presence of Jason,\u2019\u2019 who lived hard and died suddenly in 2006. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very much alive, in a sense,\u2019\u2019 Norah says.HOW AND WHY people collect is often a symptom of a given cultural moment. Abstract Expressionism changed the terms of painting, and in doing so, created its own kind of intellectual capital, in which Pollock\u2019s splotches of color became a new language that was necessary to understand in order to be considered visually literate. Collecting now has the reputation of an opportunistic pastime, a way of accumulating trophies, and living with difficult art both is and isn\u2019t a remedy for this \u2014 to maintain a conceptually rigorous or hard-to-install art work is on one level a thankless labor of love, and on another a kind of particularly elite humblebrag: Is there a more outlandish statement of privilege than lamenting how the water in your Jeff Koons installation is growing mold?Still, the truly arcane might be the final frontier of serious connoisseurship, and one artist who has emerged as a paragon for collectors who appreciate a struggle is Darren Bader, a conceptual artist who even a decade ago would have been considered rabidly noncommercial. Recently, however, he\u2019s become a favorite among adventurous collectors because his work, as he put it to me, questions the very \u2018\u2018notion of ownership, and also impermanence.\u2019\u2019 One work, \u2018\u2018person sitting in passenger seat of car,\u2019\u2019 is a person sitting in the passenger seat of a car \u2014 any car, any person, anywhere. Another work, \u2018\u201816,937 USD,\u2019\u2019 is $16,937, \u2018\u2018kept/taken/destroyed/used/found/forgotten anywhere,\u2019\u2019 according to the artist. Many of Bader\u2019s pieces exist in intangible forms, often only as a certificate with accompanying text and instructions. His art is a specter slyly haunting a room rather than occupying it; with Bader, one thinks more of the mind creating the work than of any particular object.One of his best-known pieces is called \u2018\u2018chicken burrito, beef burrito.\u2019\u2019 It is, in fact, a chicken burrito and a beef burrito, \u2018\u2018placed on the same axis,\u2019\u2019 according to its certificate, either stacked or next to one another. It was first installed at the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s Queens outpost, MoMA PS1, in 2012, as part of the artist\u2019s solo show there. The burritos, sitting on a windowsill in an otherwise empty gallery, took on a surreal beauty \u2014 recognizable as what they were, but stripped of any usual meaning: two beige lumps slowly collapsing in the fading sunlight. They were replaced with new burritos once or twice a week throughout the show\u2019s nearly 16-week run. I asked Bader what inspired the piece. He responded in a way that made me think he regarded the answer as obvious, or at least unimportant: When the museum asked him for a piece to show, he visited PS1, and while standing in an empty gallery with the show\u2019s curator, asked, \u2018\u2018How about some burritos?\u2019\u2019Bader\u2019s works are, crucially, funnier than his conceptual forebears and can veer awfully close to surrealism. A lot of difficult art is at its core mischievous, and the relationship between the artist, work and collector becomes necessarily playful: If an artist makes a work that seems ostensibly impossible to keep in a house, chances are there is a collector out there who will gladly accept the challenge. Andrew Ong, who has designed a number of commercial galleries, owns Bader\u2019s \u2018\u2018French horn with/and guacamole (or other \u2018sauce\u2019),\u2019\u2019 which is a French horn filled with guacamole. (Bader\u2019s instructions are fairly \u00adopen-ended and mention the possibility of using a different \u2018\u2018sauce\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018If the owner of the horn is feeling adventurous, s/he can try to fill the entirety of the horn with any number of potable liquids.\u2019\u2019) The piece was briefly part of Bader\u2019s PS1 show, and was then displayed at Frieze New York by Andrew Kreps, Bader\u2019s dealer. The gallery brought bags of tortilla chips to their fair booth so that visitors could sample the dip.The piece now sits, usually empty, on a pedestal in Ong\u2019s Manhattan apartment, though he and his husband will \u2018\u2018activate it\u2019\u2019 \u2014 meaning they\u2019ll spoon guacamole into the sound hole \u2014 about four times a year. Ong, a native \u00adCalifornian, says he has \u2018\u2018a love for guacamole, so I do make it myself when we activate it.\u2019\u2019 When it\u2019s \u2018\u2018not activated,\u2019\u2019 guests will invariably ask who plays the French horn. Neither man does.PERHAPS THE HASSLE of living with difficult art is, above all, an attempt to find absolution from the sins of the art market, and of materialism generally, by embracing the esoteric. It\u2019s easy to forget in 2017 that one of the long-prevailing theories about art since at least the 19th century has been that it doesn\u2019t necessarily serve a practical purpose; that its point, to quote the English critic Walter Pater, is \u2018\u2018frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass\u2019\u2019 \u2014 money, then, becomes a superfluous part of the conversation.Eleanor Cayre, an art adviser and collector, buys and sells quite a lot of art, but insists that money trivializes it. I met her last May at her townhouse on the Upper East Side, where prominently displayed in her foyer is a \u2018\u2018live ecosystem\u2019\u2019 by the artist Pierre Huyghe, which she bought in 2014. The work resembles what it essentially is: a regular fish tank. Yet it took close to 10 people \u2014 employees from Huyghe\u2019s gallery and his studio, aquarium engineers, an electrician \u2014 a month to install. \u2018\u2018Everyone had an opinion on everything,\u2019\u2019 Cayre said. There were debates over how to set it up. The studio wanted the water to \u2018\u2018get used to the tank\u2019\u2019 before they, as they said, \u2018\u2018introduced the living.\u2019\u2019 She spends about $1,000 a month maintaining the work because, she said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s such a joy to live with.\u2019\u2019 The tank was designed to contain three horseshoe crabs, an arrow crab and a large rock that seems to float, barely jutting above the water\u2019s surface. The artist and his studio specify that the crabs ideally be fed shrimp, but every other day Cayre feeds them chopped fish because, \u2018\u2018We keep kosher here.\u2019\u2019 The fates of the creatures in the tank are, of course, inevitable. On my visit, the arrow crab, a spidery, unloved reef dweller, was, in fact, dead at the bottom of the tank; it was the fourth time one of the crustaceans had died in about three years.As I talked to the owner of what was likely the world\u2019s most expensive dead crab, I came to understand Cayre\u2019s frustration over people being more concerned with prices than with art itself. On one level, it\u2019s easy to dismiss Huyghe \u2014 if you\u2019re going to buy a fish tank, why not just buy a fish tank? And yet I can\u2019t recall a time when I\u2019ve ever looked at a fish tank and felt compelled to ponder some dark and unavoidable truths about life and death \u2014 but I couldn\u2019t help but do this with the Huyghe. The artist\u2019s work seems to have as much in common with a regular fish tank as Duchamp\u2019s urinal has with an actual toilet.Cayre and I moved to a sitting room on the second floor, where a Sturtevant copy of a Jasper Johns flag hangs over the sofa and, as if divulging a secret, she mentioned a work she has that is, and will forever be, impervious to the art world\u2019s obsession with monetary value: a Tino Sehgal.The Berlin-based performance artist known for his \u2018\u2018constructed situations\u2019\u2019 is perhaps the most difficult of all living artists to possess. Sehgal trains participants to enact his instructions, which range from baroque (two people kissing in three-hour shifts) to sarcastic (performers dancing around visitors to a museum and chanting \u2018\u2018Oh, this is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary\u2019\u2019). He once described his work to The New Yorker as a means of addressing the question, \u2018\u2018Can something that is not an inanimate object be considered valuable?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It\u2019s nothing,\u2019\u2019 Cayre said of owning a Sehgal. \u2018\u2018You basically buy air.\u2019\u2019 To acquire the work \u2014 \u2018\u2018technically\u2019\u2019 \u2014 she had to meet with Sehgal in person so that he could \u2018\u2018transfer\u2019\u2019 it. Sehgal refuses to travel by plane for work-related matters, so in 2016, she flew to Paris, where the artist had a show at the Palais de Tokyo. The work exists only theoretically (and in an email from Sehgal\u2019s dealer). Called \u2018\u2018Those Thoughts\u2019\u2019 (2005), it involves Cayre and her husband, a real estate developer, throwing a dinner party, and at a certain point getting up from their chairs to switch seats. The one problem is: She hasn\u2019t been able to get her husband to take part in the performance.\u2018\u2018All he needs to do is get up and sit in another chair and he refuses to do it,\u2019\u2019 she said. A little wistfully, she added, \u2018\u2018One day, perhaps.\u2019\u2019 I could see why a person would be suspicious of this, but in an age in which art is as commodified as oil, the idea of owning a work that is a secret, that in many ways doesn\u2019t exist, feels both precious and, literally, invaluable. We might not have been able to see the Sehgal, but we both knew it was there, and after she told me about it, the whole house felt different, like some unanswered question was lingering in the air, waiting to be answered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Princess, the Private Investigator and Another Inquiry for FIFA", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A Jordanian princess who is married to the billionaire ruler of Dubai has for more than a year been discreetly working with British private investigators in an attempt to collect evidence of corruption in global soccer, according to several people with direct knowledge of the effort.It is unclear what new information, if any, the investigators have uncovered, but the involvement of Princess Haya, whose brother Prince Ali bin al-Hussein was twice a losing candidate for the presidency of FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body, suggests that while FIFA has claimed to have entered an era of reform since a corruption scandal toppled its leadership in 2015, its days of palace intrigue are far from over.The investigation also raises the possibility that there may be more accusations of wrongdoing for a sport brought low by the series of indictments and arrests against top officials led by United States prosecutors in 2015. The United States case led to the fall of almost of all of FIFA\u2019s top leadership, including its former president Sepp Blatter, who had defeated Prince Ali in an election in May 2015, only days after the Swiss police arrested several members of FIFA\u2019s executive board at the request of the United States Department of Justice.She and Prince Ali declined to confirm the current information-gathering effort, but each confirmed to The New York Times that they had worked with Quest.\u201cWhen my brother Ali asked me to manage his FIFA election campaign, we agreed that integrity had to be the dominating factor of the campaign,\u201d Princess Haya said, adding: \u201cQuest ensured that we acted with the utmost integrity at all times, as well as protecting our campaign from numerous unethical approaches by reporting these to the electoral committee in the correct and professional manner. As I am still required to give an informed opinion at the highest level, I choose to continue to work with Quest.\u201dPrince Ali confirmed in a statement that he had reported a number of \u201cunethical approaches\u201d during his election to FIFA without detailing what they were. \u201cMy duty to ensure that football is governed with only the highest level of integrity is continuously affected by the continuing breaking news of ethics and integrity issues at FIFA,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows how important it is for Quest, on my behalf, to keep up to date with developments in the world of football.\u201dQuest, whose chairman, John Stevens, is a former head of London\u2019s Scotland Yard, declined to comment about its work on behalf of Princess Haya or Prince Ali. The agency has conducted investigations into sports before, including one on behalf of England\u2019s Premier League into possible irregularities in the player transfer market. Stevens is also an adviser to the International Centre for Sport Security, a Qatar-financed organization launched months after the controversial vote to award that country the hosting rights to the 2022 World Cup.The first trial related to officials indicted in the Justice Department\u2019s soccer corruption case are scheduled to begin in November in New York. Charges have been filed against about 40 different individuals and entities, including the former heads of soccer\u2019s two regional governing bodies in the Americas.Quest\u2019s staff have been present around various FIFA meetings, and were especially active during Prince Ali\u2019s campaigns, where some of the lobbying took place at plush gatherings and exclusive hotels around the world. Recently, they have acted as intermediaries between the United States authorities and soccer officials who may have evidence of wrongdoing yet to feature in ongoing charges, according to two people familiar with the matter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Siemens and Alstom Form European Train Giant to Beat Chinese Competition", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Once, the merger of two iconic European companies might well have been derailed by regional political rivalries. But in the case of a deal between Siemens and Alstom, those concerns have receded in the face of a larger threat: China.The proposed merger of Europe\u2019s two largest train makers, one German and one French, demonstrated on Wednesday that economic imperatives are pushing the Continent together even as populist politicians try to pull it apart.The new company, to be called Siemens Alstom, is a response to intensifying competition from China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, the state-backed train maker that has been winning contracts in the United States and emerging markets where mass transit is a fast-growing business.The company\u2019s success is emblematic of China\u2019s increasing economic power, which, combined with a more isolationist American foreign policy, is forcing European leaders to violate old taboos in order to improve the functioning of the European Union and its economy.\u201cThe message of this merger is that the European spirit is alive,\u201d Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, said at a news conference in Paris on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful message in times that are marked by populism and nationalism and social and political divides.\u201dCompetition from China has already been a factor in other big European mergers. Last week, the German steel giant ThyssenKrupp said it would merge its European steel operations into a joint venture with Tata Steel. And last year, Nokia of Finland acquired Alcatel-Lucent, a French maker of telecommunications equipment, in part to address intense competition from China\u2019s Huawei.Other sectors, like shipbuilding or semiconductors, could also be ripe for mergers.The French president and other European leaders have grown increasingly alarmed that the E.U. is ceding control of advanced technology to China. In a recent speech in Athens, Mr. Macron called for strengthening the bloc into a \u201cpower that can face the U.S. and China.\u201dJust weeks ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tightened rules to limit takeovers of German strategic assets, a move aimed at Beijing.Chinese competition was a driving factor in Mr. Macron\u2019s backing to seal a deal between Alstom and Siemens, despite outcries from political opponents in France that he was handing over a French icon to the Germans.\u201cThe big story here is the French willingness to let this happen,\u201d said Mikko Huotari, director of the international relations program at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. \u201cAlstom is one of the crown jewels of French industry.\u201dThe Siemens-Alstom deal is in part a bid that being bigger may be a better way to counter China Railway Rolling Stock, known as CRRC, which has grown into the world\u2019s largest and most competitive maker of railway equipment. The European company could yet grow further: Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement, there had been speculation that Siemens could link up with Bombardier of Canada. On Wednesday, Mr. Kaeser of Siemens did not rule out that Bombardier could later become part of the combined company.Still, with sales of over $33 billion last year and 180,000 employees worldwide, CRRC is bigger than the train businesses of Siemens, Alstom and Bombardier combined.\u201cOf course CRRC is extremely strong, and has changed a little bit the picture of the market,\u201d Henri Poupart-Lafarge, the chief executive of Alstom, told reporters Wednesday.Mr. Poupart-Lafarge will be chief executive of the new company, which will have its headquarters in Paris. The Mobility Solutions unit of Siemens Alstom, which provides systems to control rail traffic and is more profitable than the unit that makes trains and streetcars, will be based in Berlin.The new company will have annual revenue of \u20ac15.3 billion, an order backlog valued at \u20ac61.2 billion and more than 62,000 employees worldwide.Alstom in particular is a symbol of national technological might for the French, with high-speed TGV trains racing across the countryside, and Eurostar trains connecting Paris to London in just over two hours through the Eurotunnel.While populist parties such as the National Front are hostile to closer political ties in the European Union, they are less likely to oppose corporate mergers that protect European companies from foreign competition.Pro-European political leaders like Mr. Macron have themselves not been averse to government intervention to protect jobs at home.As France\u2019s economy minister, he pushed through a government plan last year to order \u20ac630 million worth of new TGV trains \u2014 most of which were not calibrated to run on faster tracks \u2014 from an Alstom factory in the eastern town of Belfort to prevent hundreds of jobs there from moving to another plant.The Alstom deal with Siemens also reflects, however, a willingness to be flexible to protect broader French interests.On Tuesday, the country\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the French government welcomed the deal with Siemens, characterizing it as one that protected French jobs at Alstom.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Liz Alderman from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protests Erupt in Guatemala Over Laws to Dilute Antigraft Campaign", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday night, the country\u2019s highest court, the Constitutional Court, provisionally suspended the legislation. But the congressional maneuver had already generated broad opposition \u2014 from conservative business groups to students.The upheaval is only the latest chapter in the escalating tension between the government and a United Nations anticorruption panel that many Guatemalans view as their best hope to root out the pervasive graft that chokes public institutions.Even before the court ruling, there were signs Thursday that the furious reaction had pushed some legislators to regret passing the measures swiftly and without debate on Wednesday. Those measures would have gutted campaign finance rules and allowed many criminals serving sentences of less than 10 years to walk free in exchange for a small fine.\u201cNow people see the president and Congress are like a gang of people just trying to protect themselves from crimes they\u2019ve already committed with impunity,\u201d said Fernando Carrera, a former foreign minister and analyst.Even though the court acted quickly, he warned that \u201cinstability will continue to grow, and economic and institutional deterioration will worsen.\u201dTwo weeks ago, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, the Colombian prosecutor who leads the panel, known by its Spanish initials as Cicig, and Attorney General Thelma Aldana announced an investigation into the president\u2019s party over campaign finance irregularities. As secretary general of the party during the 2015 campaign, Mr. Morales was responsible, they said.\u201cPresident Morales lost a lot of support when he wanted Cicig out of the country,\u201d Mr. Carrera said.And Cicig\u2019s focus on campaign finance \u2014 which the panel has called \u201cthe original sin\u201d of Guatemala\u2019s political system \u2014 means that prosecutors are casting a wide net over Guatemala\u2019s political establishment and the businesses that finance it.The government\u2019s hostility toward Cicig pits Mr. Morales directly against the United Nations and the United States, a strong supporter of the panel.If Guatemala\u2019s political establishment tries still more measures to weaken Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Ms. Aldana, it also faces a wild card in the reaction on the streets.Mr. Morales, a former television comedian, won the election that followed almost by default because he was seen as an outsider, despite running for a party founded by right-wing former military officers.Manfredo Marroqu\u00edn, president of the board of Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, Transparency International\u2019s Guatemala branch, warned that the protests could resurge.\u201cThe people feel betrayed again,\u201d Mr. Manfredo said.

Hard to Say.", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDogged by investigations into his political fund-raising, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised last year to prove his integrity to New Yorkers by providing concrete examples of campaign contributors who did not get favors from his administration.After 16 months, the mayor finally released an essay aimed at fulfilling that promise \u2014 even though it only mentioned two fresh examples, without names or specifics.Mr. de Blasio made the vow in May 2016, when he was troubled by cascading revelations of multiple federal and state investigations that centered on his fund-raising practices, and his relation to donors who did business with the city.\u201cIn fact, as we will be showing you more and more in the coming weeks, a stunning number of donors and supporters not only did not get things they hoped they would get, they got rejection of things they hoped they would get because we ran a government that was clean and appropriate,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said then. \u201cWe\u2019re making decisions on the merits. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019ve known someone for 20 years, if their goal is not the right goal, we\u2019ll say no, and we\u2019re going to show you a whole lot of evidence of that.\u201dThe results were far from stunning.\u201cThere was a leading real estate developer and campaign contributor who wanted the contract for our new citywide ferry service,\u201d the mayor wrote. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get the contract. That decision wasn\u2019t about his political donations to me. It was about which company could best move New Yorkers around a city of waterways.\u201dThe other example the mayor gave was an unnamed real estate developer and campaign donor who \u201cwanted to know what would happen on a land-use action before the public had a chance to weigh in.\u201dIn response, the mayor said that he made it clear to that donor that \u201cit was impossible to say. It didn\u2019t matter how much money he gave my campaign. I would have given the same answer to anyone.\u201dUsing Mr. Durst as an example, even if not by name, seemed an ill-fitting choice, since the mayor has made no assertions that Mr. Durst had discussed the ferry contract with him or sought to influence the decision, which was part of a public bidding process.Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the Durst Organization, responded to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s essay with a reference to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the popular series about a fantasy world of dragons and political scheming. \u201cWinter is coming,\u201d Mr. Barowitz said.Mr. Peebles declined an interview request.Mr. Reichberg did receive a reduction in water bill charges at a Brooklyn property, but the mayor wrote in his essay that the decision was made properly after an investigation that showed a water meter was broken. What the essay does not mention is that Mr. Reichberg was able to send his complaint directly to the chief of staff of the first deputy mayor Anthony E. Shorris \u2014 a level of access that few New Yorkers have. This seems to contradict the mayor\u2019s claim in the essay that he seeks to \u201ctreat everyone the same.\u201dMr. de Blasio also used the essay to complain about how the media has covered the way his administration has dealt with donors doing business with the city. \u201cA frequently undeserved cynicism nearly always crowds out the facts,\u201d the mayor wrote, accusing the media of a \u201cboundless energy spent distorting the donor-City Hall relationship\u201d and lamenting the lack of \u201csome basic modicum of media fairness.\u201dAfter Mr. de Blasio posted his essay, Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, who started the federal investigations into Mr. de Blasio, went on Twitter to suggest a poll: \u201cWho\u2019s more prone to blame the press for his own failings & failures \u2014 Donald Trump or Bill de Blasio?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Federal Flood Insurance Puts Homes at Risk", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt was clear long before Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas that the National Flood Insurance Program, the government\u2019s most important means of recovering from such disasters, needed to be overhauled. It fails to account for the full extent of flood risk, encourages development in areas known to be flood-prone and is not realistically funded.Congress created the program in 1968 after most private insurers stopped selling flood policies or began charging very high premiums because the business had become too risky.The biggest change would be to have premiums reflect the actual overall risk. Previous attempts to quickly increase their cost over just a few years faltered after policyholders and their elected representatives pushed back. If Congress is unwilling to raise premiums, it ought to properly finance the subsidies.The program could also offer policyholders more money to raise their homes above flood elevations. It now offers up to $30,000 for such improvements, but experts say costs can be two or three times more than that.The insurance program could also provide home buyers better information about properties\u2019 flooding history. Now, the first time many people learn that their new homes are flood-prone is the first time they see their living room underwater. FEMA should also be required to provide aggregate information about flooding risks to local governments and the public, so they can better prepare for storms.Congress clearly cannot eliminate the threat that natural disasters pose to the country. But it can do a much better job reducing the risk that storms like Harvey pose to life and property.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Operation Car Wash Is Exposing Political Crime in Brazil", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewBrazil, a nation rich in natural resources, fertile lands and cultural diversity, has struggled for decades with underdevelopment. Some blame it on the \u201ccusto Brasil,\u201d or \u201cBrazil cost\u201d \u2014 the accumulated price, in cash, time and other resources, of doing business here \u2014 pointing to the weight of bureaucracy, high taxes and poor investment. Others cite insufficient investments in infrastructure, science, technology and education.The root cause of our struggle, however, is a decay of democracy in the face of systemic, institutional corruption. Our representative system has been so far removed from its raison d\u2019\u00eatre that the will to govern has been replaced by the goal of remaining in power.Our governmental structure is coalition-based, which makes it vulnerable to corruption. With dozens of parties vying to form a majority in Congress, elections are bloated and prohibitively expensive. Gaining power allows a political party the chance to appoint executives at state-run companies. Executives receive kickbacks from contractors, and some of that cash is funneled back to the party.It is a self-perpetuating cycle: Fraudulent elections generate public administrations that promote corruption, and are operated by politicians who create electoral reforms to grant themselves more and more power, resources and control. As a result, Brazil\u2019s main political parties, which have taken uninterrupted turns in authority for decades, are focused not on governing the country, but on building alliances to stay in power.Ministers, advisers, senators, representatives and even members of the judicial branch collaborate with private interests to make decisions about public investments and push for the approval of bills that disproportionately benefit those in power.Some of Brazil\u2019s largest economic groups are, in fact, artificial empires built on tax exemptions and loans from the Brazilian Development Bank, and their failures have shaken the foundations of the country\u2019s economy.Development resources intended to improve quality of life and reduce social inequality have been drained to enrich certain groups and companies that have been hailed as \u201cnational champions,\u201d and to finance the political party system. Through misguided economic policy and the misappropriation of public resources, they have cost more than 14 million people their jobs.Operation Car Wash also serves as a warning for the business sector and its deep-rooted practice of influencing government decisions. Businesses engaged in corruption can now be dealt with by the justice system, which will free us up to create an environment in which competition can promote efficiency and adequate public works and services.This tsunami sweeping Brazil will allow space for a new political paradigm founded on the principle that justice means justice for all. We\u2019re not there yet, but operation Car Wash is working, as evidenced by the reaction of the political establishment along the entire ideological spectrum.A significant number of political, party and business leaders are using all their assets to keep things as they are. There are alliances between former opponents aimed at stopping the investigation, and there are attempts to impose rules for the 2018 general election that would guarantee continuity for those currently in power. Operation Car Wash\u2019s main task force was even shut down in July, leaving the investigation to be absorbed by a larger anti-corruption division with a more limited scope.Our hope of seeing Brazil rejuvenated remains in the hands of the press, the judicial branch and the people. With a lot of pain, we are learning how to create effective laws and institutions. The first big test will be the 2018 elections, when voters will be able to conduct the biggest \u201cwash\u201d ever seen in Brazilian politics \u2014 when they will have a chance to clean out corruption and open the door to a reconstruction of the country\u2019s institutions.Advertisement"}

Trump talked tough on China, accusing the world\u2019s second-largest economy of stealing jobs from Americans. On Wednesday, Wilbur Ross, his commerce secretary, echoed that sentiment, calling for a dramatic shift in the countries\u2019 trade relationship.Mr. Ross was speaking after a visit to Beijing, where he met with Premier Li Keqiang and other finance and economic officials, as part of an effort to lay the diplomatic foundations for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to China this year.\u201cWe do need major change, and I hope and I believe that we\u2019ve made that clear to the Chinese government, because the relationship is too lopsided at present,\u201d Mr. Ross said in a media briefing.During his meetings with officials in Beijing, Mr. Ross said he raised concerns about the imbalance of trade and investment relations, the need to protect intellectual property and lower tariffs.\u201cThe most important thing is better market access both for companies operating there physically and for companies exporting there,\u201d Mr. Ross said on Wednesday. He added that the Trump administration wanted to see less protectionist behavior, calling China \u201cone of the most protectionist\u201d countries in the world.\u201cWe can understand that they would desire self-sufficiency and if the way they get there is through a free and open level playing field, and it\u2019s a fair match, we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d Mr. Ross said on Wednesday. But, he added, the Trump administration would object to American companies\u2019 being forced to transfer technological know-how in exchange for market access.In closed-door conversations with United States officials, the Chinese have expressed concerns over a broad inquiry by the Trump administration into China trade practices that has focused on potential violations of intellectual policy. Officials have also complained about the United States\u2019 export controls.This year, the United States signed a deal with China to give American companies greater access to the Chinese market in several areas, including agriculture, banking and finance. Mr. Ross referred to the deal as \u201crelatively low-hanging fruit.\u201d\u201cNow we\u2019re moving into harder things, bigger things, more serious things, and hopefully the good will that\u2019s been built up between President Xi and President Trump will help to change the atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Ross, referring to Xi Jinping, told an audience at a Forbes conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.But tensions remain between the two leaders.

{"Headline": "Why the Latest Health Bill Is Teetering: It Might Not Work", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Health insurers, who had been strangely quiet for much of the year, came off the sidelines to criticize it. Many state Medicaid directors could not stomach it, either.For months now, proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have risen and fallen in the House and the Senate, almost always uniting health care providers and patient advocacy groups in opposition but winning support among conservatives, including Republican policy makers. But the version drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 and hastily brought into the spotlight last week \u2014 went further.It brought much of the health care world together to stop it, an effort that appears to have succeeded \u2014 not for ideological reasons, but for the simple reason that administrators, caregivers, advocates and insurers believed it could not work.Senate Republican leaders hoped to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote this coming week. But the bill is on life support after Senator John McCain, the unpredictable Arizona Republican whose dramatic \u201cno\u201d vote killed the previous repeal effort, announced on Friday that he could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d vote for the bill. He joined Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, in opposition \u2014 and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, is leaning hard toward no.The three would be enough to doom the bill.\u201cI think Republicans remain pretty trapped between an abstract promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the reality of what that would mean,\u201d said Matthew Fiedler, an economist at the Brookings Institution who advised President Barack Obama on health policy. \u201cThat basic tension is going to remain.\u201dShould the Graham-Cassidy measure die, it would almost surely end the long Republican quest to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. If the Senate does not vote by Sept. 30, the drive to kill the Affordable Care Act will lose special protections under Senate rules that allow it to pass with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster.The Senate Finance Committee has scheduled a hearing on the measure for Monday, and proponents of the repeal bill say they are not giving up.\u201cThe deadline is still a week away,\u201d said Tommy Binion, who handles government relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy organization. \u201cIt is one of the last trains leaving the station, and it is a political imperative for the Republican Party. I think we are going to go through a couple more loop de loops on this roller coaster before we are all done.\u201dIn a series of tweets early Saturday, President Trump, who has embraced the legislation in recent days, appeared to be nurturing hopes that the legislative effort could be kept alive. He voiced optimism that Mr. Paul would rethink his opposition \u201cfor the good of the party.\u201d He also indicated that he thought Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who had wavered publicly about the measure, would support it, though her spokeswoman has said only that the senator was studying the bill.But at the same time, the president vented his frustration with Mr. McCain, saying he had let his state down and been deceived by Democrats into abandoning a promise.Patient advocacy groups, who also oppose the Graham-Cassidy measure, say they will continue their fight. \u201cWe are certainly not relaxing our efforts, because the vote count is not clear,\u201d said Sue Nelson, a vice president of the American Heart Association, which is fighting to preserve the 2010 health law. \u201cWe are going full steam ahead with advertising, lobbying and grass-roots efforts to contact members of Congress.\u201dAnd in an unusual joint statement on Saturday, groups representing doctors, hospitals and health plans urged the Senate to reject the bill.\u201cWhile we sometimes disagree on important issues in health care, we are in total agreement that Americans deserve a stable health care market that provides access to high-quality care and affordable coverage for all,\u201d the groups, which included the American Medical Association and America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said. The bill, they added, \u201cdoes not move us closer to that goal.\u201dStill, the pressure on Republicans to fulfill their promise has been intense \u2014 not only from the voters who helped elect them, but also from conservative donors. Doug Deason, a wealthy Dallas businessman who manages money for his billionaire father, said he had formed a loose-knit coalition of donors who warned senior Republicans \u2014 including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader \u2014 that contributions would dry up if Congress did not overhaul the tax code and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe said we\u2019re not interested in meeting with him until he gets something done,\u201d Mr. Deason said, recounting a telephone conversation he had with Mr. McConnell over the summer. \u201cHe needs to lead.\u201dThe drive for repeal of the Affordable Care Act appeared to be dead at the end of July, after Mr. McCain\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote on a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d measure that was designed purely as a vehicle to permit negotiations with the House, which had passed a much more ambitious bill. That measure also had critics who called it unworkable and potentially disastrous for the insurance market, but Republican leaders could argue that they never intended to actually enact it. They were prepared to discard their handiwork as soon as House-Senate negotiations could start.The talks never did.\u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d a dejected Mr. McConnell declared at the time.But behind the scenes, Mr. Graham, whose main expertise is in military affairs, and Mr. Cassidy, a gastroenterologist, had already been working with Rick Santorum, a Republican former senator from Pennsylvania, on a measure that morphed into the Graham-Cassidy bill.Their collaboration, Mr. Santorum said, grew out of a chance meeting between him and Mr. Graham in the Senate barbershop last spring. Mr. Santorum had already been working with members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus on a bill to take much of the money spent under the Affordable Care Act and send it to states, with vast discretion over how to use it for health care.\u201cI thought maybe I should bounce this idea off Lindsey and see what he thinks,\u201d Mr. Santorum said, adding that he thought the measure could attract the votes of Senate Republican moderates.Mr. Santorum argues that giving governors control over how to spend health care dollars will create efficiencies in the system, and disputes as a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d the idea that states will get less money under the bill.The bill would require states to organize their own health care systems by 2020 \u2014 a time frame that many health care experts say is unworkable \u2014 and would also give states a way to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions.If enacted, the measure would constitute \u201cthe largest transfer of financial risk from the federal government to the states in our country\u2019s history,\u201d said the National Association of Medicaid Directors, whose members run the program for more than 70 million Americans.Beyond that fast time frame, the bill faces other hurdles, said Mr. Fiedler of the Brookings Institution. Politically, it almost appears designed to fail, because many more states would lose money under it than would gain. Many of those losing states are represented by Republican senators whose votes are vital: Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Mr. McCain and Ms. Collins, to name a few.And the legislation would set a cap on how much federal support states would receive per person enrolled in the Medicaid program, while health care costs are rising more quickly than the scheduled growth rate for the cap.\u201cOne of the objectives that Republicans have come to this debate with is to reduce federal spending on health care, and it is very difficult to do that, ultimately, without reducing the people covered,\u201d Mr. Fiedler said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not making the underlying health care delivery system more efficient, all you\u2019re doing is shifting around the costs.\u201dThe bill would take money spent under the Affordable Care Act and give it to states in the form of block grants. State officials, including some who initially supported the Graham-Cassidy bill, were dismayed when they saw how much money their states could lose.\u201cWe equalize how much each American receives toward her care, irrespective of where she lives,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why a lower-income American in Mississippi should receive so much less than a lower-income American in Massachusetts.\u201dMr. Graham and Mr. Cassidy, unlike some Republicans, have tried to explain and defend their proposal. But they have been overwhelmed by a tidal wave of criticism from doctors, hospitals, insurers, governors and patients \u2014 and even the late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel. Critics object to these provisions:The bill could weaken consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act. It envisions waivers of federal law that would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to sick people or omit some of the benefits that are now guaranteed, such as maternity care, mental health services or treatment for drug addiction.It would eliminate the federal tax credits and other subsidies that make health insurance more affordable for people with low and moderate incomes, letting states decide how to use the money.It would end the expansion of Medicaid, which has provided insurance to low-income people in 31 states of all political hues. The states include Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, New York and West Virginia.\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cThey read in the paper, they see on TV, they see online that their insurance might be taken away. There\u2019s a lot of fear in this society injected by government, and they should be ashamed of themselves.\u201dA picture caption on Sunday with an article about the latest Republican-sponsored health bill in the Senate misspelled the given name of the senator from South Carolina who drafted the measure.

They drove themselves to excel in an unfamiliar environment. But at what cost?Supported byMarvin had just turned 14 when he arrived, and at a little over five feet tall and 100 pounds, he was a tiny thing. His face was boyishly open, eyes and mouth big and bright, black hair that grew in waves toward a lopsided widow\u2019s peak. His skin was yellow-brown. Marvin had the spirit of a bouncing ball, and back home in Richmond he\u2019d kept his classmates and teachers laughing. In all his years of schooling, he\u2019d never earned a grade other than A. The old couple who raised him, his aunt and uncle, had given him a dime for each perfect report, but money wasn\u2019t Marvin\u2019s motivation. He lived to please them, and after his aunt died when he was 12, Marvin lived to please his uncle. Going off to V.E.S. had delighted him and just about everyone else. \u201cThe neighbors and the other kids, they were just excited,\u201d Marvin recalled. \u201cThe thing that gave me such a rush was that I could see it in their eyes. It\u2019s like: \u2018Well, you go, and you show them. You show them what you can do. You show them for us.\u2019\u201dAnother black boy, Bill Alexander, had also been sent that year. Bill had traveled by jet from his hometown, Nashville, to Washington and then on to Lynchburg aboard a propeller plane. He, too, was alone, though he brought more bags than Marvin, coming as he did from Nashville\u2019s black middle class. At the airport, Bill hailed a taxi driven by a black cabby. \u201cTo Virginia Episcopal School,\u201d Bill told him. But those were impossible words to the man\u2019s ears. He took Bill to a black Baptist seminary instead. \u201cI told the man, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to Virginia Episcopal School on V.E.S. Road,\u2019\u201d Bill told me. \u201cHe kinda looked at me. I must have said it two, three, four times before he drove all the way up to V.E.S.\u201dBill and Marvin were part of a quiet but strategic experiment, funded by a private organization called the Stouffer Foundation, to instill in Southern white elites a value then broadly absent: a visceral and compelling belief in the societal benefits of integration. From the beginning, the boys were a pair, one hardly seen without the other, one name seldom said without the other to follow. Bill and Marvin. Marvin and Bill. To their white classmates and teachers, each existed as one half of a singular whole: the new black boys on campus. Bill was more reserved than his roommate (of course they would have to room together), with the look of someone holding something back, behind bespectacled eyes and a half smile. He was six months older than Marvin, seven inches taller, 35 pounds heavier and his skin several shades darker. His face had already taken a turn toward manliness. A Presbyterian minister\u2019s first child, Bill was preppy before he knew what preppy was. A teacher would nickname the new duo Fire and Ice: Marvin, warmblooded, with his heart on his sleeve; Bill so confident and cool.That same fall, four other Stouffer students broke the racial barrier at Saint Andrew\u2019s School in Boca Raton, Fla. Another three enrolled in the Asheville School in the mountains of western North Carolina. Three more went to the Westminster School on Atlanta\u2019s affluent north side. Twenty students in all integrated seven schools, a teenage vanguard that left black America for the wealthiest white enclaves. Not all of them made it. But each year that followed, a new class came. The privately financed experiment would become a turning point in elite high school education in the South, and it would test, in very real terms, how much a black child could achieve in a white environment and the price he would have to pay.Black leaders debated the merits of educating an elite leadership class versus more broad-based common schooling, a divide famously personified by W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington. At the beginning of the 20th century, Washington endorsed a more utilitarian model of education, including trade schools and workshops for industrial training. Du Bois\u2019s approach was characterized by the term \u201ctalented tenth,\u201d which he borrowed from a Northern philanthropist and used to describe the cadre of highly educated blacks who would lift other black people up, an ideal that grew deep roots in the culture. In 1963, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. tried to enroll his son in an all-white prep school in Atlanta but was refused. The change would have to start within the white community.Anne Forsyth, an heiress of the North Carolina Cannon and Reynolds families, traveled in Winston-Salem\u2019s emerging white liberal circles in the mid-\u201960s. One of her sons went to a Northern prep school that had long accepted black students, and Forsyth noticed that racial integration was beginning to occur almost everywhere except the prep schools of the South. An idea took hold of her. What would society look like if she exposed young wealthy white students to black scholarship students? Would the South change if its future leaders were socialized to be less bigoted? Her aim, using a few token blacks to mend the South\u2019s racial divide from the top down, was utopian to say the least. It was also novel, a systematic effort by whites to help rid other whites of their prejudices. Providing a better life for black students was secondary.They wouldn\u2019t choose just any black students. Forsyth started the Stouffer Foundation, named for her mother, and hired a small team of like-minded white colleagues who toured the South coaxing schools to open their doors to blacks and scouting black public schools for exceptional students. In the years after Brown v. Board of Education, new private schools popped up around the South, and older private schools expanded enrollment. The schools gave such reasons for their growth as \u201cquality education,\u201d \u201cChristian atmosphere,\u201d \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201ccollege preparation,\u201d but mostly they were academies with nostalgia for the Jim Crow South, schools to which white families fled in order to avoid integrated public schools. Thirteen years after the Supreme Court ruling made school segregation unconstitutional, the Stouffer Foundation quietly sent off its first class.V.E.S.\u2019s headmaster, a New Englander named Austin Montgomery, agreed to accept Bill and Marvin over the objections of many parents and members of the school\u2019s board. \u201cWhy, why, why have you done this cruel thing to our beloved school?\u201d one parent wrote. \u201cA private boarding school like V.E.S. is an extension, a part of the family,\u201d another wrote. \u201cWe have no intention whatsoever of integrating those of another race into our family.\u201d The school\u2019s tract of land had been part of a working slave plantation until Emancipation. In the years before Bill and Marvin arrived, V.E.S. tore down the remaining slave cabin on the grounds. Their dormitory bedroom looked out on Jett Hall, the campus\u2019s main building, and from their windows, the campus spread out over 160 acres, with Georgian Revival buildings cropping out of red clay and open green space. The only other black faces belonged to the hired help, like the beloved custodian, Robert Thomas, son of a man named Paul, who had worked at the school in the old days as one of the white-coated waiters who served white boys in the dining room.Marvin and Bill each came to V.E.S. with a belief that the civil rights movement was his to bear, and that the way to bear it was by proving himself in the classroom. Bill, the preacher\u2019s son, had seen the movement up close in meetings at his father\u2019s church. Marvin\u2019s inspiration came from black cultural figures, Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. \u201cWe recognized that being the black kids, everything we did was going to be under scrutiny,\u201d Marvin said. That meant no sneaking off campus, stealing away with girls or missing class. \u201cIt would go beyond us as individuals, and they would say: \u2018This is what all black kids do. This is what the black race would do.\u2019 Representing yourself as an individual and then being a representative of your people \u2014 as I went through school, that became a struggle.\u201dMontgomery, the headmaster, was a near-perfect archetype of the patrician Northerner, with smart eyeglasses and an old smoking pipe always between his teeth. He kept watch over his new charges from his office window. Just weeks into their freshman year, he informed the Stouffer Foundation of a first triumph: \u201cAs I write, the two are playing touch with a dozen others out on the lovely front campus \u2014 a use to which I always like to see it put. The game goes on without regard to the usual stream of Sunday visitors and sightseers.\u201d Calling Bill and Marvin by their last names, Montgomery wrote, \u201cI thought you might be interested that Friday, unbeknownst to me, the freshmen held class elections, in which Alexander was chosen president by a solid majority \u2014 of which Barnard was not one!\u201dWith uncanny speed, Bill and Marvin did just what they set out to do, rushing to the head of the class while shaking up racial allegiances, seldom losing their footing, the path they raced along hewing so closely to the one they\u2019d imagined. A few more weeks into the school year, faculty members posted student rankings on a bulletin board, as they did at the end of every grading period. When the freshman boys pressed up against the bulletin board in their jackets and ties, they saw Bill and Marvin at the top of their class, ahead of all 40-some white boys. \u201cI wanted to get their badges,\u201d Marvin told me. \u201cThat became one of my mottos. I want to get what you say is good, so that you have to say I\u2019m good.\u201dIt\u2019s possible that the stars aligned for the Stouffer Foundation\u2019s experiment during the first months of Marvin and Bill\u2019s time at school. \u201cDivine intervention,\u201d Bill calls it now. A high point came on the baseball field, where Bill attracted the attention of white boys at another school, the prestigious Woodberry Forest, which had previously refused the foundation\u2019s request to desegregate. Forsyth, the heiress and philanthropist, later spoke about the incident: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know what Bill said to these boys, but the next day during chapel, the head of student government asked Mr. Duncan\u201d \u2014 Woodberry\u2019s headmaster \u2014 \u201cif they were supposed to be leaders in the South scholastically, socially and athletically, why weren\u2019t they leaders in integration?\u201d So Woodberry\u2019s headmaster accepted three Stouffer students, the program growing by word of mouth.On the evening of April 4, 1968, Bill and Marvin were in their dorm room when news came over the radio that Martin Luther King had been shot and killed. The movement\u2019s leader was dead, and they were away from home. \u201cI\u2019m standing in the room,\u201d Marvin recalled. \u201cBill is in the room. And then we hear nothing but \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s like the whole doggone dorm was celebrating and laughing and whooping. And I looked at Bill, and I\u2019m just like, \u2018No, this is not gonna happen this way.\u2019 I went out into the hallway, and I looked up and down the hallway, and I yelled out that if anybody thinks that this is funny, then come out of your rooms now and tell me. I wasn\u2019t the biggest guy around or nothing like that. But they could feel I wasn\u2019t taking no mess. And there was quiet.\u201dLate that night, Montgomery, having heard the uproar himself, as had other faculty members who lived in the dorms, assembled the pajama-clad boys in the chapel to admonish them. \u201cThis is not who we are,\u201d he told them, invoking the school\u2019s motto, \u201cToward Full Stature,\u201d which was on a crest above the chapel door. If this seems an obvious response, it was not in the South at that time. To Bill and Marvin, two among hundreds, Montgomery was a hero at that hour. But that night was a turning point for them. It was as if they\u2019d been picked up off their feet and set down in another place, and from their new vantage point, light didn\u2019t shine as brightly toward harmony. \u201cWe had made some miscalculations about how people felt in their hearts,\u201d Marvin said. \u201cThat took some of the smile off of my face.\u201dMarvin spent the summer at home in Richmond. His uncle, whom he called \u201cfather,\u201d had been sick, and Marvin decided that he would rather stay there to care for him than return to V.E.S. He and his uncle were at home on a hot July night, when his uncle told him: \u201cYou\u2019re a kid. But you\u2019re really like a little man. And you really are a man tonight.\u201d Moments later, Marvin heard a gasp, the sound of his uncle\u2019s last breath. \u201cI think in many ways he allowed himself to die so he would not hold me back from the opportunity,\u201d Marvin told me. \u201cAnd from that moment, I did what I had to do.\u201dHeadmaster Montgomery sent Marvin a letter expressing his condolences and harked back to the night King was killed. \u201cI think you took hold of what could have been a difficult situation this past year and handled it manfully, in the very best sense of that word. You did yourself great credit. I hope that you had a happy year and one you think was profitable. Probably you did at least as much for V.E.S. as it did for you.\u201dBut Montgomery never recovered the confidence of the school\u2019s faithful after going against their will. He resigned before the start of Bill and Marvin\u2019s sophomore year, and the school replaced him with the assistant headmaster, a Southerner. By that time, Montgomery had accepted two more Stouffer scholars, Johnny Holloway, from Durham, N.C., and Jerrauld Jones, from Norfolk, Va., assuring them and their parents that they would be looked after. He asked others at the school, including the football coach, to fulfill his promise.The Stouffer Foundation continued its work. Forsyth, after providing seed money, faded into the background, giving management of the operation to John Ehle, a North Carolina novelist turned public-policy idea man. Ehle, before the 1968 school year, traveled to Knoxville, Richmond and Greensboro in search of talented black students, asking school counselors for their best and brightest. To the students and parents he met, many of whom had never had a white person in their home, Ehle must have seemed an apparition. He kept a file for nearly every one of the 140 Stouffer scholars, who eventually included girls, Native Americans and Latinos. Many files include audio recordings of his and others\u2019 interviews with them. Ehle asked one student about his experience with integration.\u201cWell, several summers ago, I went to a camp that was integrated,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut other than that, I haven\u2019t been in contact very much with, um, many white boys and girls.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t really have any dislike for them, though, do ya?\u201d Ehle asked.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t understand why Negroes and whites don\u2019t get along.\u201dOf Jerrauld Jones, one of the second pair of black boys to go to V.E.S., a Stouffer report said that he is \u201can affable, intelligent young boy.\u201d It continued: \u201cHe at least appeared almost oblivious to the idea of personal problems relating to race. He\u2019s right. He\u2019ll be accepted for being himself.\u201d In his roommate Johnny\u2019s file, there is a letter from Johnny addressed to Anne Forsyth: \u201cI realize that a huge responsibility will be resting upon my shoulders but I feel as though I can hold it.\u201dLike Bill and Marvin, Jerrauld and Johnny and Stouffer\u2019s second class of scholarship recipients were required to attend an eight-week crash course in prep-school manners and academics, covering everything from how to hold a tennis racket to a reading list of \u201cHuckleberry Finn,\u201d the \u201cOdyssey\u201d and Robert Frost. Civil rights leaders including Vernon Jordan and Julian Bond were recruited to advise them. And Forsyth herself addressed them with the story of Bill\u2019s ballgame, which for her embodied the Stouffer experiment\u2019s ideal \u2014 by simple exposure, racial barriers fell away. Forsyth did not tell the students stories of the four boys who didn\u2019t make it that first year, including one boy whose white classmates at another Southern prep school held him outside a third-floor dormitory window by his ankles. It\u2019s possible that she didn\u2019t know about him.Each took one under his wing. Marvin agreed to look after Jerrauld. \u201cYou know, Jerrauld\u2019s a good guy,\u201d he told me. \u201cA great guy. But in my opinion at the time, he wasn\u2019t from my background. He\u2019s from a middle-class background, and to me he wasn\u2019t tough enough. And I saw guys, white guys, trying to take advantage of him in terms of, you know, bullying him. I\u2019m like, \u2018No, \u2019cause if they feel that they can bully you, then they can bully the rest of us, and they may think they can bully black people, and that\u2019s not going to happen here.\u2019\u201dBill and Marvin decided that the best way to respond to the exultation they saw after King was killed was to outpace the whites. It was not enough to outrank their classmates by a few decimal points; it had to be clear and unquestionable who was best. So they pulled away. Bill and Marvin were the top two students in their class their entire four years at V.E.S. They became the head counselors in the dorm. They were on the football team, which won a state prep-school championship, the first integrated team to do so, a year before the public-school team made famous by \u201cRemember the Titans.\u201d \u201cThose white boys knew,\u201d Marvin told me.Each year, the number of black students grew. Their junior year, two more came: Terry Sherrill, from Huntersville, N.C., a small town north of Charlotte, and Greg Prioleau, from Washington. Terry\u2019s eighth-grade teacher asked him to take a battery of tests, and only later did he learn what they were for. His father worked in a warehouse, and his mother as a nurse\u2019s assistant. He had a sense of the civil rights movement from having gone to the March on Washington in 1963, sitting on his father\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAll of that helped mold me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it came to V.E.S., I was determined that I was going to do my absolute best. And I don\u2019t think there was a quarter when I wasn\u2019t No.1.\u201dHis roommate, Greg, said: \u201cMy parents, being very Christian, they looked at it as a blessing. You don\u2019t give back blessings that the Lord gives you.\u201d Neither even considered prep schools before the foundation discovered them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that any of us, my family included, understood the racial component of it,\u201d Greg said. \u201cThat was hidden from us. I had never been around white folks before.\u201dIn Bill and Marvin\u2019s march toward graduation, they expanded their little movement, insisting that the others keep it going, make it bigger. Year after year, they watched the project repeat itself. In Marvin and Bill\u2019s senior year, the foundation sent one student to V.E.S., Tony Johnson, from Richmond, who shared a room with Terry and Greg. They felt more and more that they were operating not just on V.E.S.\u2019s campus, but in history. \u201cI used to always say that going to V.E.S. is bigger than you,\u201d Marvin said. In 1970, the black students named themselves the Magnificent Seven, after the western film featuring seven gunfighters who protect a Mexican village from marauding bandits. They met at night to rally one another. Group dynamics took over; the white kids had numbers and dominant culture on their side. The seven operated as symbols, as representatives for all black people. How that changed the white people, if it did, is hard to say.Marvin, who came from Richmond\u2019s slum, changed the way he carried himself. \u201cThere\u2019s certain things that a preacher\u2019s son can\u2019t say and do,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut there\u2019s certain things a boy from the hood can say and do.\u201d He grew an Afro to add inches to his frame. Now his classmates couldn\u2019t overlook his blackness. He took on the garb of black nationalism, wearing dashikis over his shirt and tie and menace on his face. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna have some members that were friends of K.K.K. and the Confederates or whatever, they gotta know that there\u2019s somebody here that may be a little bit on that Black Panther side,\u201d Marvin said. \u201cThat was my role.\u201dBill quietly shone in the classroom and on the athletic field. Marvin, after trailing Bill in the academic rankings for three years, decided that in their final year he would best Bill. \u201cI said: \u2018Bill, you know I love you like a brother. But you\u2019re not going to sweep me.\u2019\u201d It was Marvin\u2019s understanding that the senior with the highest grade-point average for the year gave the valedictory speech, and as the sharpest edge of the Magnificent Seven, Marvin wanted his classmates and their families to have to look at him with his Afro. \u201cI wanted them to understand the difference of somebody coming from what they perceive as poverty and a broken home and disadvantaged, that this person could be on top of your son, sons of congressmen, corporate men, lawyers, all that. I had something to say.\u201d Marvin finally beat Bill that year. They finished first and second. Then Marvin\u2019s faculty adviser came to his room, and he found out that Bill, who had the highest average over four years, would be giving the address. Marvin felt the school had chosen ice over fire. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, but I was hurt,\u201d Marvin told me.Still, one of Marvin\u2019s proudest moments at V.E.S. was on graduation day in 1971, looking up at his roommate. There, on a bright spring morning, Bill criticized his fellow students\u2019 indifference to life outside their privileged bubble. \u201cMy hope is for V.E.S. to accept the challenge of developing a new lifestyle, a new atmosphere, a new microcosm in which life is given more perspective besides the one-sided affluent one,\u201d he said calmly at the end of the speech. \u201cThe challenge for V.E.S. is to create a new spirit, to perforate the buildings of this campus. I hope that movement continues.\u201dThe Magnificent Seven hadn\u2019t all gotten together since Bill and Marvin\u2019s graduation in 1971. As five of them moved around campus, I watched them swing between their past and present selves, between adolescent horseplay and a 60-something\u2019s sense of a long life lived. In many ways, V.E.S.\u2019s campus looks as it did 50 years ago. The chapel, the bell tower and the old dormitories still stand. In Jett Hall, there\u2019s a permanent display honoring Bill and Marvin, featuring their freshman and senior yearbook photos.They had come to realize how much the seven had sacrificed. The feeling was acute in the company of their white classmates, who with age also realized what the Stouffer scholars went through; some were moved to tears. At a cocktail reception, I sat with the former roommates Greg and Terry and a couple of their classmates. \u201cTerry and Greg had a lot more pressure on them going through V.E.S. \u2014 don\u2019t you think?\u201d Rick Scruggs asked. \u201cTerry and Greg couldn\u2019t hang and do the things we did.\u201d I asked him what that meant. \u201cLike going out and drinking. They had more pressure on them to toe the line and be successful. We were all kinda stupid sometimes.\u201d\u201cWe had each other,\u201d said Greg, who studied at Northeastern and then Stanford and is now a project manager at a construction firm. \u201cWe knew where we were, understanding the time in America we were in. And all this stuff might have been going on over our head. Like, what was going down at the river?\u201d Weed smoking, apparently. Terry, a trial lawyer now, didn\u2019t know either.I bumped into Jerrauld at the barbecue lunch. We talked about how Ehle seemed to have a certain kind of person in mind when he picked them \u2014 resilient. \u201cDon\u2019t get it wrong,\u201d Jerrauld said. \u201cThere was a lot of ugliness, hostility, overt and covert, that we had to endure here.\u201d But he said the past looks rosier with time. Jerrauld went to Princeton and on to law school at Washington and Lee; he is now a state judge in Virginia, after having served in the State Legislature for 14 years and as a member of a governor\u2019s cabinet for three.It was hard to walk a few paces with Marvin and Bill without an old classmate stopping them to offer a pat on the back. Like Terry, Bill has served on the V.E.S board and has kept in touch with black students, and he has also endowed a scholarship that bears his name. We talked at the football game about black students at the school today, and he said that at times they struggled to find their place.Marvin leaned in. \u201cOne of the problems I experienced in those times was my own personal identity versus being a representative of an entire race.\u201d After V.E.S, Marvin was ready to move on. Unlike Bill, who chose to go to Harvard, Marvin went to Howard, the elite university known to many as the black Harvard, \u201cto further define who I was, rather than for another race who blacks were. I had to learn more myself.\u201dAs the football game blared, Bill asked me how my high school experience compared with his. I\u2019m an alumnus of a program called A Better Chance, which was started in Atlanta a few years before the Stouffer Foundation and at the time provided scholarships for black students to attend prep schools in the North. Now it helps send 2,000 students to nearly 350 schools nationwide.But my education was something different from Bill and Marvin\u2019s, not so connected to a movement and more about personal enrichment and attaining traditional measures of success. After going to public elementary and middle schools, I went to a private high school in Atlanta, my hometown, and on to Harvard, where I met Bill\u2019s son. But I was always one of a select few black students. That is not the integration ideal. Sometimes I feel a yearning, something that I imagine some children of immigrants must feel, ones who weren\u2019t taught their parents\u2019 language and culture. Why didn\u2019t my parents, my father in particular, who was a radical, a \u201crace man,\u201d ground me in any of that language? I\u2019ve had the feeling lately that that oppositional posture should have been my inheritance \u2014 but my parents were focused on other things. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do something for society; I was trying to do something for our black child,\u201d my father told me recently. \u201cIt was a mistake not to have more conversations about the movement.\u201d I\u2019m finding that with age and the political climate in this country, I\u2019m picking up the language on my own.I interviewed dozens of Stouffer scholars before focusing on the story of the Magnificent Seven, and in those interviews, I saw this ambivalence in many of the scholars. Many seemed pleased with their professional success, but it had come at a cost. I recall one conversation I had with a very successful Stouffer alum, who told me that he goes back and forth between being incredibly thankful for his educational experience and wanting to \u201cburn the whole system down.\u201d Some of the scholars value how easily they can move in and out of white social circles; they appreciate the exposure to wealth in America. Others felt that the project, and their role in it, was an assault on their blackness.At the centennial, the others kept asking me: Where\u2019s Johnny? Have you been able to catch up with Johnny? He hadn\u2019t returned to V.E.S. since 1973, when he went back to watch Terry and Greg graduate. \u201cDid he just move on, or was there some other reason?\u201d Greg said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we can\u2019t figure out. We are trying to figure out what went through his mind. Those four years. You can\u2019t just throw them away. That was the bridge that took you from a child to a man.\u201dHe wanted to explain his absence from the reunion, but our conversation started where so many of my conversations started, with Bill and Marvin. \u201cThese guys were on a different level,\u201d Johnny told me. \u201cImagine being Michael Jordan\u2019s little brother coming to play for the Bulls the year after they won their first championship. On the one hand, people go: \u2018Your last name\u2019s Jordan. O.K.\u2019 But if you can\u2019t jump and shoot and all that as well as he can, then pretty soon the comparison is not favorable.\u201d Speaking of himself and Jerrauld, he said, \u201cI think that the fact that we didn\u2019t blow the doors off the way that they did was almost a relief to everybody else around there.\u201dJohnny recalled some of the traditions at V.E.S., which for him harked back to segregation and slavery and reminded him of insults he\u2019d seen his elders suffer. He was shocked by the fact that the students called their teachers \u201cmaster\u201d; the leader of the school was the headmaster. \u201cI wasn\u2019t calling anybody \u2018master.\u2019\u201d He spoke with a measured cadence, his voice deep and round, slowly enough for his words to hang in the room but without much emotion. \u201cThat just was not going to happen. I would call them \u2018mister.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t well received initially, because it felt like I was trying to buck their system.\u201dHe bristled at the school\u2019s hierarchy. Every mealtime, also by tradition, the students sat around a dining table with an instructor and his family, who lived on campus. There were usually eight to a table, including a senior, a junior, a sophomore and a freshman who was often supposed to set the table and clear all the dishes. \u201cI\u2019m like, you know, we\u2019re all sitting there eating. I did it yesterday. You do it today. I had this chip on my shoulder, where, you know, I don\u2019t want to be seen as the black guy playing a butler. I didn\u2019t come here to do that. I came here to be a student.\u201dBut the worst of it happened after dark. It started a couple of months after he arrived at school. Upperclassmen were allowed to stay up later than freshmen, and there were no locks on the doors. When he first told me the story, his voice tightened, and he began to cry. \u201cI took a lot of beatings,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you could imagine yourself being in bed asleep and somebody throwing your sheet over your head, and you\u2019re suddenly being pummeled by a bunch of guys. That\u2019s pretty intense. At 14 years old, feeling that you have no sanctuary at all, feeling that you\u2019re really not safe from getting beat up and that you\u2019re doing it not just for yourself but for a movement that\u2019s larger than yourself, taking that kind of beating. It hurts when you get hit. Then you don\u2019t sleep the rest of the night because you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re coming back. You\u2019re crying. You\u2019re angry. You\u2019re hurt.\u201d He spoke softly now, pausing between his words. The beatings happened four or five times during his first year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of my experience there that I didn\u2019t share with the other brothers that were there because I didn\u2019t feel that that\u2019s something we would have been able to talk about and do anything about.\u201dJohnny went home to Durham after his freshman year to a hero\u2019s welcome. His grandmother, who every two weeks sent him $15, two-thirds of what she made as a housekeeper, took him to visit all her friends, beaming. He wanted to quit V.E.S. but couldn\u2019t bear to disappoint her. And he thought of his forebears, like his great-grandmother, who was born a slave. \u201cMy great-grandmother had been alive until I was 5 or 6 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I was at V.E.S. sitting in a classroom with white students whose grandparents and great-grandparents had owned slaves, I felt the real need to demonstrate that I was as good as they were.\u201dJohnny never considered going to the reunion, but he has begun to rethink his relationship with the school. \u201cYou know, when I think about V.E.S. now, without a doubt V.E.S. changed not just my life but the lives of my children and my grandchildren. I know the high schools I would have attended, and I know the high school I did attend,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s for everyone, being pulled away from home and forced to basically live independent of your family. But for me, I think it was a great experience and changed everything.\u201d The greatest value, he said, was shaking off notions of white supremacy that he\u2019d absorbed. He was as good or better than they were. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade the experience at all. It propelled me into a new place in life.\u201dI wondered how Johnny\u2019s presence, the sacrifice of his own body, had affected the white people who he said beat him, two in particular. One of them is dead now, and the other, who lives in North Carolina, didn\u2019t return my calls.Jerrauld, Johnny\u2019s roommate, slept beside him every night. Could he have missed the violence? He hadn\u2019t mentioned anything at the reunion but was more forthcoming when I called him later. \u201cI was aware of those two guys being standouts when it came to harassment that certainly had racial aspects to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Johnny was not alone. They did some of the same things to me as well.\u201d Though Johnny recalls suffering on his own, Jerrauld remembers talking with Johnny about the two boys who beat them, and yet a third antagonist. \u201cHe was particularly ugly from a racial perspective in his relations with us. And he was verbally abusive to me. And I remember lying in my bed one night, thinking to myself: I am going to kill this guy. That\u2019s how much I don\u2019t like him. I am going to kill this guy. And I started to plan how I was going to do it.\u201d He was going to throw him off the top of the dormitory, but he told his mother, and she drove the 200 miles from Norfolk to comfort him.He told me about a letter he received from a teacher named Rock Lee, who was also the school\u2019s beloved football coach. \u201cHe was not well at the time. He was much older. And he wrote this letter of apology to me. When he found out all this stuff was going on\u201d \u2014 Lee, he learned, had read a about a speech Jerrauld gave in the Virginia Legislature in which he recounted the difficulties of attending a mostly white school \u2014 \u201cbecause he said that he had promised Austin Montgomery that he would protect us, that he would protect us from all this awful stuff. And when he found out that things were going on that he didn\u2019t know about, he said, he cried.\u201dThe Stouffer Foundation was aware of the risks its scholars faced. \u201cI remember them saying that we would likely experience some very difficult days and some very ugly things,\u201d Jerrauld said, \u201cbut that we always had to remember that the way to survive it was to make A\u2019s in mathematics and English and chemistry and history. That is what I think they saw as the great social equalizer.\u201dI am no longer conscious of the race of students in prep school: Agree or Disagree?I would object to a black student dating my sister: Agree or Disagree?I believe another five years of social change may result in a greater degree of integration than we have now: Agree or Disagree?In their answers, the students seemed to point out the implicit flaw in the Stouffer experiment. \u201cI think that this test was a waste of time,\u201d one student wrote. \u201cThere really aren\u2019t enough blacks in this school for us to be able to answer the questions fairly.\u201d Another echoed the same sentiment, criticizing not the project itself but its size. \u201cWhy the questionnaire on black students when there are only three in the whole school? Seems rather ridiculous. I hope something was gained by this because I think it\u2019s silly.\u201dThe Magnificent Seven hadn\u2019t heard of the study until I told them about finding the dot matrix printouts in the University of North Carolina\u2019s archives. I asked them whether they cared that their educations \u2014 and the personal costs some of them paid \u2014 had been an afterthought in this larger experiment in conditioning white Southerners to tolerate black children from a young age. \u201cNo, I never felt that way,\u201d Bill told me. \u201cI think I benefited from the V.E.S. educational experience. Did we contribute to changing the culture of the school? Sure.\u201dSome of their white classmates told me that knowing the seven changed them. But how do you quantify that? What\u2019s easier to see is how the black students used the Stouffer experience to position themselves for success. As their lives progressed, each of them in his own way had to bring the bad that happened to accord with the good. I believe that\u2019s a common refrain of many high-achieving black people in this country. In order to fully inhabit the bright parts of life \u2014 their educations, the friendships, the knowledge, the doors opened, the growth \u2014 they must own the darkness. Johnny told me I was the first person he had ever explored his feelings with. By the last time we spoke, he said he had made peace with what happened to him.Whenever Jerrauld\u2019s life takes him near Lynchburg, he visits V.E.S. for a walk around campus. \u201cThey were kids,\u201d he told me, speaking of his white classmates. \u201cI\u2019m not giving them a complete pass on the bad things they did to us. But once they were put in the position of knowing that we were just like them or better than them academically, once they saw that, I think they had no other choice but to deal with us as people. There was this begrudged respect for us.\u201d With time, the experiment became theirs, an attempt to wrest control from a world that didn\u2019t always want to give it to them. \u201cWe were soldiers,\u201d Jerrauld said, \u201con that little bitty battlefield.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Minnesota Finds a Way to Slow Soaring Health Premiums", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Last fall, as consumers in Minnesota were facing health insurance rate increases of 50 percent or more, Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, said the Affordable Care Act was \u201cno longer affordable to increasing numbers of people.\u201d The state\u2019s top insurance regulator said the Minnesota market was \u201con the verge of collapse.\u201dThe outlook now is much better. Rate increases requested for 2018 are relatively modest, thanks in part to a new program under which the state will help pay the largest claims. The program, known as reinsurance, and the efforts that led to its creation hold lessons for other states where rates are rising rapidly, and for Congress, where lawmakers are considering the introduction of a similar program.\u201cThe individual insurance market is stabilizing under the program here,\u201d said Allison L. O\u2019Toole, the chief executive of Minnesota\u2019s state-run insurance marketplace. \u201cHealth plans are very happy about it.\u201dState officials and insurers say that, as a result of the program, premiums next year will be about 20 percent lower than they would otherwise have been. The program \u2014 for which Minnesota has budgeted about $270 million in each of the next two years \u2014 potentially benefits all of the 160,000 people buying insurance on their own, not just those with large claims.But the program will be invisible to consumers. They will not have to file additional paperwork or do anything different from what they would ordinarily do.\u201cReinsurance is keeping rates under control and keeping insurers in the market in counties and places where they might not otherwise participate,\u201d said State Senator Michelle R. Benson, a Republican who is chairwoman of the Senate health and human services committee.In Washington, Congress returns Tuesday with a list of urgent priorities that include an increase in the federal debt limit, disaster relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey, a spending plan to avert a government shutdown \u2014 and decisions about the future of the Affordable Care Act.The Senate health committee, headed by Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, has scheduled four hearings in the first half of September to consider bipartisan proposals to steady insurance markets. A group of eight governors, led by John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, and John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, has suggested a package of quick fixes, including federal funds for reinsurance programs.Minnesota\u2019s experience with such an effort is instructive. The bill creating its reinsurance program, the Minnesota Premium Security Plan, became law within three months of being introduced \u2014 lightning speed when compared with the pace in Congress.The Minnesota plan was a Republican initiative. Most Democrats voted against the bill, and Governor Dayton allowed it to become law without his signature. Many Democrats preferred a different approach that would have allowed consumers to buy coverage under an existing state program.But now that the reinsurance program has been authorized by state law, members of Congress from Minnesota and state legislative leaders from both parties have joined Mr. Dayton in urging the Trump administration to grant the approvals the state needs to carry out the plan. When proposed rates for 2018 were announced at the end of July, Mr. Dayton said, \u201cI applaud the Minnesota legislators, who worked together to pass this pioneering legislation, which is being shown to cause major reductions in the costs of health insurance next year for many thousands of Minnesotans.\u201dIn a letter to governors in March, Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said the Trump administration would be receptive to such state initiatives.\u201cState-operated reinsurance programs may be an opportunity for states to lower premiums for consumers, improve market stability and increase consumer choice,\u201d Mr. Price said.HealthPartners, a Minnesota company that provides coverage to 62,000 people who buy insurance on their own, has proposed rate reductions that average 13 percent to 15 percent next year. Without the reinsurance program, it would require rate increases of 3 percent to 5 percent, it said in filings with the Minnesota Commerce Department.\u201cWe\u2019ve had two years of very significant rate increases, and the market is still volatile,\u201d said Andrea Walsh, the president and chief executive of HealthPartners. \u201cBut the reinsurance program promises more stability. We\u2019ll be able to spread the cost of high-cost cases across the entire individual marketplace.\u201dBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is proposing rate increases of up to 11 percent for the plans it offers in the public marketplace. Without reinsurance, it said, its rates would rise 16 percent to 32 percent, on average. By contrast, its average rate increase this year was 55 percent.Hodan Guled, the chief executive of Briva Health, a community group that helps Minnesotans sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, said the reinsurance program was \u201cdefinitely helpful and beneficial\u201d for consumers.State Senator Tony Lourey, the senior Democrat on the health committee in the Minnesota Senate, said he voted against the legislation because it was financed mainly with money from a fund intended for a separate state health program for the working poor. But he said, \u201cReinsurance itself is a good tool, a valuable tool, to mitigate premium spikes, and this program does work.\u2019\u2019\u201cThis is the type of risk-mitigation tool that the feds defunded in an effort to sabotage Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Lourey said. \u201cIt\u2019s left to states then to put this massive investment in place. The feds need to be stepping up to the plate and not leaving it to the states.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act created a temporary federal reinsurance program, which was in effect from 2014 to 2016. But like much of the law, it became snarled in politics and legal disputes.Under the measure adopted this year in Minnesota, the state reinsurance program pays 80 percent of the amount of a claim from $50,000 to $250,000. The insurer is responsible for any amounts over $250,000.If, for example, a person has $60,000 in claims next year, the reinsurance program would pay the insurer 80 percent of $10,000, or $8,000. If a person has $600,000 in claims, the program would cover 80 percent of the cost from $50,000 to $250,000 \u2014 80 percent of $200,000 \u2014 so the payment to the insurer would be $160,000.The state is counting on the federal government to pay about half of the cost for the reinsurance program, using money the federal government is expected to save because of lower premiums here.Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government offers subsidies, in the form of tax credits, to lower- and moderate-income people to help them pay premiums for insurance that they are generally required to buy.\u201cHigher premiums mean higher federal tax credits,\u201d the state said in its application to the federal government. \u201cLower premiums mean lower federal tax credits.\u201dIn Congress, House and Senate Republicans say the Affordable Care Act has failed to hold down premiums. As part of their bills to repeal the law, they would provide tens of billions of dollars that states could use for reinsurance programs in the coming decade. Two Democratic senators, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia, have introduced legislation that would provide money for reinsurance programs without dismantling President Barack Obama\u2019s health law.In Maryland, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the dominant insurer, has just received approval from the state insurance commissioner for rate increases averaging 34.5 percent to 49.9 percent next year.Chet Burrell, the president and chief executive of CareFirst, said the rate increases were unsustainable and would drive healthier people from the market, leaving a pool of sicker customers. \u201cA few more years of this,\u201d he said, \u201cand there will be no more market left.\u201dMr. Burrell said that a federal reinsurance program \u2014 to help pay for the \u201creally high-cost cases\u201d \u2014 would help stabilize the market.In July, the Trump administration approved a reinsurance program proposed by Alaska, where health care and coverage are particularly expensive. The program helps pay claims for people with certain high-cost medical conditions like metastatic cancer, H.I.V. and AIDS.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Prepares to Brief Congress on Its Role in Election", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has become the latest Silicon Valley giant to become entangled in a widening investigation into how online social networks and technology products may have played a role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.On Friday evening, Google said it would cooperate with congressional inquiries into the election, days after Facebook and Twitter provided evidence to investigators of accounts on their networks that were linked to Russian groups. Google was called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Google has also begun an internal investigation into whether its advertising products and services were used as part of a Russia-linked influence campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the issue. Exactly when the inquiry began is not known, but it has been discussed inside Google over recent weeks, the person said.Google\u2019s search engine, with about a 90 percent market share, is an inescapable part of the internet, so it was no surprise that congressional investigators turned toward the company. Google is the only company that sells more digital advertising than Facebook, and its YouTube service is the go-to place for videos on the internet.On Thursday, Twitter said in a closed-door briefing for the Senate and House intelligence panels that it had found about 200 accounts \u2014 a fraction of the number of potentially compromised accounts found by outside researchers \u2014 that appeared to be linked to a Russian campaign to influence the election.What direction the congressional investigation into Google will take is not clear. Google is much larger than Facebook or Twitter, and it has a wide range of services that played a role in the dissemination of so-called fake news during the campaign.But it is not a social network like Facebook or Twitter, making it harder for blatantly untrue stories to catch on, or for public sentiment to be stirred up through carefully targeted posts.Google has, however, long dealt with people trying to game its search engine to highlight misleading information or use its AdSense advertising network to finance eye-catching but false news stories. YouTube is also fertile ground for offensive videos and misleading news stories.\u201cWe will of course cooperate with inquiries; we\u2019re looking into how we can help with any relevant information,\u201d Google said in a statement late Friday.Similar to the way content that receives more attention is often more heavily promoted on Facebook and Twitter, Google\u2019s search engine gives more weight to results that are more frequently clicked on. It is one of hundreds of factors that go into ranking links.The company has also been working on shutting access to AdSense for sites that spread misinformation. Google\u2019s ad network is widely used by other websites and is often their only source of revenue. AdSense allows marketers to target users by different criteria, but it does not offer the same detail as Facebook, which can slice and dice its audience by their interests, including political leanings.In late January, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from AdSense \u2014 a tiny number compared to the more than two million publishers registered on AdSense.At the time, Google said it reviewed 550 sites \u201csuspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations\u201d in November and December and took action against 340 of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A History of Bloomberg\u2019s Successes and Failures", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Michael Bloomberg ended up running the information technology department at Salomon Brothers partly as a punishment. It was 1979, and he had already had a highly successful 13-year career at the firm, after joining it out of Harvard Business School. But he had also made enemies. The other Salomon partners decided to put him in charge of a department that \u201cwas a critical function to be sure,\u201d as Chris McNickle writes in \u201cBloomberg: A Billionaire\u2019s Ambition,\u201d \u201cbut far removed from the glory of the trades and the deals that made the firm money.\u201d Two years later, they eased him out of the company, albeit with a $10 million goodbye.Information technology was a good fit for Bloomberg. He had always liked data and analysis. As an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University in the early 1960s, he first planned to be a physics major before switching to electrical engineering. The experience of running Salomon\u2019s technology department underscored to him how valuable data could be. It also made him think there was a business opportunity: giving people on Wall Street better information than they had. Bloomberg believed more numbers and facts would allow traders to make better decisions. They, in turn, would pay handsomely for the information.And so he founded a company that made computers designed to fit on a trader\u2019s desk, which wasn\u2019t easy in the bulky computing days of the early 1980s. \u201cThe Bloombergs,\u201d as they were known, provided traders with information about the bond market. Eventually, the company grew far beyond the bond market and made Bloomberg a billionaire, the richest man in New York.His belief in the power of information has remained the closest thing to an unshakable ideology for Bloomberg. As New York\u2019s mayor for 12 years, he tried to use data, facts and analysis to transform an enormous, dynamic city.He famously got rid of most offices at City Hall, sitting in open cubicles alongside his aides (as he had at his company) largely so that he and they both would be in the midst of an information flow. Upon taking office, he was aghast to discover that no one could tell him how many people worked for the City of New York; his staff soon changed that, creating a registry of city workers. In one area after another \u2014 the use of the waterfront, the zoning of buildings, public health, transportation and, most famously, policing and schools \u2014 Bloomberg used information as his primary tool of governance. As one poverty expert said, Bloomberg tried to \u201cbuild a culture of evidence.\u201dBloomberg\u2019s mayoralty began less than four months after 9/11 and spanned most of the presidencies of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as the worst financial crisis in 70 years. Bloomberg has been out of office less than a full term, and yet his tenure already seems in some ways to be out of another time.Republicans (he joined the party to win the mayor\u2019s office, before abandoning it) show little interest in his fact-based approach to government. The party nominated a compulsive liar for president, and its congressional leaders tried to pass a major health care bill based on fictions. Party leaders now regularly attempt to deny basic facts, whether they come from climate scientists or the dispassionate analysts at the Congressional Budget Office.Democrats remain much closer to Bloomberg\u2019s technocratic vision of government as a force for good, but their energy has also shifted. Nothing represents the change better than Bloomberg\u2019s own successor, Bill de Blasio. He is arguably the most proudly left-wing government executive in the United States. He won in large part by casting Bloomberg as insufficiently concerned about the gaping inequality that afflicts both New York and the country. Populism is in. Bloombergism seems quaint.McNickle, a lifelong New Yorker who has a doctorate in history and spent years working in finance, has done something valuable with this biography. He has focused on Bloomberg\u2019s 12 years as mayor and tried to offer an early historical judgment on them. The book lacks the narrative panache and fresh detail of some political histories. The 2009 book \u201cMike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics,\u201d written by my former Times colleague Joyce Purnick, has a more accessible pacing, for example. McNickle, however, has the advantage of being able to cover all three of Bloomberg\u2019s terms rather than only the first two, and he proves to be an excellent judge.He scrupulously allows both Bloomberg\u2019s circle and his critics to have their say. But McNickle doesn\u2019t leave the reader feeling helpless among conflicting evidence. He avoids the nihilist trap that causes so many journalistic assessments of politicians to be unsatisfying. He instead is willing to offer perspective about the scale of failures and successes. He ends his chapters, each of which focuses on a major subject, by making an argument about what worked, what didn\u2019t and what mattered most.McNickle is withering about Bloomberg\u2019s deal with the City Council \u2014 \u201ca crass marriage of ambitions\u201d \u2014 to change the term-limits law so that he could serve a third term. McNickle also recognizes that Bloomberg\u2019s election and re-elections depended on his personal wealth, which in turn \u201cmade a farce\u201d of the campaign-finance law. This book lays out various policy mistakes and disappointments, like the damage from stop-and-frisk policing and the mixed record of Bloomberg\u2019s educational policies.Yet the full picture is rather different, and McNickle doesn\u2019t shy from it either. Bloomberg was a remarkably successful mayor. He succeeded in large part because of his faith in the power of facts. He sought detailed, reliable information about life in the city. He asked his aides to focus on big questions and charged them with improving New Yorkers\u2019 lives.They did. They remade New York\u2019s once grim waterfront, transforming the face of the city. They won a huge public-health victory by restricting smoking and made more progress than many people realize on obesity. Bloomberg rewrote archaic zoning laws, so they were no longer based on the notion that factories and residences were the main uses for New York\u2019s real estate; offices, retail and public parks were vital too. The Bronx Terminal Market, Hunters Point in Queens and the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn are all examples. He presided over a decline in both crime and the jail population. The poverty rate fell relative to the rest of the country\u2019s. His schooling reforms fell short of what he wanted, but McNickle shows they were also responsible for real improvements.The most resonant critique of Bloomberg, de Blasio\u2019s central critique, is that he governed for the 1 percent rather than the 99 percent. It\u2019s certainly the case that the rich did better than everyone else over the course of his mayoralty. But that\u2019s a global story, not just a New York one. While Bloomberg didn\u2019t solve the great stagnation of living standards that afflicts the American middle class and poor, it\u2019s hard to think of a contemporary mayor or governor who made more progress.The problem of inequality may well be too big for only a technocratic approach to government. It will probably also require muscular federal action on areas like taxes, antitrust, and workers\u2019 bargaining power. But Bloomberg nonetheless leaves a giant legacy for anyone who cares about the power of government to do good. When future fact-loving politicians take office \u2014 and they will, even in Washington \u2014 they will be able to learn from both Bloomberg\u2019s successes and his shortcomings.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Graydon, Who?", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGraydon Carter\u2019s exit means the Vanity Fair editorship is up for grabs. 1. Be comfortable in Vanity Fair\u2019s swirling spheres of celebrity, politics, journalism and finance. Mr. Carter hosted parties and owned trendy restaurants. Mingling, and finessing a seating chart, are key. 2. Be willing to navigate the tumult at Cond\u00e9 Nast, which in the past year has shaken up top leadership and reorganized its production structure as it weathers an industry-wide financial downturn. 3. Embracing the digital future is a must. So is the ability to generate new revenue streams to offset continued declines in print advertising and circulation.5. Star quality counts. With the departure of Glamour\u2019s Cindi Leive, Cond\u00e9 Nast has lost two major editors in the span of a week. An unknown quantity at Vanity Fair could fuel a perception that the company is losing its luster. Here is a look at several top contenders, based on their experience, interviews with people in the industry and chatter in the Manhattan publishing world.She turned US Weekly into a behemoth, then revived The Hollywood Reporter from a dusty trade into a glossy weekly with influence on both coasts and big online traffic. She is a woman of color with an enviable track record in a lily-white field of candidates. Vanity Fair has long been seen as a next step for her \u2014 and she was spotted in the hallways of Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s headquarters this week. But some at Cond\u00e9 Nast question her journalism chops. Ms. Min would also have to uproot her family from Los Angeles, where she has a real shot at leading a television network, a business with a much brighter future than magazines. The maverick genius of the 1980s, now the gray eminence of the 2010s, Mr. Moss is perhaps the most successful editor of his generation. After founding the groundbreaking weekly 7 Days, he oversaw The New York Times Styles section and ran the Sunday Magazine before taking his current perch at New York, where he picks up national magazine awards like pennies on the sidewalk. At 60, he is closer to retirement age than Cond\u00e9 Nast executives may prefer. And Mr. Moss is a social caterpillar who avoids the gala circuit, a drawback for Vanity Fair\u2019s extroverted culture. But it would be hard to count out his visual creativity and stable of talented (and devoted) journalists. Whether he wants to leave his well-compensated role at New York is another question. GQ, a Cond\u00e9 Nast property, has thrived thanks to its longtime editor, Jim Nelson, who has run the magazine since 2003. Known for throwing lavish retreats catered by hip mixologists, Mr. Nelson has the loyalty of his staff. But in an industry stocked with celebrity editors, he remains curiously obscure, keeping a lower profile than peers like Mr. Carter, Ms. Wintour, and David Remnick of The New Yorker. Cond\u00e9 Nast leadership trusts him, but can Mr. Nelson hold court poolside in Cannes and air-kiss Jennifer Lawrence at the Oscars? It\u2019s harder than it looks.A prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Ms. Wintour, she has experience leading a big publication, editing T Magazine at The New York Times for two years before returning to Vogue as creative digital director. Installing Ms. Singer at Vanity Fair would give Ms. Wintour a loyalist at one of Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s biggest titles. The former editor of Cosmopolitan, Ms. Coles has consolidated power at Hearst Magazines, where she is now chief content officer. Her board seat on Snapchat makes for a neat digital bona fide. But she may be more interested in building an empire, Anna Wintour-style, at Hearst, rather than leave to run a single title.A former digital guru at Time Inc., Mr. Tyrangiel turned Bloomberg Businessweek into an award-winning must-read. Now he runs Vice\u2019s millennial-focused news series on HBO. But the show has struggled to gain traction, and Mr. Tyrangiel may seek greener pastures elsewhere. He has relationships in Hollywood and on Wall Street; advertisers like him, too.

{"Headline": "A Funeral of 2 Friends: C.I.A. Deaths Rise in Secret Afghan War", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "The number of C.I.A. deaths in Afghanistan rivals those killed in the Southeast Asia conflicts of nearly a half-century ago.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On a sweltering day earlier this summer, operatives with the Central Intelligence Agency gathered at Arlington National Cemetery to bury two of their own. Brian Ray Hoke and Nathaniel Patrick Delemarre, elite gunslingers who worked for the C.I.A.\u2019s paramilitary force, were laid to rest after a firefight with Islamic State militants near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan.There had been scant mention of Mr. Hoke\u2019s death in local news reports in Leesburg, Va., his home, and nothing at all about Mr. Delemarre in news accounts in the Florida Panhandle, where his family lives. Their deaths this past October were never acknowledged by the C.I.A., beyond two memorial stars chiseled in a marble wall at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va.Today there are at least 18 stars on that wall representing the number of C.I.A. personnel killed in Afghanistan \u2014 a tally that has not been previously reported, and one that rivals the number of C.I.A. operatives killed in the wars in Vietnam and Laos nearly a half century ago.The deaths are a reflection of the heavy price the agency has paid in a secret, nearly 16-year-old war, where thousands of C.I.A. operatives have served since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The deaths of Mr. Hoke, 42, and Mr. Delemarre, 47, show how the C.I.A. continues to move from traditional espionage to the front lines, and underscore the pressure the agency faces now that President Trump has pledged to keep the United States in Afghanistan with no end in sight.\u201cWe are going to be fighting this war for a very long time,\u201d said Ken Stiles, a former C.I.A. counterterrorism analyst who worked closely with paramilitary officers in Afghanistan and who lost three friends in the war.Mr. Hoke grew up in South Dakota, played violin and football in high school, graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a degree in oceanography and in 1997 passed the grueling test to become a member of the Navy SEALs. He was deployed to the Middle East and Europe, and in 2004 joined the C.I.A.At the agency\u2019s training facility in Virginia, known as the Farm, Mr. Hoke learned how to recruit and handle spies and the art of crafting secret messages. He stood out, a classmate recalled, as among the best in the class. Mr. Hoke moved on to the agency\u2019s advanced training course, held at a secret location in the southeastern United States, and was soon part of the agency\u2019s paramilitary arm, the Special Activities Division.Like Mr. Hoke, many of those in the Special Activities Division came from the SEALs, the Army\u2019s Delta Force and other elite military units.During his 12 years in the C.I.A., Mr. Hoke played the role of both commando and spy. He deployed to Iraq and other hot spots but also posed as a foreign service officer \u2014 the agency\u2019s typical cover for a covert officer \u2014 in Greece and Denmark. The agency had Mr. Hoke serve outside war zones to broaden his experiences, friends said.Mr. Hoke, like his colleagues, knew there were great risks. In a desk drawer at home in Leesburg, he kept a clipping of a newspaper article about another C.I.A. operative, Maj. Douglas A. Zembiec, a Marine officer and fellow Naval Academy graduate known as the \u201cLion of Falluja,\u201d who was killed in Iraq in 2007.In 2008, Mr. Hoke was deployed in Afghanistan when he was called on to reinforce a group of C.I.A. operatives who had been ambushed by the Taliban. One of the operatives, Donald Barger, 40, a former Ranger and Green Beret who earned the Bronze Star, was dead by the time Mr. Hoke arrived at the scene, former agency officers said.Friends say that Mr. Hoke turned to painting to help decompress after his tours.In an email exchange, Mr. Hoke\u2019s wife, Christy, described her husband as \u201cthe kind of person movies are made about, as are most of his colleagues. Unbelievable human beings.\u201d\u201cHe lived by a code that I will not break for anything. Even writing this email feels like a small betrayal,\u201d she said.Mr. Hoke left behind three children.Little is known about Mr. Delemarre\u2019s service in the C.I.A. According to military records, he spent roughly a dozen years as a radio operator in the Marine Reserves, where he was a lance corporal. Friends willing to talk about him said he joined the C.I.A. after the Sept. 11 attacks and later shifted to the Navy Reserves \u2014 a commitment he maintained while also working at the spy agency \u2014 where he became a commissioned officer.Mr. Delemarre\u2019s wife declined to be interviewed. He left behind two daughters.Since 2001, as thousands of C.I.A. officers and contractors have cycled in and out of Afghanistan targeting terrorists and running sources, operatives from the Special Activities Division have been part of some of the most dangerous missions. Over all, the division numbers in the low hundreds and also operates in Somalia, Iraq, the Philippines and other areas of conflict.C.I.A. paramilitary officers from the division were the first Americans in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks, and they later spirited Hamid Karzai, the future president, into the country. Greg Vogle, an agency operative who took Mr. Karzai into Afghanistan, went on to run the paramilitary division and became the top spy at the C.I.A.The first American killed in the country, Johnny Micheal Spann, was a C.I.A. officer assigned to the Special Activities Division. He died in November 2001 during a prison uprising.In the years since, paramilitary officers from the Special Activities Division have trained and advised a small army of Afghan militias known as counterterrorism pursuit teams. The militias took on greater importance under President Barack Obama, who embraced covert operations because of their small footprint and deniability.In 2009, in the worst loss for the agency in Afghanistan, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives vest and killed seven C.I.A. employees \u2014 none were from the Special Activities Division \u2014 at a forward operating base in Khost, on the Pakistan border.The slush fund, which was exposed in 2013, was seen by many American diplomats and other officials and experts as fueling the rampant corruption that has undermined the American effort to build a functioning democracy in Afghanistan.On Oct. 21, 2016, Mr. Hoke and Mr. Delemarre were shot in an assault on an Islamic State compound in Jalalabad, where the militant group has made inroads in recent years.Details are sparse. Friends say that as Mr. Hoke made his way around a wall, a militant shot him. Mr. Hoke radioed that he was down, Mr. Delemarre heard his close friend\u2019s voice, left his position of safety and ran to Mr. Hoke\u2019s aid, but Mr. Hoke soon died. Mr. Delemarre was wounded in his attempt to help and was evacuated to Germany, where he died shortly after his wife arrived.The two were awarded stars at the C.I.A. in May, when the agency held its annual memorial for officers who died in the line of duty. A third C.I.A. paramilitary officer, George A. Whitney, 38, who was killed in December in the Jalalabad area, also received a star. As a Marine captain, Mr. Whitney served with the Third Marine Reconnaissance Battalion in Anbar province in Iraq. Relatives of Mr. Whitney, who studied classics and played fullback on the football team at Bates College in Maine, declined to comment.Other C.I.A. operatives killed in Afghanistan since 2001 include Dario Lorenzetti, a West Point graduate and former Ranger, who died in 2012 after a member of the Afghan intelligence service detonated a suicide vest in an insider attack; Jay Henigan, 61, a contractor and plumber who was gunned down in Kabul in 2011 during an attack; a pair of paramilitary officers killed in 2003 while tracking terrorists in southeastern Afghanistan; and Nathan Ross Chapman, a Green Beret who was detailed to a C.I.A. paramilitary team in Afghanistan when he was shot to death hunting Al Qaeda in January 2002.The seven C.I.A. employees killed by a suicide bomber in 2009 in Khost were at Forward Operating Base Chapman, which had been named for him.The ranks of C.I.A. operatives aren\u2019t easily replaced, said Mr. Stiles, the former counterterrorism analyst.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the challenges for the government,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we maintain the level of experience and expertise in a war that is going to last for another 20 or 30 years or longer?\u201dAt the Arlington funeral of Mr. Hoke and Mr. Delemarre on July 14 \u2014 long delays before interment are common \u2014 heavily muscled men with beards and sunglasses sweated through their suit jackets as a Navy honor guard played taps and performed a rifle salute. Mr. Vogle, the C.I.A. operative who took Mr. Karzai into Afghanistan, stood among the mourners.A program from the service shows a smiling Mr. Hoke in a tuxedo and a grinning Mr. Delemarre on the beach. On the back of the program is a quote from Adm. Chester W. Nimitz: \u201cThey fought together as brothers in arms; they died together and now they sleep side by side.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Thursday about deaths of C.I.A. paramilitary operatives in Afghanistan referred incorrectly to the location where Brian R. Hoke, one of the operatives killed, grew up. As the article correctly noted, he grew up in South Dakota, but not in the town of Park River.

{"Headline": "Why a World-Famous Art Exhibition Needed a Government Bailout", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Debt was one of the core themes of the 14th edition of Documenta, the sprawling German exhibition of contemporary art that takes place every five years in the city of Kassel. The failure of this year\u2019s show to balance its own books may be one of its enduring legacies.The exhibition, which closed Sunday, was divided between two cities \u2014 Kassel and Athens \u2014 in part to draw attention to the failures of the capitalist system that led to Greece\u2019s near-default on its debt in 2010. Bankruptcy there was averted by bailouts worth hundreds of billions, and Greece was plunged into a devastating economic crisis, from which it is only now emerging.The city of Kassel and the state of Hesse, which are both shareholders in the company, then stepped in to cover the deficit with loan guarantees, according to the newspaper.\u201cAs shareholders, the city of Kassel and the state of Hesse have agreed that the company\u2019s liquidity must be secured beyond that,\u201d Mr. Geselle said in a statement. \u201cDocumenta is inextricably linked with Kassel.\u201dJust how much the cost of the exhibition escalated and exactly who is at fault remain matters of robust debate. The artistic director of the exhibition, Adam Szymczyk, said in an interview that its economic plan was created before he was appointed, that it had not been sufficiently adapted to take account of the double-venue costs and that his team had been forced to work \u201cunder terrible budget constraints.\u201d\u201cWhat is happening now is an attempt to make this a problem exhibition because of some financing issues at the end,\u201d Mr. Szymczyk said.Founded in 1955, the quinquennial \u201cmuseum of 100 days\u201d transforms working-class Kassel \u2014 which brands itself \u201cDocumenta City\u201d \u2014 into a cosmopolitan hub of creative activity and brings in welcome tourism revenue. Often described as the most important art exhibition in the world, Documenta is seen as a bellwether for the relevance and direction of art internationally. It is conceived as an exhibition that takes risks, and in recent days its organizers have used strong language to suggest that its high-concept ambitions were being leadened by government leaders too focused on the bottom line.This year\u2019s extravaganza ran from April to July in Athens and from June to September in Kassel. It included works by 160 artists, most of whom were unknown and were featured in both cities. Conceived to \u201cmirror, witness and fiercely comment on its time\u201d \u2014 in the words of Mr. Szymczyk \u2014 its themes encompassed debt crises, migration, war and the rise of right-wing populism.The budget agreed for Documenta 14 was 37 million euros (nearly $50 million) \u2014 half to be financed by Hesse, Kassel and the German federal government and the other half to be raised by Documenta from ticket and merchandise sales and sponsors.Reporting by Hessische Nieders\u00e4chsische Allgemeine has faulted management miscalculations for the budget overshoot, including what it said was an inability to prepare for soaring electric bills to air-condition spaces in superhot Athens.\u201cUnfortunately, politicians have prompted the media upheaval by disseminating an image of imminent bankruptcy of Documenta and at the same time presented themselves as the \u2018saviors\u2019 of a crisis they themselves allowed to develop,\u201d a Sept. 14 statement from the curatorial team said.Mr. Szymczyk\u2019s decision to stage Documenta in Kassel and Athens faced what he described in an essay in the catalog as \u201cpre-emptive and at times disheartening critique\u201d from the start.The Kassel branch of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union had campaigned against the double-venue plan in local elections last year, seeing the Athens offshoot \u2014 particularly that the exhibition opened there \u2014 as a threat to Kassel\u2019s identity as Documenta\u2019s home.Norbert Wett, a local C.D.U. politician who is running for Parliament in the national elections later this month, said that it was a mistake to take the focus of the exhibition off Kassel, whose taxpayers are helping to pay the bills and that it had been \u201cpredictable\u201d that the budget would be inadequate.\u201cWe would like to know where the money went,\u201d Mr. Wett said in an interview.Mr. Szymczyk criticized Documenta\u2019s reliance on increased attendance to help underwrite each edition and noted that the Kassel part of this year\u2019s show had surpassed what he called the \u201calready insane\u201d 2012 figure of 850,000 visitors, while Athens \u2014 which was mostly free of admission charges \u2014 had drawn 330,000.\u201cIt is good to be democratic and art is for everyone, but the capacity of the infrastructure is an issue,\u201d he said.Mr. Szymczyk said he was concerned that the political establishment would use Documenta\u2019s financial woes \u201cas a punitive instrument against the exhibition itself,\u201d reaching the point where \u201cno crazy ideas are possible anymore.\u201d His curatorial team\u2019s statement went a step further, accusing authorities of conducting what amounts to a \u201cpolitical takeover of Documenta.\u201d It criticized the authorities for asking, as the statement put it, \u201ca public cultural institution to become primarily an economic institution subject to the demands of profit and success.\u201dThis anti-establishment tongue-lashing may not go down well with the public backers of the show. Lawmakers in Kassel are scheduled to meet on Monday \u2014 the day after the national election \u2014 and will need to approve any cash injection proposed by the mayor.The mayor, Mr. Geselle, said as the event closed that the exhibition had \u201creached its financial and structural limits\u201d and that its organizational structure must be rethought. He pledged to uphold the artistic freedom of curator but stressed \u201cthe limits of that freedom are at the point where Documenta jeopardizes its own future.\u201dThe show has a long tradition of making political statements; its first edition in 1955 marked Germany\u2019s re-entry into international artistic dialogue after World War II, with a presentation of art once banned and defamed by the Nazis as \u201cdegenerate.\u201d Its reputation rests on its record of granting maximum freedom to the curatorial team and of pushing artistic and ideological boundaries.This time the financial boundaries were pushed, too.Jason Farago contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Offers a Selective View of Sovereignty in U.N. Speech", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Trump, in declaring Tuesday that sovereignty should be the guiding principle of affairs between nations, sketched out a radically different vision of the world order than his forebears, who founded the United Nations after World War II to deal collectively with problems they believed would transcend borders.But more important than how he defined sovereignty was Mr. Trump\u2019s adoption of the word itself \u2014 language more familiar to small countries, guarding themselves against the incursions of larger neighbors or defying the judgments of a global elite, than to a superpower that fashioned a web of global institutions to enshrine its national interests.\u201cI will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first,\u201d Mr. Trump declared to a smattering of applause from an audience that included gimlet-eyed diplomats from some of the countries he criticized.\u201cAs long as I hold this office, I will defend America\u2019s interest above all else,\u201d the president declared.But it was more remarkable for how Mr. Trump departed from decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus. Even if they fell short, American presidents have generally staked out a global role for the United States in confronting the world\u2019s problems.Mr. Trump, by contrast, used the words sovereign or sovereignty 21 times. \u201cOur success,\u201d he said, \u201cdepends on a coalition of strong, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.\u201dStrong, sovereign nations, he said, keep their citizens safe and enable them to prosper economically. Strong, sovereign nations, he said, can join together to fight common threats and constitute the irreducible building blocks of world institutions like the United Nations.Mr. Trump is hardly the first leader to invoke sovereignty as a credo. Its roots go back to Roman times. It has been elaborated in agreements like the Peace of Westphalia, which gave rise to the principle of noninterference in a country\u2019s internal affairs. And it has been litigated through 20th-century upheavals like the Communist revolution in China.Yet some foreign-policy experts said Mr. Trump\u2019s definition was problematic because he applied it inconsistently.That did not stop him from railing against the policies of his three major nemeses. North Korea, he said, starved and tortured its people, and had ordered the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of its tyrannical ruler, Kim Jong-un. Iran\u2019s regime had transformed a proud nation into an \u201ceconomically depleted rogue state.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, had stolen power and left his people in poverty and misery.All three, he warned, could feel the full fury of American might, going so far as to say that if the United States were forced to defend itself, \u201cwe will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\u201d\u201cThe Iranian regime\u2019s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its finance,\u201d he said, before singling out Saudi Arabia for praise.Mr. Trump did take China to task for its reluctance to do more to curb its neighbor, North Korea. \u201cIt is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict,\u201d he said.Some analysts played down the inconsistency in Mr. Trump\u2019s approach, saying it was a recurring feature of American foreign policy, under presidents from both political parties, because the nation\u2019s values and strategic interests do not always align.\u201cHis specific comments about Venezuela, Cuba, and Iran indicate he does not believe the concept of sovereignty immunizes them from criticism or endless abuse of their citizens,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who served as a senior diplomat and policy-maker under Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush.Mr. Abrams said he believed the president \u201csquared the circle\u201d by linking the concept of sovereignty with a coalition of successful sovereign states. Such a coalition, he said, could act together to confront threats like North Korea\u2019s nuclear program under the banner of the U.N.The president, he said, was also obviously still grappling with how to deal with the concept of human rights. Though Mr. Trump spoke broadly about freedom, he never explicitly referred to individual rights.\u201cHow does the promotion of freedom fit in?\u201d Mr. Abrams said. \u201cI still don\u2019t think we know the answer to that.\u201dA news analysis article on Wednesday about President Trump\u2019s speech at the United Nations General Assembly described incorrectly Elliott Abrams\u2019s work during the George W. Bush administration. He was a senior diplomat and policy maker under Presidents Reagan and Bush, but not a senior State Department official under Mr. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Columbia Proposes Ban on Corporate and Union Donations in Elections", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER \u2014 The government of British Columbia introduced legislation on Monday to ban corporate and union donations as part of a broad effort to tighten the reins on political contributions in provincial elections, remove outside influence and erase the province\u2019s reputation as the \u201cwild west\u201d of Canadian political financing.The legislation also limits individual donations to 1,200 Canadian dollars per year, about $980, the second-lowest limit in Canada behind Quebec, and bars donations from foreigners and nonresidents of the province, while capping donations to third-party election advertisers.It also requires public reporting of all fund-raisers attended by major party leaders, cabinet ministers and other officials, including for events in private homes.\u201cToday we\u2019re getting big money out of politics and ending the wild west of campaign financing,\u201d Premier John Horgan said at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s time our elections were decided by voters, not by those with the most money,\u201d he added.A campaign finance overhaul was a major promise of the New Democratic Party, which won leadership of the far-western province\u2019s new government in May.The measures must be voted on by provincial lawmakers but are expected to be enacted because they are a product of a deal between the N.D.P. and the Green Party, which together have a majority of votes in the legislature.The legislation is expected to dramatically reshape the political landscape in British Columbia, which for decades allowed unlimited corporate, union and foreign donations, and permitted its premier to pocket tens of thousands of dollars annually in the form of a stipend from pooled party contributions.Such practices are prohibited almost everywhere else in Canada, including at the federal level.\u201cThis legislation will make sure 2017 was the last big-money election in our province,\u201d said David Eby, the province\u2019s attorney general. \u201cThe days of limitless donations, a lack of transparency and foreign and corporate influence over our elections are history.\u201dIn the months leading up to the May provincial election, campaign financing became a major issue, with critics saying the government, then led by Premier Christy Clark and the conservative British Columbia Liberal Party, had been usurped by deep-pocketed donors and become plagued by conflicts of interest.Mr. Eby estimated that the new finance rules would eliminate around 65 million Canadian dollars in corporate and union donations over the next four years, around $53 million.The legislation will be retroactive, prohibiting political parties from using donations they have already received in future elections. The government plans to begin an allowance of public subsidies, which will be phased out over five years, to help parties transition to the new system.After the legislation was introduced, some civic groups said they were optimistic that the new rules would help remove outside political influence in the province.\u201cThis is going to make British Columbians the most important ingredient in B.C.\u2019s democracy, not board room or union checks,\u201d said Dermod Travis, the executive director of IntegrityBC, a nonpartisan political watchdog group based in Victoria, the provincial capital.Other groups took issue with aspects of the legislation. Duff Conacher, a founder of Democracy Watch, a Canadian civic organization, criticized individual donation limit of 1,200 Canadian dollar as too high, saying it would continue to let wealthy donors influence parties and politicians while allowing businesses and unions to funnel donations through executives, employees and their relatives.\u201cIt won\u2019t stop big money in B.C. politics,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Conacher said. \u201cIt will just hide it.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about efforts to ban corporate and union donations in provincial elections in British Columbia, Canada, misstated the amount of money raised by the British Columbia Liberal Party in 2016. The party raised 13.1 million Canadian dollars, not just 13.1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voter Fraud? A Trump Nominee Looks as if He Cast an Illegal Ballot", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump\u2019s voter integrity commission looks under rocks for possible voter malfeasance, its members might want to examine a presidential nominee awaiting confirmation by the Senate Finance Committee.Documents indicate that Jeffrey Gerrish, the president\u2019s pick to be a deputy United States Trade Representative, moved from Virginia to Maryland last year, but opted in November to vote in the more competitive state of Virginia than his bright blue new home.The Senate Finance Committee, which has been considering Mr. Gerrish\u2019s nomination, was briefed on the matter on Tuesday, including the fact that Mr. Gerrish had almost certainly voted illegally, according to three Democratic congressional aides familiar with the briefing. Public records back up that notion.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s intense focus on alleged widespread voter fraud in last year\u2019s election \u2014 the president has claimed that millions of people voted illegally, without evidence \u2014 Democrats are likely to pounce on the misstep to try to sink Mr. Gerrish\u2019s nomination.Julia Lawless, a spokeswoman for the committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said she could not comment on Mr. Gerrish\u2019s voting history, but that the committee would continue to examine his record.\u201cMr. Gerrish is continuing to undergo the same bipartisan vetting process that every nominee before the Senate Finance Committee does,\u201d Ms. Lawless said. \u201cGiven that this process is still underway, we are unable to discuss specific details in his file.\u201dMr. Gerrish could not immediately be reached for comment.Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, said on Wednesday that he stood by Mr. Gerrish, noting his long record as an international trade lawyer.\u201cHe is one of the foremost experts on U.S. trade law and policy and is pre-eminently qualified for this position,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.Mr. Gerrish\u2019s move does not appear to have fallen in that grace period. Records show that he sold a Fairfax, Va., home in July 2016 and purchased a home in Montgomery County, Md., just across the state line, the same month. Mr. Gerrish did not register to vote in Maryland until February of this year, according to state records.A Trump administration official, who asked for anonymity to discuss the case in detail, said that Mr. Gerrish had a Virginia driver\u2019s license at the time of the election and was under the impression that the state granted a longer grace period for former residents. He had lived there for more than a decade before moving, the official said.Studies consistently show that illegal voting is extremely rare.Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Gerrish to be deputy United States Trade Representative for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and industrial competitiveness in June. He worked alongside Mr. Lighthizer, who has been the United States Trade Representative since May, at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a prominent New York-based law firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say It\u2019s Gone Too Far", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "After revelations of harassment and bias in Silicon Valley, a backlash is growing against the women in tech movement.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Their complaints flow on Reddit forums, on video game message boards, on private Facebook pages and across Twitter. They argue for everything from male separatism to an end to gender diversity efforts.Silicon Valley has for years accommodated a fringe element of men who say women are ruining the tech world.One of those who said there had been a change is James Altizer, an engineer at the chip maker Nvidia. Mr. Altizer, 52, said he had realized a few years ago that feminists in Silicon Valley had formed a cabal whose goal was to subjugate men. At the time, he said, he was one of the few with that view.Now Mr. Altizer said he was less alone. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few people going through that in Silicon Valley right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploding. It\u2019s mostly young men, younger than me.\u201dMr. Altizer said that a gathering he hosts in person and online to discuss men\u2019s issues had grown by a few dozen members this year to more than 200, that the private Facebook pages he frequents on men\u2019s rights were gaining new members and that a radical subculture calling for total male separatism was emerging.\u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d he said in a phone interview, contending men are being fired by \u201cdangerous\u201d human resources departments. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a soundproof booth right now because I\u2019m afraid someone will hear me. When you\u2019re discussing gender issues, it\u2019s almost religious, the response. It\u2019s almost zealotry.\u201dMr. Altizer is part of a backlash against the women in technology movement. While many in the tech industry had previously dismissed the fringe men\u2019s rights arguments, some investors, executives and engineers are now listening. Though studies and surveys show there is no denying the travails women face in the male-dominated industry, some said that the line for what counted as harassment had become too easy to cross and that the push for gender parity was too extreme a goal. Few were willing to talk openly about their thinking, for fear of standing out in largely progressive Silicon Valley.Even so, \u201cwitch hunt\u201d is the new whispered meme. Some in tech have started identifying as \u201ccontrarians,\u201d to indicate subtly that they do not follow the \u201cdiversity dogma.\u201d And self-described men\u2019s rights activists in Silicon Valley said their numbers at meetings were rising.Others are playing down the women-in-tech issue. Onstage at a recent event, the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said harassment in Silicon Valley was \u201crarer than in most other businesses.\u201dMany men now feel like \u201cthere\u2019s a gun to the head\u201d to be better about gender issues, said Rebecca Lynn, a venture capitalist at Canvas Ventures, and while \u201cthere\u2019s a high awareness right now, which is positive, at the same time there\u2019s a fear.\u201d\u201cIn just the last 48 hours, I\u2019ve spoken to a female tech executive who was grabbed by a male C.E.O. at a large event and another female executive who was asked to interview at a venture fund because they \u2018feel like they need to hire a woman,\u2019\u201d said Dick Costolo, the former chief of Twitter, who now runs the fitness start-up Chorus. \u201cWe should worry about whether the women-in-tech movement has gone too far sometime after a couple of these aren\u2019t regularly happening anymore.\u201dAfter months of apologizing by Silicon Valley for bad behavior, here was a young man whom some in tech\u2019s leadership could potentially get behind.Paul Graham, who founded an influential start-up incubator, Y Combinator, posted two articles about how the science behind Mr. Damore\u2019s memo was accurate. Another start-up investor, John Durant, wrote that \u201cCharles Darwin himself would be fired from Google for his views on the sexes.\u201dAnd the investor Peter Thiel\u2019s business partner, Eric Weinstein, tweeted, \u201cDear @Google, Stop teaching my girl that her path to financial freedom lies not in coding but in complaining to HR.\u201dMr. Durant declined to comment. Mr. Graham said in an email that there needed to be more distinction between fact and policy, and Mr. Weinstein said there was \u201ca sea of brilliant women\u201d and that more needed to be done to \u201cfigure out how to more fully empower them.\u201dNow men\u2019s rights advocates in Silicon Valley have galvanized.\u201cWhat Google did was wake up sectors of society that weren\u2019t into these issues before,\u201d said Paul Elam, who runs A Voice for Men, a men\u2019s rights group. He said his organization had seen more interest from people in Silicon Valley.Silicon Valley has always been a men\u2019s space, others said. Warren Farrell, who lives in Marin County, Calif., and whose 1993 book, \u201cThe Myth of Male Power,\u201d birthed the modern men\u2019s rights movement, said, \u201cThe less safe the environment is for men, the more they will seek little pods of safety like the tech world.\u201dThis turn in the gender conversation is good news for Mr. Damore. \u201cThe emperor is naked,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSince someone said it, now it\u2019s become sort of acceptable.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe whole idea that diversity improves workplace output, it\u2019s not scientifically decided that that\u2019s true.\u201dMr. Damore filed a labor complaint against Google in August and said more than 20 people had reached out about joining together for a class-action suit about systemic discrimination against men. He is represented by Harmeet Dhillon, a local firebrand lawyer.\u201cIt\u2019s become fashionable in Silicon Valley for people like James, a white man, to be put into a category of less desirable for promotion and advancement,\u201d Ms. Dhillon said. \u201cSome companies have hiring goals like \u2018We\u2019ll give you a bonus if you\u2019re a hiring manager and you hire 70 percent women to this organization.\u2019 That\u2019s illegal.\u201dGoogle declined to comment.\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a mission from God to set the world straight, it\u2019s easy to go too far,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cThere was no control over women hiring women.\u201dHe said that his clients, Greg Anderson and Scott Ard, had faced gender discrimination in Yahoo\u2019s media teams and that other teams like cars were headed by women, which to Mr. Parsons was a sign of problems.\u201cNo eyebrows are going to rise if a woman heads up fashion,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cBut we\u2019re talking about women staffing positions \u2014 things like autos \u2014 where it cannot be explained other than manipulation.\u201dThose leading Silicon Valley\u2019s gender equality push said they were astonished that just as the movement was having an impact, it opened up an even more radical men\u2019s rights perspective.\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Joelle Emerson, who runs Paradigm, a company that designs diversity strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s created divides that I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201dCassie Jaye, who lives in Marin County and made a documentary about the men\u2019s rights movement called \u201cThe Red Pill,\u201d said that the tech world and the men\u2019s rights community had \u201csnowballed\u201d together and that the rise in the number of people in Mgtow is new.On the Mgtow message boards, members discuss work (\u201cEver work for a woman? Roll up your sleeves and share your horror story\u201d), technology (\u201cThe stuff girlfriends and wives can\u2019t stand \u2014 computers, games, consoles\u201d) and dating (mostly best practices to avoid commitment).\u201cI think there are a lot of guys living this lifestyle without naming it, and then they find Mgtow,\u201d said Ms. Jaye, who calls herself a former feminist.Mr. Altizer leads Bay Area Fathers\u2019 Rights, a monthly support group for men to talk about the issues they uniquely face. He became interested in the community after a divorce and said his eyes were opened to how few rights men have. As for the numbers of women in tech, the effort for parity is absurd, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve been on the hiring side for years,\u201d Mr. Altizer said, adding that he is not currently hiring people. \u201cIt would be nice to have women, but you cannot find applicants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico May Get Help from Unlikely Source: Its Lenders", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter wondering for seven sweltering days who would pay to rebuild their ruined electrical grid, Puerto Ricans got a possible answer from an unexpected source on Wednesday: investors holding the island power company\u2019s defaulted bonds.The bondholders, a group that includes mutual-fund giants and hedge funds, have offered to lend Puerto Rico $1 billion to pay for urgent repairs and to cancel $150 million of the power company\u2019s outstanding debt in the process.Because of how it is structured, the proposal by the bondholders could help them even as it helps Puerto Rico.The loan would not be enough to replace the island\u2019s aged electrical system, which was knocked out by Hurricane Maria, leaving more than three million people without power and, in some cases, water.But the bondholders say that in addition to covering immediate repairs, their offer would allow Puerto Rico to apply for federal grants for long-term rebuilding that would not have to be repaid.Various federal agencies offer such grants after natural disasters, but require recipients to put up a share of a project\u2019s cost, usually 25 percent. The Federal Emergency Management Agency typically coordinates such grants.Puerto Rico\u2019s power company, known as Prepa, was insolvent even before the hurricane hit and would have a hard time producing such upfront money on its own.\u201cThis capital commitment will provide bridge financing and matching funds as required by FEMA legislation,\u201d said Stephen Spencer, a managing director at the investment bank Houlihan Lokey who is the bondholder group\u2019s financial adviser in Puerto Rico\u2019s bankruptcy case.Mr. Spencer said the package offered by his group, which includes Franklin Templeton, Knighthead Capital Management and OppenheimerFunds, would qualify Prepa for at least $3 billion in federal grants, and possibly as much as $9 billion.The potential benefits for the bondholders are tied to the package being offered as debtor-in-possession financing, which is normally used to keep bankrupt corporations afloat during Chapter 11 cases.Debtor-in-possession financing requires court approval because it increases a bankrupt party\u2019s total insolvency. Parties that extend such financing typically jump to the top of the creditors list in a bankruptcy, notable given that some of Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors are fighting one another over where they rank on that list.Not only would the bondholders\u2019 loan take priority over some of Puerto Rico\u2019s other debts, but it would also offset some losses the bondholders may face if the original debt were not repaid in full.In a statement, Natalie Jaresko, the executive director of the federal board overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s finances, said: \u201cWe welcome and appreciate the expression of support from creditors. The board will carefully consider all proposals in coordination with the government.\u201dWith about $9 billion in outstanding debt, Prepa is among the most troubled branches of a Puerto Rican government saddled with around $74 billion in total debt, mostly in municipal bonds. Prepa declared itself insolvent in 2014 and stopped making debt payments, leading bondholders to start negotiations to slow the original repayment schedule.Many Puerto Ricans now associate Prepa with corruption, abuse and a $9 billion debt they believe they should not have to repay.Under the terms of the $1 billion loan being offered by bondholders, Puerto Rico would not have to make principal or interest payments for two years. During that time, interest would accumulate at a variable rate starting at about 5.5 percent and following market rates up or down. The bondholders also offer not to charge an early payment penalty should Puerto Rico find a better deal after accepting the loan.The $150 million in canceled debt would come via an arrangement known as a roll-up, in which participating bondholders would exchange $1 billion of outstanding defaulted bonds for new, viable bonds with a face value of $850 million.The deal would have to be approved by both the Puerto Rican government and Judge Laura Taylor Swain of Federal District Court in New York, who is presiding over Puerto Rico\u2019s case.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s no professional sports.\u201dThe California State University, Fresno campus is situated more than 150 miles from both of California\u2019s main professional sports hubs, Los Angeles and the Bay Area.As a result, residents tend to adhere to a patchwork of allegiances to the Raiders, Giants, Dodgers and other teams.\u201cBut those are all kind of secondary,\u201d said Paul Loeffler, a sports broadcaster in Fresno.The Bulldogs, he said, \u201creally are the focal point not just for the Fresno community, but this whole San Joaquin Valley region.\u201dSupporters have had plenty to cheer about in the past as the relatively small program in the Mountain West Conference managed to attract outsize talent.Lately, however, the Bulldogs football squad has been slumping.

{"Headline": "How Two Sentences in Tax Plan May Help Unleash $1 Billion in Lobbying", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The sweeping tax rewrite unveiled by President Trump and Republican lawmakers this past week leaves many of the details to Congress, but two sentences in the nine-page framework have Washington lobbyists salivating over a payday that some industry experts predict could top $1 billion.Tucked away on Page 8, the sentences refer vaguely to plans to repeal or roll back \u201cnumerous\u201d exclusions and deductions, and to \u201cmodernize\u201d tax rules affecting specific industries \u201cto ensure that the tax code better reflects economic reality and that such rules provide little opportunity for tax avoidance.\u201dAnd those fears are being stoked by lobbyists, who are urging clients and prospective clients to get out in front of any changes that could eliminate or weaken sections of the tax code that benefit them.\u201cYou\u2019re either going to be at the table, or you\u2019re going to be on the table,\u201d said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former Republican congressman from New York who served on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and is now a lobbyist at Holland & Knight focusing on tax issues. Most businesses that could be affected by the tax overhaul \u201cwill not have to be encouraged to engage,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said.\u201cEverybody is beginning to pay attention, and there is going to be a flurry of people looking for representation,\u201d he added.\u201cPeople have been expecting this all year. But the feeling that specific provisions could be put in play is now more real, and all of those provisions have a constituency and a lobbyist,\u201d said Randolf H. Hardock, a tax lobbyist at Davis & Harman. \u201cSome of it is just keeping clients informed, even if they don\u2019t ultimately engage, because there are issues that could come up right at the end, where if you\u2019re not paying attention, you could miss them.\u201dLobbying has expanded and evolved drastically since then: It\u2019s now a $3 billion industry with a sophisticated war-room approach that goes beyond simply buttonholing lawmakers to include comprehensive marketing and pressure campaigns.Those costly campaigns can pay off, as they did for those fighting a proposed tax on imports championed by many Republicans, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. A coalition of major retailers such as Wal-Mart, retail trade associations and manufacturers including Koch Industries banded together earlier this year with the single goal of killing the so-called border adjustment tax.But while the tax on imports was a clear target, the paucity of details in the new blueprint has created anxiety in corporate suites across the country, despite the overwhelming support in the business community for its proposed reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Lobbyists are potentially facing two rounds of business-development opportunities: one in which they capitalize on the fear of getting attacked, and another when specific industries come under attack.Meanwhile, the details revealed so far are creating fissures within industries, such as real estate, as trade groups battle one another in an effort to strip out or protect various provisions under consideration.The National Association of Realtors is already out in force, criticizing aspects of the plan as dealing a devastating blow to the housing market and United States economy. While the framework specifically protects the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents say the proposal to double the standard deduction and eliminate the state and local tax deduction would make buying a home less valuable.The National Association of Home Builders, by contrast, has come out in favor of the framework, saying the lower corporate tax rate, a new 25 percent tax rate for \u201cpass through\u201d businesses, and protection of the low-income housing tax credit will help builders, whose businesses benefit from both renters and home buyers.\u201cBy lowering the pass-through rate, the plan will reduce the tax bill of thousands of small businesses and help to spur job and economic growth,\u201d the chairman of the home builders association, Granger MacDonald, said in a statement. \u201cMore importantly, the blueprint maintains the low-income housing tax credit, the most indispensable tool to help produce affordable rental housing.\u201dMeredith McGehee, the chief of policy at Issue One, a nonprofit group that works to reduce the influence of deep-pocketed special interests in politics and government, said that \u201cthe estimate of $1 billion in lobbying expenditures is probably conservative.\u201dMs. McGehee, who has been both tracking lobbying and actually lobbying since 1987, predicted that many of the efforts to influence the details of the tax overhaul would not be disclosed under congressional lobbying rules because they would fall outside the scope of the direct contacts with federal government officials that prompt disclosure requirements.Several tax lobbyists said businesses and trade groups concerned about whether they could be in jeopardy as the plan develops should look to a tax reform bill released in 2014 by the House Ways and Means Committee under its then-chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, a Republican who retired in 2015. That bill proposed ending all manner of loopholes and credits, including for insurance companies and research and experimentation.\u201cYou have to be out there working to make the case now, because everybody knows what the menu includes,\u201d said James Gould, a tax lobbyist who worked as a Senate tax aide during the 1986 reform effort.But Mr. Hardock said there might be some benefit in trying to stay out of the debate for companies or trade groups in industries that aren\u2019t being openly discussed as targets for revenue generation.\u201cThere are some industries that probably don\u2019t want to put their heads too far up, because that might draw unwelcome notice,\u201d he said.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bike-Sharing Brings Out Bad Manners, China Asks, What\u2019s Wrong With Us?", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Liu Lijing, a mechanic in Beijing, does not usually pay much attention to manners. He does not mind when people blast loud music, and he strolls the alleyways near his home in a tank top stained with grease. But when a stranger recently ditched a bicycle in the bushes outside his door, Mr. Liu was irate.Start-ups have flooded the city with shared bikes, he complained, and people have been leaving them all over the place without thinking about other residents. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of decency anymore,\u201d he muttered, picking up the discarded bike and heaving it into the air in anger. \u201cWe treat each other like enemies.\u201dThere are now more than 16 million shared bicycles on the road in China\u2019s traffic-clogged cities, thanks to a fierce battle for market share among 70-plus companies backed by a total of more than $1 billion in financing. These start-ups have reshaped the urban landscape, putting bikes equipped with GPS and digital locks on almost every street corner in a way that Silicon Valley can only dream of.Such problems have raised questions about the sustainability of China\u2019s bike-share boom. But the debacle has also led many Chinese to look for deeper explanations and ask if bike-sharing has revealed essential flaws in the national character, prompting a far-reaching debate about social decay and the decline of decorum and morality in the country.In many cities, the supply of bicycles far exceeds demand, bringing chaos to sidewalks, bus stops and intersections and prompting grumbles that excessive competitiveness \u2014 seen as a national trait \u2014 is spoiling a good thing. In Shanghai, where officials have struggled to maintain order, there is now one shared bike for every 16 people, according to government statistics.In some places, the authorities have confiscated tens of thousands of bicycles and imposed parking restrictions. News outlets have documented the waste with astounding images of mountains of candy-colored bicycles, each hue representing a different bike-share company.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle every day,\u201d said Ke Jin, a security guard at a residential compound in northeast Beijing, as he cleared a path that had been blocked by a tangled heap of blue and yellow bikes. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature not to care.\u201dOn social media and in conversation, it is common to hear people describe bike-sharing as a \u201cmonster-revealing mirror\u201d that has exposed the true nature of the Chinese people. In that sense, it is the latest chapter in a line of critical introspection that stretches back before the Communist Revolution, when the famed writer Lu Xun assailed Chinese culture as selfish, boastful, servile and cruel.Technology executives who work in the so-called sharing economy and depend on good behavior for profit are now among the more prominent critics.One start-up, 3V Bike, was forced to shut down in June after nearly all its 1,000 bicycles were stolen from the streets of small cities. In interviews with Chinese news outlets, the company\u2019s founder, Wu Shenghua, blamed the public\u2019s \u201cpoor suzhi\u201d in part for driving the company out of business.Others have argued that theft and vandalism of bicycles had been overstated, that some disorder was to be expected with innovation and that misbehavior would be worse in other countries.Hu Weiwei, founder and president of Mobike, one of the most popular bike-sharing apps in China, said the benefits of shared bicycles far outweighed any inconvenience, noting reductions in carbon emissions and improvements in traffic.\u201cPublic properties are seen as having no owner,\u201d he said, \u201ctherefore people believe they can take advantage of them.\u201dBut Mr. Yan said the overall success of bike sharing suggested that mutual trust was growing in China.Some citizens have formed volunteer groups to take up the cause of promoting the common good.Zhao Qi, 23, an architect, spends much of his free time as a \u201cbike hunter,\u201d roaming the streets of Beijing looking for vandalized bikes and misbehaving riders.Mr. Zhao said he was motivated partly by patriotism. China has been pushing for years to develop technology products that catch fire overseas. Many now see promise in bike-sharing, with the domestic news media hailing it as one of China\u2019s four great modern inventions, drawing a comparison with the ancient inventions of gunpowder, paper, printing and the compass.\u201cThis is a symbol of national pride \u2014 a gift from China to the world,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. \u201cWe can\u2019t mess it up.\u201dAnother volunteer, Cheng Xiaofeng, 46, who works for a state-owned investment company, said she had reported more than 4,000 improperly parked bicycles since April.\u201cI believe that people are kind, and that human nature is good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sometimes they fall under bad influences and need to be corrected.\u201dOn a recent evening, Ms. Cheng came upon a woman trying to park a bicycle inside a residential compound near the Lama Temple, in Beijing, in violation of rules set by bike-sharing companies. Ms. Cheng tried to persuade her to reconsider. The woman gave a confused look, left the bike and walked away.Yang Xiong contributed research.Advertisement"}

In it, Ms. Acogny, an imposing presence at 73, performs alone in a black box to a recording of \u201cRite.\u201d She smokes a pipe. She shakes her backside. She laughs. She screams.Much about \u201cMon \u00c9lue Noire,\u201d starting with its back story and every word in its title \u2014 the possessive pronoun, the specification of blackness, the choice and who is choosing \u2014 seems provocative and likely to expose differences between American and European sensibilities, sensitivities and taste.But, to choose among issues, doesn\u2019t a French male choreographer imposing his vision on an African female performer risk replicating the colonial relationships that the C\u00e9saire text condemns?Presented with that question in a recent phone interview, Ms. Acogny, speaking from Senegal, laughed but calmly rejected the premise. \u201cIt\u2019s not colonization,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my choice.\u201dBeing inside the \u201cpagan story\u201d of \u201cRite,\u201d she explained, was a way of honoring her ancestors, particularly her father\u2019s mother, a Yoruba priestess she never met. When a dove appeared at Ms. Acogny\u2019s birth, her family saw it as a sign of this grandmother\u2019s return.Many of Ms. Acogny\u2019s shows have addressed that African heritage. But it was in Paris, where she was studying to be a physical education teacher, that she discovered dance as a discipline. The year was 1962, and after three years of training in harmonic gymnastics (a now defunct French method), ballet and modern dance, she returned to her newly independent homeland and looked at African dance and its surrounding culture with new eyes, learning as much as she could.Not everything appealed to her. When her husband took a second wife, she demanded a divorce. To support herself and her two children, she began teaching dance in her backyard. Soon, she created her first solo. \u201cIt was a way to break free,\u201d she told Radio France Internationale last year.Senghor sent her for approval to his friend B\u00e9jart (whose father was French-Senegalese), and when Senghor and B\u00e9jart founded Mudra Afrique in 1977, they hired Ms. Acogny to teach African dance. When foreign teachers tried to take over her classes, though, she threatened to quit unless she was made sole director. B\u00e9jart put her in charge.Both B\u00e9jart and Senghor wrote prefaces to \u201cDanse Africaine,\u201d the groundbreaking photo-illustrated textbook that Ms. Acogny published in 1980. In that book, she resisted the stereotype of African dance as natural and spontaneous; it had rules and forms to be analyzed, taught and studied. Her vision was a Pan-African synthesis that borrowed from Europe as well. Although deeply rooted in tradition, it was not a return to roots, she insisted, but an innovative approach for the Africa of skyscrapers. \u201cLike everything else, African dance evolves,\u201d she wrote.Not long after Senghor resigned in 1980, the financing for Mudra Afrique dried up. That, Ms. Acogny said in our interview, is why she never appeared in B\u00e9jart\u2019s \u201cRite.\u201d She moved back to France, where she married a German man, Helmut Vogt, with whom she founded a school near Toulouse.\u201cThey call her Mama Germaine,\u201d Mr. Dubois, 45, offered at the start of his interview. \u201cBut to me she is my little girl.\u201dHow did Ms. Acogny contribute to Mr. Dubois\u2019s work? \u201cThe choreography and the intention is all mine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the flesh and blood of the piece is her. It can only be done by her. And it\u2019s not a tribute. She\u2019s not from the past. She\u2019s the future, an artist with a political voice I want people to hear.\u201dThe extent to which she can express that voice through Mr. Dubois\u2019s work may be a question for viewers, but not for Ms. Acogny. \u201cThe question doesn\u2019t exist for me,\u201d she said. \u201cOlivier is my equal. Just because he is a white choreographer doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t express my n\u00e9gritude.\u201dWhen Mr. Dubois first proposed his idea to Ms. Acogny, she was skeptical, she said, because of her age \u2014 just as she had been skeptical when B\u00e9jart chose her because of her limited classical training. Asked to describe the rehearsal process, she focused on her difficulty counting the music, laughing at herself in retrospect.\u201cIt is not only through me,\u201d Ms. Acogny said. But what about \u201cthe mother of contemporary African dance\u201d title?\u201cYes, they call me that, and I accept it,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout pride, and without undue modesty,\u201d she added, laughing some more.Mon \u00c9lue NoireThrough Oct. 7, Brooklyn Academy of MusicAdvertisement"}

The fight against malaria has reached a critical moment. We now face the prospect of a resurgence of the disease. Strains that are resistant to multiple drugs have appeared in Southeast Asia, and could spread to Africa, where they have the potential to cause a deadly catastrophe. This has happened at least three times before, and conditions are ripe for it to happen again.As someone who has had malaria four times, I know the awful power of this disease. I remember how grim the situation was in Africa in the 1990s when two of the most used medicines then, chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, were failing. A sense of hopelessness was felt by the people living with malaria and those of us working to stop the disease. We had to accept a daily disaster \u2014 as a colleague of mine has put it, a 747 full of African children crashing into a mountain every three hours, day and night, for years on end. With an enormous amount of work, we managed to reduce this carnage to something less horrible. But I don\u2019t ever want to go back to those days.Malaria is transmitted to humans (and other animals) by infected mosquitoes, who inject malaria parasites into the bloodstream. The parasites spread throughout the body and multiply exponentially, causing chills, fever, headache, nausea and intense fatigue. Over the last century, researchers have developed effective medicines for malaria, including quinine, chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and artemisinin. When taken promptly, those drugs killed the parasites before they killed their host. Unfortunately, as usually happens in the battle between microbe and human, the malaria bug has evolved and developed resistance to our medicines. As a result, malaria has been beaten back in several places over the last 75 years, only to spread again, more lethal than before because the drugs no longer work.Frequently, drug-resistant strains have originated in the Mekong region of Asia, an area that includes Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the Yunnan Province of China. We are not sure why it starts there; it is likely a combination of factors. The parasites that circulate in the region may be able to mutate especially quickly. The region draws tens of thousands of migrants, who come for work on rubber plantations and in other industries, and who are particularly susceptible to malaria since they have lower levels of natural immunity. Because of widespread poverty, as well as lack of health care and education, those who get sick often use less medicine than they should, or use counterfeit drugs; both practices spur drug resistance.Once drug resistance appears in the Mekong region, it spreads, often with ghastly results. In the 1950s, chloroquine-resistant malaria jumped to India and Africa, killing millions. Researchers, drug companies and public health officials came up with a replacement by combining two existing drugs, but then in the 1970s, parasites resistant to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination appeared in the Mekong and spread globally, rendering the treatment useless.Since the late 1990s, we have relied on a drug called artemisinin, which is the best treatment we have ever had for malaria. Much of our recent success against this disease reflects the power of this medicine. It kills the parasite quickly, with few side effects, and it has saved millions of lives. We have tried to forestall resistance by combining artemisinin with other drugs, much as we do when treating H.I.V. and tuberculosis, but the day of reckoning appears to be at hand.Over the past decade, several studies have found widespread resistance to the artemisinin-piperaquine combination throughout Southeast Asia. At some spots in western Cambodia, more than 40 percent of people who received artemisinin drug combinations failed to clear the parasites from their blood, or got sick again soon after treatment ended. This is a clear and ominous sign that the parasites are becoming more resistant.So now we stand once again on the edge of the precipice. This time the risk of untreatable malaria is even greater than in the past, because no new drugs are likely to be available in the next few years. It takes a long time for drugs to go through the development pipeline, and most of the leading candidates are close relatives of artemisinin, so the malaria-causing parasites will likely be resistant to those drugs as well.The first response of the public health community was to try to contain drug-resistant malaria in the Mekong region where it originated, preventing its wider spread. But past experience shows that this is not easy to do, and we now have clear evidence that multidrug resistant strains have spread across hundreds of miles, crossing national borders. Even worse, new resistant strains are popping up repeatedly and spreading, in a lethal version of Whac-a-Mole.Instead, we should focus on a more ambitious strategy: to eliminate malaria from the Mekong region. This will be difficult, because the areas with the highest rates of malaria tend to be poor, rural and underdeveloped. But with coordination, hard work and proper funding, we can achieve our goal. Malaria has been eliminated from many regions where it was once common: the Southern United States, Russia, southern Europe, the Middle East and, most recently, Sri Lanka. There is no reason we can\u2019t do the same in the Mekong region.A broad consensus has emerged that elimination is the best strategy. The World Health Organization; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others, have all expressed their commitment to this approach, as have the countries in the region.Elimination will require a coordinated attack using all the weapons at our disposal. We know we can eventually eliminate malaria from the region by using the currently available anti-mosquito and anti-parasite measures, including insecticides and bed nets, plus medicines and diagnostic tests. Eliminating multidrug resistant malaria from the Mekong before it spreads to Africa will require so-called elimination accelerators, including highly sensitive new tests to identify symptom-free carriers of malaria infection, and mass drug treatment of infected groups or populations.We also need closer cooperation from American and European health officials, international health agencies and financers, local nongovernmental organizations and especially from the inhabitants and governments of the Mekong region. We must ramp up quickly; drug resistance is spreading; if it spins out of control, we run the risk of a huge resurgence of malaria in other parts of Asia and especially in Africa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plunging His Pen Into the Dark Heart of 1980s Wall Street", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "With \u201cJunk,\u201d the Pulitzer-winning playwright Ayad Akhtar examines financial chicanery in the 1980s \u2014 and how it shaped the blind worship of affluence today.Supported byAt the age of 7, Ayad Akhtar, the son of two doctors in suburban Milwaukee, was seized by a religious fervor. He began asking his parents to take him to the one mosque in the area, a converted schoolhouse on the city\u2019s Polish south side that they only occasionally attended. He taught himself to pray, and he saw the Prophet Muhammad in his dreams. One year, on the day in the calendar when some Muslims say all of creation bowed in respect to Muhammad, he stayed up all night, looking out his bedroom window and waiting to see the trees bend. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I was a very sensitive kid. I had an acute awareness of splendor,\u201d Mr. Akhtar told me in one of the conversations we had over the summer. \u201cThe only thing that really responded to that register of life for me was the Quran \u2014 and \u2018Star Wars.\u2019\u201dHis devotion to Islam deepened until he reached high school and encountered a teacher who introduced him to the European Modernists: Kafka, Camus and others. Mr. Akhtar, who is now 46, went off to Brown, got a graduate degree in film at Columbia and then spent a big chunk of his early adulthood, six years, writing a novel in the style of his literary heroes. The book was 600-plus pages \u2014 and unpublishable. One friend considered it \u201cunbearable.\u201d For Mr. Akhtar, the response was both crushing and liberating: \u201cI just thought, this is tiring, and I\u2019m not even good at it.\u201dThis latest work is a progression rather than a departure for Mr. Akhtar. He once again mercilessly examines a faith and culture \u2014 in this case, money and Wall Street \u2014 and his characters are subject to the pull of a powerful orthodoxy. An idealistic journalist in the story sets out to \u201ctorpedo every piety of this new faux-religion of finance\u201d but edges too close and is compromised and subsumed. The drama is not an overt comment on the current political moment, but it is a kind of parable. It implies we have all been co-opted, having traded our healthy suspicion of people with vast wealth for something more like worship.\u201cThe whole culture around rights, it\u2019s valuable and it\u2019s important but it\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. Akhtar said. Identity politics on both sides, he believes, has the nation \u201cconsumed and distracted from the real story.\u201d\u201cMoney,\u201d he said, \u201cis what\u2019s happening.\u201dMr. Akhtar\u2019s first reader and informal dramaturge on everything he writes is Steve Klein, a close friend, financier and jack-of-all-trades who has written screenplays and produced movies. The two of them are engaged in a long-running back and forth about the morality of capitalism and meaning of various arcane events that have taken place on Wall Street. I had lunch with them one day as they jousted about \u201cQE,\u201d which they somewhat helpfully explained stands for \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d and Mr. Akhtar insisted to his friend, \u201cI\u2019ve read the Fed minutes!\u201d \u2014 by which he meant the minutes of a meeting of the Federal Reserve from 1979.We were at BBar in the East Village, an informal place, and Mr. Akhtar was dressed in jeans and a white V-neck T-shirt. He often augments this look with an unbuttoned flannel shirt, which I\u2019d heard referred to as his \u201cuniform.\u201d He has a shaved head, what usually appears to be a day or two of stubble and such an intense gaze that in a children\u2019s cartoon he\u2019d be depicted with gears spinning rapidly inside his brain.His interest in finance is longstanding. When Mr. Akhtar set off for New York to become a writer, his father, who founded a cardiology practice in Wisconsin, made him promise to read The Wall Street Journal every day. He helped support himself by trading stocks, using as seed money annual stipends of $12,000 or so sent by his parents. \u201cAmerican Dervish\u201d earned an $850,000 advance, huge for a first novel, and made him more comfortable. Still, I never got the sense that Mr. Akhtar is enamored of money \u2014 he lives modestly and works constantly \u2014 but he is fascinated by the game, its rules and its sleight of hand.He had long wanted to write \u201ca very big play about finance,\u201d but his choice of subject can be taken as a statement: He is not going to be solely defined as an ethnic playwright. Having been a decoder of a strain of Muslim-American life \u2014 middle-class, educated, assimilated, though less comfortably so after 2001 \u2014 he has, for now, moved on.Mr. Akhtar\u2019s fast-twitch intellect can quickly access a range of subjects \u2014 from the Green Bay Packers to Thucydides\u2019 history of the Peloponnesian War to his enthusiasm for ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and Ibsen\u2019s \u201cHedda Gabler,\u201d his favorite play. He gave me a kind of heads-up the first time we talked, just after he had referred to the German philosopher Theodor Adorno. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be overly pretentious,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am overly pretentious sometimes, and you will pick up on that, so if you hear me pontificating, just stop me.\u201dHis work, however, is notable for its directness \u2014 it is all lean muscle and tension. It\u2019s as if he disgorged all his extraneous words during his European Modernist phase. With 17 characters, \u201cJunk\u201d is bigger in scale than Mr. Akhtar\u2019s previous plays, but it bears his signatures \u2014 it is fast, funny, ruthless and dark. (My favorite bit is when the wife of one of the main characters urges him into a can\u2019t-miss investment \u2014 for-profit prisons \u2014 as she is nursing her baby.)At our lunch that afternoon, Mr. Klein said that his notes to Mr. Akhtar are usually intended to keep the pace barreling forward. \u201cIf something gets in the way, I tend to see it,\u201d he said.Mr. Akhtar said they had \u201can endless debate about one line\u201d in \u201cJunk.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFinally, I just cut it. I was sick of it.\u201dI asked him about an incident that occurred during the London run of \u201cDisgraced,\u201d which in 2015-16 was the most produced new play in American theaters. At a preview performance, he was seated next to a woman as the dinner party at the center of the drama built toward an explosion. At the most chilling moment, his seatmate shouted, \u201cOh my [expletive] God.\u201d It was a breach of theater etiquette, but I wondered if he liked it. \u201cYes, very much,\u201d he said, adding that if he could, he\u2019d arrange for such an outburst every night that \u201ccritics and tastemakers were in the house.\u201dMr. Akhtar was married at 25 to a French student he met in Paris his junior year of college and divorced in his mid-30s. She is an art curator. He described the end of their marriage as \u201clike a death\u201d but also noted that his best work came in the years after. They did not have children. For many years he was unattached, but he now lives with his girlfriend, an actress, in an apartment near Lincoln Center. He has close friends but he can go months without seeing them as he sinks monk-like into his work.He is circumspect in talking about his family and relationships, and I had to push him some. I wanted to probe how someone who can give the impression of living in his head became a writer who drills so close to the bone that he makes theatergoers gasp.The broad outlines of his upbringing are seemingly idyllic. His parents emigrated from the Punjab region of Pakistan in their late 20s, as part of a program to attract foreign doctors and scientists, and raised him and his younger brother in the generous-spirited Upper Midwest. Islam had not yet been politicized, and as far as he could tell, the mosque he attended was at most a source of mild curiosity in the neighborhood, perhaps a little exotic, like the first Thai restaurant on a block. The family home was big enough to have bedrooms for both sets of grandparents, who visited frequently from Pakistan, and he spent part of his summers traveling to see them.His mother, a radiologist, was given a diagnosis of ovarian cancer just as he was starting school, was sick for much of his childhood and battled numerous recurrences until she died, at 72, earlier this year. He described a hot-tempered atmosphere in the household. \u201cPunjabis are like the southern Italians of the Indian subcontinent, loud and operatic,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s an extremity of expression and a willingness to go there. If you overheard calls with my family at certain extreme moments, if you wrote down the dialogue, you would think it was melodramatic even if O\u2019Neill wrote it.\u201dMr. Akhtar\u2019s zeal for Islam, to an extent, took him out of his parents\u2019 sphere. His father is a \u201cmilitant anti-religionist.\u201d His mother adapted her faith to American notions of self-help and became \u201csort of a Wayne Dyer/Oprah Muslim.\u201d \u201cI think she was maybe a little proud when I became religious,\u201d he said, smiling and shifting into a lilting accent, his mother\u2019s voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a very holy child. He knows the Quran!\u201dFor reasons that are unsurprising, Mr. Akhtar\u2019s work has angered some Muslims. As the dinner party in \u201cDisgraced\u201d unravels, the character of Amir, the lawyer, offers up his opinion that the Quran is \u201cone long hate-mail to humanity.\u201d You could, of course, say the same of the Old Testament, but there is a more established tradition in the Judeo-Christian world of artists critiquing religious dogma and sacred texts.In \u201cAmerican Dervish,\u201d the characters inside the mosque express a great deal of virulent anti-Semitism. The novel is in no way admiring of it. One of its most sympathetic characters is a Jewish doctor who falls into an ill-fated relationship with the young Muslim narrator\u2019s aunt.Though there are no Muslim characters in \u201cJunk,\u201d there are lots of Jewish characters \u2014 many of them engaged in behaviors other Jews file into the category \u201cbad for the Jews.\u201d The ethnic mix in Mr. Akhtar\u2019s work and dead-on portrayals are the product of a writer who has dwelled in several different worlds. His mother (like the mother in \u201cAmerican Dervish\u201d) believed that American Jews were the model immigrants, assimilated enough to make it in the new land but respectful of their traditions. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that when I got to college all my closest friends were Jewish,\u201d Mr. Akhtar said.He described himself to me as comfortable being an outsider. \u201cI was on the outside in my own family, and I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way,\u201d he said. He has close friends, but they are not writers. If he has a tribe it is among other intellectual obsessives \u2014 types who would get interested in finance and plow through minutes of Fed meetings.I didn\u2019t but went back and looked \u2014 the young boy at the center of the story, an Orthodox Jew whose paintings are considered sacrilege, becomes celebrated for his work but is ultimately cast out of his family and religious community.Mr. Akhtar and the cast of \u201cJunk\u201d gathered in mid-July for a weeklong workshop in a basement space at Lincoln Center where several folding tables had been set up in a rectangle. It was a hot stretch of the summer, and most everyone came dressed in shorts or sundresses, but he was sporting his unbuttoned-flannel-shirt look over a T-shirt and jeans. He sat next to the play\u2019s director, Doug Hughes, with a thermos of coffee and a bottle of some kind of green juice in front of him, looking straight on at the actors as they read their lines.Mr. Akhtar does not expect every audience member to follow every financial twist and turn, but said, \u201cIf the human stakes are understandable, if we understand the action of any given scene \u2014 somebody is lying; somebody is trying to steal; there is a vendetta \u2014 those basic human interactions will be understood. That was my gambit.\u201dWhen \u201cJunk\u201d played last summer in La Jolla, Mr. Akhtar sat through each performance of the monthlong run, in different parts of the theater, watching the expressions of audience members and listening to their responses so he could know which of his lines fell flat. Mr. Ashley, La Jolla\u2019s artistic director, told me that it was common for playwrights to stay through previews as they continue to revise but \u201cvery rare\u201d for one to stay from beginning to end.At the workshop, Mr. Akhtar wanted to hear his post-La Jolla rewrites out loud. He had tweaked numerous lines. A whole scene had been cut \u2014 one of his favorites, but it did not move the story forward. Only three cast members had been in the previous production, so he also needed to hear how actors new to the play delivered his lines. \u201cThat\u2019s actually better!\u201d he said more than once when a cast member stumbled over the written words but ended up saying something that sounded more natural.Both in its scale and the complexity of its story, \u201cJunk\u201d presents dramatic challenges. The rapid-fire, short scenes give a hint of Mr. Akhtar\u2019s film-school background. Mr. Hughes told the actors that the drama requires \u201csmash-cut energy.\u201dMr. Akhtar kept up a sort of running commentary. \u201cThe Jews are really expressing American values,\u201d he said at one point, \u201cby innovating, working harder and taking risks. The rest of the Street is resentful.\u201dAt times, Mr. Akhtar sounded as if he were teaching a graduate seminar at Wharton. He observed after one scene that a maneuver plotted by the corporate raiders probably contained a \u201c13(d) violation,\u201d a breach of securities law requiring large investors to disclose their stakes in companies. Most of the discussion, though, was more broadly dramaturgical. He wanted to make sure that the stakes were clear and that the play \u201cfully turns the screws.\u201dAlthough his drama is set a quarter-century ago, \u201cJunk\u201d speaks to the present day. Mr. Akhtar believes that all the sound and fury and political chaos of Trump-era America covers for even greater shifts of money and power to the upper classes \u2014 and that we are looking in the wrong direction and have been for quite some time. \u201cThe new landed gentry are those who manufacture money, who have access to massive amounts of capital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the strand the play is really following.\u201dIn the three weeks between the workshop for \u201cJunk\u201d and the beginning of full rehearsals, Mr. Akhtar went away \u2014 to an ashram in the Bahamas. He was exhausted. His mother\u2019s death, after decades of illness, had rocked him more than he ever anticipated, he said. He was in Wisconsin at the end, but for most of the last five years, as his plays were being staged and he was traveling the world, he had not been physically present.Work itself for Mr. Akhtar is a kind of holy pursuit. Elise Joffe, a psychotherapist whose friendship dates back to Brown, recalled being directed by him in an undergraduate production of Jean Genet\u2019s \u201cThe Maids.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d reach the point in rehearsals where we were feeling, let\u2019s get out of here and get a drink, but Ayad would keep at it. He is ambitious and driven and disciplined, but at the same time he does the work for the work. He is dedicated to it almost as if it\u2019s a spiritual practice.\u201dThe question now is what Mr. Akhtar will do next. If he were just a novelist, his next book, following the promise of \u201cAmerican Dervish,\u201d would be eagerly anticipated. He has notes and outlines for new novels, plays and screenplays. But he has spent most of the last two years writing for TV, first for a project that did not go forward at HBO after the executives backing it left the network. He is now developing a series for FX set in 1980s Hollywood. If it is picked up, he would presumably be the showrunner.The last time we were together, I asked Mr. Akhtar if he ever worried that he should, so to speak, declare a major. \u201cIt\u2019s a qualm that drifts in and out of my consciousness, but it doesn\u2019t drive what I do,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m guided by invisible influences. I\u2019ll hear some odd voice urging me to do this or that, and until I do, I hear that voice.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated a location where Ayad Akhtar was photographed. It was Federal Hall National Memorial in Manhattan, not the New York Federal Stock Exchange (there is no such place).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drew Nieporent May Be the Last Old-School Restaurateur Standing", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as a kid, he didn\u2019t eat like one. For sure, at 5 or 6 he\u2019d kick his older brother, Tracy, under the table whenever his parents took the family to restaurants, but mostly he was paying attention, learning about the food of a time in Manhattan when the top restaurants served German, Swiss or other cuisines that are infrequently celebrated these days.Drew Nieporent was born in 1955 and was obsessed with food by the early 1960s, before New York diners and newspaper critics became infatuated with everything French. \u201cI had amazing exposure to restaurants of the \u201860s that nobody around today visited except my brother and me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had to parlay it into something.\u201dIn an age when marquee restaurants are often defined by their celebrity chefs, he may be the last of the great meet-and-greet men, a breed of owners who reigned over their personal dominions, the seemingly insignificant space between dining room and front door.He never hired a public relations firm, preferring personal contact. He remains the best resource for those who know him, have his phone number and need a last-minute reservation at any restaurant in town.\u201cIf you\u2019re a friend of Drew, you get in any door,\u201d said the comedian and actor Paul Reiser, who took a photography class with Mr. Nieporent at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. \u201cThe whole point of getting famous is to hope for a good table, but you can end that heartache with a shortcut, just by knowing Drew. I once wanted to go to Rubicon in San Francisco while he was in Japan. He got me in. He\u2019s hospitable from 5,000 miles away.\u201dWherever Mr. Nieporent (NEE-pour-rent) appears \u2014 and he seems to be everywhere \u2014 he is a commanding figure, never content to hover in the background. He lights up a room like a bottle rocket on a birthday cake. He greets everyone he knows (and he knows everyone) in a voice that booms like a bugle call at sunrise or a ram\u2019s horn on the Jewish High Holy Days.\u201cTaking care of people separates him,\u201d said Marty Shapiro, a Myriad partner. \u201cOthers feel that way, but it\u2019s in his soul.\u201dAs everyone knows, attention from Mr. Nieporent can come at a price. \u201cHe will say anything that comes to mind,\u201d his daughter, Gabrielle, pointed out. \u201cHe has no filter.\u201dHe does it for love of a punch line, and perhaps from a certain cantankerousness that comes from knowing that what he set out to become \u2014 the Manhattan restaurateur as arbiter of everything culinary \u2014 has diminished drastically with the rise of the superstar chef.He was always going to become a restaurateur, even before he knew what the word meant. Mr. Reiser wrote in Mr. Nieporent\u2019s high school yearbook, \u201cGood luck with your restaurant.\u201d As Mr. Reiser explained recently, \u201cHe was the only guy our age who knew exactly what he wanted to be when he was 17 or 18.\u201dMr. Nieporent said he remembers every restaurant he visited and everything he learned.\u201cEating out in the \u201960s was for the privileged and the wealthy,\u201d Mr. Nieporent said. \u201cWe were neither, but we were treated so well that I wanted to be a part of it. We\u2019d sit at the table with the old-school guys who ran the restaurants. They\u2019d ask my father, \u2018What does he want to be?\u2019 He\u2019d say, \u2018He wants to be in the restaurant business.\u2019 They\u2019d reply, \u2018It\u2019s getting terrible.\u2019 They\u2019d moan and bellyache. They were always crabby, always in a bad mood. But I would feel the aura.\u201dMr. Nieporent eventually caught the eye of Mr. Baum, the man he calls his idol. Mr. Baum brought him in for a job interview and remarked, not speaking of himself, \u201cThere are two people in this room, and one of them thinks he\u2019s Jesus Christ.\u201d They never did work together, but Mr. Nieporent loved the compliment. (Yes, he considered it that.)\u201cI wanted roast chicken on the menu,\u201d Mr. Nieporent recalled. \u201cHe experimented. After a week, he brought me roast chicken ice cream.\u201d\u201cBack then, the chef was anonymous unless he had named the restaurant for himself,\u201d Mr. Nieporent said. \u201cToday, chefs are all Clint Eastwoods. They consider themselves directors/restaurateurs. They don\u2019t want to take direction from people like me.\u201dMontrachet eliminated stuffiness and initiated casual elegance. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need the bowing and the tuxedos,\u201d he said. The location below Canal Street was considered so remote by some diners that Mr. Nieporent recalled \u201chaving to run out of the restaurant and up to Broadway to find customers when they got lost.\u201d And while he is known these days for his girth, he could really run back then, having completed the New York City Marathon in 1983.Most surprising at Montrachet were the prices. The year before, he had eaten lunch at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s Jamin in Paris, where the prix fixe was 185 francs at a time when the exchange rate was about 10 francs to a dollar. \u201cI said if Robuchon can do it for $18.50, I can do it for $16,\u201d Mr. Nieporent recalled.The partners were shocked. \u201cAt the time it was a risky venture,\u201d recalled one, Michael Chin. \u201cWe were all about 30, and we put all the money we had into the restaurant.\u201dMr. Nieporent\u2019s resentment endured for decades, even as Montrachet thrived with a series of other chefs. His wife, Ann, said, \u201cIn the old days, there was such bad blood between them that if both were working the same food event, the organizer would have to put them on opposite sides of the kitchen.\u201dThe feud ended in the aftermath of 9/11, Mr. Nieporent said, when both men worked separately to feed rescue workers and help save the neighborhood.Mr. Nieporent has opened more than 40 restaurants in 32 years, not an enormous quantity in this era of branding and franchising, but he was never interested in multiple variations on the same theme. He now says that was a financial mistake.\u201cI never wanted to make the same movie over and over, Nobu being the exception,\u201d he said. \u201cI approached restaurants with new things, new people. I didn\u2019t realize until much later the power of the brand.\u201dHis restaurant menus have been Middle Eastern (Layla), Italian (Zeppole), American (Tribeca Grill), Japanese (Nobu), heart-healthy (Heartbeat), seafood (the Coach House, on Martha\u2019s Vineyard), Mexican (Centrico) and Californian (the seminal Rubicon). He regrets not opening a Chinese restaurant, a passion obvious when he showed up for a recent interview carrying a shopping bag of dim sum.He is currently a partner in five restaurants: B\u00e2tard (in the former Montrachet and Corton space), Tribeca Grill and three Nobus (Nobu Downtown, Nobu Fifty Seven and Nobu London). Among his partners in all but the first is Robert De Niro, who introduced Mr. Nieporent to the chef Nobu Matsuhisa.\u201cBob used to come to Montrachet,\u201d Mr. Nieporent said. \u201cHe always sat at the last table, his back to the room. One day Toukie Smith, then his girlfriend, came over and said to me, \u2018Want to open another restaurant in TriBeCa?\u2019 Bob knew Nobu from Matsuhisa in L.A., and he wanted him to be the chef. Nobu came and saw the space that would become Tribeca Grill and said, \u2018Maybe I can do a small sushi restaurant with you.\u2019\u201dThe relationship between the two men seesawed over the years, especially after the replication of Nobu across the globe proceeded without Mr. Nieporent. He says there was a \u201cstrong disagreement\u201d between him and the other three partners over expansion and control; he continued overseeing the Nobus in New York and London, and the brand kept growing without him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really break up, and we continue to work together today,\u201d he said.Montrachet, the original Nobu and Tribeca Grill were the foundations for the development of TriBeCa as one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan. While Mr. De Niro could rightfully take credit, the actor demurred, saying, \u201cIt would have created itself.\u201dAsked about his relationship with Mr. Nieporent, Mr. De Niro laughed and said: \u201cDrew is a character. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs.\u201dMr. Nieporent said: \u201cHe\u2019s too busy to have a lot of fights with. I am sensitive to who he is. I\u2019m careful. I understand the relationship, and I give him credit for what he proposed.\u201dThe marriage of Ann and Drew Nieporent has lasted 31 years. \u201cFew in the business can say that,\u201d she said.It has endured a separation of a few months (\u201cShe threw me out,\u201d he said) and his apparent inability to turn down endless invitations to festivals, restaurant openings and culinary events. \u201cMy wife still reminds me I never changed a diaper, but she\u2019s wrong, I did it once. My son\u2019s.\u201dMs. Nieporent claims she was fooled decades ago by her husband-to-be during a brief but magical time when he was not working restaurant hours, in the months before Montrachet opened.By all accounts, Mr. Nieporent has remained in character as father and husband. Which means that the marriage and the raising of children have been about food \u2014 although his wife points out that he is also besotted by their cocker spaniels. She said she was in the kitchen one day and overheard her husband in the next room. \u201cHe was talking to Chloe, sweetly saying to her: \u2018You just had your hair done.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t notice when I\u2019ve had my hair done.\u201dMr. Nieporent is the family cook, a position he rightfully earned after decades in the kitchens of the restaurants he owns or oversees. \u201cHe is an excellent cook, his food perfect,\u201d his wife said. \u201cI suspect he drove all his chefs crazy over the years because he has strong opinions how dishes should be made.\u201dThe Nieporents and their children \u2014 Andrew, 29, and Gabrielle, 25 \u2014 seem to have never missed a meal.\u201cIt was nonstop,\u201d Gabrielle said. \u201cOn weekends, we\u2019d talk about food. When we went on family vacation, we\u2019d plan lunch, we\u2019d plan dinners, we\u2019d roll home at the end of the trip.\u201d Andrew said his father still likes to sit next to him at family gatherings. \u201cHe takes a small percentage of my meal and a large percentage of everything else on the table. He\u2019s very systematic.\u201dMr. Nieporent said he has one more restaurant in him, perhaps his last, considering that New York rents have become exorbitant and New York chefs uncollaborative. It will be Chinese.He vividly recalls the meal he ate the night the Beatles played the Ed Sullivan Theater, and the scene outside was pandemonium. His most treasured memory of that historic New York evening? The egg rolls.Advertisement"}

He noted that Mr. Mnuchin is a member of the National Security Council with responsibility for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.It comes as Mr. Mnuchin is leading the Trump administration\u2019s push to overhaul the tax code, which he has promised to make more fair for middle-class Americans.The couple did travel by government plane on that trip, and the Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general is reviewing the flight and whether any ethical violations were made.Treasury officials traditionally fly on commercial aircraft except in extenuating circumstances, because government planes can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to operate.

{"Headline": "Irma May Force Florida Insurers to Turn to Deeper Pockets", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Hurricane Irma\u2019s destructive force having pushed north, Floridians are beginning to check on what has become of their homes. They may also want to check on their insurers.The big national carriers like State Farm and Allstate cut back on writing homeowners\u2019 insurance policies in Florida years ago, citing catastrophic risks and unhelpful state regulators. Those reductions left a vacuum that was filled, initially, with a state-owned insurer, Citizens Property Insurance. Eventually, the state offered incentives to coax some brave new insurers into the market.As a result, all that stands between many Florida homeowners and potential ruin is one state-owned insurer and dozens of relatively little-known companies that do most \u2014 or all \u2014 of their business in the state. They all have the benefit of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which, with no major storms in the past 12 years, has $17 billion at the ready \u2014 a sum that may not be nearly enough.\u201cThis can really be a hurricane that can bust the insurance industry,\u201d said Shahid Hamid, a finance professor at Florida International University\u2019s International Hurricane Research Center. \u201cWhen I saw Irma\u2019s track, I was tremendously concerned.\u201dWhether policyholders can be made whole will most likely depend on reinsurance \u2014 the custom-tailored insurance that the Florida insurers themselves take out \u2014 and other financial vehicles that they have to fall back on. But the variables at play \u2014 the storm\u2019s path, the companies\u2019 balance sheets and the details of their reinsurance contracts \u2014 could produce differing fortunes for the various companies.By missing a direct hit on Miami, and inflicting less damage than expected on Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast, Irma turned out to be bad, but not as bad as experts had feared.AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm in Boston, predicted on Monday that Irma\u2019s insured damage in the United States would cost the industry $20 billion to $40 billion. If insured property in the Caribbean is included, the total projected losses would range from $25 billion to $55 billion, according to Kevin Long, a spokesman.Insurer strength could be more of an issue in Florida than it was in eastern Texas, where most of Hurricane Harvey\u2019s damage was caused by inland flooding. Homeowners\u2019 insurers do not generally provide flood insurance. While Irma brought flooding to Florida, too, the greater damage was expected to be from high winds, a peril covered by standard homeowners\u2019 policies.Investors dumped the stocks of Florida insurers last week as they anticipated the resulting claims and losses. Not all the insurers are publicly traded, but the second largest in the Florida market, Universal Property & Casualty Insurance, saw the shares of its corporate parent, Universal Insurance Holdings, drop by 15 percent on Thursday. It regained some of that ground Friday and was up more than 13 percent Monday.Mr. Hamid led the development of the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model, which is used by state regulators to assess insurers\u2019 financial strength, among other things. But he said it was impossible to predict which insurers might be vulnerable, because the companies\u2019 exposures vary by region and the terms of their reinsurance contracts are not known.Long before Hurricane Irma started bearing down, Mr. Hamid stress-tested the larger homeowners\u2019 insurers in Florida and found that they would withstand a worst-case scenario, as he defined it at the time: a storm like Hurricane Andrew in 1992.Until now, Andrew was ranked as Florida\u2019s most destructive storm, causing $27 billion in damage \u2014 $47 billion in today\u2019s dollars. Twenty-two insurers failed, leaving a million policyholders without coverage.Joseph L. Petrelli, president of Demotech, an Ohio-based company that reviews and rates regional and specialty insurers \u2014 including about 50 in Florida that represent 60 percent of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 insurance market \u2014 suggested that Irma could be more significant because it would cause such a wide swath of damage.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in history that every county in Florida was on hurricane watch,\u201d he said.Using the same benchmark as Mr. Hamid, Mr. Petrelli said he believed his Florida client insurers could withstand a storm like Hurricane Andrew, mainly because they currently hold more reinsurance than ever. He said he could not speak for the other insurers because he does not rate them.Reinsurance allows companies to transfer some of their exposure to other, well-capitalized companies, adding capacity but reducing their profits. Mr. Petrelli said that was why the national insurers pulled back from Florida \u2014 their reinsurance needs in other states were far less expensive and did not undermine profits.\u201cWe make them buy more reinsurance every year,\u201d he said of his Florida clients, \u201cbecause the value of homes goes up every year, the number of homes goes up every year, and the cost of repairs goes up every year.\u201d For the last few years, reinsurance prices had fallen, even for companies in high-risk Florida, because the state has not had a major storm since 2005.Specialized vehicles known as catastrophe bonds have also been more affordable for insurers. Michael Peltier, a spokesman for Citizens Property Insurance, said that when the company issued its first catastrophe bond, in 2012, investors demanded a yield of 21 percent. This year, he said, the rate was only 7 percent. Between reinsurance and catastrophe bonds, he said Citizens was able to increase its capacity to absorb losses this year by $1.3 billion, at a cost of $97 million.Industry experts think the losses from this year\u2019s storms could put an end to the buyer\u2019s market for reinsurance, however.The insurers pass at least some of the cost on to their customers. Homeowners in Florida spent about $1 billion on insurance in 1991, the year before Hurricane Andrew. Last year, they spent nearly $9 billion.\u201cInsurance rates are pretty high,\u201d said Mr. Hamid. \u201cThe average rate for $300,000 coverage, built pre-1992, is $11,500, and it\u2019s higher if you\u2019re near the coast.\u201dHe said the state\u2019s building codes had improved since Hurricane Andrew, and people who upgrade older houses to the new standards can get \u201ca huge discount\u201d on their premiums.The largest homeowners\u2019 insurance company in Florida remains Citizens Property Insurance. It was formed in 1993, and for many years it dominated the market in Florida, causing consternation because its size meant the state was bearing significant risk.By 2011, Citizens estimated that a 100-year storm would cause $24.5 billion in losses, and it had the resources \u2014 including the state catastrophe fund and reinsurance \u2014 to cover just $13 billion.That year, Citizens opened up its books and let the private insurers buy its most profitable policies, in big batches. The goal was to reduce the role of the state, so that while big risks would still be there, for-profit companies would bear more of them.The initiative succeeded, said Mr. Peltier, the company spokesman. Today, Citizens is about one-third its former size. With fewer policyholders, it estimated that it would get only $6.6 billion in claims after a 100-year storm. It has enough resources to cover that without taxpayers getting involved, company projections show. Citizens now screens prospective customers to make sure it takes only those deemed too risky for the companies to insure, like homeowners near the coasts.Citizens builds reserves, buys reinsurance and issues catastrophe bonds to sophisticated investors, just as the private insurers do, Mr. Peltier said. But Citizens also has a risk-management tool that private companies do not: the taxing power of the state. If Hurricane Irma turns out to be devastating enough to use up other resources, Citizens has the authority to assess virtually all policyholders in the state, no matter what type of insurance they hold or whether they bought it from Citizens.The private companies have nothing like that. If one exhausts its resources, it will end up insolvent. In such cases, the company is typically closed, and a state-led \u201cguarantee\u201d mechanism takes over, seeking to pay homeowners as much as possible from what is left and assessments on other insurers. Homeowners\u2019 claims would be unlikely to be paid in full.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the participation of big national carriers like State Farm and Allstate in the homeowners\u2019 insurance market in Florida. While they have cut back on writing policies, they have not withdrawn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The More We Connect, the Better It Gets \u2014 for Facebook", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs Facebook expands its global reach, it\u2019s looking to the developing world to increase its two-billion-strong user base. One pillar of its strategy is a mobile application called Free Basics, a portal that offers access to a limited number of websites at no charge.Facebook promotes Free Basics as a program for social good. The company describes Free Basics as an \u201con ramp\u201d that introduces the internet to people in the developing world. The goal, Facebook says in its promotional materials, is to \u201cbring more people online and help improve their lives.\u201d The three-year-old app is available to hundreds of millions of mobile phone users in more than 60 countries.Bringing more people online is a noble goal. About 50 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 mainly people in developing countries, women in particular \u2014 is still not online. Internet affordability remains staggeringly unequal across the globe: In Africa in 2015, one gigabyte of data cost more than 17 percent of the average person\u2019s income, while in the Europe and United States, it cost less than 1 percent.The head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has responded to these criticisms by saying, \u201cIt is always better to have some access than none at all.\u201dA study by the Alliance for Affordable Internet found that most Free Basics customers had used the internet before they began using Free Basics. This and other studies suggest that a large proportion of Free Basics users see the app as a way to get extra free time on Facebook \u2014 a way to stay connected with their Facebook friends without using up their data plans \u2014 and not as an \u201con ramp\u201d to the web. Facebook does not appear to be introducing people to the open internet, but it is making it easy for people who can afford smartphones and data plans to spend unlimited time in the company\u2019s closed, for-profit environment.One reason Free Basics may be missing the mark is that a mobile phone app isn\u2019t a good way to get poor people online. In rural areas, people are often disconnected because their region lacks cables, towers or a signal, rendering a mobile app useless. And the world\u2019s poorest people are typically left offline, regardless of where they live, because they cannot afford a smartphone.For the people who are getting a taste of the web through Free Basics, what does the app look like? The offerings differ in each region. Researchers testing the app in six countries found that more than half of the websites on the app\u2019s main screen belong to big companies like ESPN, Johnson & Johnson and Disney. Free Basics typically features some news sites (usually BBC and one or two national daily newspapers) and sites dedicated to things like finance and health care. But, at best, a user can see only about 150 websites, all of which are selected either by Facebook or by site operators.Free Basics users cannot see video. Many photos are removed. And if they want to click a link to explore an issue further, they can rarely do so.The unclickable links, unloadable videos and paltry supply of websites all appear to be part of an effort to minimize the cost of data traveling through the network. Perhaps those limitations do keep costs down \u2014 and make it possible for the service to be free \u2014 but this technical design also helps benefit Facebook\u2019s bottom line. It keeps users in a confined space, where the company can monitor and analyze their habits for profit.Whenever users click a website in Free Basics, that click sends packets of data to Facebook\u2019s servers. The company collects information about the websites that users visit, and other data like their phone numbers.This is no small matter. The likes and sharing habits of Facebook\u2019s billions of users provide a trove of data to sell to advertisers, eliminating the guesswork of figuring out what consumers care about or want to buy. For any advertiser, from the hyperlocal to the multinational, this is empirical gold.What the company has done instead cuts against the power of the open internet, where people can follow their curiosity, build new knowledge from scratch and participate in civic and economic life at local and even global levels.Facebook portrays itself as a benevolent entity that is introducing people to the web for the simple reason, cited in Free Basics promotional materials, that \u201cthe more we connect, the better it gets.\u201d The question is: better for whom?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Wisconsin, Foxconn Vowed Big Spending in Brazil. Few Jobs Have Come.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a news conference in Brazil, Foxconn officials unveiled plans to invest billions of dollars and build one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing hubs in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The government had high expectations that the project would yield 100,000 jobs.Six years later, Brazil is still waiting for most of those jobs to materialize.\u201cThe area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,\u201d said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even expressed an interest in meeting us.\u201dFoxconn\u2019s experience in Brazil and other parts of the world illustrates how difficult it has been for it to replicate its enormously successful Chinese manufacturing model elsewhere.But the model does not translate easily to other countries, where Foxconn must navigate different social, political and labor conditions.In Brazil, Foxconn\u2019s plans unraveled quickly. The administration that had wooed the company was soon swept from power amid corruption allegations and an impeachment vote. Some of the tax breaks that had been promised were reduced or abandoned, as economic growth and consumer spending slumped.Today, Foxconn employs only about 2,800 workers in Brazil.Foxconn does the \u201cbig song and dance, bringing out the Chinese dragon dancers, ribbon cuttings, toasts and signature of the usual boilerplate agreements,\u201d said Alberto Moel, an investor and adviser to early-stage tech companies who until recently was a technology analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThen, when it gets down to brass tacks, something way smaller materializes.\u201dFoxconn said in a statement that it was committed to investing billions of dollars in building facilities outside China. But the company also said it had been forced to adapt to changing conditions in markets like Brazil, where the economy had stagnated.\u201cThis and the changing needs of our customers that our proposed investments were designed to serve have resulted in scaled down operations in the country at this time,\u201d the company said in its statement.With regard to the Wisconsin project, Foxconn has said it plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturing campuses in the southeastern part of the state. The company expects the buildings that will make up the campus to total 20 million square feet \u2014 about three times the size of the Pentagon \u2014 and to help transform the region into a major production center for flat-panel display screens.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, called the Foxconn deal a \u201cgame changer\u201d that could help spur a manufacturing revival in the Midwest. At the White House in July, President Trump hailed the agreement as a great one for American manufacturing, American workers and \u201ceverybody who believes in the concept, in the label, Made in the U.S.A.\u201d Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin officially approved the deal on Monday.Foxconn has good reason to diversify its manufacturing operations. About 95 percent of the company\u2019s 1.1 million employees work in China. Building a large work force elsewhere could reduce the company\u2019s reliance on a single locale, lowering its risk if countries imposed tariffs or other trade barriers on Chinese exports.But exporting Foxconn\u2019s Chinese strategy is virtually impossible.The global supply chain for electronics remains firmly rooted in Asia, where advantages like low-cost labor and an abundance of skilled engineers have been crucial to the region\u2019s development as a manufacturing base.What makes Foxconn\u2019s Chinese operations really hum are the extraordinary level of government subsidies and support, and the sheer scale of those operations. Local governments often finance and build the company\u2019s factories, manage its dormitories and recruit tens of thousands of workers. Some government officials have gone door to door in small counties to recruit workers.The government aid can reach into the billions of dollars.Foxconn began to shift large-scale production operations beyond China in about 2009, when it opened plants elsewhere in Asia, including Vietnam and India. The company now has factories in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, and a large plant in Mexico that employs 18,000 workers.When several countries began to require that some components be made locally as a way of encouraging production at home, Foxconn stepped up its efforts to build outside China. And company executives essentially followed the same playbook they had used inside China.Foxconn\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, met with high-ranking leaders, including Brazil\u2019s president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Mr. Gou made pledges; won tax breaks and government concessions; and announced plans to spend billions of dollars to create tens of thousands of jobs in multiple countries. Brazil called one of the planned Foxconn sites the \u201cCity of the Future.\u201dThen reality set in.Labor strikes in India and Vietnam prompted Foxconn\u2019s operations in those countries to be shut down temporarily. Political and economic turmoil in Brazil led the authorities there to scale back some of tax breaks it had offered the company. A plan to invest $1 billion in the construction of a plant in Jakarta, Indonesia, collapsed, partly because Foxconn could not develop the supply chain it had hoped to, according to analysts and government officials.Foxconn\u2019s plans also fizzled in Pennsylvania. In 2013, the company, which has a small office in Harrisburg, said it intended to build a $30 million factory in the state that could employ 500 workers. The plant has yet to be built.Pennsylvania officials declined to comment on why the factory had not been built, but said that they had not given up hope. (Foxconn also did not comment.)\u201cWe do not believe Pennsylvania is out of the running for any particular project,\u201d David Smith, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development in Harrisburg, said about Foxconn\u2019s commitment in the state.For Foxconn, the move to Wisconsin offers political benefits.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump skewered China over what he deemed its unfair trade practices. He vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States and said his administration might impose a border tax on imports, raising the prospect of a trade war.After the election, Foxconn joined a parade of global companies bearing promises.Jack Ma, the executive chairman of the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, arrived at Trump Tower in New York and pledged to create one million jobs in America. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank of Japan, said his company would invest $50 billion in the United States. And at around the same time, Foxconn said it was planning to build production facilities in the United States.Wisconsin lawmakers pushed it through nonetheless, and when Mr. Walker approved the deal on Monday, he called it \u201ca truly transformational step for our state.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Brazil, and Joe Cochrane from Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Dealers, Too, Were Romantics", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewInto this anxious moment comes a wistfully romantic portrait of the postwar dealer Richard Bellamy, a passionate advocate for contemporary art and a notably indifferent businessman. \u201cDeadeye Dick: Richard Bellamy and His Circle,\u201d at Peter Freeman, Inc., lionizes Bellamy and his bohemian milieu \u2014 emphasizing the brief early-1960s tenure of the Green Gallery he founded on West 57th Street \u2014 while inviting some cleareyed judgments about the realities of running a gallery today.They include Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and Claes Oldenburg, who all made their New York solo debuts at the Green. They\u2019re represented at Freeman by audacious early works like Mr. Oldenburg\u2019s \u201cGiant Blue Men\u2019s Pants\u201d from his 1962 outing, a pair of enormous painted-canvas slacks casually draped over a hanger; and Mr. Flavin\u2019s 1964 light piece \u201ca primary picture,\u201d made of red, yellow and blue fluorescent bulbs arranged to resemble an empty frame. \u201cDeadeye Dick\u201d almost makes you feel like you\u2019re encountering these pieces for the first time \u2014 a rare feat, given the current blue-chip status of these artists and their hushed presentation in big museums and mega-galleries.Other, less familiar names are given equal billing, which is heartening because it would have been all too easy to convene a winners-only exhibition. A 1956 wood, gravel and metal relief painting by Jean Follett (one of few women on the Green roster) makes an earthy, Jean Dubuffet-like impact. And the painter and critic Sidney Tillim pays tribute to his fellow art writer Clement Greenberg in his mysterious allegory \u201cWho Among Us Really Knows? Or Greenberg\u2019s Doubt,\u201d from 1969.How might we characterize Bellamy\u2019s taste, on the basis of \u201cDeadeye Dick\u201d? Early works by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman and Mark di Suvero (the subject of the Green\u2019s first solo, and one of just a handful of artists Bellamy represented at the time of his death) evince an intuitive response to sculpture. His painting sensibilities are harder to define, with bracingly austere abstract works by Mary Corse, Myron Stout and Jo Baer offset at Freeman by the helter-skelter figuration of Jan M\u00fcller\u2019s \u201cTemptation of Saint Anthony\u201d (1957).A selection of ephemera confirms that Bellamy was way out front in fostering participatory and performative projects like Oldenburg\u2019s pop-up \u201cStore\u201d on the Lower East Side (1961) and the duo of Tehching Hsieh and Linda Montano\u2019s \u201cArt/Life One Year Performance\u201d (1983-4), conducted partly in Bellamy\u2019s final gallery venture, Oil & Steel, which began in TriBeCa.When it came to closing deals, however, Bellamy lagged behind contemporaries like Sidney Janis and Castelli. \u201cThere was no real thinking about the business aspect, or what a stable of artists means, or what a dealer does to promote them apart from sitting there and trying to sell a painting every time someone asks the price of it,\u201d Bellamy later acknowledged. Often in the Green Gallery years, Ms. Stein writes, he wasn\u2019t even \u201csitting there\u201d; he was napping in the back room, or out at a bar, having taken the gallery\u2019s phones off the hook.How would this reluctant salesman have fared in today\u2019s hyper-professionalized art world, our society, per Mr. Freymond-Guth, of \u201cpower, finance, and exclusion\u201d? Would Bellamy have scouted studios in Mexico City and Berlin, opened a branch in Los Angeles and another in Brussels? Would he have done all the fairs, monitored the contemporary auctions, wooed new collectors on Instagram, hired a public relations team?I think we know the answer.A review on Friday about \u201cDeadeye Dick: Richard Bellamy and His Circle,\u201d at Peter Freeman, Inc., misspelled the surname of an artist whose work is featured in the exhibit.

We\u2019ve Got Answers to Your Questions.", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "Part 1Both are accurate, but they mean different things.You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because \u201cthe weather has been so cold\u201d in winter. But the claim is false. Scientists have used both terms for decades.Two degrees is more significant than it sounds.As of early 2017, the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 1 degree Celsius) since 1880, when records began at a global scale. The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high, which explains why much of the world\u2019s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists say, the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which would undermine the planet\u2019s capacity to support a large human population.We\u2019ve known about it for more than a century. Really.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.This one is nailed down.Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity. Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past, but those changes took thousands of years. Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.Nope.In theory, they could be. If the sun were to start putting out more radiation, for instance, that would definitely warm the Earth. But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough. The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.Mostly because of ideology. Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.Part 2Big trouble.Are you rich enough to shield your descendants?The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects, whether they know it or not. Because of sea level rise, for instance, some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate, scientists have calculated. Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming. The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change. Of course, as with almost all other social problems, poor people will be hit first and hardest.The real question is how fast.The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.Some of it is.Part 3Yes, but change is happening too slowly.Society has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe, scientists say. But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act. The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero. The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars, stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants. But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.Virtually every country agreed to limit future emissions.Job growth in renewable energy is strong.The transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers, like coal companies, but it also creates jobs. The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining.Both could help clean up the energy system.Hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run. The fracking itself can also create local pollution.Sales are still small overall, but they are rising fast.It\u2019s just jargon for putting a price on pollution.The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d for short. That is because two of the most important gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. (Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category, even if they do not actually contain carbon.) When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions, which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them.Start by sharing this with 50 of your friends.You can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.Leading corporations, including large manufacturers like carmakers, are starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, support the companies taking the lead, and let the others know you expect them to do better.These personal steps may be small in the scheme of things, but they can raise your own consciousness about the problem \u2014 and the awareness of the people around you. In fact, discussing this issue with your friends and family is one of the most meaningful things you can do.Produced by Gray Beltran and Rumsey Taylor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Say They Will Not Vote on Health Bill", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans on Tuesday officially abandoned the latest plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, shelving a showdown vote on the measure and effectively admitting defeat in their last-gasp drive to fulfill a core promise of President Trump and Republican lawmakers.\u201cWe haven\u2019t given up on changing the American health care system,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after a lunchtime meeting of Republican senators. \u201cWe are not going to be able to do that this week, but it still lies ahead of us, and we haven\u2019t given up on that.\u201dMr. McConnell said Republicans would move on to their next big legislative goal: overhauling the tax code, a feat that has not been accomplished since 1986.Democrats, who have spent all year fighting to protect the Affordable Care Act, a law that is a pillar of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, responded by calling for the resumption of bipartisan negotiations to stabilize health insurance markets. Republican leaders had squelched those talks as the latest repeal plan, written by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, gained steam.\u201cWe hope we can move forward and improve health care, not engage in another battle to take it away from people, because they will fail once again if they try,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.The decision by Senate Republican leaders may prove to be a milestone in the decades-long fight over health insurance in the United States, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act had gained at least a reprieve and perhaps a measure of political acceptance.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been working on legislation to stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums in the next couple of years. Both said on Tuesday that they hoped to resume those efforts.Thirteen lawmakers from 12 states have opposed at least one of the Senate\u2019s five major repeal efforts in recent months.And health care is sure to be an issue in next year\u2019s midterm elections.Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the concept behind the Graham-Cassidy bill would help Republicans define their differences with Democrats in the campaign season.\u201cSingle payer, socialism \u2014 or federalism, returning power to the states to make decisions,\u201d Mr. Thune said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great contrast for us, and I think that\u2019s an argument eventually we can win.\u201dFor their part, Democrats have tried to use health care as a bludgeon against the few Senate Republican targets they have next year, mainly Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona.\u201cWe know Republicans like Dean Heller and Jeff Flake won\u2019t stop until they force Americans to pay more for less, and we will make sure voters hold them accountable for it,\u201d the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement this week.The Graham-Cassidy bill would have taken money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and sent it to states in the form of block grants.This time, Senate Republicans were trying to pass a different proposal, and a deadline was fast approaching: They had only until the end of this week to pass a repeal bill using special budget rules that shield it from a Democratic filibuster.Mr. McConnell had planned for a vote before that deadline, but he could afford to lose only two Republicans. By Tuesday, three members of his party had already gone public with their firm opposition: Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.None of the three senators seemed likely to change their minds. Mr. McCain detested the hasty, partisan process used to push the bill; Ms. Collins had broad concerns about the legislation\u2019s effects on health care; and Mr. Paul objected to the fundamental architecture of the bill, which in his view constituted \u201cfake repeal.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he saw no reason for the Senate to vote.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the votes,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t see why we would waste the time of the Senate.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. Senate cannot get the text of a bill on a Sunday night, then proceed to a vote just days later, with only one hearing \u2014 and especially not on an issue that is intensely personal to all of us,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said, without saying which way she would have voted.Mr. Cassidy was blunt: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the votes,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAm I disappointed? Absolutely.\u201dAnd Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, was left fuming.\u201cI am kind of disgusted that after nine months, the self-interest is still outweighing the national interest in our caucus in some ways,\u201d he said.But Mr. Graham still held out the hope that the repeal proposal would pass \u2014 just later, after Republicans tackle taxes, and when Republicans can consider the repeal plan in a more deliberative fashion.\u201cThere are 50 votes for the substance,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cThere are not 50 votes for the process.\u201dBut that could be months away \u2014 if not years.President Trump has taken action on at least four fronts to undermine the Affordable Care Act.The tax effort will probably occupy Congress through the remainder of this year, and into next year.After tackling the tax overhaul, Republicans could make another attempt at passing a health bill without needing any Democratic votes. But such an undertaking would require passing yet another budget blueprint, in order to protect the bill from a Democratic filibuster, and it would put health care front and center as lawmakers head into the midterm elections.Even as Republicans shift their focus to taxes, pressure is building for a bipartisan response to the problems of the health care system. The Alexander-Murray stabilization package has two main elements: money for subsidies paid to insurance companies, to reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and more freedom for states to revamp their insurance markets.Democrats see the cost-sharing subsidy payments as essential. But many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have described them as a bailout for insurance companies that would prop up the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI think most of the members would suggest they really don\u2019t know that they can stabilize the product at this stage of the game,\u201d said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. \u201cI think there\u2019s a number of them that are going to be very hesitant to try to put more money into a system that they are convinced is going south.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, with little hope of success in the Senate, Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure.\u201cAt some point there will be a repeal and replace, but we\u2019ll see whether or not that point is now or will it be shortly thereafter,\u201d he said at the White House. \u201cBut we are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re a little frustrated that the Senate has not acted on a seminal promise,\u201d said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.Then he returned to talking up the need for a tax overhaul.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Center-Right Party Hangs On in New Zealand Election", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 After a tumultuous campaign, the center-right governing party in New Zealand placed first in the country\u2019s general election on Saturday, but failed to capture a parliamentary majority, meaning it will have to assemble a coalition if it wants to extend its nine-year hold on power.With nearly all the votes counted, the National Party took 46 percent of the vote, beating back a late surge by the center-left Labour Party, which received 35.8 percent, according to the Electoral Commission. Smaller parties took the rest.Late Saturday night, Prime Minister Bill English delivered a victory speech in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city, but his main challenger, the Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern, did not immediately concede defeat.Mr. English failed in a previous bid to become prime minister in 2002, when he was National\u2019s leader, so the party\u2019s first-place finish on Saturday was something of a vindication.During the campaign, she emphasized issues including child poverty, environmental management and housing affordability.In the end, however, her efforts appeared to have fallen short.Neither of the main parties won a majority of the 120-seat Parliament, which means that National, with 58 seats, and Labour, with 45, will now try to court minor parties to form a coalition \u2014 a process that could take days or even weeks.Given its advantage, National is more likely to succeed, but to do so, it will need support from Winston Peters, a populist whose right-leaning New Zealand First party won nine seats.Mr. Peters, 72, who is poised to act as kingmaker, did not tip his hand on Saturday, boarding a ferry to go home as reporters peppered him with questions. He said he would reach a decision by Oct. 12.Amid blue balloons and triumphant applause, Mr. English, 55, told supporters at Sky City Casino in Auckland, \u201cWe gave it everything, and we got better and better.\u201dMs. Ardern reminded supporters that she had once called the Labour leader\u2019s position \u201cthe worst job in politics,\u201d adding that she had now changed her mind. She said that the party and its supporters had given it \u201ctheir all\u201d and that, while she had called Mr. English to acknowledge that National had won the most votes, she was not ready to admit defeat.The campaign was raucous, at least by the standards of New Zealand, a prosperous member of the Commonwealth that has largely been spared the divisive debate over migration that has roiled its larger neighbor, Australia.The resignations of Mr. Key and of Mr. Little put new leaders in charge of the two biggest parties.Adding more uncertainty to the result is a likely high number of \u201cspecial votes\u201d \u2014 ballots cast by New Zealanders living overseas and by people registering to vote on the same day they cast their ballot. The count from those votes is expected by Oct. 7.In the 2014 election, 12.5 percent of the ballots cast were special votes, and they tend to trend leftward. National lost one seat, and the Greens picked up one, as a result of the special-vote tally that year.A major upset in Saturday\u2019s results was the vanquishing of the Maori Party, a group which grew out of protest action about indigenous rights to New Zealand\u2019s foreshore and seabed.Formed in 2004, the party won two seats at the 2014 election; in the next Parliament, it will have none.The right-leaning, libertarian ACT party, a traditional coalition partner for National, won a single seat, with its leader, David Seymour, returned to Parliament.Gareth Morgan, a millionaire making his first attempt at Parliament as the leader of the Opportunities Party, received 2.2 percent of votes, too few to win a seat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At CNN, Retracted Story Leaves an Elite Reporting Team Bruised", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate on a Monday afternoon in June, members of CNN\u2019s elite investigations team were summoned to a fourth-floor room in the network\u2019s glassy headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.In interviews with The New York Times, more than half a dozen CNN staff members, including three with direct knowledge of the investigative unit\u2019s operations, provided previously unreported details about the publication of the story and the fallout from its retraction. Citing fear of retribution, the people requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal information.In the weeks since the story was retracted, the investigative team has been reshaped and redirected. Its members were told they should not report on perhaps the most compelling political story of the year: potential ties between the Trump administration and Russia. That subject is now largely handled by CNN\u2019s reporting team in Washington. The political whizzes of KFile, a group of Internet-savvy reporters poached from BuzzFeed that was untainted by the retraction, were transferred out of the investigative team.The remaining team members have resumed publishing, but with a narrower reporting scope; they now focus on topics less glamorous than Mr. Trump\u2019s potential ties to Russia, like the opioid crisis and the environment.\u201cFor 37 years, CNN has done award winning investigative work that has led to fundamental changes at some of the country\u2019s most important institutions,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cThis year, CNN has gone even further, devoting additional time, talent and resources to an expanded investigative team. While there have been lessons learned along the way, one thing has remained constant \u2014 our unwavering commitment to this type of work at a time when it has never been more important.\u201dIn a memo introducing the new unit in January, Andrew Morse, an executive vice president at CNN, trumpeted an expansion that he said would \u201csupercharge\u201d the network\u2019s commitment to investigative journalism.The memo envisioned a robust team of more than 25 reporters and producers that would include new hires and star correspondents gathered from other parts of the network, including Sara Ganim, a Pulitzer Prize winner for her coverage of the Penn State sexual abuse scandal.Mr. Zucker courted A-list journalists to join the team; in April, CNN scored a coup, hiring Eric Lichtblau, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter from The New York Times.Members of the unit initially expected to have plenty of time to report on a wide variety of stories. But, increasingly, CNN journalists said, the team was pulled into day-to-day political developments in Washington, especially the Trump campaign\u2019s potential connections to Russia; at times, it resembled more of a rapid-response team. At the same time, the pressure to produce scoops increased.It was in that heated environment that the first major public lapse involving the team occurred.The article ran under the bylines of Mr. Lichtblau; the anchors Jake Tapper and Gloria Borger; and a producer, Brian Rokus. Ms. Borger relayed the news to viewers on-air.But the network soon began hearing from sources who said the information in the article was wrong. CNN was forced to issue a correction.In the newsroom, some colleagues of Mr. Lichtblau, who had only recently joined the network, blamed him for the mistake; others defended him. It was a sign of the tension that already existed between CNN\u2019s Washington bureau and the upstart investigative unit, which were jousting over the various reporting lines of the Trump-Russia story, two people said. The botched Comey story only exacerbated it.The mistake also drew the ire of Mr. Zucker, who told his journalists that the political climate \u2014 with CNN in Mr. Trump\u2019s cross hairs \u2014 left no room for error.It was in this strained environment that, less than three weeks later, the investigative unit found itself at the center of a more consequential blunder.On June 22, a modest, 950-word story appeared on CNN\u2019s website, reporting that a Trump adviser named Anthony Scaramucci \u2014 at the time not yet a household name \u2014 had ties to a Russian investment fund that had attracted the attention of investigators in the United States Senate.The story said that the Senate Intelligence Committee was examining the fund and that Mr. Scaramucci had met with the head of the fund, Kirill Dmitriev, several days before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. It also said the Treasury Department had been looking into the meeting at the request of two Democratic senators, who had expressed concern that Mr. Scaramucci might have promised to help get sanctions against Russia waived by the new administration.The story was written by Thomas Frank, who had been a Pulitzer Prize finalist at USA Today. But Mr. Scaramucci, who was jockeying for a position in the White House, disputed the information when CNN contacted him for comment, according to a person close to Mr. Scaramucci; the story quoted Mr. Scaramucci as saying \u201cthere is nothing there,\u201d in reference to his meeting with Mr. Dmitriev.Mr. Lichtblau was editing the article and, according to the people with direct knowledge of the events, he sent a draft of the story to Lex Haris, the head of the investigative unit. Mr. Haris, who was traveling to Phoenix for a conference, signed off \u2014 as long as the story passed muster with CNN\u2019s internal review system, known as the Triad.The Triad includes CNN\u2019s fact-checkers and its standards team, both of which approved the article. But the third prong, the legal department, had at least one question that went unanswered.It is not clear what specific concerns the legal department raised, or why Mr. Lichtblau and Mr. Haris did not address them; journalists at CNN said it was sometimes difficult to keep track of the flurry of inquiries that could come during the review process. (Mr. Frank, Mr. Haris and Mr. Lichtblau declined to comment for this story.)Mr. Lichtblau moved forward with publication. He emailed an editor affiliated with KFile, Kyle Blaine, who had not been involved in the story, and instructed him to publish it on his behalf.When the story was posted that afternoon, it received little attention \u2014 inside the newsroom and out. But Mr. Scaramucci and his representatives quickly contacted CNN officials, including the network\u2019s Washington bureau chief, Sam Feist, to complain. It was an \u201call hands on deck\u2019\u2019 rebuttal, said the person familiar with Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s response.When CNN managers began to review the piece, they discovered the legal department\u2019s concerns \u2014 and that they had not been addressed. They also realized a factual error had slipped through the fact-checking process; it was a technicality related to a Russian bank\u2019s relationship to the fund, but managers found it to have been a troubling lapse.And there was a more problematic issue, two people familiar with the review said.Mr. Frank\u2019s single source had wavered before the story was published, expressing concern about how the information was being presented. But Mr. Frank had not relayed that hesitancy to his colleagues.Between Mr. Frank\u2019s wavering source and the discovery of breakdowns in the editorial vetting process, executives concluded that the network could not stand behind the story. The day after the article was published, CNN removed it from its website and issued a formal retraction and an apology to Mr. Scaramucci.It is still unclear to what degree the story was inaccurate. CNN has never said that the article\u2019s reporting was incorrect, and Mr. Zucker made clear on a morning conference call, soon after the retraction, that the network would not go back and report the story again.Some journalists inside and outside the network said privately that they believed the story was materially true. But the story also suffered from a lack of clarity. A reader could easily come away with the impression that Mr. Scaramucci himself was under investigation for some kind of illicit dealings with the Russians \u2014 an assertion that the article does not explicitly make.As Breitbart News and other CNN critics gloated over the retraction, Mr. Zucker decided that stern action was necessary to demonstrate to its employees \u2014 and to the outside world \u2014 that the network would not tolerate such mistakes. The network asked Mr. Lichtblau, Mr. Haris and Mr. Frank to resign.The episode shocked many inside CNN and created anxiety in the newsroom. Some staff members said they thought the punishment had been overly harsh, a view expressed by some media commentators as well.Though corrections are not uncommon for news organizations, full retractions are more unusual and typically signify major factual errors or ethical breaches. When news organizations do retract a story, they normally also make an effort to correct the record, and explain to the reader what went wrong. But the brief editor\u2019s note from CNN, some journalism experts said, provided more questions than answers.\u201cCNN failed in its duty to enlighten the public,\u201d said Edward Wasserman, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cInstead, it muddied the waters to correct something and we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s correcting.\u201dMr. Trump quickly seized on the resignations. He posted on Twitter the next morning, \u201cWow, CNN had to retract big story on \u2018Russia,\u2019 with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!\u2019\u2019At CNN, executives took some time to regroup. Mr. Zucker vowed that the network would not be cowed by the Trump administration. After a reassessment period, CNN asked the investigative unit to resume its work. Its ranks have been replenished: new journalists have been brought on from other parts of CNN, and there is a new team leader in place, Matt Lait, a veteran former editor at The Los Angeles Times.On Aug. 2, weeks after he informed the investigative team of the resignations, Mr. Burke, the CNN executive, convened another meeting \u2014 this time to outline the unit\u2019s refocused mission. The team would engage in longer-term reporting on national issues, with less focus on the White House. He affirmed that the unit should leave the Russia investigation story to CNN\u2019s staff in Washington.Mr. Scaramucci, meanwhile, had been named Mr. Trump\u2019s communications director. His successful tangling with CNN was said to have greatly pleased the president. Before Mr. Scaramucci was himself forced out of the White House, he was overheard on a live television microphone referring to the retracted story and Mr. Zucker.\u201cHe helped me get the job by hitting those guys,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said, referring to the resignations. He added, \u201cTell him he\u2019s not getting a placement fee for getting me the job.\u201dA picture on Wednesday with an article about a report retracted by CNN was published in error. It showed Thomas Frank, a political analyst, historian and the author of \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Kansas\u201d \u2014 not the former CNN reporter Thomas Frank, who wrote the CNN article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governors Rally Around Health Law Fixes as White House Pushes Repeal", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Governors from both political parties told Congress on Thursday that they supported immediate action on modest, bipartisan steps to repair the Affordable Care Act without repealing it, even as the Trump administration continued to encourage efforts to dismantle the law.Testifying at a hearing of the Senate health committee, governors from Colorado, Massachusetts, Montana, Tennessee and Utah endorsed proposals to stabilize health insurance markets by providing federal money for continued payment of subsidies to insurance companies to offset the cost of discounts provided to low-income people.\u201cCongress should take steps now to prevent the total collapse of the health insurance market\u201d by providing money for the \u201ccost-sharing\u201d subsidies, said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, a Republican.Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat, said, \u201cIf this committee is genuinely concerned with stabilizing the individual marketplace, the most important step it can take in the near term is ensuring funding for the cost-sharing reduction payments for at least the next two years.\u201dSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the health committee, is working with the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, on legislation that would finance the cost-sharing subsidies through 2018 and perhaps 2019 as well.Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said on Thursday that he had White House support for a bill that would repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with lump-sum payments to states that could be used for a variety of health insurance programs.Mr. Cassidy said Vice President Mike Pence was encouraging senators and governors to support the proposal for block grants, which he drafted with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, said on Fox News: \u201cThe president is ready. He\u2019s ready with pen in hand to sign health care reform if, say, Graham-Cassidy moves forward. A lot of the governors seem to be supportive of that.\u201dDescribing his proposal, Mr. Cassidy said: \u201cEvery American, no matter where that American lives, will ultimately get about the same amount of money to support health care. Right now four states get 37 percent of all the money that is spent on behalf of the Affordable Care Act. We equalize that.\u201dMr. Cassidy said his bill was being drafted so it could be approved in the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes usually required for major legislation.But Mr. Cassidy and his bill face long odds. The procedural device that allows Republicans to sidestep a Democratic filibuster on health care will not be available after Sept. 30, little more than three weeks from now, the Senate parliamentarian said last week.Mr. Cassidy has not finished writing the bill, no committee has held a hearing on it, and the Congressional Budget Office would need to analyze it \u2014 a task that could take two weeks \u2014 before the Senate could vote on it.Optima Health, a Virginia-based insurer, announced on Wednesday that it would limit its participation in the individual insurance market next year, raising the possibility that people in dozens of Virginia counties might not have any insurance options. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said the announcement showed the urgent need for congressional action and the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration\u2019s threat to stop the cost-sharing subsidies.Mr. Kaine said he would not support Mr. Cassidy\u2019s proposal for a block grant because it \u201creally penalizes Virginia.\u201d Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, also spoke out against it.\u201cThe proposal would dramatically negatively affect the commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking billions and billions of dollars over the course of the next four or five years.\u201dMr. Baker said the formula for distributing block-grant funds ignored the fact that Massachusetts was a high-wage state with relatively high health care costs.Insurers that want to participate in the federal insurance marketplace are supposed to sign contracts with the federal government by Sept. 27. The fifth annual open enrollment period, when consumers can sign up for coverage, is scheduled to start on Nov. 1 and end on Dec. 15.To shore up insurance markets before then, Mr. Alexander said, lawmakers will need to compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to be for extending the cost-sharing payments,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. But \u201cto get a Republican president, a Republican House and a Republican Senate just to vote for more money won\u2019t happen in the next two or three weeks unless there\u2019s some restructuring\u201d of insurance market regulation to address Republican concerns.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Aimed to Fight in Syria. ISIS Had a Broader Plan: Southeast Asia", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPURWOREJO KLAMPOK, Indonesia \u2014 The quiet young Indonesian aircraft mechanic dashed out of his relatives\u2019 home in a hurry in February and disappeared. The next time his anxious family would get word of him would be three months later, on the television news.The authorities announced that the man, Yoki Pratama Windyarto, 21, was one of seven Indonesians who had joined the Islamic State and gone to the Philippines to fight on the island of Mindanao.His family had not even known that he had a passport.And then another shock: Weeks later, his mother, Sri Eny Windarti, received an anonymous call saying that her son had been martyred, and got a text message with a picture of him lying dead on the battlefield, a pool of blood under his head.\u201cWhat caused him to go there is a big question for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no idea what happened to him.\u201dThe militants fighting in Marawi opposed the government long before they announced loyalty to the Islamic State, known as ISIS or ISIL. But in addition to the propaganda value of linking themselves to the militant group, recent evidence suggests that they have received financing and other assistance from the Islamic State command.Among those helping to recruit foreign fighters have been Indonesians who went to Syria, joined the Islamic State and rose to leadership positions, said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, a research organization in Jakarta. Another who has taken a leading role in recruitment for the group is a former law lecturer from Malaysia who is part of the inner circle of militant leaders in Marawi, the authorities say.Once Mr. Windyarto arrived in the Philippines, he was told to recruit his jihadi friends to come to Mindanao for a \u201cbig party\u201d in May.The siege of Marawi began in May, when Philippine troops tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State leader in Southeast Asia, and stumbled upon hundreds of militants massing for an assault.In Manila, Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, a spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said that most of the foreign fighters had come from neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia. Fighters from Arab countries and Bangladesh are believed to be among them, he said, but their sightings are unconfirmed.\u201cThere have been a number of foreign fighters who made their way here under the guise of humanitarian workers,\u201d he said. \u201cSome come through the back door. It\u2019s a very porous border.\u201dIndonesian Islamists, in particular, have long had ties to Mindanao. In the 1990s, they received military training at a camp near Marawi. In the 2000s, Mindanao became a transit point for Indonesians returning from fighting in Afghanistan and a sanctuary for others wanted in a string of terrorist bombings in Indonesia.\u201cMarawi is not strange for Indonesian jihadis,\u201d said Ansyaad Mbai, the former head of Indonesia\u2019s National Counterterrorism Agency. \u201cAll Indonesian jihadis are familiar with this place.\u201dToday, the most prominent foreigner among the militants in the Philippines is Mahmud Ahmad, a Malaysian and onetime Islamic law lecturer who fled to Mindanao in 2014.A seized video of a strategy meeting before the battle shows him in the militants\u2019 inner circle with Mr. Hapilon, Mr. Maute and Mr. Maute\u2019s brother Abdullah, a fellow leader of the Maute Group. The former lecturer is known among the militants there as Dr. Mahmud.\u201cDr. Mahmud appears to be senior to anyone operating in Indonesia, meaning whatever the intergroup frictions, all recognize a chain of command within the ISIS hierarchy that they are obliged to obey by virtue of their oath,\u201d the report says.Among those Mr. Mahmud helped bring to Marawi was Mr. Windyarto.The young aircraft mechanic grew up in a mostly Muslim neighborhood in the central Java town of Purworejo Klampok, a tolerant community about 250 miles east of Jakarta. The family is doing well by local standards: His mother is an English teacher, his father a town official.A few years ago, Mr. Windyarto was accepted into a university. But his parents said the cost was too high and sent him to the Indonesia Aviation School, a strict boarding school in the city of Tangerang, west of Jakarta.He began studying aviation maintenance there in 2013. At first he was despondent. His head was shaved and he was not allowed to leave or talk to anyone by phone for three months. He graduated in September of last year, shortly before his 21st birthday, and moved in with his uncle while waiting to start a job as a trainee at Garuda Indonesia, the state airline.Mr. Windyarto had always been devout. And during his stay in Bekasi he expressed conservative religious views to some family members, including the idea that women should not work outside the home.But in interviews, more than a dozen relatives said they had not realized that he had embraced a radical ideology. He never spoke about the Islamic State or Syria, they said, speculating that he had been recruited online.But Ms. Jones, a leading expert on terrorism in Southeast Asia, said evidence indicated that he had been recruited by Islamists in person after he was allowed to leave campus.By 2015, he had joined a little-known Islamist network called Al Hawariyun, or \u201cThe Helpers,\u201d and took part in military training outside Jakarta, according to her institute\u2019s report.The network\u2019s first leader, the cleric Ustadz Nanang Ainur Rafiq, went to Syria in 2015 and was killed last year fighting Kurdish forces. The next leader, Abu Nusaibah, was arrested in November with eight followers on charges that they were plotting to set off a riot at a huge election protest against the governor of Jakarta.More than 500 Indonesians have joined the Islamic State in Syria, including families with children, Ms. Jones said. About 100 fighters have been killed in combat or by airstrikes; others have risen within the Islamic State\u2019s ranks.But when the two militants contacted Indonesian operatives with the Islamic State in Syria, they were urged to go to Mindanao instead and told to contact Mr. Mahmud, the report says. He agreed to help and directed a member of a rival Islamist group in Central Java to organize their travel.In mid-December, even before starting his job with Garuda, Mr. Windyarto quietly got a passport.Mr. Windyarto was briefly ill in mid-February, and his mother went to Bekasi to care for him. Even then, she said, he gave no hint of his plan to leave.But after she left, he emptied his bank account, dropped out of the family WhatsApp messaging group and sold his motorbike and laptop, she said. Then, on Feb. 27, he made a quick visit to the house in Bekasi when only his aunt was home, retrieving a flash data drive before rushing off. He never spoke with a family member again.On March 20, his parents, suspecting that he might have run off to join militants, filed a missing person\u2019s report and asked the police to block him from leaving the country.Even so, they said they were shocked on May 31, when the Indonesian police announced on national television that their son and six other Indonesians were wanted for involvement in Islamic State terrorism in Marawi.The phone call that Ms. Windarti dreaded came on June 20. A man speaking English told her that her son had become a \u201cshahid\u201d \u2014 a martyr.He texted her the picture of her son\u2019s body lying on the ground.Family members cling to the hope that he may somehow be alive, perhaps having faked his death to escape. But there have been few answers.\u201cIf we use our normal logic, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said his uncle, Anto Kuswanto, in Bekasi. \u201cWe educated him to be a good guy. He had never even been in an airplane.\u201dFira Abdurachman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Boys of Brexit: Tony Blair and Nigel Farage", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "OpinionThe veteran pols on either side of the vituperative, vertiginous Brexit debate spar.Supported byLONDON \u2014 It seems like an impossible feat. But Tony Blair has done it. He has made himself even less popular in Britain.And this, on the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana\u2019s death, when everyone should be grateful that he helped save the monarchy by forcing the royal family to put aside its distaste for Di\u2019s modern, confessional, subversive ways, climb out of its crusty shell and pay more respect to \u201cthe people\u2019s princess,\u201d as Blair ingeniously christened her.The 64-year-old Blair is more gray, but his eyes are bright blue and he looks trim in a navy suit, sans tie. The country he once worked to unite is fractured now over Brexit and he \u2014 a decade after his time as prime minister \u2014 finds himself as a key player in trying to undo what voters did last year. Nigel Farage, the Brexit ringleader, has blamed Blair, in part, for throwing open the borders to \u201crub our noses in diversity.\u201dThe two men, one working in London and one in Brussels, are not fresh faces in Britain. But they are facing off as nemeses, like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Moriarty wresting on the edge of a cliff, over where the country will go next.Recalling his intervention with the royal family, Blair said, \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to make sure that you try and keep the country together and united and, look, it was an extraordinary time because I\u2019d literally just come into office.\u201d He related those days as we sat in his Mayfair office \u2014 the same one used by John Adams when he was the ambassador here \u2014 and sipped coffee out of white porcelain cups.\u201cIf you think back to when she became queen, roughly when I was born,\u201d he said of Elizabeth, \u201cthere was still an age of deference around. We\u2019re past the age of deference. So what she understood was, the monarchy could only stay the monarchy if it could justify itself on its own terms. That process of modernization of the monarchy was very important. But you have to do it without losing that mystique and mystery.\u201dHe says he has never seen Michael Sheen\u2019s take on him in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d and he has not watched \u201cThe Crown,\u201d its twin jewel in Peter Morgan\u2019s prodigious effort to put a shine back on Queen Elizabeth after the Diana debacle.(He has seen the famous Hugh Grant dance from \u201cLove Actually,\u201d and said he did it himself, not as well, after winning the Olympics bid in 2005 and almost did it again after the Irish peace deal was struck.)Did Blair ever think he would see a time when the royal family would keep calm and carry on as the queen\u2019s grandson moved toward marrying an American TV actress who is divorced and half black?\u201cYeah, I mean, it\u2019s great,\u201d he said.And for Blair, all deference disappeared when the British had their suspicions confirmed that the selling of the Iraq invasion was based on sexed-up evidence, and that their prime minister\u2019s role as W.\u2019s enabler and simultaneous translator had helped pave the path to endless war and ISIS.Blair has plunged back into the fray as a leading advocate for overturning Brexit. His office \u2014 along with David Geffen\u2019s yacht, to which Blair is no stranger \u2014 is ground zero for the global elite. Although he bristled at that term. \u201cOn this elite thing, the progressives are just going to stand up for themselves and push back against\u201d that hooey, he said, using a stronger word. \u201cThe idea that the handful of right-wing media proprietors here are some ordinary Joes from the street, I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous. There are elites on both sides.\u201dWhile we\u2019re on the subject of right-wing media proprietors, I broached the subject of his former benefactor and buddy Rupert Murdoch, who cut him off when he came to believe that Blair had been involved with his then-wife, Wendi. (Blair denies it.) Will they ever be friends again?\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll comment on that one,\u201d Blair said with a tight smile.I asked if his quixotic push against Brexit was an expiation for his push for the Iraq war \u2014 even though he maintains that, as he looks at Syria, he still feels it was right to go into Iraq.\u201cNo is the answer to that,\u201d he replied.I\u2019ve always thought Blair was one of a handful of people who could have stopped the Iraq war, and I was fierce in my criticisms of him.In London, though, I stopped short of doing what some here, including a bartender at a hip London restaurant where Blair was dining, have done: a citizen\u2019s arrest for crimes against peace. (A website called arrestblair.org \u2014 with a current pot of over 10,000 pounds \u2014 offers a reward for Blair\u2019s capture, or attempted capture.)Even though he stiffened, I asked why he helped W. switch 9/11 villains from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein.\u201cWhat I would say is that our anxiety, particularly straight after 9/11, was that you would end up in a situation where these unstable dictatorships, you know, which combined with terrorism to cause mass destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned about this issue is that there\u2019s no point in me trying to relitigate it with people.\u201dI asked about speculation that he had bonded with W. over their strong Christian faith. \u201cNot really,\u201d he replied.He\u2019s Teflon Tony no more. I wondered if he thought he could ever get beyond it, the way W. has become more popular in contrast to President Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t know is the truthful answer,\u201d he said.Some Britains even blame Blair for Brexit, arguing that the emotional release he encouraged in the stiff-upper-lip country after Diana\u2019s death uncorked a reservoir of decidedly un-British visceral feeling.\u201cDrawing a line from Princess Diana to Brexit is a bit of a stretch, I would say,\u201d he said curtly.Blair\u2019s office is decorated with paintings and a map of the Middle East, where he served as special envoy for the \u201cquartet\u201d of the U.S., the U.N., the E.U. and Russia. W.\u2019s book of paintings sits on a shelf.Blair knows Jared Kushner \u2014 he has not met Trump \u2014 so I asked what he thought of the son-in-law\u2019s epic task of making Middle East peace.\u201cThe fact that someone\u2019s not got a long institutional experience of these issues isn\u2019t necessarily a disadvantage,\u201d Blair said.Certainly, the Iraq war proved that a consortium combining decades of experience is no guarantee of wisdom.The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change may sound like a front for the restoration of the global elite. But Blair said he has struggled to understand the forces that led to Brexit and Donald Trump: \u201cMaking sense of it is very hard. I feel like a student of politics again.\u201d Odd, he added, since \u201cI spent most of my political life in a state of reasonable certainty.\u201dHe said he still talks to his old Third Way pal, Bill Clinton. \u201cSpending time in his company is well spent because he\u2019s got an amazing political mind,\u201d Blair said. And he\u2019s still in touch with W.The central question, he said, is whether politicians can change the status quo enough to steer people through this period when they feel they\u2019ve lost control.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can adopt a politics that essentially says that those grievances are unjustified or irrelevant,\u201d he explained, \u201cor say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to focus on something else because that\u2019s really more important than your grievance.\u2019\u201dHe could have been describing What Happened with Hillary\u2019s campaign, when she and President Barack Obama sniffed at the rise of Trump and Bernie Sanders.The anger that buoyed Trump, he said, \u201cis not unjustified. You can\u2019t sit there and essentially blame the people.\u201dThat approach can lead to the rise of strongmen, or what he called \u201cthe Putinist model.\u201d \u201cThe strongman form of government says, \u2018I\u2019m just going to bust through the systems not delivering for you and I\u2019m going to deliver,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got an appeal.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI think the threat to what I would call traditional democracy is bigger than we think.\u201dThe weekend I talked to him, he told me he was publishing a report on how to deal with the immigration issue, which he said \u201cagonized\u201d progressives because they \u201chate the tinges of racism and sometimes the overt racism that comes with anti-immigrant feeling.\u201dHis report represented a radical pivot. He now believes that Brexit can never be undone \u201cunless we have an immigration policy that makes sense of the fact that people do worry about pressure on services and wages that can come from large accumulations of migrant labor and frankly, anxieties people have about whether there\u2019s a cultural divide from migrants, particularly if they come from a majority of Muslim countries.\u201cI think the only way of changing the Brexit situation is to say, \u2018We\u2019ve listened, we\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re going to act on these problems, but we\u2019re going to act in a way that is sensible, that is consistent with our values.\u2019\u201dHis U-turn showed up as a banner headline in The Sunday Times: \u201cTony Blair Gets Tough on Migrants 13 Years After Opening Doors.\u201d The paper outlined Blair\u2019s \u201cexplosive\u201d backtrack: Calling on Theresa May\u2019s government to force European Union migrants coming to Britain to register or face being barred from renting a home, opening a bank account or claiming benefits; recommending curbing unemployed migrants\u2019 access to free health care and permitting businesses and universities to discriminate in favor of British citizens.Upon hearing the news, British tabloids, not to mention Cockney taxi drivers, went nuts.\u201cMigrant U-Turn Fury,\u201d shrieked The Sun. \u201cBlair Bitch Project.\u201d\u201cButt Out Blair \u2014 You Ruined This Country,\u201d blared The Daily Star\u2019s headline.The Daily Express lead editorial, headlined \u201cTony Blair Is the Reason That We Are Leaving the EU,\u201d huffed about the jaw-dropping shift: \u201cIf he had a shred of decency or integrity we would never hear from him on this subject again.\u201d It reminded readers that Blair\u2019s consigliere, Lord Peter Mandelson, said in 2013 that the Labour Party had \u201csent out search parties for immigrants\u201d in what the paper called \u201ca cynical move\u201d to expand its voting base and be in a position to label Tories racist if they objected.Farage called Blair\u2019s new stance \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d When I mentioned to Blair that Farage is surrounded at the E.U., where he is a member of Parliament, by people who loathe him, the former prime minister shot back, \u201cHe rejoices in that fact.\u201dI flew to Brussels to track down Farage, who managed to turn Britain upside down after 20 years of not being taken seriously.Although he thinks Blair was once a \u201cgenius\u201d politician, Farage said, \u201cThe thing about Blair is that, in terms of British public opinion, he\u2019s a busted flush.\u201d He added that May is \u201ca very, very cold fish.\u201dThe 53-year-old hell-raiser was in his office in a modern Parliament building, the skunk at the garden party. All day long, E.U. members try to hammer out the terms of the blistering divorce with Britain. And here is the renegade who led the lemmings off the cliff, holed up, wearing a natty dark suit, wreathed in Camel smoke despite the no-smoking rules, sipping Welsh whisky and trashing his colleagues.He told Herman Van Rompuy, who was then president of the E.U., in front of the whole European Parliament that he had \u201call the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.\u201dNext to his desk Farage has installed a black coffin emblazoned with a golden emblem of the euro. \u201cI bought it on eBay for 180 euros,\u201d he said gleefully, \u201cwhich for a properly made coffin didn\u2019t seem bad.\u201d He has in a frame the infamous picture of him and Trump in front of a gold elevator at Trump Tower, gloating, thumbs up, the week of Trump\u2019s upset victory.Farage loves Trump. He admits that padding around the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington with a large glass of red wine is one of his favorite nocturnal activities.When Trump tweeted in November that Farage should be named ambassador to the U.S., it caused an uproar at 10 Downing Street.Farage mused that it would have been interesting to do something constructive, rather than stay on his usual destructive path, but the former banker said that those in the British establishment \u201clook upon me as a member of the lower orders.\u201dAlthough The Guardian reported that Farage had been named \u201ca person of interest\u201d in the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation, Farage shrugged it off, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got no Russian connections.\u201dDespite his stunning success with Brexit, Farage is now a man without a party. He resigned as leader of UKIP, which has basically sputtered out.\u201cWhat are political parties for?\u201d he said, philosophically. \u201cAre they there for their own sake? If you\u2019re in politics because you want to be something, then parties are essential. If you\u2019re in politics because you want to do something, parties are vehicles.\u201dHis friend Trump, he said, took over his party. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete hijack and I love it,\u201d he laughed, hoarsely. He called Trump the \u201cextreme alpha male, the silverback gorilla.\u201dBut even those who like Trump, he said, wonder \u201cwhy he\u2019s picking a battle on so many fronts simultaneously\u201d \u2014 especially with his own party. You know you\u2019re in trouble when Nigel Farage thinks you\u2019re picking too many battles.Reviled by many at home in London and at work in Brussels, Farage is spending the autumn giving speeches all over Europe.He recently got a standing ovation at a rally for a far-right, anti-immigration party in Berlin, where he said Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to maintain open borders during the refugee crisis was the \u201cworst decision by any leader in modern political history.\u201d He was invited by his fellow Parliament member Beatrix von Storch, a leading member of the far-right Alternative for Germany Party and a granddaughter of Hitler\u2019s finance minister.\u201cThe hard left has made my life a complete misery over the last four or five years,\u201d Farage said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to live with 24/7 security. I\u2019ve had threats, physical assaults against me, my family. And this is all from people who are in organizations that profess themselves to be about love and hope and optimism, all right?\u201dFarage, who once dismissed France under the stewardship of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as \u201ca pipsqueak,\u201d said that with Emmanuel Macron, France would become even more of a pipsqueak. He loved Melania\u2019s hurricane stilettos, is excited about Kate Middleton\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely bloomin\u2019 marvelous!\u201d \u2014 and thinks that Prince Harry should not marry Meghan Markle. \u201cI don\u2019t think Harry\u2019s ready to marry anyone yet,\u201d he said.He called Gary Cohn wrong to have publicly chastised Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville and denied that Javanka\u2019s presence in the Oval was a detriment to the president, saying \u201che needs family around him.\u201dNot only can the sun set on the British Empire. It can set on Nigel Farage. At dusk, we walked across the street to a favorite haunt, the Beer Factory, where he had a red wine.He waved his hand at the crowded square, shrugging off the very idea of Brussels. \u201cBelgium\u2019s not a nation,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cBrit-bashing here in Brussels is about to become a registered E.U. sport, as every single one of them lines up to say we are wrong, we are deluded, we are stupid, we made a deplorable decision and they won\u2019t budge a millimeter in the negotiations and that we\u2019re going to be taught a jolly good lesson.\u201dFarage is the proverbial cat on a hot tin roof. The victory is just staying on it, I guess, as long as he can.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Far-Right German Party Is Poised to Break Postwar Taboo", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTroubled by her migration policy and her long tenure, some Germans are turning more toward smaller, more ideological parties. For the first time in more than 60 years, they are expected to vote a far-right, anti-immigration party \u2014 the Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD \u2014 into the federal Parliament.In recent weeks, the party has regained lost ground in the opinion polls. It could emerge as Germany\u2019s third-largest party \u2014 and even become the leader of the opposition, if the current coalition of the two largest parties falls apart.Such a scenario would represent a big shift in the consensus-driven style of politics in Germany. And the historical import is undeniable in a country still shadowed by the Nazi legacy of World War II, which is why the election is generating some angst.Far-right parties have held seats in state legislatures and municipal councils in Germany for decades. But since the federal Parliament of West Germany was established in 1949 after the Nazi defeat in World War II, no party to the right of the Christian Democratic Union has surpassed the 5 percent threshold necessary to win seats there.Several polls estimate that the AfD, which has morphed from an anti-euro currency party to one opposed to immigration, will win 10 percent to even 15 percent of the vote.Entrance into Parliament would also strengthen the AfD by making it eligible for public financing and increasing its visibility. Its members would serve on parliamentary committees and would force more established political parties to respond more clearly on issues like immigration and redefining the national identity.Yes and no. The main German parties are solidly pro-European and the campaign has actually been criticized as too dull, leaving room for smaller, more extreme parties, like the AfD and the Left party, the inheritor of the East German Communist Party, to make inroads.Gerd Feichtinger, a sanitation technician who was born in the former East Germany, said that after decades of supporting the chancellor\u2019s conservatives, the AfD was getting his vote.\u201cI want to finally see a real opposition in Parliament,\u201d he said in a phone interview from his home near the former West German capital of Bonn. \u201cWhatever happens, Ms. Merkel has to go. I am going to do what I can to make that happen.\u201dAt the same time, representation for the AfD in parliament, given Germany\u2019s complicated system of proportional representation, would acknowledge democratic reality and give 10 percent or more of the Germans, who like Mr. Feichtinger feel isolated and alienated, a voice in the national political debate.As campaigning began in the summer, the immigration issue had largely slipped out of the collective consciousness, the party\u2019s support dipped into the single digits from the near 20 percent it enjoyed just after the arrival of nearly a million refugees in 2015.\u201cThere was hardly any difference in their positions,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.Four smaller parties, up from the current two, are expected to make it into Parliament: the AfD; the liberal Free Democrats, who are running almost neck-and-neck for third place; the Greens; and the Left party. But a significant number of voters say that they remain undecided.Ms. Merkel could face a tough choice between two options for forming a government, particularly if the AfD comes in third. One would be trying to revive the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of the past four years with the Social Democrats, many of whom think they would be better off with a time in opposition.Her preference would appear to be a coalition with the Free Democrats \u2014 who are poised to re-enter Parliament after failing to secure enough support in 2013 \u2014 and, if they fail to win enough seats to secure a majority together, the Greens.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.If AfD were to become the leader of the opposition, that would grant it the right to respond to the chancellor after she addresses Parliament and would give the far-right party more exposure.Concern is already building about how the far right\u2019s greater prominence would affect the largely respectful demeanor of debate that has been a cornerstone of German politics for decades.The president of the Parliament, Norbert Lammert, who has announced his retirement after 12 years in that position, earned resounding applause this month when he urged lawmakers to uphold the \u201cconsensus of democrats over the competition between parties that fanatics and fundamentalists consider to be more important.\u201dAlexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, the AfD\u2019s co-leaders, held two separate news conferences in the final weeks of campaigning, highlighting different elements of the party\u2019s stance on immigration in an apparent effort to remind voters of the issue.He has also taken on the country\u2019s postwar culture of atonement and remembrance of that period, calling for Germans to \u201ctake pride in the performance of German soldiers in two world wars.\u201d\u201cThe success of the AfD is in its strategy of choosing aggressive polarization,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile the other parties are more careful, more weighed; and they are notable to make the differences between them clear.\u201dWhile the party seems to have energized its adherents, its critics have also been galvanized. Some Germans look on the prospect of AfD in Parliament with trepidation.\u201cI think about it a lot and it scares me,\u201d said Markus Pesch, 41, who studies ecotourism in Berlin. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get more than 10 percent, and will probably beat out the Greens and the Left,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried that they get to help make political decisions and that they\u2019ll have a real influence.\u201dOthers are more sanguine. \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about the rise of the AfD. Not everyone who is voting for them are actually right wing,\u201d said Christian Sekula, 54, a goods trader from Berlin. \u201cThey\u2019re just not happy, and they haven\u2019t found what they are looking for with the current parties.\u201dEdmund Heaphy, Victor Homola and Christopher F.

Marcantonio died of a heart attack in 1954 after walking up the City Hall subway steps while collecting signatures for a Congressional run.\u201cHe was a lefty during the McCarthy era,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWhen he died, Cardinal Spellman prohibited him from having a Catholic funeral.\u201dFinding the graves of the famous and not so famous \u2014 like Marcantonio, once well known but now obscure \u2014 was always the Gardinos\u2019 hobby. Part treasure hunt, part Who\u2019s Who in America, it has now become their part-time job.At Woodlawn, they visited LaGuardia himself, but also his first wife, Thea, who died of tuberculosis, and their baby, Fioretta. \u201cThey died within months of one another in 1921,\u201d said Vincent, touching the tombstone, covered in a green copper plate with a haunting etching of a mother reaching her arms out to an approaching toddler.That same morning, the Gardinos visited the grave of the Western gunslinger Bat Masterson, the hero of a 1950s television show starring Gene Barry. \u201cNot many people know Masterson ended his career working at The New York Morning Telegraph as a sportswriter,\u201d said Robert. \u201cHe collapsed typing a story at his desk.\u201d\u201cHe died in the saddle,\u201d Vincent added. \u201cMy kind of guy.\u201dThe Gardinos\u2019 fascination with graves grew out of their love of history and celebrity. While they were growing up in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, their Italian immigrant father, a waiter at Danny\u2019s Hideaway \u2014 another forgotten city gem \u2014 would bring home autographs of the rich and famous.\u201cHe would bring them home to me in pencil,\u201d said Vincent, 63, laughing. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get them in ink!\u2019\u201d His father\u2019s treasured Robert Mitchum and Ed Sullivan signatures still grace the wall in Vincent\u2019s apartment on the Upper West Side. (Robert, 60, has Parkinson\u2019s disease and recently moved into the same building.)As a teenage autograph hound, Vincent would spend all weekend at the local library, writing letters to presidential candidates, as well as other well-known figures, like Robert Moses. They all wrote back. So started his and his little brother\u2019s autograph collection. \u201cThe only presidents I\u2019m missing are Obama and Trump,\u201d said Robert, sounding like an excited 8-year-old.It was a trip to Arlington Cemetery to visit President Kennedy\u2019s grave 20 years ago that started their hobby of grave tripping.Their favorite character in Arlington is Dan Sickles, a Civil War major general who almost lost the battle of Gettysburg. He also lost his leg, which he kept, along with the cannonball that took it, on display at a hospital in Washington. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been trying to find his foot,\u201d Robert said. \u201cNo one knows where his foot is.\u201dSickles was also the first man to use temporary insanity as a defense, after murdering the son of Francis Scott Key across the street from the White House because Key was having an affair with his wife. Sickles, a Congressman, was also awarded the Medal of Honor.On one of their visits to his grave, Vincent noticed Sickles\u2019s gravestone didn\u2019t have the usual gold leaf afforded Medal of Honor winners. After pestering Arlington officials, the gold leaf was added.It wasn\u2019t until three years ago, right after Vincent\u2019s wife, Jinny, died of cancer, that the Gardinos thought to make their cemetery trips into more than just a hobby. \u201cI was trying to stay busy after Jinny died, so we went up to visit our friends in Boston,\u201d Vincent said. He told his friends, John and Melissa Capuano, that he wanted to visit Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, his favorite cemetery. Not because Jinny or anyone he knew was buried there. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really beautiful place,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were like, \u2018All right,\u2019\u201d said Melissa, recalling how dubious she was about a trip to a graveyard. \u201cBut we wound up having a great time. Their knowledge is unbelievable, not your typical historical facts. They go so deep.\u201dIt was after the brothers told the story of Edwin Booth, the brother of Lincoln\u2019s assassin, John Wilkes Booth, that the Capuanos became hooked: They learned that Edwin was not only on the Union side during the Civil War, but that he once saved Lincoln\u2019s son, Robert, by pulling him to safety when he nearly fell onto some train tracks in Jersey City.The night after visiting the cemetery, on the Capuanos\u2019 rooftop deck watching the Fourth of July fireworks, the couple suggested the Gardinos turn their cemetery obsession into a reality show.\u201cVincent will tell a story and Robert will roll his eyes because he\u2019s heard it a hundred times,\u201d Ms. Capuano said. \u201cThey bicker. They\u2019re so close and obviously love each other. The back and forth is just great. They\u2019re just funny.\u201dThe Gardinos found a Boston production company, Powderhouse, and they now have a trailer and three short episodes \u2014 two filmed at Woodlawn with visits to Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Lionel Hampton and Admiral David Farragut (he of \u201cDamn the torpedoes\u201d fame).Robert, a retired banker, does most of the research and comes up with the subject matter; Vincent, head of sales for Straus News, takes care of the financing.\u201cWe have to raise the money to produce it,\u201d said Vincent, shrugging. \u201cMinor detail.

{"Headline": "Brazilian Corruption Case Ensnares Ex-Presidents da Silva and Rousseff", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe attorney general, Rodrigo Janot, whose term ends this month, described the governments of Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff as essentially fronts for a criminal enterprise through which senior politicians collected roughly $450 million from entities that included the state-run oil company Petrobras and the Brazilian National Development Bank. In addition to his conviction, Mr. da Silva has been charged in several other cases in which he stands accused of accepting bribes of relatively modest sums.But the 230-page charge sheet released Tuesday puts him at the center of a huge conspiracy. Mr. Janot wrote that the allegations should not be seen as a sign that the judiciary was \u201ccriminalizing politics\u201d or routine \u201cpolitical negotiations,\u201d but rather as a record of a ruling elite that systematically used public money to \u201cbuy popular support.\u201d\u201cThis is very significant,\u201d said Matthew M. Taylor, a professor at American University in Washington who studies Brazil\u2019s justice system. \u201cDilma had been arguing that she was personally honest.\u201dMr. Janot described Mr. da Silva as the mastermind of the kickback scheme, initially as president and later as a result of the \u201cstrong influence he exercised over\u201d Ms. Rousseff. The attorney general emphasized that many key players in the bribery scheme were supported or appointed by Ms. Rousseff.\u201cDilma Rousseff integrated the current criminal organization since 2003 when she accepted\u201d Mr. da Silva\u2019s invitation to run the Ministry of Mines and Energy, he wrote. \u201cFrom there, she contributed decisively so that the private interests negotiated in exchange for bribes could be met, especially in relation to Petrobras, where she was the president of the board between 2003 and 2010.\u201dMr. Janot, who was appointed by Ms. Rousseff in 2013, wrote that Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff spread the wealth, inviting leaders of other political parties to take part in the scheme.\u201cCritics had long said that given her prominent roles on the Petrobras board, and as head of the M.M.E., Dilma was either complicit or incompetent,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cJanot clearly thinks the former.\u201dBut in a statement released Tuesday night, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s press office said, \u201cWithout presenting proof or evidence of a material crime, the attorney general\u2019s office is filing charges without any foundation whatsoever.\u201dAnd the Workers\u2019 Party, in its own statement, called the allegations baseless and the continuation of a vendetta by the judiciary to weaken certain political factions through \u201cselective persecution.\u201dOne defendant in the latest case, Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, who took the helm of the Workers\u2019 Party in June, enjoys the same legal protection, which critics say has contributed to a culture of impunity among Brazilian politicians.It was unclear whether the case caught the defendants by surprise. As Brazilians were poring through the charging document, Mr. da Silva was sounding triumphant at the end of his caravan tour.Also charged in the case were: Guido Mantega, a former finance minister; Paulo Bernardo, a former communications minister; Antonio Palocci Filho, a former chief of staff for Ms. Rousseff; Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, a former treasurer for the Workers\u2019 Party; and Edinho Silva, the mayor of Araraquara.Shasta Darlington reported from S\u00e3o Paulo, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Santiago, Chile.Advertisement"}
