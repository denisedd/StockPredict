{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Courts Brand-Name Teachers, Raising Ethics Issues", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedMAPLETON, N.D. \u2014 One of the tech-savviest teachers in the United States teaches third grade here at Mapleton Elementary, a public school with about 100 students in the sparsely populated plains west of Fargo.\u201cI will embed it in my brand every day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said of Seesaw. \u201cI get to make it better.\u201dTheir ranks are growing as public schools increasingly adopt all manner of laptops, tablets, math teaching sites, quiz apps and parent-teacher messaging apps. The corporate courtship of these teachers brings with it profound new conflict-of-interest issues for the nation\u2019s public schools.Moreover, there is little rigorous research showing whether or not the new technologies significantly improve student outcomes.Teachers said that more established start-ups gave them pricier perks like travel expenses to industry-sponsored conferences attended by thousands of teachers. In exchange, teacher ambassadors often promote company products on social media or in their conference talks \u2014 sometimes without explicitly disclosing their relationships with their sponsors.Many public schools are facing tight budgets, and administrators, including the principal at Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, said they welcomed potentially valuable free technology and product training. Even so, some education experts warned that company incentives might influence teachers to adopt promoted digital tools over rival products or even traditional approaches, like textbooks.\u201cTeachers can\u2019t help but be seduced to make greater use of the technology, given these efforts by tech companies,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.Public-school teachers who accept perks, meals or anything of value in exchange for using a company\u2019s products in their classrooms could also run afoul of school district ethics policies or state laws regulating government employees.Ms. Delzer and other educators forcefully argue that they\u2019re motivated by altruism, and not company-bestowed status or gifts. \u201cI am in this profession for kids,\u201d Ms. Delzer said, \u201cnot for notoriety or the money.\u201dAnother important draw for teachers, who already often feel underappreciated: Having tech companies, the icons of American society, seek their views provides welcome attention. \u201cTeachers have really responded well to feeling like they are being listened to,\u201d said Carl Sjogreen, a co-founder of Seesaw.The benefits to companies are substantial. Many start-ups enlist their ambassadors as product testers and de facto customer service representatives who can field other teachers\u2019 queries.Microsoft and Apple said they worked with schools to make sure any conference travel expenses they covered for teachers complied with district ethics rules. Google said it provided meals but not teachers\u2019 travel expenses.An Amazon representative, responding to a question about the gift cards that TenMarks offered to certain teachers last year, said that the company had not given that incentive recently and that it had procedures \u201cto ensure our compliance with applicable laws and to help facilitate teachers\u2019 obligations to their schools.\u201dSo far, no teacher has asked for the payment, said Melissa Davis, GoEnnounce\u2019s chief executive. Still, she said, teacher referrals accounted for 20 percent of GoEnnounce\u2019s first-year sales.\u201cThese champions are really essential in giving us a really powerful foot in the door to meet with districts and schools,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Unlike industry influence in medicine, however, the phenomenon of company-affiliated teachers has received little scrutiny. Twitter alone is rife with educators broadcasting their company-bestowed titles.\u201cIf medical experts started saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Google Certified Doctor\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Pfizer Distinguished Nurse,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm.This is true for celebrities and teachers alike. And it applies equally to conferences, YouTube videos, personal blogs or Twitter posts.Some teachers and start-ups said they were not aware of those guidelines.\u201cIf you are receiving any sort of incentive to promote the company\u2019s product, that is what we call a material relationship,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, associate director of the trade commission\u2019s division of advertising practices, \u201cand that has to be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the endorsement message.\u201dFor some teachers, corporate relationships can be steppingstones to lucrative speaking or training engagements. Schools often hire company-connected educators to give training sessions to their teachers. And technology conferences for teachers often book influential teachers as speakers.Ms. Delzer said her fees for such events started at several thousand dollars a day. Some veteran education influencers charge much more.To do it all, Ms. Delzer negotiated a special contract with her district, allowing her to take 10 unpaid days off a year. She uses those days off to give speeches and run teacher workshops for other schools.\u201cIt\u2019s like two full-time jobs,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.Just before 8:30 a.m. on school days, Ms. Delzer, 32, stations herself at the classroom door. She greets each of her third graders by name, ushering them in one by one with a brief shoulder squeeze. \u201cI want them to feel love when they walk in,\u201d she said.If her classroom looks less like a traditional schoolroom and more like a den \u2014 with a colorful rug and inspirational signs exhorting children to \u201cDREAM\u201d and \u201cLAUGH\u201d \u2014 that is no accident. A few years ago, Ms. Delzer decided to remodel her classroom to foster the kind of independent work habits she thought her students would need in life.So she ditched the standard-issue desks and rearranged the room to look more like the place where she goes to work on her conference talks: her local Starbucks. Today, her third graders sit wherever they please \u2014 on cushions, rocking chairs, balance balls.\u201cIf I\u2019m just feeling like relaxing, I usually sit on the rockers or the ball chairs or the beanbag chairs,\u201d Jennings, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class last spring, explained. \u201cBut if I want to be really, really focused, then I usually feel like going on something a little harder so that I don\u2019t lose concentration.\u201dSitting in her local Starbucks in West Fargo, Ms. Delzer noted: \u201cIf you Google \u2018Starbucks Classroom,\u2019 it\u2019s a thing now.\u201dBut Ms. Delzer said she did not start out seeking to influence the practice of teaching. It was serendipity, she said, and an iPad experiment.In 2011, Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, in Thief River Falls, Minn., bought a few iPads and asked her to try using them in class. Two years later, her school\u2019s technology director suggested that they speak at an education conference about her experiment.That was when Ms. Delzer realized, she said, that by addressing her peers, she could reach vastly more students.\u201cI see the ripple effect on teachers who leave the conference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to know that those classrooms are better because of it.\u201dToday, so many teachers from other districts want to visit her classroom that Mapleton Elementary has set aside every Tuesday to host them. \u201cWe limit it to four teachers a day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.One morning last spring, Ms. Delzer assigned her third graders a math problem to solve on their iPads using Seesaw. Developed by two former Facebook product managers, Seesaw lets students produce and share their schoolwork as written notes, diagrams, audio recordings or videos.Some children love the sharing aspect. \u201cThey can see what you are doing now that we have Seesaw,\u201d McCoy, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class, said of his parents. \u201cOther years they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were only able to see on your papers.\u201dTeaching, by nature, is a helping profession. And educators have a long tradition of sharing ideas with colleagues.Ms. Delzer said she did not see a conflict between her teaching and other activities. She said she deliberately divided her work, devoting herself to her students during school hours while giving conference talks on days off and working with companies on some school nights.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep the two things separate,\u201d she said.She added that she worked only with companies whose products she personally believed in. Those relationships, she said, gave her valuable access to resources that could benefit her students, colleagues and teacher followers.\u201cIf I am going to put my name on it, it either has to make learning better for students or teaching better for teachers,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.But companies that tap public-school teachers to use or promote their products in exchange for perks are effectively engaging the educators as consultants \u2014 a situation that could conflict with teachers\u2019 obligations to their employer: schools.\u201cVendors offering free technology to teachers for their personal or professional use in exchange for teachers promoting it to students or other teachers is a very questionable activity,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Tim Jacobson, the principal of Mapleton Elementary School, where Ms. Delzer teaches, offered a different view. He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201dMr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201dOne evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.He had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.Now, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.Mr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.This teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.If the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.But there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.Mr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.He left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.Among other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.And Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Linda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.The Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.Last year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.Kittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.It was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.An hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.After dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.Ms. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.If her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.Every fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201dLest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Self-Driving System Faulted by Safety Agency in Crash", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as the government moved Tuesday to open a clearer path for automakers to develop driverless cars, its leading safety agency waved a new warning flag.The agency said the system, known as Autopilot, had performed as intended, but lacked safeguards to prevent drivers from using it improperly.In the Florida case, the driver was able to use the system on a road for which it was not designed, and to turn his attention away from the road for an extended period just before the crash, the N.T.S.B. said.\u201cThe combined effects of human error and the lack of sufficient system controls resulted in a fatal collision that should not have happened,\u201d Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the N.T.S.B., said at a meeting during which the board\u2019s report was approved.The renewed attention to the Tesla system came as automakers are jockeying to push driverless technologies forward, while lawmakers and regulators scramble to keep pace, with the Trump administration putting forward its approach on Tuesday.The Transportation Department unveiled voluntary guidelines for testing autonomous vehicles on Tuesday as part of a broader government effort to encourage automakers\u2019 development of self-driving technology.The guidelines replace policies set down by the Obama administration last year that called for automakers to submit safety assessments of their self-driving models before testing them on public roads.Under the new guidelines, it will be left to automakers and other companies to decide whether to submit safety reviews to federal regulators. While the Trump administration will encourage public disclosures of such assessments, the documents will not be subject to federal approval.\u201cThis is not an enforcement document,\u201d Ms. Chao said. \u201cThis is a guidance document.\u201dThere will be no waiting period for a company to begin testing autonomous models, although the vehicles remain subject to broader safety rules and standards for equipment and parts.Industry officials lauded the less restrictive guidelines, which are intended to be a model for state policies. \u201cThe guidance provides the right balance, allowing emerging innovations to thrive while government still keeps a watchful eye over new developments,\u201d said the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group.In addition to Tesla\u2019s efforts, the competition to develop self-driving cars has become fierce among auto industry giants such as General Motors and Ford Motor, as well as technology companies including Google and Apple.The companies have been accelerating their testing and have backed legislation exempting autonomous vehicles from current motor vehicle laws.Some safety campaigners and consumer groups have been critical of the move toward voluntary rules covering self-driving technology, including the guidelines introduced by Ms. Chao, saying they reduce federal oversight that was already too limited.\u201cThe voluntary policy announced today is a retreat from the already flawed guidance provided in 2016,\u201d said Jason K. Levine, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. He said the lack of required safety assessments cedes power to automakers \u201cwho have frequently proven they cannot be trusted to protect the public interest in their race for profits.\u201dAutomakers and government officials contend that self-driving technology could reduce vehicle accidents and traffic fatalities, which rose by nearly 8 percent in 2015 to more than 35,000 deaths. Tesla reiterated that safety potential Tuesday after the transportation safety board issued its report on the Florida crash.The system\u2019s forward-looking camera failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky, and neither Mr. Brown nor the Autopilot system activated the brakes. Data from the car showed it had been traveling at 74 miles per hour at the time of the crash and that Mr. Brown had ignored several warnings to keep his hands on the steering wheel. A preliminary N.T.S.B. report found that he had at least seven seconds to notice the truck before impact.Like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the N.T.S.B. found that the version of Autopilot in Mr. Brown\u2019s car had performed as it had been designed to.But Mr. Sumwalt said that version of Autopilot \u201cgave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.\u201d He also said it was intended for use on limited-access highways rather than routes with cross traffic and intersections, such as the state highway Mr. Brown was traveling on.In a statement, Tesla said it \u201cappreciates\u201d the N.T.S.B.\u2019s analysis and will evaluate the agency\u2019s recommendations. \u201cWe will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times,\u201d the company said.Since the accident, Tesla has modified Autopilot to warn drivers more frequently to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the system cannot be engaged without stopping and restarting the car.Tesla has also modified how Autopilot\u2019s radar and camera sensors interact to improve its ability to recognize obstacles. The Autopilot upgrade was rolled out a year ago.Tesla introduced Autopilot in October 2015, to great fanfare. And for a time it seemed that Tesla was far ahead of the big, established automakers as the notion of self-driving cars caught the imagination of both the media and technology enthusiasts.But before long, some drivers, including Mr. Brown, began to post videos on YouTube showing that it was possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel. Some videos show drivers reading while at the wheel; in one, a driver climbs into his car\u2019s back seat.Even before the fatal crash, Tesla had come under criticism for releasing Autopilot without greater safeguards to prevent improper use. And early on, the company referred to it as a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version, suggesting it was a work in progress.Advertisement"}

Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter based in Seattle, discussed the tech he is using.You cover Amazon and Microsoft. Do you use their technology?The one technology constant in my career as a journalist seems to be Microsoft Word. I take notes for all of my stories in it on a MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve tried Google Docs and OneNote, but can\u2019t stick with them for reasons I can\u2019t explain. I have a feeling I might be cremated with a copy of Microsoft Word.What do or don\u2019t you like about their tech products that you use?I find some of the things you can do on the Echo pretty silly and much easier on a smartphone app. I\u2019ll give you an example. A while back I was installing a sprinkler system in my garden that was connected to a wireless control unit. I found out I could use the control unit with Alexa to turn on the sprinklers with my voice.What are your favorite websites, apps or other tech tools for keeping on top of technology news?I get so much of my news diet, technology or otherwise, through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. I have configured my phone to send me a text message every time Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, tweets because he\u2019ll occasionally make news that way.What tech gadgets or apps are you or your family currently obsessed with and why?I am a contrarian on the Apple Watch, which I believe has been unfairly maligned by tech pundits. I love mine, and I get pretty frustrated by a lot of Apple products. I\u2019m a runner and cyclist and track all of my workouts with it. I use Siri on the watch to respond to text messages.Apple somehow managed to create a wearable device versatile enough that you can wear it on a run and with a suit. That\u2019s impressive.Are there technologies that you\u2019re not crazy about?I\u2019ve never cared for reading books on screens, even though I almost exclusively read newspapers and magazines on my phone and computer.I don\u2019t play video games. My son does. I\u2019m embarrassed to say he spent a decent chunk of the summer wasting bad guys in Call of Duty. He also read a big stack of books and is a sweet, sensitive kid, which is how he got away with it.What\u2019s your advice about how much or how little kids should be on their devices and on games? This is such a difficult issue. Most of my daughter\u2019s homework is on a computer so policing her screen time is really about limiting certain applications or websites. The other day I gave her a hard time when I heard her listening to YouTube. It was for her Spanish class.Overall, I try to encourage personal responsibility rather than hassle my kids all the time about their devices. It has worked so far.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s $1.3 Billion Fine in Europe Requires Review, Court Says", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The highest court in the European Union ruled on Wednesday that Intel\u2019s $1.3 billion antitrust fine get a second look, a decision that could ease some of the legal pressure that American tech giants face in the region.The order, which will send the Intel case back to a lower court for review, is a blow to a sweeping regulatory crackdown in Europe that has ensnared American household names like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. It could also embolden these technology companies, which have long complained that officials in Europe target them unfairly, to challenge the rulings and investigations against them.The case, and its outcome, plays to the legal headaches for Silicon Valley in Europe. The European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has made technology companies a central focus, with investigations into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The companies all deny any wrongdoing.The commission said that such rebates, offered to manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC, were anticompetitive. That argument raised questions about whether some common practices in the digital world, such as the bundling of products or services, could violate antitrust rules.It did not strike down the original ruling, but experts said the decision to send the case back to a lower court was a good sign for businesses looking to offer rebates to customers in exchange for exclusivity deals.\u201cThis decision is the right one for business, consumers, and E.U. antitrust law and policy,\u201d said Dave Anderson, an antitrust partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. \u201cExclusivity rebates are no longer considered in the E.U. as inherently anticompetitive.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line for Intel,\u201d Mr. Anderson added, \u201cis that Intel lives to fight another day.\u201dThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up 2 percent, to $35.72, in midday trading in New York.\u201cWe welcome today\u2019s landmark ruling,\u201d Steven R. Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said. \u201cWhile this case concerns events that happened more than a decade ago, we have always believed that our actions were lawful and did not harm competition. We look forward to the next step in this process.\u201dStill, some critics, particularly in the United States, say Europe\u2019s antitrust officials have too much power to levy fines and to force companies to change business practices without prior court orders.The ruling on Wednesday will give businesses more confidence that they could win a case on appeal if they come under investigation, said Veronica Roberts, a London-based partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, a law firm.\u201cThis gives them more confidence that a defense that they put forward could be reviewed,\u201d she said.The European Commission gave a cautious response when asked what the latest ruling would mean for other technology companies under investigation in Europe, and whether it would give those firms confidence to pursue legal challenges rather than to reach financial settlements.\u201cI cannot comment how companies will proceed or assess the judgment,\u201d Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news conference. \u201cWe ourselves still have to look carefully into the details of the judgment.\u201dThe chip-making industry, including Intel, has changed markedly since the case was brought.Intel was being investigated for its actions from 2002 to 2007. At one point, the company controlled 70 percent of the market for microchips, according to the European Commission. Known for its \u201cIntel Inside\u201d advertising slogan, the company dominated the market for personal computers.But since then, Intel has seen demand for PCs deteriorate, as consumers have shifted to buying increasingly powerful smartphones and tablets, a sector in which chip makers like Qualcomm, ARM and Samsung are major suppliers.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Amie Tsang from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Italian Vogue, a New Beginning", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThey\u2019ll just have to close it,\u201d the friend said to Mr. Farneti. \u201cNo one is going to be able to follow her. There\u2019s nobody.\u201d Mr. Farneti made some noncommittal noises. Then he changed the subject. Because what his friend did not know was that he had already been offered \u2014 and accepted \u2014 the job.\u201cI understood why she said it,\u201d Mr. Farneti said dryly a few months later in the lobby of the H\u00f4tel Costes in Paris, drinking a Coke. He was in the city for the couture shows and was wearing a Prada suit, Church\u2019s shoes (Prada owns Church\u2019s) \u2014 and a Swatch.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought of me necessarily either,\u201d he said.Little wonder certain questions have been accessorizing the story ever since: Who is this guy anyway? And what\u2019s he going to do with that job?For a start, Mr. Farneti said: \u201cI am not Franca.\u201dWell, duh \u2014 except he is referring not just to the blindingly obvious, but also the fact that he is about as different from Ms. Sozzani as possible: He is a different gender, from a different generation and a different professional background and has a different mien. His experience is journalistic and legal, as opposed to visual or fashionable. The woman he is succeeding, practically a brand in herself, was described as a cross between a figure from Botticelli and one from Stendhal by the French philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy.Mr. Farneti is most often described by those who know him or work with him as low-key, and occasionally as bourgeois.With his wings of brown hair and square jaw, his fondness for leather loafers without socks, Mr. Farneti looks like nothing so much as a G-rated Hollywood version of an Italian. He tends to blend into the woodwork. At the couture shows, he sat quietly in the front row. No one really came to pay homage, as they did with other Vogue editors such as Anna Wintour and Emmanuelle Alt. Paparazzi did not take his picture with celebrities. In his room at the Costes, he had one bouquet of somewhat sere-looking flowers from Dior.None of this bothers Mr. Farneti, who has two children ages 8 and 6; a wife who works for a digital marketing agency; an apartment near the Alberta Ferretti headquarters in Milan; and two getaways: a house in the Alps and one on the Italian coast near Portofino. Also, a 15-year-old black Suzuki he rides to work.He does not mind being underestimated. That should not be confused with being insecure.\u201cI think there are lots of different ways to be an editor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be useful to embody a magazine,\u201d as Ms. Sozzani did, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the only possible way.\u201d Besides, it is his very un-Franca-ness that probably made him the best candidate for the job. As Jonathan Newhouse, the chief executive of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was possible to replace Franca with an exact duplicate, and we didn\u2019t try to do so.\u201dBesides, it is clear that if there is one thing Mr. Farneti understands, it is engineering magazines. According to Mr. Newhouse, \u201cHe is a magazine \u2018maker,\u2019 which is someone who cannot only edit a publication but can conceive and create a title from scratch, which he has done in the past.\u201dThough he comes from a long line of respected Italian jurists and investigative reporters, and studied law at Milan University, Mr. Farneti started his career in television. He quickly moved into print as part of the team that founded Italian GQ, and from there went into sports journalism, covering soccer (his favorite team is Juventus) before becoming editor of the local version of Men\u2019s Health. That led to a job with Panorama magazine, where he was in charge of supplements, including Flair, a woman\u2019s style magazine.In 2014 Cond\u00e9 Nast poached him to run the Italian edition of Architectural Digest, which he did for a year before returning to GQ, which he also did for a year. Vogue is the third magazine he has remade in as many years.Still, when Cond\u00e9 Nast called on Jan. 2 to ask if he would be interested in the fashion publication, he said he never considered turning it down.\u201cFor me, not having grown up in the fashion system makes it interesting,\u201d Mr. Farneti said. \u201cI have to take advantage of the fact I am not 24/7 in the fashion conversation.\u201d Besides, he knows fashion people; he is close to Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, has what he calls a \u201cdecent\u201d relationship with Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, and has known Diego Della Valle, chief executive of Tod\u2019s, since interning for him in San Diego in 1995.But reinventing Vogue is a difficult task, even without the former editor lingering in most people\u2019s memories. Glossy publications are in free-fall. Over the summer Italian Cond\u00e9 Nast announced that by the end of the year it was closing all the peripheral Vogues that Ms. Sozzani had run: L\u2019Uomo Vogue (men\u2019s), Vogue Bambini (children\u2019s), Vogue Sposa (bridal) and Vogue Gioiello (jewelry). It was spun as a decision to focus on the core property, but widely interpreted as a sign that the business needed meaningful belt-tightening in the age of digital.Mr. Farneti, however, said, \u201cI believe in print.\u201d One of his first decisions was to adopt a larger format page. Otherwise, he has moved slowly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to delete everything that came before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s super arrogant.\u201dHis relaunch cover for the July issue was a gesture of continuity: Shot by Steven Meisel, a photographer championed by Ms. Sozzani (he did all her covers until 2014), it had a vintage air.When Ms. Sozzani took over Vogue in 1988, she inherited a decidedly parochial magazine with no real profile outside the country; her genius lay in understanding that to make Italian Vogue matter to anyone who was not Italian, she would have to communicate largely through photographs. She did so, and then added a dollop of activism on top, commissioning shoots that dealt with domestic abuse, plastic surgery and the BP Oil Spill. They were impossible to ignore, and her magazine soon became known as the most visually powerful of all Vogues. Though the magazine has a circulation of only 100,000, tiny compared to American Vogue\u2019s approximately 1.2 million, Italian Vogue has an outsize influence: It is the kind of magazine that other magazine people buy.Mr. Farneti understands this, but he has his own agenda. \u201cThe Apple people all say the worst thing they could have done over the last five years is try to think, \u2018What would Steve have done?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Farneti said, by way of explanation. His goal now is to make the magazine function as a platform to introduce Italian talent to the world.\u201cI want to put more Italian soul into the magazine, have it define this attitude toward life and beauty,\u201d he said (despite this, one of his early moves was to name Luke Leitch, who is English, as an editor at large; he is not oblivious to the power of the accessible word). \u201cI understand how hard it is for young talent in Italy to have a global impact.\u201d Hence the September issue, which comes with a sticker on the front announcing \u201cIt\u2019s All About Italy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Stefano Tonchi, the Italian who is editor of W. \u201cAt this moment of globalization, if you want to make a dent you have to something unique and in a way local to offer the larger world.\u201dSo far only two senior staff members have left the magazine, though Mr. Farneti\u2019s management style has been an adjustment. \u201cPeople were used to having Franca pick up the phone and solve their problems for them,\u201d he said. He\u2019s more into direct accountability.For now, however, he has other pressing questions on his mind. Like what to wear to his party. \u201cIt\u2019s a political decision,\u201d he acknowledged, given the whole fashion world will be there, watching.The solution: \u201ca Zegna tuxedo.\u201d Chosen because Ermenegildo Zegna is purely a men\u2019s wear brand, which makes it neutral territory in the women\u2019s wear (or sometimes women\u2019s-plus-men\u2019s wear) season. Plus, it\u2019s classic Italian, of course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201dPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201dFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201dAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201dWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.Labor exists on a similar continuum.The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201dLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201dIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.In reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company\u2019s workers from forming one.There is little chance for building connections at Apple. \u201cEveryone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don\u2019t see each other outside of work,\u201d said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.Ms. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.\u201cOne thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people,\u201d said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. \u201cIt was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company.\u201dBut in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized.Neil Irwin reported from Rochester and Cupertino, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of.

{"Headline": "Apple Watch Series 3 Excels, Even if You Don\u2019t Need Cellular", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixTo understand why you might want the new cellular Apple Watch, put yourself in the shoes of a wealthy person who drives a weekend car. (I promise this is a fun exercise.)But the cellular version is a luxury that most people probably will not need. The price you pay for those brief moments of respite from your iPhone is steep: at least $399 for the hardware, plus $10 a month for access on your cellphone plan for some carriers. And I seldom found reasons to use the watch without my iPhone to justify the extra cost.In the end, some people who want a wearable device for things like fitness tracking and a quick glance at mobile notifications will probably be happy with the Series 3 without cellular, which costs $329.Like its predecessors, the Apple Watch Series 3 is a computer worn around the wrist, with a miniature touch screen.The device requires an iPhone to set up and work properly. Notifications like text messages or social media alerts that come to your iPhone appear on the watch first if you are not actively using the phone. The watch runs apps, including some built-in software for fitness tracking as well as third-party widgets you can download from the App Store.The main difference with the cellular Apple Watch is that some important features, like placing calls, texting and streaming music, will work when you are not near your phone; the watch shares the same phone number and cellular plan with your iPhone.To help determine whether the cellular watch is right for you, I abandoned my iPhone to test the watch in a number of common situations. Here\u2019s how that went.Over the weekend, my partner and I made plans to go to dinner at a sushi restaurant. I used the Apple Watch to summon a Lyft car to pick us up at home.At the sushi bar, I liked that I didn\u2019t have a smartphone constantly buzzing in my pocket, though I got a text that I quickly responded to on the watch using an emoji. My partner and I enjoyed 90 minutes of intimate conversation over omakase with minimal distraction, though I was a bit envious that she could Instagram our gorgeous nigiri. (Alas, the watch does not have a miniature spy camera.)Verdict: I could have had roughly the same experience with just an iPhone put on Do Not Disturb mode \u2014 and a bit of self-discipline.For several days, I wore just the watch while walking my dogs. Not having a phone freed up valuable space in my pockets for other items, like my keys, my wallet, dog treats and bags. I liked that the Apple Watch tracked my steps and walking distance to make dog walking feel more like exercise than a chore. I placed a call to my partner with the watch to tell her where to meet me at a park; she said the call sounded crystal clear.It was also nice that with just the watch, I could still be reachable via phone or text by my colleagues during morning walks \u2014 but emails took several minutes to show up after they were sent. It turns out that while texts and calls are done directly on the cellular watch, emails still rely on the iPhone\u2019s pushing emails to the cloud, which then transmits the message to your watch.Verdict: The watch is good for staying reachable via phone or texts. But in those brief moments when you need to step away from a computer during work hours, a smartphone is still necessary if you rely heavily on email, as I do.I wore the watch and took a pair of AirPods, Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds, to a rock-climbing gym. Again, I left my iPhone behind.At the gym, I opened the Workout app to track my heart rate and calories burned throughout the workout. During breaks, I used Siri to write a few quick texts to some friends to make plans for the week. I put on the AirPods in the hope of streaming songs on the watch from Apple Music, only to realize that this capability has not yet been released. Apple said music streaming for the cellular watch will come out next month.Verdict: It was nice being able to stay in touch with people at the gym without a phone bulging in my pocket, but I\u2019d be happy unplugging for a while and tracking my workout with a noncellular Apple Watch. As for whether streaming music makes a cellular watch worth owning, I unfortunately can\u2019t tell you yet.Here\u2019s where leaving my phone behind and relying only on the watch did not make sense: during grocery shopping. The watch doesn\u2019t have a web browser, let alone a big enough screen, for looking up recipes. But when it came time to check out, I hit the side button to activate Apple Pay and quickly paid for the groceries.Verdict: A smartphone is a better shopping companion than a watch.The value of the cellular capabilities on the Apple Watch is questionable considering the price you pay each month.AT&T and Verizon Wireless, for example, charge a network access fee of $10 a month to share your phone plan\u2019s texts, minutes and data with an Apple Watch. That\u2019s about the same as a Spotify subscription, but with the exception of avid joggers and gym rats, people may not use the cellular features frequently enough. Hopefully, over time, Apple will negotiate with carriers to bring the monthly rate down.Important features like the stopwatch, calendar and Siri work quickly and reliably. And unlike its predecessors, the watch has impressive battery life \u2014 on average, I had more than 40 percent battery remaining after a full day of use.So the final verdict? The Apple Watch Series 3 is the first sign that wearable computers are maturing and may eventually become a staple in consumer electronics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Plans Second Headquarters, Opening a Bidding War Among Cities", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply.Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon \u2014 and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town \u2014 using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners.By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company\u2019s attention.\u201cThis is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. \u201cWhat governor or mayor doesn\u2019t want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?\u201dBut Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company\u2019s hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.Those considerations and more are laid out in Amazon\u2019s detailed wish list for its new project, which it is calling HQ2. In addition to a metropolitan area with more than one million residents, Amazon insists that its new project have on-site access to mass transit, a commute of 45 minutes or less to an international airport and easy access to a major highway or arterial road \u2014 no more than two miles.It also asked for evidence of fiber optic internet connections and a coverage map showing strong cellular phone service at the location. Amazon also wants traffic congestion figures, lists of universities and statistics on the qualifications of local workers.The company is also requesting that the new location have a diverse population and recreational opportunities. In other words, it does not want to stray too far from the lifestyle of Seattle, the home of Starbucks and Nordstrom, sandwiched between mountains and water. The headquarters in Seattle has 24 cafes.Already, Amazon is one of the largest tech employers in the world. But the company said the total number of new employees at its second headquarters outside Seattle could reach 50,000.The announcement of its hiring plan comes at a time when President Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon on Twitter, accusing the company of hurting retailers and killing jobs.The local antipathy toward the company was summed up in graffiti that recently appeared on the wall of a busy downtown traffic tunnel: an expletive before the last name of Mr. Bezos.Amazon itself seemed to suggest that it was looking for a more welcoming atmosphere than in Seattle, emphasizing that it is looking for a \u201cstable and business-friendly environment\u201d for its new headquarters.\u201cWhen big corporations say \u2018business-friendly\u2019 climate, it\u2019s code for corporate giveaways and vicious policies seeking to make the biggest possible profits on the backs of working people,\u201d Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said in an email.Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, said he had heard concerns from executives at Amazon about the climate for businesses in Seattle.\u201cI recognize there are many factors that went in to Amazon\u2019s decision, but the Seattle City Council\u2019s focus on dividing the pie of economic opportunity rather than growing the pie for the city and the region is undoubtedly among them,\u201d he said.Maud Daudon, the chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said she has heard similar concerns from Amazon executives and called the company\u2019s announcement of its plan a \u201cwake-up call for the region.\u201d\u201cWe have not said thank you enough\u201d to Amazon, Ms. Daudon said.Amazon has no plans to leave Seattle, where it employs 40,000 of its 380,000 total workers. It has an additional 6,000 open jobs in Seattle, a sprawling network of buildings downtown, with millions more square feet of office space under construction. Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment about the plan for the company\u2019s new headquarters.Political leaders elsewhere wasted no time saying how badly they want Amazon to join them.\u201cWe will aggressively demonstrate that Dallas and our surrounding area would be the perfect spot for their expansive business needs,\u201d Mike Rawlings, the city\u2019s mayor, said in a statement. Dallas representatives were already in touch with Amazon about next steps, he said.Amazon has been a beneficiary of generous public subsidies as part of its expansion of its warehouse network. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group, published a report last year saying that Amazon had received forms of public subsidies totaling at least $613 million for 40 of the 77 warehouses it built from 2005 to 2014. Additional subsidies for Amazon data centers were about $147 million, the institute said.Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that the average incentive package from a state usually adds up to 2 to 3 percent of wages, although recently there have been a spate of megadeals, like the $3 billion in state tax credits that Wisconsin offered Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants.Such outsize offers could end up being a \u201cwinner\u2019s curse,\u201d where the costs outweigh the benefits. He added that such gifts may not even be what is crucial.\u201cEither you have the things they want or you don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Bartik said, things like, reasonable housing costs, a pool of skilled talent, an international airport or the kind of amenities that would attract the kind of workers that Amazon wants to hire.When General Electric announced last year that it was moving its headquarters to Boston, G.E. executive said that some of city\u2019s most important selling points included the number and quality of its colleges and universities, a technically fluent work force, an atmosphere of innovation and entrepreneurial start-ups, and a quality of life that would attract current and future employees. Tax incentives were a factor, but not the most significant one by far, they said.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was not bothered by Amazon\u2019s decision, which he said would give another city a chance to become a significant tech hub.\u201cI think there\u2019s no way to accommodate another 50,000 engineers and executives in Seattle,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t think it would be healthy for Seattle to have that. As much as I love Amazon, to have that great a density of a single company, it means you\u2019re a one-horse town.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Patricia Cohen from New York.

{"Headline": "These Are Not the Robots We Were Promised", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFrom the moment we humans first imagined having mechanical servants at our beck and call, we\u2019ve assumed they would be constructed in our own image. Outfitted with arms and legs, heads and torsos, they would perform everyday tasks that we\u2019d otherwise have to do ourselves. Like the indefatigable maid Rosie on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d the officious droid C-3PO in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the tortured \u201chost\u201d Dolores Abernathy in \u201cWestworld,\u201d the robotic helpmates of popular culture have been humanoid in form and function.It\u2019s time to rethink our assumptions. A robot invasion of our homes is underway, but the machines \u2014 so-called smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home and the forthcoming Apple HomePod \u2014 look nothing like what we expected. Small, squat and stationary, they resemble vases or cat food tins more than they do people.Echo and its ilk do, however, share a crucial trait with their imaginary forebears: They illuminate the times. Whatever their shape, robots tell us something important about our technologies and ourselves.Although smart speakers have been around just three years, they already have a hold on us. The devices, powered by \u201cchatbots\u201d like Siri and Alexa, are in the midst of a sales boom. Some 35 million Americans now use the diminutive, talking computers \u2014 more than twice the number of just a year ago, according to estimates by eMarketer \u2014 and analysts predict that three-quarters of United States households will own at least one of the gadgets by 2020.It\u2019s not hard to understand the attraction. Smart speakers are oracles of the countertop. They may not be able to speak for the gods, but they can deliver reports on news, traffic and weather. And they have other talents that their Delphic ancestor couldn\u2019t even dream of: They can serve as D.J. They can diagnose ailments and soothe anxieties. They can read bedtime stories.They can even bark like a watchdog to scare off burglars. And they promise to be the major-domos of home automation, adjusting lights, controlling appliances and issuing orders to specialized robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.Still, if you were looking forward to having a Rosie scurrying around your abode, feather duster in hand, an Echo feels like a letdown. It just sits there.There are good reasons that the domestic robot has taken such an uninspiring form. Some are technical. Visualizing a nimble, sure-footed android is easy, but building one is hard. As the Carnegie Mellon professor Illah Nourbakhsh explains in his book \u201cRobot Futures,\u201d it requires advances not only in artificial intelligence but also in the complex hardware systems required for movement, perception and dexterity.The human nervous system is a marvel of physical control, able to sense and respond fluidly to an ever-changing environment. Achieving such agility with silicon and steel lies well beyond the reach of today\u2019s engineers. Even the most advanced of our current automatons still get flustered by mundane tasks like loading a dishwasher or dusting knickknacks.Meanwhile, thanks to gains in networking, language processing and miniaturization, it has become simple to manufacture small, cheap computers that can understand basic questions and commands, gather and synthesize information from online databanks and control other electronics. The technology industry has enormous incentives to promote such gadgets. Now that many of the biggest tech companies operate like media businesses, trafficking in information, they\u2019re in a race to create new products to charm and track consumers.Smart speakers provide a powerful complement to smartphones in this regard. Equipped with sensitive microphones, they serve as in-home listening devices \u2014 benign-seeming bugs \u2014 that greatly extend the companies\u2019 ability to monitor people\u2019s habits. Whenever you chat with a smart speaker, you\u2019re disclosing valuable information about your routines and proclivities.Beyond the technical challenges, there\u2019s a daunting psychological barrier to constructing and selling anthropomorphic machines. No one has figured out how to bridge what computer scientists term the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d \u2014 the wide gap we sense between ourselves and imitations of ourselves. Because we\u2019re such social beings, our minds are exquisitely sensitive to the expressions, gestures and manners of others. Any whiff of artificiality triggers revulsion. Humanoid robots seem creepy to us, and the more closely they\u2019re designed to mimic us, the creepier they are. That puts roboticists in a bind: The more perfect their creations, the less likely we\u2019ll want them in our homes. Lacking human characteristics, smart speakers avoid the uncanny valley altogether.Although they may not look like the robots we envisioned, smart speakers do have antecedents in our cultural fantasy life. The robot they most recall at the moment is HAL, the chattering eyeball in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d But their current form \u2014 that of a stand-alone gadget \u2014 is not likely to be their ultimate form. They seem fated to shed their physical housing and turn into a sort of ambient digital companion. Alexa will come to resemble Samantha, the \u201cartificially intelligent operating system\u201d that beguiles the Joaquin Phoenix character in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Through a network of speakers, microphones and sensors scattered around our homes, we\u2019ll be able to converse with our solicitous A.I. assistants wherever and whenever we like.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook C.E.O., spent much of last year programming a prototype of such a virtual agent. In a video released in December, he gave a demo of the system. Walking around his Silicon Valley home, he conducted a running dialogue with his omnipresent chatbot, calling on it to supply him with a clean T-shirt and toast bread for his breakfast, play movies and music, and entertain his infant daughter. Hooked up to cameras with facial-recognition software, the digitized Jeeves also acted as a sentry for the Zuckerberg compound, screening visitors and unlocking the gate.Whether real or fictional, robots hold a mirror up to society. If Rosie and her kin embodied a 20th-century yearning for domestic order and familial bliss, smart speakers symbolize our own, more self-absorbed time.It seems apt that as we come to live more of our lives virtually, through social networks and other simulations, our robots should take the form of disembodied avatars dedicated to keeping us comfortable in our media cocoons. Even as they spy on us, the devices offer sanctuary from the unruliness of reality, with all its frictions and strains. They place us in a virtual world meticulously arranged to suit our bents and biases, a world that understands us and shapes itself to our desires. Amazon\u2019s decision to draw on classical mythology in naming its smart speaker was a masterstroke. Every Narcissus deserves an Echo.Nicholas Carr is the author of \u201cThe Shallows\u201d and \u201cUtopia Is Creepy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iPhone 8 Reviews: What the Critics Say", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnsurprisingly, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are very good phones. Most of Apple\u2019s improvements over the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are minor, but if you have an older model, either of the 8s will feel like a solid upgrade. And if you are considering upgrading from an Android phone, there\u2019s one area where the new iPhones still rank head and shoulders above their competition \u2014 the processor, the engine that runs the entire device, where Apple is so far ahead that it almost feels unfair.The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus may not be as flashy as the iPhone X, but anyone upgrading from an older model will appreciate the jumps. Coming from the iPhone 6s, for instance, you\u2019re getting double the storage, the option to wirelessly charge your iPhone, a refreshed design, and a faster camera. If you\u2019re coming from the iPhone 7 family, on the other hand, it\u2019s harder to make the case.While the 8 and 8 Plus share a processor, wireless charging capability, and similar camera setups to the X, they lack any truly new ideas about what an iPhone is \u2014 they\u2019re both very much just the next step along a path Apple\u2019s been on for quite some time now.So what\u2019s actually new? The most commonly cited improvements included the camera, wireless charging and augmented reality abilities.The new \u201ccolor filter\u201d and \u201cdeeper pixels\u201d in the 8 and 8 Plus mean more vivid colors and less noise. The new image signal processor helps optimize features like exposure, autofocus, and HDR, before you take the photo.What that means in practice is more detailed photos that really only appear more detailed if you zoom way, way in.Once you\u2019ve tried pad charging, you won\u2019t go back. You come home from work, you just set the phone down on your way in. Or you set it down on your bedside table. Done.After testing early augmented reality apps, it\u2019s clear the feature is well executed and packs a genuine \u201cwow\u201d factor. It\u2019s most useful for games, shopping and a star gazing app that overlays constellations on the real night sky. It also offers the most enjoyable way to dissect a beating human heart in my kitchen yet.The iPhone 8 Plus definitely has better battery life than its smaller sibling, even when being used heavily. On a day where I had to use it for navigation, video streaming and plenty of email, it made it through the day and probably could have made it through the next morning without being in dire need of a top-up. The iPhone 8, when I used it, got down pretty low by the end of the day, at which point I switched to low power mode. In other words, it got me through a day, but not much further.What can you do with a phone that fast? Those new camera tricks, plus high frame-rate 4K video, wouldn\u2019t be possible without it. And it never hurts to try to futureproof the computer you use most. But the bottleneck on the apps I use most often is internet speed, not the processor. Aside from some 3-D games, I couldn\u2019t find many apps that require so much horsepower today.There\u2019s something about the texture of glass. It\u2019s smoother than the aluminum, but typically less slippery and easier to grip. Glass also warms up to the temperature of your hand faster and stays at that temperature rather than getting hot. And when your phone is really chugging along, it distributes the heat from the processor better, making hot spots less pronounced.Apple has painted us a picture of what its mobile future looks like, so is it any surprise the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus seem dull by comparison? To be clear, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re poorly designed. It\u2019s just that the iPhone\u2019s aesthetic hasn\u2019t changed much since the debut of the 6 and 6 Plus three years ago.For the first time in the 10-year history of the iPhone, I can\u2019t recommend buying the newest models.That\u2019s not because the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are bad phones. They\u2019re actually great.But an even better phone is on the way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Best Buy\u2019s Secrets for Thriving in the Amazon Age", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftWhile running errands the other day, I ducked into a local Best Buy to pick up a pair of new headphones. What I saw inside was shocking.Happy-looking people were huddled around tables filled with the latest gadgets from Microsoft and Apple. The video game aisle was bustling. Blue-shirted employees were helping a customer pick from a glowing wall of flat-screen TVs. There was a line \u2014 a line! \u2014 at the checkout counter.But Best Buy\u2019s rebound has been surprisingly durable. Revenue figures have beaten Wall Street\u2019s expectations in six of the last seven quarters. The company\u2019s stock price has risen more than 50 percent in the past year. Workers are happy. And judging from several other visits I paid to Best Buy stores, the chain appears to have avoided the bleak fate of other big-box retailers.How do they do it?To find out, I called Hubert Joly, Best Buy\u2019s chief executive.An upbeat Frenchman who spent more than a decade at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Mr. Joly, 58, explained that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround was years in the making, and that it involved reshaping nearly every piece of the business. It\u2019s a fascinating playbook for companies hoping to survive in the Amazon age.Here are the keys to Best Buy\u2019s turnaround, according to Mr. Joly:The most worrisome trend in big-box retail was \u201cshowrooming\u201d \u2014 customers were testing new products in stores before buying them for less money online from another retailer. To combat showrooming and persuade customers to complete their purchases at Best Buy, Mr. Joly announced a price-matching guarantee.\u201cUntil I match Amazon\u2019s prices, the customers are ours to lose,\u201d Mr. Joly said.Price-matching costs Best Buy real money, but it also gives customers a reason to stay in the store, and avoids handing business to competitors.Mr. Joly also realized that if Best Buy was going to compete with Amazon, which has spent billions building a speedy delivery system and plans to use drones to become even more efficient, it needed to get better at things that robots can\u2019t do well \u2014 namely, customer service.In his first months on the job, Mr. Joly visited Best Buy stores near the company\u2019s Minnesota headquarters to ask rank-and-file employees about the struggles they encountered. (Among their gripes: an internal search engine that was returning bad data about which items were in stock.)Best Buy fixed the search engine. It also restored a much-loved employee discount that had been suspended and embarked on an ambitious program to retrain its employees so they could answer questions about entirely new categories of electronics, such as virtual reality headsets and smart home appliances.\u201cThe associates in our stores are much more engaged now, much more proficient,\u201d Mr. Joly said.Customers had always loved Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad, its army of specially trained tech support experts who could be hired to mount TVs and install other appliances at a customer\u2019s home. But sometimes, people needed help before they bought big and expensive gadgets. So it started an adviser program that allows customers to get free in-home consultations about what product they should buy, and how it should be installed. The service started as a pilot program last year and is now being rolled out nationwide.Best Buy has \u201creally come through the valley by making investments around the customer experience,\u201d said Peter Keith, a retail analyst with Piper Jaffray.When Mr. Joly arrived at Best Buy, the company\u2019s online ordering system was completely divorced from its stores. If a customer placed an order on the website, it would ship from a central warehouse. If that warehouse didn\u2019t have the item in stock, the customer was out of luck.Mr. Joly realized that with some minor changes, each of Best Buy\u2019s 1,000-plus big-box stores could ship packages to customers, serving as a mini warehouse for its surrounding area. Now, when a customer orders a product on Best Buy\u2019s website, the item is sent from the location that can deliver it the fastest \u2014 a store down the street, perhaps, or a warehouse five states away. It was a small, subtle change, but it allowed Best Buy to improve its shipping times, and made immediate gratification possible for customers. Now, roughly 40 percent of Best Buy\u2019s online orders are either shipped or picked up from a store.Best Buy also struck deals with large electronics companies like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft to feature their products in branded areas within the store. Now, rather than jamming these companies\u2019 products next to one another on shelves, Best Buy allows them to set up their own dedicated kiosks. (Apple\u2019s area inside a Best Buy, for example, has the same sleek wooden tables and minimalist design as an Apple Store.) It\u2019s a concept borrowed from department stores, and it\u2019s created a lucrative new revenue stream. Even Amazon has set up kiosks in Best Buy stores to show off its voice-activated Alexa gadgets.Granted, Best Buy has a last-man-standing advantage in these partnership deals. Many of its big-box rivals (Circuit City, Radio Shack, HH Gregg) have gone bankrupt or shut down completely. Which means that if Samsung wants to show off its newest line of tablets in a big-box electronics store, it has basically one choice.Best Buy has also found more creative penny-pinching methods. Once, the company noticed that an unusually high number of flat-screen TVs were being dropped in its warehouses. It revamped the handling process, reducing the number of times TVs were picked up by a clamp lift and adding new carts to prevent TV boxes from falling over. The changes resulted in less broken inventory and bigger profits.Mr. Joly didn\u2019t explicitly tell me this, but it is obvious: Best Buy has benefited from some serious good fortune.It\u2019s lucky that the products it specializes in selling, like big-screen TVs and high-end audio equipment, are big-ticket items that many customers still feel uncomfortable buying sight unseen from a website. It\u2019s lucky that several large competitors have gone out of business, shrinking its list of rivals.

{"Headline": "Instagram Your Leftovers: History Depends on It", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionI am a culinary historian, and scrolling through the endless food on Instagram makes me hungry. No, not for the fresh-baked sourdough rolls nestled so prettily in a linen napkin or that jaunty tumbler of strawberry mousse sporting its shiny green sprigs of mint. They look delicious, but what really makes my mouth water is the thought of all the stories behind them \u2014 everything that happened in the kitchen before you picked up your phone and clicked.I\u2019m hungry for a look at the messy, bulging envelope where you keep the recipe. I want to see the toddler plunging a dirty fist into the strawberries, and the scenes from your shlep through four markets as you searched for some decent-looking mint. Add a caption and tell me who came to dinner but refused to taste the rolls \u2014 \u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019m gluten-free\u201d \u2014 and who turned out to be allergic to strawberries, and whether you went to bed swearing never to cook again.Both by instinct and by profession, I\u2019ve always been curious about people\u2019s eating habits. So I\u2019ve tried to latch onto the astonishing culinary kaleidoscope that is Instagram, poring over the images of avocado toast and seafood paella in search of whatever they can tell me about taste and cultural identity and the secrets of appetite. After all, that\u2019s what food does \u2014 it talks to us.President Harry Truman, for instance, once hosted a dinner for Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, hoping to encourage his young democracy to tilt toward the United States in the Cold War. The menu featured roast turkey, cranberry sauce and a molded ginger-ale fruit salad with toasted Triscuits \u2014 a short course in the history of American cuisine and a remarkable example of patriotism made edible. This meal was practically singing the national anthem. (Nehru was unmoved and remained skeptical about America for years. Was it the Triscuits?)But no matter how hard I scrutinize the pictures on Instagram, they don\u2019t speak up. Or rather, they all say the same thing \u2014 \u201cLook at this amazing food!\u201d To be fair, that\u2019s what high-style food photography was invented to do: It has always been far more interested in our dreams than in our actual meals. The best-selling \u201cBetty Crocker\u2019s Picture Cook Book\u201d set the tone for food photography back in 1950, with page after page of lurid baked hams and frosted cookies. Later came gigantic coffee-table cookbooks, with sumptuous photographs of laughing families gathered for summer lunches in Provence, or sari-clad Indian home cooks sitting on the floor crushing spices.Today we have Instagram, overflowing with glamorous images created not by professional photographers but by home cooks in kitchens around the world. What an opportunity! With its vast reach and the technological savvy of its users, Instagram could go beyond mere glamour and open up a domestic world that has always been elusive. I\u2019m talking about ordinary meals at home \u2014 the great unknown in the study of food.Sure, we have agricultural statistics and marketing surveys; we have household records from 18th-century castles and charts showing the average consumption of Popsicles in the United States from 1953 to 1982. But there\u2019s nothing to tell us what a schoolteacher in Connecticut served to her family on a Thursday in 1895. Or what she was thinking when she boiled the string beans for 45 minutes, put ketchup in the salad dressing and decided to try her neighbor\u2019s recipe for rice pudding, the one with a little cinnamon.Could Instagram capture today\u2019s version of that story? Could it zero in on the third consecutive night of frozen tacos or the mug of milky Sanka that makes you feel like somebody\u2019s grandfather but has become an unexpected nighttime addiction? Next time you eat a meal that\u2019s certain to be forgettable, that\u2019s the very moment to pull out your phone and hit \u201cshare.\u201dStart with the refrigerator \u2014 anything good in there? And who\u2019s standing next to you, stuffing himself with handfuls of cereal because he can\u2019t wait another minute? Hand him an apple, figure out whether there\u2019s enough cheese for a grilled cheese sandwich, check the bread for mold and click. Add a hashtag admitting that you found a few green spots. When he\u2019s finished, don\u2019t forget to take a picture of the plate with most of the sandwich still on it. Make it your own lunch, and take a selfie.There will always be room for adorable cupcakes and whole roast pigs, but if you\u2019re a food lover with a smartphone, don\u2019t limit yourself to these social media classics. Do a huge favor for culinary historians and offer us a glimpse of the ordinary.If there\u2019s nothing on the breakfast table except a slice of cold pizza \u2014 click. If you\u2019ve just returned from the farmers market with bags of fresh produce but you\u2019re ordering Chinese anyway \u2014 assemble a picture. Show the mess, show the kitchen flops, show the dumb choices we all make when we\u2019re standing alone at the refrigerator. You can even skip the filter. A hundred years from now (assuming somebody has figured out how to archive this stuff) scholars will be riveted to your images of the everyday, and you \u2014 or at least your Instagram handle \u2014 will be immortal.Laura Shapiro is the author of \u201cWhat She Ate: Six Remarkable Women and the Food That Tells Their Stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Wants You to Wake Up With Alexa, and That\u2019s Just the Start", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon released the first Echo smart speaker three years ago, not long after the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone proved to be a humiliating failure.So far, the results for the Echo have been anything but humiliating. Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities.On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks.Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick \u2014 aggressive pricing \u2014 and by finding ways to embed Alexa\u2019s hooks more deeply into customers\u2019 lives.If the strategy works, Amazon could gain an edge in a new wave of computing. Most big technology companies are convinced that voice commands and intelligent assistants will be primary ways that people interact with technology, perhaps more vital than touch screens and keyboards.David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said Wednesday that the company had about 5,000 employees working on Alexa projects. The company held its event on the 30th floor of one of its high-rise buildings in Seattle, where it had created a living room and kitchen to test how the Alexa devices worked in a homelike setting.The company has identified music, communications and controlling smart home appliances as the most popular uses of Alexa. Although Amazon has not released specific sales figures for Alexa devices, Mr. Limp said tens of millions had been sold.\u201cThey\u2019re literally scattering them around the house, putting them in hallways, workshops and garages,\u201d he said.Echo Spot, a $129.99 spherical device with a 2.5-inch touch screen, is Amazon\u2019s version of an alarm clock. In addition to displaying the time and weather, its microphones will allow people to make phone calls, turn lights on and off and ask how long a morning commute will take. A tiny camera makes videoconferencing possible.The device, and its camera, could also provide a test for Amazon. Whether customers feel comfortable having a camera aimed at their beds will depend partially on whether they trust Amazon to protect their privacy.Also introduced Wednesday was an updated version of the original, cylinder-shaped Echo. The new iteration is shorter, with sleeves made of fabric, wood veneer and other materials that allow it to blend in better with the rest of a home\u2019s d\u00e9cor. The company said it had improved the device\u2019s speakers as well. The biggest change is the price: $99.99 instead of the original Echo\u2019s $179.99.Another new device, Echo Plus, resembles the original Echo, but comes with technology that helps control certain household devices like light bulbs that are automated. Echo Plus, priced at $149.99, is designed to find many of those automated devices with little configuration required.A new version of Fire TV, the company\u2019s device for streaming internet video to televisions, is small enough to dangle from the back of a television\u2019s video port. Amazon said that media companies including Bravo, Netflix and Showtime planned to use a new Alexa capability that lets people use voice commands to control Fire TV video apps.Amazon also said that BMW Group had agreed to embed Alexa in its BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles starting next year, the latest in a series of relationships that Amazon has entered with carmakers to spread the use of Alexa outside the home.Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research said he believed Amazon\u2019s goal was to strengthen the loyalty of its customers, especially those enrolled in its Prime membership program.\u201cOverall, today\u2019s announcements felt like Amazon doubling down on its Echo and Alexa strategy,\u201d he said, adding that the company was \u201creminding all of us that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make money on Echo hardware for the strategy to be successful.\u201dMr. Dawson said the strategy created \u201cinteresting competitive challenges for others like Google and Apple who don\u2019t have such obvious non-hardware revenue streams associated with their smart voice speakers.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the devices introduced by Amazon on Wednesday. Is the updated version of the original Echo, not the Echo Plus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iPhone 8: A Worthy Refinement Before the Next Generation", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSo here\u2019s my conclusion, after nearly a week testing the 8 and 8 Plus: The 8s feel like a swan song \u2014 or, to put it another way, they represent Apple\u2019s platonic ideal of that first iPhone, an ultimate refinement before eternal retirement.Unsurprisingly, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are very good phones. Most of Apple\u2019s improvements over the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are minor, but if you have an older model, either of the 8s will feel like a solid upgrade. And if you are considering upgrading from an Android phone, there\u2019s one area where the new iPhones still rank head and shoulders above their competition \u2014 the processor, the engine that runs the entire device, where Apple is so far ahead that it almost feels unfair.But let\u2019s start with the basics.\u2022 The iPhone\u2019s overall design is very slightly improved in the 8. The new models have a glass back, which you would think would make them more delicate but which actually adds a slight grippiness, making them less prone to catastrophe. (I\u2019d still use a case for the 8 Plus, which I find ungainly to hold; the 8, though, shines in its caseless glory.)The glass back allows for the iPhone 8\u2019s handiest new feature, wireless charging. This works just as it does on the many other phones that have long sported this trick: Set the phone down on a charging pad and it just starts charging, even through most cases. Apple said it would release its own charging mat next year; for now, you can use one of the many third-party mats that run the Qi wireless standard. (Over all, battery life on the 8 was comparable to that of the 7 \u2014 it lasted all day with light use, about half a day with heavy use, and always not long enough.)\u2022 The display on the 8 and 8 Plus is better than on the 7, but only very slightly. In particular, the screen uses a technology Apple calls True Tone, which automatically adjusts the display\u2019s white balance to match the lighting in your surroundings. This adds a subtle vibrancy to everything you see \u2014 though honestly the only time I was able to appreciate it was when I compared it side by side with the iPhone 7.\u2022 But the best thing about the 8 and 8 Plus is what\u2019s most hidden: It\u2019s the processor that powers everything else. The first thing I usually do when I get a new iPhone is run a benchmark app to get a sense of the kind of power I\u2019m dealing with. (Yeah, I\u2019m real fun.)I spoke to several processor analysts about why Apple is so far ahead on processing power. They explained that Apple can produce these gains because it designs its own processors, while its competitors rely on chips created by third parties. And performance matters. Everything you do on a phone is improved by better chips: The interface is more responsive, advanced graphical features like augmented reality (in which digital scenes are interposed on the real world) work more fluidly, and they allow for groundbreaking new features, like the face-detection system Apple built into the iPhone X.And while experts said Apple\u2019s lead might slip over time, for now, its advantage remains enormous enough to make the iPhone a must for people who think of their phones as their most important computing device \u2014 in other words, you and me and everyone we know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Offers Concessions to Europe After Record Antitrust Fine", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle announced concessions on Wednesday to European regulators over its online shopping service, signaling a new willingness by the Silicon Valley company to bow to tightening pressures from governments around the world.Google said the changes would be introduced early on Thursday morning, meeting a deadline to open up its shopping platform to greater competition or potentially face further fines from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm. As a result, about a dozen shopping sites from companies besides Google could become more visible and accessible.\u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping,\u201d Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said.The fine against Google in June was among the most aggressive moves against an American technology company taken anywhere in the world. It immediately confirmed Europe\u2019s role as the Western world\u2019s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany\u2019s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.\u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,\u201d said Mr. Verney.The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.Google would like the measure it\u2019s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google\u2019s formidable search platform.Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.Any decision to separate traditional web search from other search-related functions, such as shopping for products, looking for travel bookings or seeking restaurant reviews, could reverse a profitable evolution of the company\u2019s moneymaker.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Those offices would house employees working on Facebook\u2019s effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans.Facebook\u2019s plans are tentative, the people said, and would depend on approval from the Chinese government. But if successful, it would be a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade.\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to questions about the office plans.At the moment, Facebook uses third parties and its own employees to sell ads in China. Because of cybersecurity concerns, Facebook employees run special security software on devices when they travel in China and do not have access to secretive or critical business information.Opening an office in Shanghai allows more support for its employees when they are in China, but also raises security questions. The Building 8 teams, which focus on their own hardware projects, would have less need to access sensitive Facebook data when in China, one person said. The office could also help Facebook work more with local Chinese companies.If it opens a Shanghai office, Facebook would not be the only Western internet company banned in the country to have some space there. Google, which pulled its servers out of China in 2010 after it decided to stop censoring search results, retained offices in Beijing and Shanghai that support both advertising and research and development. Google still maintains extensive advertising sales and research facilities there.Facebook over the past three years has pulled out all the stops to court the Chinese government and gain approval for its network. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has showed off his Mandarin at one of the country\u2019s top universities and has directly courted Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.The office search comes just months after Facebook released the Chinese-language version of Moments. That app, called Colorful Balloons, originally went largely unnoticed but briefly rose into the top 50 in the photo and video section of China\u2019s iPhone app store after The New York Times reported its release last month, according to app research company App Annie.Like other cities in China, Shanghai has been eager to attract technology start-ups and other internet-related investments.That the Colorful Balloons app has not come down could be a sign that Facebook has done something right with the government, said Teng Bingsheng, a professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. Opening an office, if it happens, would be another sign.\u201cIt has symbolic meaning,\u201d Mr. Teng said, \u201cbecause it must be the result of good communication with the government.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

They should talk to us, recognize everything from faces to flowers, and maybe soon do the driving. All this artificial intelligence requires an enormous amount of computing power, stretching the limits of even the most modern machines.Now, some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are taking a cue from biology as they respond to these growing demands. They are rethinking the very nature of computers and are building machines that look more like the human brain, where a central brain stem oversees the nervous system and offloads particular tasks \u2014 like hearing and seeing \u2014 to the surrounding cortex.After years of stagnation, the computer is evolving again, and this behind-the-scenes migration to a new kind of machine will have broad and lasting implications.

For about half a century, computer makers have built systems around a single, do-it-all chip \u2014 the central processing unit \u2014 from a company like Intel, one of the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor makers. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in the middle of your own laptop computer or smartphone.Now, computer engineers are fashioning more complex systems. Rather than funneling all tasks through one beefy chip made by Intel, newer machines are dividing work into tiny pieces and spreading them among vast farms of simpler, specialized chips that consume less power.Changes inside Google\u2019s giant data centers are a harbinger of what is to come for the rest of the industry. Inside most of Google\u2019s servers, there is still a central processor. But enormous banks of custom-built chips work alongside them, running the computer algorithms that drive speech recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence.Google reached this point out of necessity. For years, the company had operated the world\u2019s largest computer network \u2014 an empire of data centers and cables that stretched from California to Finland to Singapore. But for one Google researcher, it was much too small.In 2011, Jeff Dean, one of the company\u2019s most celebrated engineers, led a research team that explored the idea of neural networks \u2014 essentially computer algorithms that can learn tasks on their own. They could be useful for a number of things, like recognizing the words spoken into smartphones or the faces in a photograph.In a matter of months, Mr. Dean and his team built a service that could recognize spoken words far more accurately than Google\u2019s existing service. But there was a catch: If the world\u2019s more than one billion phones that operated on Google\u2019s Android software used the new service just three minutes a day, Mr. Dean realized, Google would have to double its data center capacity in order to support it.\u201cWe need another Google,\u201d Mr. Dean told Urs H\u00f6lzle, the Swiss-born computer scientist who oversaw the company\u2019s data center empire, according to someone who attended the meeting. So Mr. Dean proposed an alternative: Google could build its own computer chip just for running this kind of artificial intelligence.This trend toward specialty chips and a new computer architecture could lead to a \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d of artificial intelligence, said Gill Pratt, who was a program manager at Darpa, a research arm of the United States Department of Defense, and now works on driverless cars at Toyota. As he sees it, machines that spread computations across vast numbers of tiny, low-power chips can operate more like the human brain, which efficiently uses the energy at its disposal.\u201cIn the brain, energy efficiency is the key,\u201d he said during a recent interview at Toyota\u2019s new research center in Silicon Valley.There are many kinds of silicon chips. There are chips that store information. There are chips that perform basic tasks in toys and televisions. And there are chips that run various processes for computers, from the supercomputers used to create models for global warming to personal computers, internet servers and smartphones.For years, the central processing units, or C.P.U.s, that ran PCs and similar devices were where the money was. And there had not been much need for change.By 2010, however, doubling the number of transistors was taking much longer than Moore\u2019s Law predicted. Dennard\u2019s scaling maxim had also been upended as chip designers ran into the limits of the physical materials they used to build processors. The result: If a company wanted more computing power, it could not just upgrade its processors. It needed more computers, more space and more electricity.At the time, Microsoft was just beginning to improve Bing using machine-learning algorithms (neural networks are a type of machine learning) that could improve search results by analyzing the way people used the service. Though these algorithms were less demanding than the neural networks that would later remake the internet, existing chips had trouble keeping up.Mr. Burger and his team explored several options but eventually settled on something called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or F.P.G.A.s.: chips that could be reprogrammed for new jobs on the fly. Microsoft builds software, like Windows, that runs on an Intel C.P.U. But such software cannot reprogram the chip, since it is hard-wired to perform only certain tasks.With an F.P.G.A., Microsoft could change the way the chip works. It could program the chip to be really good at executing particular machine learning algorithms. Then, it could reprogram the chip to be really good at running logic that sends the millions and millions of data packets across its computer network. It was the same chip but it behaved in a different way.Microsoft started to install the chips en masse in 2015. Now, just about every new server loaded into a Microsoft data center includes one of these programmable chips. They help choose the results when you search Bing, and they help Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing service, shuttle information across its network of underlying machines.In fall 2016, another team of Microsoft researchers \u2014 mirroring the work done by Jeff Dean at Google \u2014 built a neural network that could, by one measure at least, recognize spoken words more accurately than the average human could.Xuedong Huang and his fellow Microsoft researchers had trained their speech-recognition service using large numbers of specialty chips supplied by Nvidia, rather than relying heavily on ordinary Intel chips. Their breakthrough would not have been possible had they not made that change.\u201cWe closed the gap with humans in about a year,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Mr. Huang said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the weapon \u2014 the infrastructure \u2014 it would have taken at least five years.\u201dBecause systems that rely on neural networks can learn largely on their own, they can evolve more quickly than traditional services. They are not as reliant on engineers writing endless lines of code that explain how they should behave.But there is a wrinkle: Training neural networks this way requires extensive trial and error. To create one that is able to recognize words as well as a human can, researchers must train it repeatedly, tweaking the algorithms and improving the training data over and over. At any given time, this process unfolds over hundreds of algorithms. That requires enormous computing power, and if companies like Microsoft use standard-issue chips to do it, the process takes far too long because the chips cannot handle the load and too much electrical power is consumed.So, the leading internet companies are now training their neural networks with help from another type of chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. These low-power chips \u2014 usually made by Nvidia \u2014 were originally designed to render images for games and other software, and they worked hand-in-hand with the chip \u2014 usually made by Intel \u2014 at the center of a computer. G.P.U.s can process the math required by neural networks far more efficiently than C.P.U.s.Nvidia is thriving as a result, and it is now selling large numbers of G.P.U.s to the internet giants of the United States and the biggest online companies around the world, in China most notably. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue from data center sales tripled to $409 million over the past year.G.P.U.s are the primary vehicles that companies use to teach their neural networks a particular task, but that is only part of the process. Once a neural network is trained for a task, it must perform it, and that requires a different kind of computing power.After training a speech-recognition algorithm, for example, Microsoft offers it up as an online service, and it actually starts identifying commands that people speak into their smartphones. G.P.U.s are not quite as efficient during this stage of the process. So, many companies are now building chips specifically to do what the other chips have learned.Google built its own specialty chip, a Tensor Processing Unit, or T.P.U. Nvidia is building a similar chip. And Microsoft has reprogrammed specialized chips from Altera, which was acquired by Intel, so that it too can run neural networks more easily.Other companies are following suit. Qualcomm, which specializes in chips for smartphones, and a number of start-ups are also working on A.I. chips, hoping to grab their piece of the rapidly expanding market. The tech research firm IDC predicts that revenue from servers equipped with alternative chips will reach $6.8 billion by 2021, about 10 percent of the overall server market.Across Microsoft\u2019s global network of machines, Mr. Burger pointed out, alternative chips are still a relatively modest part of the operation. And Bart Sano, the vice president of engineering who leads hardware and software development for Google\u2019s network, said much the same about the chips deployed at its data centers.Mike Mayberry, who leads Intel Labs, played down the shift toward alternative processors, perhaps because Intel controls more than 90 percent of the data-center market, making it by far the largest seller of traditional chips. He said that if central processors were modified the right way, they could handle new tasks without added help.But this new breed of silicon is spreading rapidly, and Intel is increasingly a company in conflict with itself. It is in some ways denying that the market is changing, but nonetheless shifting its business to keep up with the change.Two years ago, Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, which builds the programmable chips that Microsoft uses. It was Intel\u2019s largest acquisition ever. Last year, the company paid a reported $408 million buying Nervana, a company that was exploring a chip just for executing neural networks. Now, led by the Nervana team, Intel is developing a dedicated chip for training and executing neural networks.\u201cThey have the traditional big-company problem,\u201d said Bill Coughran, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital who spent nearly a decade helping to oversee Google\u2019s online infrastructure, referring to Intel. \u201cThey need to figure out how to move into the new and growing areas without damaging their traditional business.\u201dIntel\u2019s internal conflict is most apparent when company officials discuss the decline of Moore\u2019s Law. During a recent interview with The New York Times, Naveen Rao, the Nervana founder and now an Intel executive, said Intel could squeeze \u201ca few more years\u201d out of Moore\u2019s Law. Officially, the company\u2019s position is that improvements in traditional chips will continue well into the next decade.Mr. Mayberry of Intel also argued that the use of additional chips was not new. In the past, he said, computer makers used separate chips for tasks like processing audio.But now the scope of the trend is significantly larger. And it is changing the market in new ways. Intel is competing not only with chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm, but also with companies like Google and Microsoft.Google is designing the second generation of its T.P.U. chips. Later this year, the company said, any business or developer that is a customer of its cloud-computing service will be able to use the new chips to run its software.While this shift is happening mostly inside the massive data centers that underpin the internet, it is probably a matter of time before it permeates the broader industry.The hope is that this new breed of mobile chip can help devices handle more, and more complex, tasks on their own, without calling back to distant data centers: phones recognizing spoken commands without accessing the internet; driverless cars recognizing the world around them with a speed and accuracy that is not possible now.In other words, a driverless car needs cameras and radar and lasers. But it also needs a brain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toshiba Reaches Deal With Bain-Apple Group to Sell Chip Business", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba, the huge but struggling Japanese conglomerate, traded some of its size for financial security on Thursday by selling off most of its profitable microchip business.It was not the way the company, which has long been accused of being bloated and directionless, had hoped to slim down.Toshiba said it had signed a deal to sell 60 percent of the microchip unit, Toshiba Memory Corporation, to a group of international investors that includes Bain Capital and Apple. The deal, which followed months of tumultuous negotiations, will net Toshiba about $14 billion.Toshiba traces its roots to the 1870s, when its founders helped further Japan\u2019s industrial emergence, building the country\u2019s telegraph system and installing its first domestically made electric lights. If the company had collapsed, Japan would have lost a pillar of its economy and its tens of thousands of workers. It also would have lost the main contractor cleaning up the ruined Fukushima nuclear plant, which Toshiba helped build decades ago.While Toshiba\u2019s history in many ways embodied Japan\u2019s blazing economic rise, some people say the stumbles that led the company to sell chip unit reflected the country\u2019s more recent problems.In an era when the global technology industry is dominated by nimble specialists selling cutting-edge design and software, Toshiba has been defined by a stultifying management hierarchy, a dogged focus on hardware and a scattered portfolio of businesses.\u201cToshiba is one of Japan\u2019s last zombies,\u201d said Jesper Koll, the chief executive of WisdomTree Japan, an investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s the last of the big conglomerates that does not have a defined strategy.\u201dSimilar problems have hampered other Japanese groups, but Mr. Koll said that Toshiba had been particularly slow to address them. Others, like Hitachi, another refrigerators-to-power-plants conglomerate, he said, \u201cmade hard decisions\u201d to restructure and become more accountable to shareholders, while Toshiba delayed.The inaction helped Toshiba executives save face, at least for a while.Now, with the sale of a majority of the microchip unit, Toshiba is shrinking further.Two financial institutions controlled by the Japanese government that Toshiba had previously identified as major potential investors will not contribute money initially, the company said. The institutions, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, may invest at a later date.The investors were instead drawn entirely from the private sector.In addition to Apple, they include three other American businesses: Seagate Technology and Kingston Technology, two data storage companies, and a venture capital arm of Dell, the computer maker. The South Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix, and Hoya, a Japanese manufacturer of optical equipment, were also named as investors.Toshiba itself will retain just over 40 percent of the unit, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of the flash memory chips used to store data in smartphones and other digital devices.In negotiating the deal, Toshiba struggled to balance its need for cash and its desire to retain control of the microchip unit, which has been described as the crown jewel in its vast portfolio of businesses.Toshiba pioneered its core technology, NAND flash memory, and although it has fallen to second in global production, behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the business has generated the largest share of Toshiba\u2019s profits in recent years. Among the company\u2019s concerns was that its technology could fall into the hands of investors, like SK Hynix and Kingston, that are also its competitors.Although Japan dominated the global microchip market in the 1980s and 1990s, it has lost ground more recently. Tsugio Makimoto, a retired semiconductor engineer at Hitachi, said that in the past, big conglomerates were good at nurturing microchip businesses, because they had the money to finance research and build factories.Now, as the pace of technological change has quickened, \u201cmanagement speed and specialization are more important,\u201d he said.While Toshiba will retain only a minority of the chip unit\u2019s shares, it will still exercise significant control.The American investors, whose precise financial contributions were not disclosed, will receive preferred shares that do not carry voting rights, Toshiba said. SK Hynix would be limited to an ownership stake of no more than 15 percent for 10 years.Hoya is buying 10 percent. In a line that reflected nationalistic concerns about the sale, Toshiba made a point of noting that, \u201cWith Toshiba and Hoya\u2019s investments, Japan-based companies will hold more than 50 percent of the common stock.\u201d It added that Japanese owners would \u201ccontinue to hold a majority\u201d in the future.In proceeding with the deal, Toshiba brushed aside objections by one of its business partners, Western Digital, the American storage company. Western Digital could still move to block the sale\u2019s completion.A Western Digital subsidiary, SanDisk, shares ownership with Toshiba of a flash memory production operation in Japan. Because of that, the American company contends that its approval is necessary for Toshiba to sell the chip unit. Western Digital said this week that it would seek an injunction against the deal.If the legal battle is settled in Toshiba\u2019s favor, or if the two sides reach a settlement, it could make it easier for risk-averse government institutions like the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan to join the buyout conglomerate. That would take pressure off other investors and Toshiba\u2019s banks, which Toshiba said had agreed to provide 600 billion yen in fresh loans.Regardless of the legal outcome, Toshiba\u2019s relationship with Western Digital and SanDisk has been badly damaged, presenting a challenge for the chip unit\u2019s new owners.\u201cToshiba\u2019s flash memory success has a lot to do with its relationship with SanDisk,\u201d said Mr. Makimoto. \u201cThere are still a lot of issues to address before Toshiba can breathe easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Unveils iPhone X and 8 Models as It Upgrades TV Set-Top Box", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple unveiled iPhone X, its first premium-tier phone, at an event in Cupertino, Calif., on Tuesday. Here\u2019s what else the company had to say.\u2022 iPhone X is priced at $999, the most expensive ever for a new iPhone model. It will ship on Nov. 3. (Pro tip: The X is pronounced 10, and not \u201cex.\u201d)\u2022 The phone has a newer screen technology known as OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.\u2022 The screen on the X has a so-called edge-to-edge display that takes up the entire face by eliminating the borders around the screen. Apple also eliminated the physical home button that has been a signature feature of the iPhone for a decade.\u2022 iPhone 8 is also here, as well as its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus. The models include a glass body and a faster chip.\u2022 Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box that has never been a blockbuster hit, got an upgrade. The device will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs.\u2022 Apple took the wraps off a new Apple Watch. Called Apple Watch Series 3, it has cellular capabilities. There\u2019s also a new Watch OS.With the $999 iPhone X, Apple moved to a new premium level of pricing. The smartphone will cost $300 more than the iPhone 8 and $200 more than the iPhone 8 Plus.While that will be too expensive for many people, the company said it saw the iPhone X defining a new era for the smartphone, much like the original iPhone did 10 years ago. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the device would \u201cset the path for the next decade.\u201d That\u2019s because Apple will likely build on some of the iPhone X\u2019s most notable features, including infrared facial recognition, wireless battery charging and sophisticated camera effects.Consumer reaction to the new phone will have a big impact on the company\u2019s revenue and stock price. Right now, analysts are betting on a slow uptake of the top-end phone, both because of production delays and the high price. But if it turns out to be an unexpected hit, like the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 Plus, the company\u2019s sales \u2014 and stock price \u2014 could surge.Wall Street wasn\u2019t immediately dazzled by Apple\u2019s presentation, however, with the stock price down more than 1 percent by the end of the event.The iPhone X is the first redesigned iPhone in three years, and Apple says it is the blueprint for \u201cthe future of the smartphone.\u201d Many of the design details had leaked to the press before today\u2019s unveiling \u2014 we\u2019d heard that it would have a new display that stretched across much more of the phone\u2019s front, and that it would do away with the trademark home button.Much of that turned out to be true. The iPhone X is essentially the same size and overall shape as the iPhone 7, but because the screen occupies all of the front of the phone, it is far larger than that of older models. The screen uses a technology new for Apple (which many competitors already use), called OLED. It produces better image quality than Apple\u2019s older LCD screens.What we didn\u2019t quite know was how Apple would integrate the new button-free design with the operating system \u2014 how would you navigate the phone without a physical button?It\u2019s quite simple: You swipe. To go home, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To see other apps, swipe up from the bottom and pause \u2014 now you see the multitasking pane. And to unlock your phone, you look at it. The iPhone X eliminates Apple\u2019s Touch ID, and replaces it with a facial-recognition system that Apple calls Face ID.Whether people will adjust to the button-free system remains to be seen. For better or worse, Apple has used essentially the same interface for the iPhone for the last decade. Swiping is easy, but it isn\u2019t as easy as hitting a button, and it may throw some people off at first. The learning curve will be interesting to watch.\u2014 Farhad ManjooThe brand-new feature in the iPhone X that has never existed on any other iPhone is infrared face scanning.The technology, called Face ID, uses an infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the phone and authorize mobile payments. The technology works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.For Apple, Face ID has been years in the making. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a camera system that scanned people\u2019s bodies so people could play Xbox games using body movements.Face ID is a direct response to the face-recognition feature in smartphones offered by Samsung, Apple\u2019s fiercest rival. Experts have criticized Samsung\u2019s face-recognition feature, which could be tricked by holding a photo of the smartphone owner\u2019s face in front of the camera.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.The new iPhone 8 line includes the iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the 8 Plus.The phones include a six-core processor that will handle more complex tasks and 3D games more quickly and efficiently than previous iPhones. The phones generally look the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with the exception of glass bodies, as opposed to aluminum.Apple improved the phones\u2019 cameras with new sensors and added new motion sensors to better support applications made for augmented reality, which use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.In particular, the dual cameras in the iPhone 8 Plus take photos with sharp details in low light. Apple also added a new portrait mode to improve the lighting on faces regardless of the background.Another notable new feature is the introduction of magnetic induction to the iPhones. Similar to Apple Watch, the iPhones can now be charged by being placed on a charging pad as opposed to being plugged in with a cable.The new iPhone 8 line will be one of the most important for Apple. Wall Street analysts have estimated that more than half of iPhone buyers will buy the 8 and 8 Plus over the next year. The models have a slightly higher starting price than their predecessors: The iPhone 8 starts at $699, up from $650 for older iPhone models.The new Apple TV, called Apple TV 4K, it is an iteration of the last model, which introduced a touch pad remote control. The new box will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, added that 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, and those who previously bought high-definition titles would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost.Apple said the new Apple TV 4K is also two times faster than the last one and includes support for a new color technology called H.D.R., or high dynamic range. This software feature enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture. In bright colors, you will see brighter highlights; in dark colors, you will see more details.The Apple Watch has been a sleeper hit for the company. Though early reviews were mixed, Apple has steadily improved the device, and now the smartwatch is the best-selling watch in the world, according to Apple.Today, Apple unveiled the third version of the device. It looks identical to the old version, but the new one carries a much-requested feature for the first time: It will come with a cellular chip, meaning it can access the internet even if it isn\u2019t connected to your phone. Among other capabilities, the cellular version can make calls, send texts and stream music when you\u2019re on the go.\u201cNow you have the freedom to go anywhere with just the Apple Watch,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.The cellular version completes a long-term vision for the Watch \u2014 to liberate you, in some small way, from Apple\u2019s best-selling phone. In a demo, a live call was made from the keynote address to an Apple employee on paddle board in the middle of a lake.This is a slightly risky strategy, of course; Apple doesn\u2019t want to kill its golden iPhone goose. But the new cellular watch is unlikely to be a replacement for the phone, just a high-priced complement.The new cellular version sells for $399; a WiFi-only version of the new version sells for $329, and you can still buy the older version for $249. The new watch will begin shipping on Sept. 22.Apple is set to unveil several new gadgets later this morning, but the highlight of today\u2019s event isn\u2019t something you can buy. It\u2019s Apple Park, the company\u2019s new $5 billion spaceship-shaped campus, which the company is showing off to the media for the first time.The press were penned off just out of range of the main building, at the Steve Jobs Theater, the 1,000-seat venue with a commanding view of the spaceship. A quick review: This place is just what you\u2019d imagine an Apple-designed campus would look like. Think of the aesthetics of an Apple Store \u2014 lots of wood and glass, everything in muted tans and greys, all signage in white-on-black Apple Sans type \u2014 set on an otherwise barren landscape.It is, unsurprisingly, very pretty, but its beauty comes with a deliberate touch of fright. Nothing here is to human scale, and the overall impression is one of being overwhelmed by Apple\u2019s sheer might.\u2014 Farhad ManjooAn earlier version of this article misstated the cost comparison of content streamed in 4K resolution on the new Apple TV 4K that was given by Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services. Mr. Cue said that the 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, not rent.An article on Wednesday about Apple\u2019s newly released iPhone models described incorrectly a phone call made during Apple\u2019s product announcement at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. An executive onstage at headquarters demonstrated Apple Watch capabilities by calling an employee on a paddle board in a lake; the employee did not initiate the call.videoAdvertisement"}

Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called \u201cMother\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d which criticized how the communist country was run.One line read, \u201cOne century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?\u201dThe diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T.

And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Now it\u2019s trying a different approach.Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.A beefier hardware team should also help Google bring much more of the design in-house. It should also help it realize some of its bigger smartphone hardware ambitions, which include things like making its own SoCs and building machine learning coprocessors.FlashbackGoogle was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later.The decision to buy Motorola was \u201cthe extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that\u2019s not a fixer-upper.\u201dStandard & Poor\u2019s move, which cut China\u2019s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999.

It is believed the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk.The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.\u201cSo, as you may have read, I was fired by the president of the United States.\u201dThe HighlightAt the start of the podcast, Mr. Bharara recounted his interactions with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to his dismissal as a United States attorney.

{"Headline": "At Google, Employee-Led Effort Finds Men Are Paid More Than Women", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Female employees are paid less than male staff members at most job levels within Google, and the pay disparity extends as women climb the corporate ladder, according to data compiled by employees that provide a snapshot of salary information at the internet giant.A spreadsheet, obtained by The New York Times, contains salary and bonus information for 2017 that was shared by about 1,200 United States Google employees, or about 2 percent of the company\u2019s global work force.While Google said the data painted an incomplete picture of how people are paid, the salary details shared by employees are likely to heighten concerns over gender disparities in Silicon Valley.Even as America\u2019s technology giants continue to grow in wealth and influence, most have shown little progress in leveling the playing field for women, who are underrepresented in key engineering and leadership roles and are paid less than men. These gender imbalances are reflected in long-term studies of large companies around the world by the McKinsey Global Institute.The scrutiny has been especially intense at Google. Long regarded as one of the world\u2019s best workplaces because of its perks and generous compensation, the company is under examination by the Labor Department and has faced criticism from investors and some of its own employees over differences in how women and men are paid.\u201cSilicon Valley has established itself as the boys\u2019 club of the West, just like how Wall Street has established itself as the boys\u2019 club of the East,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, a wealth management firm that takes activist positions on issues such as gender pay.At a shareholder meeting for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, earlier this year, Arjuna Capital put forward a proposal for the company to disclose what women make compared with their male peers. Arjuna had successfully persuaded seven of nine technology companies, including Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft, to disclose that data. Alphabet\u2019s directors urged shareholders to vote against the measure, and it failed.The self-reported Google salary spreadsheet was started in 2015 by a former employee who wanted to help co-workers negotiate better salaries. That employees were keeping track of this information became public knowledge soon after, but the spreadsheet\u2019s details remained private.The salary information in the spreadsheet cannot be viewed as an exact portrait of what people make at the company, because some employees may have erred when they put in their information. At some job levels, only a handful of employees volunteered to share their salary information, so a few salaries can skew the data. Even though it\u2019s not a random sample of staff members, the information is tracked closely throughout the company.The spreadsheet covers levels one through six of Google\u2019s job hierarchy, from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six. It does not include company executives and top-level engineers, who receive a wider range of salaries.At five of the six job levels, women are paid less than men. At level three, the entry level for technical positions, women make 4 percent less than men at $124,000 in salary and bonus. But it widens to 6 percent by the time employees reach midcareer status, around level five, with women earning, on average, $11,000 less than men.Google said the spreadsheet\u2019s information does not take into account a number of factors, like where employees are based, whether they are in higher-paying technical positions, and job performance.Based upon its own analysis from January, Google said female employees make 99.7 cents for every dollar a man makes, accounting for factors like location, tenure, job role, level and performance.Google said its analysis includes salary, bonus and equity compensation for 95 percent of employees between levels one and nine \u2014 three levels beyond what was reflected in the data shared with The Times \u2014 while excluding vice presidents and above. Google did not provide a breakdown of how it arrived at that calculation.Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, said the gender pay disparity reflected in the internal spreadsheet is \u201cnot a representative sample\u201d for other, more complex reasons. For example, a person in a nontechnical role may be at the same job level as an engineer, but will be paid significantly less because \u201cthere is a premium paid in all markets for highly technical talent.\u201dThe percentage of women in technical positions is lower than the overall percentage of female employees, with more women in sales, marketing, human resources or legal. Those roles, according to Ms. Naughton, do not have the same entry-level or midcareer salaries as technical positions.Other factors include geography and job performance. A position at Google\u2019s main office in Mountain View, Calif. \u2014 where the cost of living is high \u2014 may pay a lot more than a Google employee of a similar rank hired in a cheaper market. In addition, job performance significantly governs a person\u2019s pay over time \u2014 another factor not reflected in the spreadsheet.Google said it tries to exclude gender when determining salaries. Human resources analysts who determine what salary a person is offered when he or she joins Google do not know the candidate\u2019s gender. Similarly, when an employee\u2019s salary is up for annual review, the company takes into account the person\u2019s job performance, location and competitive salaries \u2014 but the analysts are not informed of the person\u2019s gender.\u201cThere\u2019s a meme around tech companies and Silicon Valley, around issues having to do with gender equity in tech,\u201d Ms. Naughton said. \u201cI do believe Google, because of its size and perhaps our size or our prominence in people\u2019s everyday lives, I think we\u2019re in the spotlight. It feels a little unfair.\u201dWhat Google pays men versus women is at the heart of a dispute with the Department of Labor. The company is fighting over how much data it needs to hand over as part of a routine audit of its pay practices. Google is a federal contractor because it sells advertising to the government.Google said it has already shared a lot of data and documents and that the Labor Department is overreaching by asking for employees\u2019 private information. An administrative law judge ruled in July that Google had to disclose some data but not as much as the Labor Department had wanted.James Finberg, a civil rights lawyer and partner at Altshuler Berzon L.L.P., said he expected to bring a class-action lawsuit against Google for \u201csubstantial gender disparities\u201d later this month. Mr. Finberg said more than 90 current and former female employees have come forward to be plaintiffs.He said that these women spoke about experiencing discrimination by being slotted into positions at a level below a man with similar qualifications and that women are not promoted with the same frequency as men. He said that some of the gender stereotypes cited in the memo are widespread and that they kept women out of higher-paying engineering jobs.\u201cIt is an atmosphere filled with stereotypes, that the comments espoused in the memo were not isolated incidents,\u201d Mr. Finberg said. \u201cThey are more of the norm than the anomaly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At $1,000, Apple\u2019s iPhone X Crosses a Pricing Threshold", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company will also enter new territory on price: The latest phone will start at about $1,000, compared with the $769 minimum for its current top phone, the iPhone 7 Plus.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new threshold,\u201d said Debby Ruth, a senior vice president at the tech consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates. I really do think it\u2019s going to make people pause.\u201dFrom the iPhone\u2019s introduction a decade ago, Apple has always priced it as a premium product \u2014 a more refined and polished alternative to the legions of cheaper smartphones available in the market.But this time, the company is pushing into luxury territory. The new phone will cost as much as the company\u2019s entry-level MacBook Air laptop. \u201cThey\u2019re doubling down on their strategy: They are going much more to the high end,\u201d Ms. Ruth said.Investors are betting that Apple\u2019s move up the price ladder will pay off with much higher profits, especially in mature markets like the United States and Western Europe, where many of the buyers will be people upgrading from older iPhones. The company\u2019s stock has risen by nearly 50 percent over the past year as anticipation has built about the 2017 models.Apple\u2019s strategy carries risks, however, especially in developing countries where smartphone sales are growing briskly but its market share is a blip compared with devices running Google\u2019s Android software.In Brazil, for example, Apple devices will account for just 8 percent of the 125 million active smartphone subscriptions this year, according to Forrester, a research firm.Steep taxes, higher retail profit margins, and added costs from a botched attempt at building iPhones in Brazil have pushed the price of an iPhone 6s, a two-year-old model, to more than $1,000 at Casa Bahia, a store in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. In late August, the retailer was selling Apple\u2019s most basic smartphone, the iPhone SE, for more than $600, while a Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini, which runs Android, was just $136.At another Rio store recently, Vanessa Perreira, 25, a university student, was browsing the 65 models on display, looking at the offerings from Samsung and LG but ignoring the six from Apple. She once owned an iPhone, she lamented, but could not afford to continue buying them. \u201cPrice is the most important factor for me,\u201d she said.Still, the iPhone is coveted by wealthier Brazilians, many of whom buy the phone while traveling abroad to avoid their country\u2019s high costs. \u201cThere will always be users in Brazil that will be interested in buying it,\u201d said Tina Lu, a senior analyst with Counterpoint Research.China\u2019s reception to the $1,000 iPhone will be even more crucial to Apple. The Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, contributed $8 billion to Apple\u2019s revenue last quarter, but sales have been sluggish.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.Apple\u2019s market share has declined slightly in China over the past year, according to Counterpoint. High-end phones from Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo have gained ground, in part by undercutting Apple on price.The new iPhone has the potential to reverse that trend. More than any other tech product, the iPhone has long denoted status in China. If a new iPhone looks the same as the previous one \u2014 and won\u2019t be recognized by others as new \u2014 it often doesn\u2019t sell well.\u201cIf the phone\u2019s appearance changes, I think people are going to be crazy about it, because we\u2019ve seen the iPhone with a similar look for such a long time now,\u201d said He Peihuan, a Shanghai-based financial analyst.Apple has also faced pressure from the Chinese government. State-run media outlets have called attention to a feature that tracked a user\u2019s most commonly visited locations and also criticized the company\u2019s after-sales policies. And government employees and leaders at state-run companies try to avoid being seen using foreign technologies like the iPhone.For all that, Zhang Xiang, a phone reseller and repairman in Shanghai, said that he still expected strong demand for the new iPhone. \u201cI think when people can afford it and want a high-end phone with good features, they\u2019ll still choose to buy an iPhone,\u201d he said.One important factor offsetting the next iPhone\u2019s expected high price is the increasing prevalence of financing options for buyers around the globe. In the United States, most phone carriers allow customers to spread the cost of a new phone over two years, and the new phone would add less than $10 a month to the payments a customer would make on an iPhone 7 Plus.\u201cThere\u2019s not that much difference in the monthly fee you have to pay,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst at Gartner, a research firm.Similar installment purchase plans are emerging in China, Brazil and other countries, making Apple\u2019s products more affordable there.\u201cI\u2019ve seen some banks providing installment plans for the iPhone with very low, or even no interest, so ordinary people could get an iPhone that way,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.That would play into Satish Meena\u2019s theory of iPhone adoption in developing countries.Mr. Meena, a senior forecast analyst at Forrester who is based in New Delhi, said that in places like India and Brazil, where millions of new smartphone users are entering the market, the first phone that people buy is a cheap Android. The second tends to be a fancier Android. Finally, they upgrade to an iPhone.\u201cThe iPhone is your dream phone,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a chart accompanying this article misstated the number of active smartphone subscribers in various countries. The figures for each country are for millions of subscribers, not thousands.Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro and Paul Mozur and Carolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Shanghai.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Blocks WhatsApp, Broadening Online Censorship", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has largely blocked the WhatsApp messaging app, the latest move by Beijing to step up surveillance ahead of a big Communist Party gathering next month.The disabling in mainland China of the Facebook-owned app is a setback for the social media giant, whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has been pushing to re-enter the Chinese market, and has been studying the Chinese language intensively. WhatsApp was the last of Facebook products to still be available in mainland China; the company\u2019s main social media service has been blocked in China since 2009, and its Instagram image-sharing app is also unavailable.WhatsApp now appears to have been broadly disrupted in China, even for text messages, Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a Paris-based research start-up, said on Monday. The blocking of WhatsApp text messages suggests that China\u2019s censors may have developed specialized software to interfere with such messages, which rely on an encryption technology that is used by few services other than WhatsApp, he said.\u201cThis is not the typical technical method in which the Chinese government censors something,\u201d Mr. Kobeissi said. He added that his company\u2019s automated monitors had begun detecting disruptions of WhatsApp in China on Wednesday, and that by Monday the blocking efforts were comprehensive.Facebook declined to comment, following past practice when asked about WhatsApp\u2019s difficulties in China.Lokman Tsui, an internet communications specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that WhatsApp seemed to have been severely disrupted starting on Sunday. But he said that some WhatsApp users might still be able to use the service.The Chinese authorities have a history of mostly, but not entirely, blocking internet services, as well as slowing them down so much that they become useless. The censorship has prompted many in China to switch to communications methods that function smoothly and quickly but that are easily monitored by the Chinese authorities, like the WeChat app of the Chinese internet company Tencent, which is based in Shenzhen.\u201cIf you\u2019re only allowed to drive one mile per hour, you\u2019re not going to drive on that road, even if it\u2019s not technically blocked,\u201d Mr. Tsui said.The disruption of WhatsApp comes as Beijing prepares for the Communist Party\u2019s congress, which starts Oct. 18. Held once every five years, the congress chooses the party\u2019s leadership, which in turn runs the country. Next month\u2019s meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinping\u2019s nearly absolute grip on power, but considerable uncertainty remains over who will join him on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the party\u2019s highest-ranking group.Over the past several years, China has not only stepped up censorship but also closed numerous churches and jailed large numbers of human rights activists, lawyers and advocates for ethnic minorities.The shutdown of WhatsApp prompted considerable dismay on Chinese social media.\u201cLosing contact with my clients, forced back to the age of telephone and email for work now,\u201d one user complained on Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging site.\u201cEven WhatsApp is blocked now? I\u2019m going to be out of business soon,\u201d another Chinese social media user said on Weibo.In China, even the use of email is fading as residents embrace the convenience of WeChat. The messaging service, which has 963 million active users, bears some similarities to WhatsApp but has a wider array of features and one crucial difference: close ties to the government. This month, WeChat sent a notice to users reminding them that it complied with official requests for information.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to open online data services and other enhanced telecommunications services to international competition. But it obtained the assent of other W.T.O. members to retain restrictions on the media. Technology multinationals, heavily dependent on the Chinese market, have been reluctant to accuse Beijing of falling short of its W.T.O. commitments.The Office of the United States Trade Representative has opened a formal investigation into whether China is violating the intellectual property of American companies, but it has released few details. The trade office has not said whether the inquiry will include the blocking of products that rely on American intellectual property, or whether it will focus more narrowly on cases in which China has allegedly purloined or otherwise copied it.WhatsApp has a strong reputation among cryptographers for security, which may have been what drew the attention of Chinese censors. The app provides so-called end-to-end encryption, which effectively means that even Facebook does not know what is being said in the text, voice and video conversations passing through its servers.WhatsApp\u2019s video, file sharing and other advanced features rely partly on broadly used internet data transfer protocols, and were disrupted over the summer. But its text messaging function relies on a different, heavily encrypted method for moving data that has seldom been used by companies.The latest disruption of the WhatsApp messaging system suggests that China\u2019s censorship apparatus may have figured out how to target the more uncommon and heavily encrypted data transport protocol as well, Mr. Kobeissi said.Other services provided by American technology companies are available in mainland China. The country tolerates Microsoft\u2019s Skype service for phone calls, which does not provide end-to-end encryption and as a result is easier for governments to monitor. Beijing also allows Apple\u2019s FaceTime service, which has end-to-end encryption but does not have a WhatsApp-like feature allowing users to exchange secret codes \u2014 letting WhatsApp users combat what are known as \u201cman in the middle\u201d attacks.By blocking the heavily encrypted WhatsApp service while making less secure applications like WeChat available to the public, the Chinese government has herded its internet users toward methods of communication that it can reliably monitor.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

In concept, the Arrow was the most advanced airplane of its time. Had it been fully developed, many people told me, Canada would have become a major force in aviation. (Several Canadian companies, notably Bombardier and CAE, nevertheless grew into major international aerospace players.)But almost everyone I met also mentioned the government\u2019s campaign to seemingly wipe away all traces of the Arrow. The six complete planes and the partially built ones on the assembly line were cut into pieces and many of their blueprints were destroyed, as was the manufacturing machinery.The effort to erase the Arrow is usually attributed to John Diefenbaker, the volatile prime minister who canceled the program.Through military and government documents, he found that the complete planes were offered to aviation research organizations in Canada, the United States and Britain. All of them said, no, thanks, apparently because of the cost of keeping a small fleet of orphaned planes flying.The destruction that followed, Mr. Isinger found, was not \u201cnot out of Diefenbaker\u2019s vindictiveness\u201d but was \u201csimply due to bureaucratic standard operating procedure.\u201dApple on Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by unveiling three new phones (four if you count the Apple Watch that can make calls). By coincidence that same day, I came across a folder with material from when I interviewed Steve Jobs shortly before the first Macintosh computer was unveiled in 1984. (At the time, I worked for Maclean\u2019s magazine.)Apple product launches were certainly less slick back then. The key handout for the Mac was a four-page, black-and-white photocopy with crude graphics made with the new Mac.But a spokeswoman sitting in during the interview on Jan. 12, 1984, would have nothing to do with that sentiment, interrupting Mr. Jobs to say: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be \u2018insanely great\u2019.\u201dNever modest, Mr. Jobs said that the Mac was as great an advance over other computers as the telephone was over the telegraph.Growing increasingly excited (according to my musty transcript), Mr. Jobs predicted that the Mac would give Apple sales of $10 billion by the end of the decade. That didn\u2019t pan out. In 1990 its sales were $5.5 billion. The company, of course, eventually far outstripped Mr. Jobs\u2019s dreams and reported sales last year of $215.6 billion.Keeping Apple from that fate, he suggested, required him to be a demanding boss.\u201cI really want to set an expectation of nothing short of great, and there are some people that are interested in doing adequate stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people and I don\u2019t get along very well.\u201dAbout a year later Mr. Jobs was ousted from Apple, and he didn\u2019t return until 1997.Many people at The Times, including me, tell you what\u2019s happening in the world. But some of my colleagues write about how to improve your health and lives in general. Here are some of the most popular such stories last month:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boston Red Sox Used Apple Watches to Steal Signs Against Yankees", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For decades, spying on another team has been as much a part of baseball\u2019s gamesmanship as brushback pitches and hard slides. The Boston Red Sox have apparently added a modern \u2014 and illicit \u2014 twist: They used an Apple Watch to gain an advantage against the Yankees and other teams.The baseball inquiry began about two weeks ago, after the Yankees\u2019 general manager, Brian Cashman, filed a detailed complaint with the commissioner\u2019s office that included video the Yankees shot of the Red Sox dugout during a three-game series between the two teams in Boston last month.Boston used an Apple Watch and video cameras to illegally gain an advantage, decoding the signs of the Yankees\u2019 catcher to the pitcher.The Yankees, who had long been suspicious of the Red Sox\u2019 stealing catchers\u2019 signs in Fenway Park, contended the video showed a member of the Red Sox training staff looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout. The trainer then relayed a message to other players in the dugout, who, in turn, would signal teammates on the field about the type of pitch that was about to be thrown, according to the people familiar with the case.Baseball investigators corroborated the Yankees\u2019 claims based on video the commissioner\u2019s office uses for instant replay and broadcasts, the people said. The commissioner\u2019s office then confronted the Red Sox, who admitted that their trainers had received signals from video replay personnel and then relayed that information to Red Sox players \u2014 an operation that had been in place for at least several weeks.The Red Sox responded in kind on Tuesday, filing a complaint against the Yankees claiming that the team uses a camera from its YES television network exclusively to steal signs during games, an assertion the Yankees denied.It is unclear what penalties, if any, Commissioner Rob Manfred will issue against the Red Sox and whether he will order a more expansive investigation to determine the extent of the Red Sox\u2019 sign-stealing system. It is also unclear how he will proceed with the countercomplaint.\u201cWe will conduct a thorough investigation on both sides,\u201d Mr. Manfred said to reporters at Fenway Park, where he was present for an unrelated event. \u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent comfortable that it is not an ongoing issue.\u201dMr. Manfred said he believed he had the power to punish teams in connection with such cheating.\u201cAnd the reason for that,\u201d he added, \u201cis it\u2019s just very hard to know what the actual impact on any particular game was of an alleged violation.\u201dBoston\u2019s manager, John Farrell, said he was aware that the players were trying to steal signs but said that he did not know they were using electronics.\u201cI\u2019m aware of the rule,\u201d Mr. Farrell said. \u201cElectronic devices are not to be used in the dugout. Beyond that, all I can say is it\u2019s a league matter at this point.\u201dStealing signs is believed to be particularly effective when there is a runner on second base who can both watch what hand signals the catcher is using to communicate with the pitcher and can easily relay to the batter any clues about what type of pitch may be coming. Such tactics are allowed as long as teams do not use any methods beyond their eyes. Binoculars and electronic devices are both prohibited.In recent years, as cameras have proliferated in major league ballparks, teams have begun using the abundance of video to help them discern opponents\u2019 signs, including the catcher\u2019s signals to the pitcher. Some clubs have had clubhouse attendants quickly relay information to the dugout from the personnel monitoring video feeds.But such information has to be rushed to the dugout on foot so it can be relayed to players on the field \u2014 a runner on second, the batter at the plate \u2014 while the information is still relevant. The Red Sox admitted to league investigators that they were able to significantly shorten this communications chain by using electronics. In what mimicked the rhythm of a double play, the information would rapidly go from video personnel to a trainer to the players.As part of the inquiry, baseball investigators have interviewed the Red Sox team trainers and outfielder Chris Young, a former Yankees player. The Red Sox told league investigators that Mr. Farrell; Boston\u2019s president for baseball operations, Dave Dombrowski; and other front-office officials were not aware of the sign-stealing operation, the people said.In the first game of the August series in question, the Red Sox prospered the first time they put a runner on second. It occurred in the second inning, and Rafael Devers promptly hit a home run, giving the Red Sox a 2-0 lead. The Red Sox went 5 for 8 in that game when they had a man on second.Their success when they had a runner on second in the other two games of the series was mixed: 1 for 6 in the second contest and 3 for 10 in the third.The video provided to the commissioner\u2019s office by the Yankees was captured during the first two games of the series and included at least three clips. In the clips, the Red Sox assistant athletic trainer, Jon Jochim, is seen looking at his Apple Watch and then passing information to outfielder Brock Holt and second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who was injured at the time but in uniform. In one instance, Pedroia is then seen passing the information to Young.The Red Sox\u2019 tactics will add to the longstanding rivalry with the Yankees. Outside New England, the case will be reminiscent of the Spygate controversy that erupted a decade ago when the world-beating Patriots were found to have violated N.F.L. rules by spying on opponents to gain an edge.Mr. Manfred is in a difficult position as he decides how to discipline the team and whether to continue investigating.In Spygate, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, hastily took away a first-round draft pick and fined the Patriots and their coach, Bill Belichick, before conducting a thorough investigation. When more evidence of cheating later emerged, Goodell was accused of trying to minimize the damage and protect one of the sport\u2019s premier franchises.In baseball, the most infamous incident involving sign stealing played out in 1951, when the New York Giants overcame a 13 \u00bd-game deficit over the final two months of the season to catch the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Giants went on to beat the Dodgers in a playoff for the pennant.Fifty years later, The Wall Street Journal revealed that the Giants had spies at the Polo Grounds who used a telescope to steal signs from the opposing catcher, which were then relayed to Giants players from the bullpen.In 1997, teams accused the Mets of planting small cameras near home plate in Shea Stadium to steal signals. The Mets denied that they had used the cameras to try to do so, and the league did not take any action.More recently, the Philadelphia Phillies faced sign-stealing accusations in 2011. Several teams logged complaints with the commissioner\u2019s office that the team used binoculars and other unauthorized methods to steal signs. Major League Baseball never imposed sanctions on the Phillies.Advertisement"}

It Made Selfies a Thing.", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementIt wasn\u2019t the first smartphone, the first mobile computer, or the first anything, really.But when I got my hands on the first iPhone in 2007, I knew it was unlike any machine I\u2019d ever used before, and it would forever alter my tech-addled life. It turns out it probably altered yours, too.In the early days, it was the simple things that were magical.The internet in your pocket. Connectivity at all times \u2014 news, baseball scores, recipes. (How innocent we were.)These sound like little things. But the collective weight of these tiny conveniences added up to something I almost couldn\u2019t live without.Almost. I returned the first iPhone three weeks after buying it.Its camera wasn\u2019t great. It didn\u2019t have the App Store. It worked on just one carrier. It cost $599. It was slow \u2014 very, very slow.Still, in those long moments it took to load a web page, you could see the whole future laid out before you: If they could get this right, if they could turn this into a general-purpose everywhere computer, it could change everything.The speed of the internet was vastly improved in the second one. The connected-everywhere promise was becoming something of a reality.And, despite Steve Jobs\u2019 early objections, Apple created its App Store.And apps could do things no other gadgets could do. Before the App Store, a song could come on the radio and you\u2019d have no way of figuring out what it was. Now you Shazam\u2019d it.Today, a lot of what you use on the iPhone is made by other people.These phones also knew where you were in the world, thanks to GPS. You could use maps in real time to get around. But GPS would eventually lead to so much more: Uber, Tinder, a scrapbook of photos on a map.The price was also right.AT&T, the only carrier offering it at the time, sold the new phone with a subsidy.$199. Almost too good to pass up if you could afford it.It created a dynamic that would turn the iPhone into the world\u2019s most profitable product \u2014 a luxury device at a mainstream price.The iPhone 4 changed that. The first iPhone with a camera on its front, it let you take good-looking pictures of yourself.The phenomenon became agonizing to parents, and irresistible to everyone else.Snapchat was released a year later, in 2011. So was iCloud, Apple\u2019s backup storage service.The collection of these technologies \u2014 selfie cameras, photo chatting, hackable online backups \u2014 would rock people\u2019s lives.And remember Anthony Weiner?She didn\u2019t sound like Rosie from \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d She was personable, and even tried to make jokes.She was Siri, the first robotic assistant that most of us encountered.But she quickly disappointed. She didn\u2019t seem very smart. She wasn\u2019t very useful. She was slow and unreliable. She misheard you.In time, she was eclipsed. Now there\u2019s Alexa and Google Now. Siri has felt stuck in the past.The iPhone 5 carried a bigger screen stuffed into a brushed aluminum enclosure. There was often no purer joy than simply holding it in your hand.Design-wise, the iPhone has gone downhill ever since.But the iPhone 5 wasn\u2019t just about design. It\u2019s when the iPhone grew up.And the iPhone got fast. Really fast. Carriers began handling more and more data. Everyone underestimated how all this would change the world.Then we started to see it: Our social media feeds, which have become the main way we encountered news, filled up with photos, videos and live broadcasts snapped on phones.By the end of 2013, Apple had sold nearly 500 million iPhones. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the time that people were sending two billion messages a day on iPhones and other devices running its mobile operating system.A few years earlier, Samsung created a laughably huge phone, the Galaxy Note. It turned out to be a huge seller.So Apple did something radical, and obvious: It made bigger phones. They sold sold amazingly well, and Apple\u2019s stock shot up.But its decision to copy its rivals on size felt like a new turn in its history. It marked a stepping back from the vanguard.Apple\u2019s phones are still the best you can buy. They still pack some of the most innovative features on the market. But they\u2019re not all that much better. Which phone you buy now feels like a matter of personal taste, rather than a judgment on product quality alone.For the iPhone to continue to be the iPhone, the trend-setting device of a generation, Apple has to do something big.It does away with the Home button, it unlocks with facial recognition and it can animate your facial gestures onto piles of poo.But is it the next big thing? Check back in a decade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Belated Awakening", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChastened by criticism that Facebook had turned a blind eye to Russia\u2019s manipulation of the social network to interfere in the 2016 election, the company\u2019s executives now acknowledge a need to do better and have promised to be more transparent about who is paying for political ads. That\u2019s a good start, but more is required \u2014 of Facebook, of social media giants generally and of Congress.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s concern about democracy is commendable, and some of the changes he announced could have a positive impact. But they apply only to his company and can be easily evaded. Disclosing the name of Facebook business accounts placing political ads, for instance, will be of little value if purchasers can disguise their real identity \u2014 calling themselves, say, Americans for Motherhood and Apple Pie. Further, even if Facebook succeeds in driving away foreign propaganda, the same material could pop up on Twitter or other social media sites.More comprehensive safeguards will need intervention from Congress, which could begin by passing a law requiring online political ads \u2014 those that mention candidates seeking office or that advocate for certain political outcomes \u2014 to disclose who paid for them. Congress should also require internet companies to preserve the ads, and data about the groups the ads were targeted against, to help investigators looking into illicit activities. Two Democratic senators \u2014 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia \u2014 are planning to introduce a bill with some of these ideas.Of course, legislation cannot completely protect American elections from outside interference. It was already illegal for foreigners to purchase political ads when Russian agents started their Facebook campaign. Stronger enforcement of those rules would help, but that would require broader reforms, like replacing the Federal Election Commission, a toothless watchdog often paralyzed by partisan gridlock, with a new agency that has an odd number of members, including a nonpartisan election law expert.An educational effort by government, schools, civil society groups and the media to help people distinguish facts from fakery might help. Regrettably, President Trump has elevated \u201calternative facts\u201d to a high political art, and many members of his party and its talking-head cheerleaders seem perfectly happy to follow his lead. The willingness of social media to serve as a theater for obvious propaganda doesn\u2019t help advance the cause of truth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Apple Engineers Working on New Eyes for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Soroush Salehian raised both arms and spun in circles as if celebrating a touchdown.Across the room, perched on a tripod, a small black device monitored this little dance and streamed it to a nearby laptop. Mr. Salehian appeared as a collection of tiny colored dots, some red, some blue, some green. Each dot showed the precise distance to a particular point on his body, while the colors showed the speed of his movements. As his right arm spun forward, it turned blue. His left arm, spinning away, turned red.\u201cSee how the arms are different?\u201d said his business partner, Mina Rezk, pointing at the laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s measuring different velocities.\u201dMessrs. Salehian and Rezk are the founders of a new Silicon Valley start-up called Aeva, and their small black device is designed for self-driving cars. The veterans of Apple\u2019s secretive Special Projects Group aim to give these autonomous vehicles a more complete, detailed and reliable view of the world around them \u2014 something that is essential to their evolution.Today\u2019s driverless cars under development at companies like General Motors, Toyota, Uber and the Google spinoff Waymo track their surroundings using a wide variety of sensors, including cameras, radar, GPS antennas and lidar (short for \u201clight detection and ranging\u201d) devices that measure distances using pulses of light.But there are gaps in the way these sensors operate, and combining their disparate streams of data is difficult. Aeva\u2019s prototype \u2014 a breed of lidar that measures distances more accurately and also captures speed \u2014 aims to fill several of these sizable holes.\u201cI don\u2019t even think of this as a new kind of lidar,\u201d said Tarin Ziyaee, co-founder and chief technology officer at the self-driving taxi start-up Voyage, who has seen the Aeva prototype. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different animal.\u201dThe company\u2019s name, Aeva, is a play on \u201cEve,\u201d the name of the robot in the Pixar movie \u201cWALL-E.\u201dThe recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne. These sensors gave cars a way of measuring distances to nearby vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment \u2014 something GPS cannot always provide.But these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings. They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel. Their measurements aren\u2019t always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.Other devices can pick up some of slack. Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances. That\u2019s why today\u2019s self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors. But despite this wide array of hardware \u2014 which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle \u2014 even the best autonomous vehicles still have trouble in so many situations that humans can navigate with ease.Where current lidar sensors send out individual pulses, Aeva\u2019s device sends out a continuous wave of light. By reading the way this far more complex signal bounces off surrounding objects, Mr. Rezk said, the device can capture a far more detailed image while also tracking velocity. You can think of it as a cross between lidar, which is so good at measuring depth, and radar, which is so good at measuring speed.Mr. Rezk also said the device\u2019s continuous wave would provide greater range and resolution than existing lidar devices, deal better with weather and highly reflective objects like bridge railings, and avoid interference with other optical sensors.Cars will continue to use multiple kinds of sensors, in part because redundancy helps ensure that these cars are safe. But Aeva aims to give these cars a better view of the world from a smaller and less expensive set of sensors.Ultimately, new sensors will allow cars to make better decisions. \u201cWith autonomous cars, 90 percent of the time, you are trying to infer what is happening,\u201d Mr. Ziyaee said. \u201cBut what if you can just measure it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Google leaned on HTC to manufacture its first Pixel smartphone, which was released last year, and is working with the company to produce the next version of the phone, which is expected to be announced on Oct. 4.Bringing on the team from HTC is a sign that Google is doubling down on plans to produce its own hardware. Company executives have said it is important to tightly couple its artificial intelligence software, like the voice-controlled Google Assistant, with a range of devices.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of hardware, said in a blog post that the HTC deal was a continuation of \u201cour big bet on hardware.\u201d Google also offers a smart speaker, the Google Home, and the Chromecast streaming video device.The two sides did not disclose how many engineers and other key employees would head to Google as part of the deal. But Peter Shen, HTC\u2019s chief financial officer, said the remaining company would still have more than 2,000 research and design staffers, down from about 4,000.As part of the agreement, Google will also secure a nonexclusive licensing deal for some of HTC\u2019s intellectual property.HTC said it will continue to make its own smartphones \u2014 including a new premium model \u2014 although it plans to streamline its handset portfolio. By acquiring the HTC engineering group that had already been working with the company, Google secured hardware talent without taking on expensive assets, like manufacturing facilities.But Google, which makes the Android operating system for smartphones, retained many of Motorola\u2019s patents \u2014 an important asset to fend off potential intellectual property lawsuits from Apple.As the Android software world has become dominated by Samsung Electronics, Google has wanted more say in the manufacturing of the phones that use its operating system. Currently, most of Google\u2019s smartphone software runs on devices manufactured by companies like Samsung and LG Electronics, and Google has only a limited say in what those companies produce.With the introduction of the first Pixel smartphone last year, Google said it was creating the smartphone it had always intended to build. Google took control of the entire development process of the device, from the industrial design to the procurement of components. The Pixel received positive reviews, but it hasn\u2019t made much of a dent in the smartphone market.HTC was an early leader in smartphones. But it has struggled against more popular competitors while trying to fend off pressure from low-end Chinese manufacturers. Its decline is another indication of the challenges facing many smartphone manufacturers, who are struggling to make profits while competing against Apple and Samsung.Operating losses piled up at HTC in recent years, forcing it to slash research and marketing spending, exacerbating the challenge of keeping pace with the bigger companies. HTC said it will continue with its virtual-reality business centered around its Vive VR headsets.Google and HTC have a long history of working together. HTC sold the first smartphone to run Android software, in 2008, and it produced Google\u2019s first-generation Nexus smartphone \u2014 the predecessor to the Pixel.The transaction is scheduled to close, pending regulatory approval, in early 2018.Carolyn Zhang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Apple Keynote, Selling Us a Better Vision of Ourselves", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookTalking about the new iPhone\u2019s augmented-reality features at Apple\u2019s announcement event Tuesday, Philip W. Schiller, the senior vice president for worldwide marketing, showed how an app could overlay an image of the constellations on a live camera picture of the sky. This got him excited. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some generic sky!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the sky around you!\u201dI don\u2019t know. It looked like a generic sky to me: clouds, blue, sunlight.I looked up through the skylight over my desk. Yep. That iPhone sky looked way better than the garbage regular sky that I could see through my garbage human eyes.This enhancement of reality is what each video-streamed Apple event sells, more than any particular iPhone or set-top box. If advertising once told us that \u201cThings go better with Coke,\u201d this event \u2014 a jewel box for Apple\u2019s products and the people who use them \u2014 says that \u201cThings look better with Apple.\u201dThis year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. It\u2019s also the 10th anniversary of the Apple keynote at which Steve Jobs announced the original device. The first one was a tour de force, Mr. Jobs leading a rapt audience as he asked them to imagine an iPod, a phone and a pocket internet device all in one.These online-streaming keynotes have become as important a production of Apple as the devices themselves. An Apple event is a distinct kind of TV special: an extended commercial \u2014 this one ran nearly two hours \u2014 that people watch willingly, to get a glimpse of the new products and an art-directed idea of their better selves.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.On the massive screen, attractive young people ran with a billowing red sheet across a golden desert. Caped figures soared through clouds like angels in a gorgeous video game preview. A promo video for the Apple Watch as a fitness tool was so heartwarming and inspirational I think the Apple Watch may be running for president.Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for retail, said new Apple stores would be rebranded Town Squares, places for community gathering, education \u2014 and buying the occasional thousand-dollar phone. (\u201cApple retail,\u201d Mr. Cook said, \u201chas always been about more than selling. It\u2019s about learning, inspiring and connecting with people.\u201d)You will do such fantastic things with this technology, the presentation said. You\u2019ll get healthy! You\u2019ll learn! You\u2019ll play ennobling games!Though Mr. Jobs is gone, his minimalist aesthetic lives on in Cupertino, in the products and on the stage. Everything was set off against a black screen, like diamond necklaces in a velvet case. The show opened with footage of the sun rising (or setting? Surely it was rising) over the curvilinear new Steve Jobs Theater, where the event took place.Mr. Cook is an amiable presenter, but he doesn\u2019t pretend to have Mr. Jobs\u2019s magnetism. Wearing a zippered fleece \u2014 rich-guy casualwear as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s aesthete\u2019s turtlenecks \u2014 he passed the spotlight around to associates. Among them was the designer Jonathan Ive, speaking from a white room in tandem with an animated monkey emoji.I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m immune to this allure. I watched the Apple keynote on my Apple iMac after getting a reminder on my Apple iPad and being unable to start a stream through the Apple events app on my Apple TV. A 1989 Mac Plus that I can\u2019t bear to part with still sits in my basement. I will almost certainly buy one of the new phones.What will I do with it? What does anyone? I will Instagram photos of my cooking that I think look more appetizing than they are. I will see another tweet from the president. I will Google song lyrics. I will read Facebook posts and get mad on the internet.And another year from now, I\u2019ll set another reminder to watch another Apple event, believing somewhere deep down that with one more upgrade, I might be perfected.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the Apple presentation Steve Jobs gave 10 years ago. He introduced the iPhone; it was not his first Apple keynote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ellen Pao: Has Anything Really Changed for Women in Tech?", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSan Francisco \u2014 Just five years ago, I sued Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm in Silicon Valley where I had worked since 2005, for bias and gender discrimination. The lawsuit, which I lost, led to the venture capital world closing ranks against me. I had trouble finding work. People were afraid to support me publicly. I was called a fraud, and greedy, and was accused of being in a fake marriage.Now, over the past year, at least a dozen women have publicly shared their stories of being discriminated against and harassed in tech by their managers, by investors or by board members. Privately, I have heard dozens more.What I also hear, over and over again, is the question, \u201cHas anything changed?\u201dBefore her post, others who spoke up publicly and privately about their experiences of harassment were at best ignored. Some of those people \u2014 whose names are unfortunately not well known \u2014 include Adria Richards, Am\u00e9lie Lamont, Gesche Haas, Julie Ann Horvath, Kathryn Minshew and Kelly Ellis. Most were disrespected and harassed online, and many found it hard, as I did, to find work after public shaming. We saw Gamergate attack female game developers and their supporters. But they all paved the way for Ms. Fowler to be heard and believed, and for subsequent stories about sexist tech culture to be accepted at face value.We\u2019re hearing about companies writing codes of conduct covering anti-harassment that they want their investors and board members to sign.On its face, it all sounds like meaningful change, right? Or at least it sounds a lot better than the very recent public shaming of women who came forward and the sweeping of bad behavior under the rug. But let\u2019s not be blinded by optimism or biased by what we want to see: Certain actions, and lack of action, could keep us in this unfair loop indefinitely. Public apologies and one-off actions are superficial ways to react to criticism or put on a happy face, but they often cover up company culture failures that are hard to fix, especially if no one is seriously trying.Many continue to describe Uber and the outed venture capitalists as a few bad apples, not indicative of the entire industry \u2014 forgetting that the whole saying is actually \u201cOne bad apple spoils the bunch.\u201d Their behavior is part of much broader and deeper culture problems that permeate all tech \u2014 which ignored, encouraged and sometimes rewarded bad behavior \u2014 at different levels. We see companies changing C.E.O.s, but the reasons are shrouded, and they install new leaders with similar backgrounds.I have heard from several women who spoke up in this newspaper and elsewhere this year that they continue to face harassment. They have been told that discussing their experiences has limited their careers.And most companies don\u2019t address the great underlying problems: the exclusion of and biases against people of color, older employees, disabled people, L.G.B.T.Q. people and many other underrepresented groups.They continue to pay only lip service to diversity and inclusion, favoring tepid diversity initiatives over real solutions. It\u2019s all superficial until we see leaders actually changing company cultures by making hard decisions, leading uncomfortable conversations \u2014 and firing those who are unwilling to include everyone.So how do we clear biases and power imbalances in tech so that everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed?We need C.E.O.s to hold themselves and their teams accountable for true diversity and inclusion. That means all people from all groups, not just women. That means understanding intersectionality \u2014 that employees can face multiple biases based on identity. That means all activities across the company, not just hiring.Practically, it means measuring progress, holding people accountable for results by setting goals and basing their compensation on hitting those goals.C.E.O.s lead the transformation from the top, and they need individual employees to focus efforts on change as well: Speak up, help others speak up, build bridges to those who are interested in changing and learning. I know that there is a real cost to speaking up. I have also seen that every voice can make a difference. Five years from now, if enough people speak up for others, the answer to \u201cHas anything changed?\u201d has the potential to be an unequivocal yes.Advertisement"}
