{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Retailers (Not Named Amazon) Continue to Struggle", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re a retailer and you\u2019re not Amazon or Walmart, life can be very hard. The bankruptcy filing by Toys \u201cR\u201d Us on Monday is just the latest example.The Main Points\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us faced a $400 million debt payment next year.\u2022 JPMorgan Chase and others will lend $3 billion to help the company keep operating and paying employees.\u201cAs part of the restructuring process, Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us plans to close some underperforming stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Its remaining locations would be reconfigured to be more experience-based, incorporating amenities such as in-store play areas, they added.\u201dThe Losers\u2022 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust, who took Toys \u201cR\u201d Us private in 2005 for more than $6 billion, have written down the value of their stakes in the company.The Context \u201cToys \u201cR\u201d Us joins a wave of retail bankruptcies this year, including the children\u2019s clothing retailer Gymboree, Payless ShoeSource and rue21, which sells clothing for teenagers. Other retailers have closed thousands of stores and laid off tens of thousands of workers as they try to cut costs and compete with e-commerce.\u201dFewer chief executives want to go public these days. Who wants to deal with the hassle of the initial public offering process and with pesky short-term investors?\u201cIt seems like a way of living in hell without dying.\u201dBonus TriviaMr. Palihapitiya asserted to Andrew that Facebook \u2014 which tried to stay private for as long as possible \u2014 had another reason for its move:\u201cWe at Facebook basically flipped the narrative, and we did it on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cOur whole thing was \u2018Let\u2019s stay private longer.\u2019 And the reason we did that was we were pretty sure it would trick a lot of other people into not trying to go public or take advantage of the capital markets.\u201dHe said Facebook had hoped that \u201call those companies would eventually die because they were not that good and we would suck up all of their talent.\u201d\u2022 The United States attorney in Atlanta, John A. Horn, is working with the F.B.I. to investigate the cyberattack.\u2022 Another focal point: \u201cIn the days after the breach was discovered \u2014 but before it was publicly disclosed \u2014 three Equifax executives, including its chief financial officer, John W. Gamble Jr., sold $1.8 million in company shares.\u201d\u2022 Also conducting their own inquiries are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and at least 34 state attorneys general.\u201cAlthough investigators are still grappling with who might be behind the Equifax break-in, the scale of the breach, sophistication of the hack and nature of the stolen data all point toward a state-sponsored actor, says a person familiar with the investigation.\u201dIt\u2019s a figure of speech. Unless you\u2019re in Geneva, where people are apparently so flush that they toss cash into the toilet.A spokesman for the Geneva Prosecutor\u2019s Office, saying what\u2019s on all of our minds: \u201cThere must be something behind this story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dear Amazon: Please Build Here", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersThey both have all the things Seattle has except mild winters and a cool reputation. If you want pleasant weather, then Atlanta or Raleigh, N.C. But if you want a classic city where you can stretch out, Pittsburgh and Cleveland offer it all.STEVE BARSBY, CARY, N.C.JILL HANO, SOMERS, N.Y.I am a longtime Seattle resident, and my advice to cities vying for Amazon is to be careful what you wish for. The average tenure at Amazon is about one year. The result: an influx of transient, well-paid workers that has turned Seattle into a city of horrendous traffic and outrageously expensive housing that has lost its quirky, middle-class character. Thanks to Amazon\u2019s rampant development without accompanying transportation infrastructure, it is an ordeal to cross town at any hour of the day. The city is now unaffordable for young families, and the flight to the suburbs is accelerating. Cities should consider exactly who will benefit from those high-paying jobs at Amazon.Having lived here for nearly 14 years as a nonnative, I can really appreciate the many ways this city outshines its competitors.SUSAN BERLIN, ATLANTABaltimore, in short, occupies the sweet spot at the intersection of need, ability and regenerative possibility. There is no better place to invest in our nation\u2019s future.The writer is research and policy analyst for Centro San Antonio, the city\u2019s nonprofit downtown partnership.We will give you no tax breaks, no free public land and no environmentally harmful zoning favors, all of which would, in the long run, reduce the quality of life in the city you would call home. We will be business-friendly, not by disrupting the workings of the private market, in which you have been so successful, but by investing our resources in infrastructure, education and other public services that will make Boston an ever better place for you, and others, to work, to live and to enjoy.Amazon thinks ahead. So does Boston.Amazon can go to Dallas, Austin or Denver and slip right into an already strong economy and make little difference to the community. In St. Louis, Amazon would turn this city around. St. Louis needs Amazon; please come here!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Graham Norton\u2019s World of Wonder", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEncountersMr. Norton, 54, first visited the store about 15 years ago, when he had just bought a two-bedroom mews house in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan. \u201cI was doing my talk show five nights a week, and all this money was rolling in,\u201d he said. \u201cI went a little crazy and bought this house that I neither need nor use a lot. But I love New York.\u201dSoon after he bought the house, a friend brought him to this temple of luxurious bohemia to buy some sheets. \u201cWe walked in and it was just love at first sight,\u201d he said. \u201cThis place is just amazing.\u201dWe quickly headed up to the fifth floor, billed as \u201cclassic & timeless,\u201d and wandered around a grouping of eclectic furnishings: some new, some old (and occasionally tattered) and all carrying hefty price tags. \u201cThat\u2019s rather nice,\u201d he said as he paused to look closer at a vintage love seat with pale flowered fabric faded by time and worn away in one spot, and its matching sofa.The love seat was $2,250, the sofa, $4,400. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Mr. Norton said, walking away.But as we got closer, he fingered the fabric and said dismissively, \u201cOh, that would wear really badly.\u201d A striking chair in a delicate deep blue fabric was also rejected for practical reasons: \u201cI have dogs, so that\u2019s not happening.\u201dAnother shopper stood and stared. \u201cDidn\u2019t I just see you on TV two hours ago?\u201d he said as Mr. Norton passed.\u201cYes, yes, that was me \u2014 thank you,\u201d Mr. Norton replied briskly before checking the price tag of a low-slung mauve couch. \u201cThat is an interesting color, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWhile we moved on, Mr. Norton turned to me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so funny. When I walked into the \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 building this morning, there were all these people there checking my ID and asking who I was and why was I there. Then after I had been on the show, and I came back out, they all asked me to take a selfie with them. They still didn\u2019t know who I was, but they had seen me being interviewed and they knew I was famous, and that was enough.\u201dMr. Norton, who has drawn high ratings for almost 20 years, is the author of two best-selling memoirs, but this is his first novel.Why a murder mystery?\u201cIt\u2019s a recognizable structure,\u201d he said over lunch (a fried-fish sandwich and a glass of chardonnay) at ABC Cocina, where we went after he had bought a Frette duvet cover to replace the one he had bought 15 years earlier.\u201cYou find a body. Then you find a second body. And then you go from there. And there is a reason to keep you reading. Even if it\u2019s an awful book, you still keeping reading it to find out what happened.\u201d (\u201cHolding\u201d is not an awful book. It is actually quite a good read, and received largely enthusiastic reviews when first published in Britain. It is also being made into a TV movie.)The main character, P. J. Collins, a bumbling local sergeant with a serious weight problem, is an unlikely hero and an even more unlikely love interest. (Two of the other characters in the novel, both murder suspects, pursue a relationship with him.)Sergeant Collins\u2019s anguish over his bulk, and his constant rebukes to himself about how much he eats, feel awfully close to the bone, as it were. Was Mr. Norton fat as a child? \u201cMentally, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone has a very dysfunctional relationship with food.\u201dBut he said he was determined that P. J. not lose weight, as part of a happy ending: \"That was not going to be his story.\u201dHe added, \u201cI have a very overweight friend, and she read the book. And I know she read it, because she texted me, 'Have your book. Reading it!' And she has never mentioned it again. And I have never mentioned it again. And I wonder if that\u2019s the reason \u2014 because I\u2019m describing a world that she knows very well and that she assumes I do not. But who knows? Maybe she just hated the book.\u201dThe genesis of the plot came from a story his mother told him about an abandoned house in the Irish town of his youth, and the three unmarried sisters who lived there. \u201cTo be honest, to do that story justice, the book would have had to have been an almost \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 kind of thing,\u201d Mr. Norton said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have the skill set to do that. So I decided to kill someone and turn it into a murder mystery.\u201dThat was not Mr. Norton\u2019s most famous brush with the tabloid press, however. A few years ago, an ex-boyfriend gave an interview to a British newspaper in which he said that the two broke up because Mr. Norton \u201ccould drink up to four bottles of wine in an evening\u201d and seemed to care more about his two dogs than him.\u201cThat\u2019s probably the only real kiss-and-tell I\u2019ve been involved in; it was something, to feel really betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s good, of course, is that it makes you feel a lot better about the breakup. And the odd thing was, in Britain, it was almost like I planted that story, because of the amazing amount of good press I got from it. \u2018Yeah, I like to drink and I like dogs.\u2019 Those happen to be two very important things to the British people.\u201dMr. Norton is now single and lives in an apartment in the Wapping neighborhood of London with Bailey, a Labradoodle and Madge, a terrier. (\u201cThe shelter named her Madonna, but I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t have a dog named Madonna,\u2019 and so I changed it to Madge.\u201d)He seems content with that arrangement. \u201cThe reality is that, as you get older, the more fussy you become,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the older you get, the less right you have to be fussy.\u201d Or as he told one interviewer: \u201cI would prefer to live alone than with towels that are folded incorrectly.\u201dHaving caught the fiction bug, he is now working on his second novel \u2014 \u201ca mystery, but not a murder mystery.\u201dBut as our earlier stroll through the store suggested, maybe being an author isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. For there, in the middle of the fourth-floor showroom, was a towering stack of used books, perhaps 300 in all, repurposed into a piece of decorative sculpture for someone with a high-ceilinged living room.\u201cThat\u2019s a lesson for any author,\u201d Mr. Norton said. \u201cYou put all that effort into what you think is your life\u2019s work, and it ends up as part of a decorative pillar in a furniture shop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
