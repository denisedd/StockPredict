{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Courts Brand-Name Teachers, Raising Ethics Issues", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedMAPLETON, N.D. \u2014 One of the tech-savviest teachers in the United States teaches third grade here at Mapleton Elementary, a public school with about 100 students in the sparsely populated plains west of Fargo.\u201cI will embed it in my brand every day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said of Seesaw. \u201cI get to make it better.\u201dTheir ranks are growing as public schools increasingly adopt all manner of laptops, tablets, math teaching sites, quiz apps and parent-teacher messaging apps. The corporate courtship of these teachers brings with it profound new conflict-of-interest issues for the nation\u2019s public schools.Moreover, there is little rigorous research showing whether or not the new technologies significantly improve student outcomes.Teachers said that more established start-ups gave them pricier perks like travel expenses to industry-sponsored conferences attended by thousands of teachers. In exchange, teacher ambassadors often promote company products on social media or in their conference talks \u2014 sometimes without explicitly disclosing their relationships with their sponsors.Many public schools are facing tight budgets, and administrators, including the principal at Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, said they welcomed potentially valuable free technology and product training. Even so, some education experts warned that company incentives might influence teachers to adopt promoted digital tools over rival products or even traditional approaches, like textbooks.\u201cTeachers can\u2019t help but be seduced to make greater use of the technology, given these efforts by tech companies,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.Public-school teachers who accept perks, meals or anything of value in exchange for using a company\u2019s products in their classrooms could also run afoul of school district ethics policies or state laws regulating government employees.Ms. Delzer and other educators forcefully argue that they\u2019re motivated by altruism, and not company-bestowed status or gifts. \u201cI am in this profession for kids,\u201d Ms. Delzer said, \u201cnot for notoriety or the money.\u201dAnother important draw for teachers, who already often feel underappreciated: Having tech companies, the icons of American society, seek their views provides welcome attention. \u201cTeachers have really responded well to feeling like they are being listened to,\u201d said Carl Sjogreen, a co-founder of Seesaw.The benefits to companies are substantial. Many start-ups enlist their ambassadors as product testers and de facto customer service representatives who can field other teachers\u2019 queries.Microsoft and Apple said they worked with schools to make sure any conference travel expenses they covered for teachers complied with district ethics rules. Google said it provided meals but not teachers\u2019 travel expenses.An Amazon representative, responding to a question about the gift cards that TenMarks offered to certain teachers last year, said that the company had not given that incentive recently and that it had procedures \u201cto ensure our compliance with applicable laws and to help facilitate teachers\u2019 obligations to their schools.\u201dSo far, no teacher has asked for the payment, said Melissa Davis, GoEnnounce\u2019s chief executive. Still, she said, teacher referrals accounted for 20 percent of GoEnnounce\u2019s first-year sales.\u201cThese champions are really essential in giving us a really powerful foot in the door to meet with districts and schools,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Unlike industry influence in medicine, however, the phenomenon of company-affiliated teachers has received little scrutiny. Twitter alone is rife with educators broadcasting their company-bestowed titles.\u201cIf medical experts started saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Google Certified Doctor\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Pfizer Distinguished Nurse,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm.This is true for celebrities and teachers alike. And it applies equally to conferences, YouTube videos, personal blogs or Twitter posts.Some teachers and start-ups said they were not aware of those guidelines.\u201cIf you are receiving any sort of incentive to promote the company\u2019s product, that is what we call a material relationship,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, associate director of the trade commission\u2019s division of advertising practices, \u201cand that has to be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the endorsement message.\u201dFor some teachers, corporate relationships can be steppingstones to lucrative speaking or training engagements. Schools often hire company-connected educators to give training sessions to their teachers. And technology conferences for teachers often book influential teachers as speakers.Ms. Delzer said her fees for such events started at several thousand dollars a day. Some veteran education influencers charge much more.To do it all, Ms. Delzer negotiated a special contract with her district, allowing her to take 10 unpaid days off a year. She uses those days off to give speeches and run teacher workshops for other schools.\u201cIt\u2019s like two full-time jobs,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.Just before 8:30 a.m. on school days, Ms. Delzer, 32, stations herself at the classroom door. She greets each of her third graders by name, ushering them in one by one with a brief shoulder squeeze. \u201cI want them to feel love when they walk in,\u201d she said.If her classroom looks less like a traditional schoolroom and more like a den \u2014 with a colorful rug and inspirational signs exhorting children to \u201cDREAM\u201d and \u201cLAUGH\u201d \u2014 that is no accident. A few years ago, Ms. Delzer decided to remodel her classroom to foster the kind of independent work habits she thought her students would need in life.So she ditched the standard-issue desks and rearranged the room to look more like the place where she goes to work on her conference talks: her local Starbucks. Today, her third graders sit wherever they please \u2014 on cushions, rocking chairs, balance balls.\u201cIf I\u2019m just feeling like relaxing, I usually sit on the rockers or the ball chairs or the beanbag chairs,\u201d Jennings, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class last spring, explained. \u201cBut if I want to be really, really focused, then I usually feel like going on something a little harder so that I don\u2019t lose concentration.\u201dSitting in her local Starbucks in West Fargo, Ms. Delzer noted: \u201cIf you Google \u2018Starbucks Classroom,\u2019 it\u2019s a thing now.\u201dBut Ms. Delzer said she did not start out seeking to influence the practice of teaching. It was serendipity, she said, and an iPad experiment.In 2011, Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, in Thief River Falls, Minn., bought a few iPads and asked her to try using them in class. Two years later, her school\u2019s technology director suggested that they speak at an education conference about her experiment.That was when Ms. Delzer realized, she said, that by addressing her peers, she could reach vastly more students.\u201cI see the ripple effect on teachers who leave the conference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to know that those classrooms are better because of it.\u201dToday, so many teachers from other districts want to visit her classroom that Mapleton Elementary has set aside every Tuesday to host them. \u201cWe limit it to four teachers a day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.One morning last spring, Ms. Delzer assigned her third graders a math problem to solve on their iPads using Seesaw. Developed by two former Facebook product managers, Seesaw lets students produce and share their schoolwork as written notes, diagrams, audio recordings or videos.Some children love the sharing aspect. \u201cThey can see what you are doing now that we have Seesaw,\u201d McCoy, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class, said of his parents. \u201cOther years they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were only able to see on your papers.\u201dTeaching, by nature, is a helping profession. And educators have a long tradition of sharing ideas with colleagues.Ms. Delzer said she did not see a conflict between her teaching and other activities. She said she deliberately divided her work, devoting herself to her students during school hours while giving conference talks on days off and working with companies on some school nights.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep the two things separate,\u201d she said.She added that she worked only with companies whose products she personally believed in. Those relationships, she said, gave her valuable access to resources that could benefit her students, colleagues and teacher followers.\u201cIf I am going to put my name on it, it either has to make learning better for students or teaching better for teachers,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.But companies that tap public-school teachers to use or promote their products in exchange for perks are effectively engaging the educators as consultants \u2014 a situation that could conflict with teachers\u2019 obligations to their employer: schools.\u201cVendors offering free technology to teachers for their personal or professional use in exchange for teachers promoting it to students or other teachers is a very questionable activity,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Tim Jacobson, the principal of Mapleton Elementary School, where Ms. Delzer teaches, offered a different view. He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201dMr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201dOne evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.He had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.Now, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.Mr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.This teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.If the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.But there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.Mr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.He left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.Among other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.And Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Linda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.The Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.Last year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.Kittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.It was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.An hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.After dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.Ms. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.If her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.Every fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201dLest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lego Will Cut 1,400 Jobs as Profit Dips, Despite Big-Screen Heroics", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "Supported byTo hold children\u2019s attention, Lego has enlisted the help of Batman, Darth Vader and Harry Potter. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be enough.The toy company said on Tuesday that it would cut 1,400 jobs after earnings showed its revenue and profit both fell in the first half of the year. The results come as Lego faces an increasingly competitive landscape. More children use mobile devices for entertainment, leaving Lego to battle not just its traditional rivals like Mattel and Hasbro, but technology companies like Sony and Microsoft, the owner of \u201cMinecraft,\u201d and video game giants like Nintendo and Activision Blizzard.With its little plastic bricks \u2014 building blocks in children\u2019s hands but a bane of parents\u2019 feet \u2014 the company, based in Billund, Denmark, has grown into a global empire. But its struggles mirror the challenges facing toymakers that are seeking new revenue streams as growth slows in traditionally lucrative markets. Mattel, the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, went as far as to poach a Google executive to be its C.E.O. in a bid to reshape itself.Lego on Tuesday reported a 3 percent decline in net profit for the first six months of the year compared with the same period in 2016, falling to 3.4 billion Danish krone, or about $544 million, from 3.5 billion Danish krone. Revenue fell 5 percent to 14.9 billion Danish krone, from 15.7 billion Danish krone.In an interview, the chairman of Lego, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, said it would take about two years for the business to return to growth, and he said that the job cuts, which equate to around 8 percent of the company\u2019s total work force, were necessary because Lego had become an unwieldy operation.\u201cA bit of bureaucracy has sneaked into what was quite an entrepreneurial organization,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has crept in on us and we want to root it out.\u201dLego had pulled itself out of a slump more than 10 years ago with an overhaul of the company. Since then, it has been growing apace, but its popularity has long been built off its classic collections, like the Lego City, Duplo and Technic lines.As the company has faced increased competition from other construction toy makers like Mega Brands, as well as a wider array of entertainment available for children, it has sought to sign licensing deals and other agreements to attract new forms of revenue.And when children do go shopping for toys, Lego often misses out on impulse buys, said Lutz Muller, an analyst focused on toys at Klosters Trading Corporation. \u201cThe buyers have a fixed amount of shelf space,\u201d Mr. Muller said. \u201cThey say to Lego, \u2018You already have all this shelf space in the construction aisle, we can\u2019t give you more shelf space in the action figure aisle.\u2019 \u201dLego\u2019s more established markets were expected to run out of steam eventually, said Matthew Hudak, senior toys and games analyst at Euromonitor International, a market researcher. And Lego will still have to grapple with mobile devices becoming a much bigger competitor for the attention of a demographic that can be fickle in its tastes, he said.The key will be to make sure that whatever children are doing on their mobile devices has some link to the toys being sold by Lego. \u201cAt the end of the day, they still have to try and keep themselves within the popular licenses,\u201d Mr. Hudak said. \u201cAll companies are competing with smartphones. So it\u2019s about partnering with the right ones.\u201dLego has also tried to lean heavily on faster growth in China, expanding its office in Shanghai to 200 employees this year, up from 80 in 2014.\u201cIn a market like China, where there\u2019s an emerging middle class that\u2019s becoming urbanized, moving into cities, it presents a growth opportunity,\u201d Mr. Knudstorp said.That has come as toy sales in Europe have fallen off \u2014 from $45 billion in 2014 to $40.5 billion last year \u2014 while sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew to $65 billion in that same period, from $57 billion, according to Euromonitor.The company has done well marketing its products as educational tools, said Mr. Hudak, and tapping into the aspirations that middle-class parents in China have for their children. Lego sells a range of learning products, including its latest robotics kit, Lego Boost, which is intended to teach coding to children ages 7 to 12. \u201cParents are starting to afford this more and they\u2019re using toys as more developmental tools,\u201d Mr. Hudak said.Advertisement"}

They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. \u201cThey are demonstrating \u2014 \u2018Save our children,\u2019 \u2018No attacks from immigrants on our children\u2019 and some things like that,\u201d Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently.The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office\u2019s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin\u2019s tight-knit Russian-German community.Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three \u201cSouthern-looking men\u201d \u2014 by which she meant Arab migrants \u2014 had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her.But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened.An official in the Merkel government told me that the administration was completely perplexed, at first. Then, a few days later, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, held a news conference in Moscow. Bringing up Lisa\u2019s story, he cast doubt on the official version of events. There was no way, he argued, that Lisa left home voluntarily. Germany, he suggested, was \u201ccovering up reality in a politically correct manner for the sake of domestic politics.\u201d Two days later, RT ran a segment reporting that despite all the official denials, the case was \u201cnot so simple.\u201d The Russian Embassy called Steltner and asked to meet, he told me. The German foreign ministry informed him that this was now a diplomatic issue.The whole affair suddenly appeared a lot less mystifying. A realization took hold in the foreign ministry, the intelligence services and the Chancellery: Germany had been hit.The intelligence assessment detailed some cloak-and-dagger activities, like the murky web of Russian (if not directly government-affiliated or -financed) hackers who infiltrated voting systems and stole gigabytes\u2019 worth of email and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But most of the assessment concerned machinations that were plainly visible to anyone with a cable subscription or an internet connection: the coordinated activities of the TV and online-media properties and social-media accounts that made up, in the report\u2019s words, \u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine.\u201dThis makes RT and Sputnik harder for the West to combat than shadowy hackers. You can tighten your internet security protocols to protect against data breaches, run counterhacking operations to take out infiltrators, sanction countries with proven links to such activities. But RT and Sputnik operate on the stated terms of Western liberal democracy; they count themselves as news organizations, protected by the First Amendment and the libertarian ethos of the internet.But the ratings are almost beside the point. RT might not have amassed an audience that remotely rivals CNN\u2019s in conventional terms, but in the new, \u201cdemocratized\u201d media landscape, it doesn\u2019t need to. Over the past several years, the network has come to form the hub of a new kind of state media operation: one that travels through the same diffuse online channels, chasing the same viral hits and memes, as the rest of the Twitter-and-Facebook-age media. In the process, Russia has built the most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far, one that thrives in the feverish political climates that have descended on many Western publics.Something like the dissemination of Ford\u2019s conveyor belt, he said, was now happening in media; the sort of global news networks the West built were being replicated by Russia, to great effect. What was making \u201cthe whole story successful,\u201d he said, \u201cis a tectonic change of the global system that all of a sudden started to develop 10 years ago.\u201dThe transformation and acceleration of information technology, Peskov said, had unmoored the global economy from real value. Perception alone could move markets or crash them. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen bubbles like we\u2019ve seen in the greatest economy in the world, the United States,\u201d he said. The same free flow of information had produced \u201ca new clash of interests,\u201d and so began \u201can informational disaster \u2014 an informational war.\u201dPeskov argued that this was not an information war of Russia\u2019s choosing; it was a \u201ccounteraction.\u201d He brought up the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which led to the ousters of Russian-friendly governments in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in the mid-2000s. Russia blamed American nongovernmental organizations for fomenting the upheavals. But now, Peskov argued, all you might need to shake up the geopolitical order was a Twitter account. \u201cNow you can reach hundreds of millions in a minute,\u201d he said.By way of example, he pointed to \u201cthis girl, from show business, Kim Kardashian.\u201d Kardashian is among the most popular people in all of social media, with 55 million Twitter followers, nearly 18 million more than President Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine that one day she says, \u2018My supporters \u2014 do this,\u2019\u2009\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThis will be a signal that will be accepted by millions and millions of people. And she\u2019s got no intelligence, no interior ministry, no defense ministry, no K.G.B.\u201d This, he said, was the new reality: the global proliferation of the kinds of reach and influence that were once reserved for the great powers and, more recently, great media conglomerates. Even Peskov sounded slightly amazed considering the possibilities. \u201cThe new reality creates a perfect opportunity for mass disturbances,\u201d he said, \u201cor for initiating mass support or mass disapproval.\u201dOne way of looking at the activities of Russia\u2019s information machine is as a resumption of the propaganda fight between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that began immediately following the Second World War. In the late 1940s, the Marshall Plan, the herculean development project helmed by Secretary of State George Marshall, flooded postwar Europe with money and advisers to help rebuild cities, advance democracy and form an integrated economic zone. Joseph Stalin immediately saw it as a threat \u2014 and saw propaganda as one of his best weapons to contain it.For the counterinformation campaign, the U.S. government enlisted journalists, including the Washington Post Pulitzer winner Alfred Friendly and the Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Roscoe Drummond; Hollywood filmmakers; and the top marketers of Madison Avenue, including McCann-Erickson and Young and Rubicam. The new effort \u2014 which eventually fell under a new United States Information Agency \u2014 produced upbeat posters with slogans like \u201cWhatever the weather, we only reach welfare together,\u201d which offered a bright contrast to the Communists\u2019 anti-Marshall Plan messaging. Operating on the theory that local voices would have more credibility than American ones, it fed news to foreign reporters about how well the Marshall Plan was progressing in their countries and recruited top European directors to produce hundreds of news features and documentaries that promoted \u201cWestern values\u201d like free trade and representative democracy.America went into the propaganda war with distinct advantages. At the time, the Marshall Plan was pumping $13 billion into Europe, while the Soviets were taking $14 billion out in the form of reparations and resource seizures; America\u2019s image abroad was as squeaky clean as it would ever be. \u201cThis was the time when finally the United States came of age as an international power \u2014 when it still had its virginity, as it were,\u201d David Reynolds, a Cambridge University history professor, told me.And unlike the Soviets, the United States benefited from the existence of a vast ecosystem of nongovernment media that, even when it crossed swords with the American government, still reflected an American outlook and implicitly promoted American cultural values. The first international, 24-hour networks to come online in the 1980s, like CNN, were American, and they provided their audience \u2014 which eventually included many behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 an unsparing view of the last days of Communism: student protesters staring down tanks in Tiananmen Square, protests and strikes in Poland, East Germans exulting on the ruins of the Berlin Wall. When Mikhail Gorbachev signed his resignation, ceding power to the new presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the last official act of Soviet Communism, he invited CNN to capture the moment in his Kremlin office suite. Finding his own pen out of ink, Gorbachev turned to the CNN president at the time, Tom Johnson, who lent Gorbachev the Mont Blanc he had in his breast pocket. After making sure the pen wasn\u2019t American-made, the last Soviet leader used it to sign one of the most important documents in Russian history. \u201cYou have built your empire better than I built mine,\u201d he told Johnson.Lesin was a sharp-witted hard drinker who was concerned about Russia\u2019s image in the world. He had a vision for an international network that would familiarize Russia in the same way that CNN familiarized America. But the chaos of the later Yeltsin years, in which the ruble collapsed and Yeltsin\u2019s government foundered, made such a thing impossible.Lesin found a more receptive patron in Putin, who succeeded Yeltsin in 1999. Putin \u2014 who, as a deputy in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office half a decade earlier, once chauffeured Ted Turner around the city \u2014 was an attentive student of the power of television. At times, he could not contain his frustration with the way the foreign media covered Russia. \u201cAll they can talk about is crisis and breakdown,\u201d he complained to a nationalist youth group in 2005.That year, with the Russian economy rebounding thanks to strong oil prices, Lesin and Alexei Gromov, Putin\u2019s press strategist, secured the approval and financing to start the network, which they called Russia Today. To run the new operation, they hired a 25-year-old TV reporter named Margarita Simonyan.When she heard she got the job, \u201cI almost fainted,\u201d Simonyan told me recently. We were sitting on plush couches on an exclusive, dimly lit floor of Voronezh, a fashionable restaurant in the Khamovniki district in central Moscow. \u201cDr. No,\u201d the James Bond film about a plan to disrupt the American space program, was on a TV screen opposite us. Before us was a spread of venison, oysters and shrimp, themselves an unsubtle statement: They were imported from Russia\u2019s far east, a menu adjustment in response to the sanctions and countersanctions that had cut off Western food imports.Simonyan grew up poor in Krasnodar, a southern Russia river town, and was 11 when the Soviet Union collapsed. \u201cWe adored the fact that we are now going to be like America and taught like America and to be even patronized by America and be America\u2019s little brother,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel in any way humiliating or contradictory to the Russian pride.\u201d Her infatuation with the United States led her to apply for a slot in a new State Department \u201cfuture leaders\u201d exchange program, which placed top students from the former Soviet Union in United States high schools to \u201censure long-lasting peace and understanding between the U.S. and the countries of Eurasia.\u201dFor one academic year, she attended a public high school in Bristol, N.H. \u201cShe was fascinated with news,\u201d Patricia Albert, whose parents hosted Simonyan, and who remains close with her, told me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d as the family still calls her, would sit transfixed every night when she joined them on the couch to watch the local news, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cCBS Evening News With Dan Rather.\u201d But she also came to resent some of her American classmates for what she viewed as their sheltered na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you have dogs?\u2019 I remember that,\u201d she told me. \u201cI still have a letter I wrote to my parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they are seriously asking me whether we have dogs.\u2019 They were grown-ups \u2014 18-year-olds \u2014 in a normal high school in New Hampshire, which is supposed to be a sophisticated place.\u201dBack home in Krasnodar, her view of the United States, like many Russians\u2019, started to curdle after the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia, with which Russian had strong ethnic, cultural and political ties: \u201cOur Slavic brothers and sisters,\u201d she told me, leaning forward for emphasis. \u201cYou bombed them with no permission, with no reason,\u201d she said, \u201cand in one day you lost Russia.\u201dWhen she took the helm of Russia Today the following year, Simonyan modeled the new network on CNN and the BBC, and she hired TV consultants from Britain to help give Russia Today a modern cable-news look and feel. (The RT studios in Moscow, when I visited them this spring, were as state-of-the-art as any I\u2019d seen in the United States.) \u201cNobody in Russia had experience of that kind,\u201d Simonyan told me. \u201cTwenty-four-hour news had not been established yet.\u201d One of her employees, Andrey Kiyashko, who started at RT in his late teens, told me: \u201cCNN, BBC \u2014 we were watching it and taking notes on how to be broadcast journalists.\u201dRussia Today \u2014 incorporated as an independent company with state financing \u2014 was getting into hotels and even American cable systems. But three years into its existence, the network still had not gained much notice or had much discernible impact abroad. Simonyan says she concluded that the network\u2019s mission of solely focusing on Russia needed revising. \u201cWe had basically too much Russian news,\u201d she told me.So in 2008, Russia Today began to reposition itself. The network was reintroduced with a new name, RT, and hired McCann \u2014 the same American advertising firm that once helped the United States sell the Marshall Plan. It soon debuted a new satellite channel in the United States, RT America. Instead of celebrating Russia, Simonyan\u2019s network would turn a critical eye to the rest of the world, particularly the United States. As Peskov sees it, the idea was: \u201cWhy are you criticizing us in Chechnya and all this stuff? Look at what you are doing there in the United States with your relationship with white and black.\u201d He went on: \u201cRT said: \u2018Stop. Don\u2019t criticize us. We\u2019ll tell you about yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dWith that, he said, \u201call of the sudden, Anglo-Saxons saw that there is an army from the opposite side.\u201d RT\u2019s new slogan, dreamed up by McCann, was \u201cQuestion More.\u201dAt the time, state journalism back in Russia was enjoying a kind of renaissance under Dmitri Medvedev, who was elected president in 2008. (Russian presidents are limited to two consecutive terms; Putin endorsed Medvedev as his successor and served as his prime minister before returning to the presidency.) The main Russian international news service, RIA Novosti, hired journalists from The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse and Reuters, following the philosophy that Russia served its interests best by providing traditional warts-and-all news, with a Russian voice and perspective. \u201cThere was no talk about censorship,\u201d Nabi Abdullaev, a former Moscow Times deputy chief editor who oversaw RIA Novosti\u2019s foreign-language news service, told me. \u201cAll they wanted from me was quality professional standards in reporting; that was it.\u201d\u201cObjectivity is a myth,\u201d Kiselyov said. \u201cJust imagine a young man who puts an arm around the shoulder of a girl,\u201d he went on, \u201cand tells the girl, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time that I treat you objectively.\u2019 Is this what she\u2019s waiting for? Probably not. So in the same way, our country, Russia, needs our love. If we speak about the editorial policy, of course, I would certainly want it to be associated with love for Russia.\u201d Journalism, he said, was an instrument of the country.Military officials in America and Europe have come to refer to this idea alternatively as the \u201cGerasimov doctrine\u201d and \u201chybrid war,\u201d which they accuse Russia of engaging in now. When I asked Peskov about those charges, he shrugged. Everyone was doing it, he said. \u201cIf you call what\u2019s going on now a hybrid war, let it be hybrid war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter: It\u2019s war.\u201dShortly after the election, academic and corporate clients hired him to track the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 that is, unequivocally false content. He confined his search to social accounts that shared fake news at least 10 times during the last month of the campaign. This September, in his airy, loft-style office suite on the West Side of Manhattan, he called up the results of the study on a laptop screen. They were visualized as a black sphere on which each of the 14,000 fake-news-spreading accounts appeared as a dot, grouped and color-coded according to ideological affiliation. The sphere was alive with bursts of purple (\u201cU.S. Conservative\u201d), green (\u201cU.S. Far Left\u201d), pink (\u201cPro-Russia/WikiLeaks\u201d), orange (\u201cInternational Right\u201d) and blue (\u201cTrump Core\u201d).Within the fake-news network, Kelly explained, RT was high on the list of most-followed accounts, but it was not the highest \u2014 it ranked No. 117 out of roughly 12,000 accounts he was tracking. Its website was the 12th-most-cited by the fake-news consumers and purveyors \u2014 ahead of The New York Times and The Washington Post but behind Breitbart and Infowars.What was more interesting was who followed RT. It drew substantially from all quadrants of Kelly\u2019s fake-news universe \u2014 Trump supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters, Occupy Wall Streeters and libertarians \u2014 which made it something of a rarity. \u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t just pumping up the right wing in America,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re also pumping up left-wing stuff \u2014 they\u2019re basically trying to pump up the fringe at the expense of the middle.\u201dNearly 20 percent of the fake-news-spreading accounts, Kelly\u2019s analysis determined, were automated bot accounts, of the sort the American intelligence assessment claimed were working in tandem with RT and Sputnik. But who was operating them was unclear \u2014 and regardless, they were far outnumbered by accounts that appeared to belong to real human beings, reading and circulating content that appealed to them. In this paranoid, polarized and ill-informed subset of American news consumers, RT\u2019s audience crossed all ideological boundaries.RT flew in several members of its leadership team from Moscow for a ceremony and held a cocktail party in the lobby of the General Assembly building, with hot plates and canap\u00e9s of shrimp dumplings and meatballs and ham. Giant banners proclaimed \u201cRT: Member Broadcaster of the United Nations In-House Network.\u201dHis speech was about his mother, who grew up under Stalin. She was orphaned at 3, \u201cwhen she was thrown out of her apartment in the middle of Moscow winter together with her brother, when their parents were arrested by the N.K.V.D., the Stalin secret police,\u201d he said, speaking haltingly. \u201cMy grandfather, her father, as she only found out many years later, was tortured and executed. And my grandmother, her mother, died in a labor camp. And similar stories happened to millions of my compatriots back in the 1930s.\u201dHe was building toward something. \u201cWhat I see today is more and more frequently people produce the highfalutin talk about using the word \u2018propaganda\u2019 that eerily echoes those dark days of the Soviet era, when even thinking their own thoughts, not to mention speaking or printing them, was a crime.\u201d People, he declared, \u201cmust have the right to know different news, coming from different sources, and then make their own judgment.\u201dWhen I asked Simonyan recently what she made of the proliferating attempts to map RT\u2019s influence in the Russian information network that United States intelligence agencies describe as a hybrid-war machine, she replied by email: \u201cThese projects simply blacklist all reporting, including by American media, as some pro-Russian campaign if any facts or views in them don\u2019t support the right kind of narrative.\u201d At the moment, she said, that narrative was: \u201cAll world problems are Putin\u2019s fault.\u201d In her view, \u201cit\u2019s the sad history of McCarthyism repeating itself.\u201d (These were arguments that echoed Trump\u2019s own.)It also reflected the genius of \u201cQuestion More\u201d: Every attempt to contain or counteract the Russian state-backed media\u2019s influence simply validated it. Churkin, the ambassador, acknowledged as much at RT\u2019s U.N. ceremony. As he stood to speak, he seemed to be almost bouncing on the soles of his feet, delighted at RT\u2019s newfound prominence. \u201cEverybody watches them,\u201d he said. \u201cDiplomats do it, ambassadors do it, foreign ministers do it, heads of state and government do it.\u201d In an oblique allusion to the recent American intelligence report, he noted that some people had been criticizing the network, but perhaps this was not such a bad thing. Grinning, he said: \u201cThey sound as if they are P.R. representatives of RT.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nestl\u00e9 Targets High-End Coffee by Taking Majority Stake in Blue Bottle", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "The deal highlights the continued hot streak of artisanal coffee, whose rapid growth and fanatical customer base have continued to draw big business.Supported byIn 2002, James Freeman gave up on being a professional clarinetist and began pursuing his other passion, roasting coffee.Mr. Freeman started out in a 183-square-foot potting shed in Oakland, Calif., and named his newborn business Blue Bottle Coffee, after a storied Viennese coffee house. Fifteen years later, Blue Bottle has grown beyond a one-man coffee shop. It is now one of the best-known purveyors of artisanal coffee that, in Mr. Freeman\u2019s words, doesn\u2019t taste like \u201cflea shampoo.\u201dIt is one of the surest signs yet of how so-called third-wave specialty coffee \u2014 the kind that inspires almost monastic devotion to pour-over brews and perfectly steeped drinks \u2014 has become a hot business.The rapidly expanding niche accounts for 15 to 20 percent of coffee consumed in the United States, according to the Specialty Coffee Association. Perhaps more important than the sector\u2019s rapid growth is that it commands higher prices and generates bigger profit margins.Taking a majority stake in Blue Bottle will help Nestl\u00e9 expand an existing foothold built around the Nescaf\u00e9 and Nespresso line of products to a flourishing new industry with a highly dedicated consumer base (read: millennials).The investment is also meant to shore up the Swiss conglomerate\u2019s presence in North America, where it has struggled.For Blue Bottle, the deal not only brings in a major new backer with products that include KitKat chocolate bars and Stouffer\u2019s frozen pizzas. Having Nestl\u00e9 as a majority owner will also help Blue Bottle buttress its expansion plans, which run from opening new outlets across North America and Asia to selling roasted beans and New Orleans-style cold-brew drinks in stores.\u201cTheir commitment to us was, \u2018We love what you do, we want to help you grow,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Freeman said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cOne of the biggest food companies in the world has really voted in favor of very delicious coffee.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Nestl\u00e9 is acquiring 68 percent of Blue Bottle; the coffee company\u2019s management and employees will own the rest. Neither side would disclose financial terms.Although Blue Bottle is one of the most important players in the third-wave coffee sector, it has distinguished itself from its rivals in significant ways. It has spurned many of the hallmarks of high-end shops \u2014 barista competitions, lengthy travelogues about journeys to find the perfect small coffee farm \u2014 while emphasizing the aesthetics and experience of a well-prepared cup.The strategy is a reflection of the company\u2019s founder, a soft-spoken, classically trained musician who began roasting coffee as a hobby while on the road with traveling orchestras. Mr. Freeman\u2019s approach has less of the rebellious rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude displayed by competitors like Stumptown, and more of the quiet calm that one might associate with a slowly but well-brewed cup of coffee.\u201cI notice in other places they\u2019re friendly toward the younger hipster types but to the older folk, they\u2019re a little dismissive,\u201d said Michele Carlstrom, a customer at a Blue Bottle store in Brooklyn.Blue Bottle stores are clean and tastefully modern, largely because of Mr. Freeman\u2019s enthusiasm for Japanese aesthetics. And the company has opened most of them in areas convenient to professionals, including the Ferry Building in San Francisco and Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan.\u201cI guess if you\u2019re thinking about going to have the most luxurious coffee in the morning, we always come here,\u201d said another Brooklyn customer, Zahra Tangorra. \u201cThey pay attention. It\u2019s a refined, nice product. It\u2019s also just a good, lovely, neighborhood vibe.\u201dThe company\u2019s approach has fueled enormous growth. Blue Bottle expects to nearly double its store count this year, to 55 outlets from 29. And it has continued to develop ready-to-drink products, as well as an online subscription business for its roasted beans.Its ground coffees include blends that cost $17 for 12 ounces, to \u201csingle-origin\u201d coffees that retail for $40 for the same quantity. By comparison, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 \u201cOriginal Blend\u201d costs $8.99 a pound.Mr. Freeman and Blue Bottle\u2019s chief executive, Bryan Meehan, said they expected a 70 percent increase in sales this year.Although most of the company\u2019s existing stores are in the United States, Blue Bottle has managed to crack one of the fussiest markets for high-end coffee: Japan, where it now runs six stores. Mr. Meehan recalled how just the announcement that it was opening a roastery in Japan attracted hundreds of barista applicants.Blue Bottle\u2019s fan base extends beyond the customers in its shops. In recent years, the company has raised more than $100 million from investors that have included big funds like Fidelity and Google\u2019s venture arm and technology moguls like Kevin Systrom, a founder of Instagram, and Ev Williams, the former chief executive of Twitter.The fervor for the company led to what Mr. Meehan said were almost weekly approaches by financial suitors. Then in February, Mr. Meehan received a call: Would he be interested in meeting with Mark Schneider, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief executive?Mr. Meehan and Mr. Freeman took the Nestl\u00e9 chief on a tour of some Blue Bottle cafes in Brooklyn. Over lunch, Mr. Schneider made his case, saying his company was serious about wanting a partnership.Months later, Mr. Freeman was at Nestl\u00e9 headquarters on Lake Geneva, where executives eagerly demonstrated their own knowledge of the coffee business.Nestl\u00e9 has not previously had a presence in the high-end coffee market. But in courting Mr. Freeman and Mr. Meehan, the company emphasized its 151-year expertise in selling consumer goods and its vast international reach.Crucially, Blue Bottle will now probably never have to deal with going public in a stock offering, a prospect that appeared to horrify Mr. Freeman.\u201cEverything that I\u2019ve seen and read, it seems like a way of living in hell without dying,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Jump-Start Your Career", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "Advertisement\n            \nAdam Bryant has conducted hundreds of interviews with C.E.O.s about leadership for the Corner Office series he created. He is also the editorial director of live journalism at the Times.\n          I've been working as an administrative assistant for about three years now, and I would like to change my role to marketing or event coordination. How would I ask my company if there is a way to do that within the company?There are probably official channels through your company\u2019s H.R. department that you should explore, but you should also start doing some reporting through unofficial channels to learn about how the various departments operate. Is there a colleague you could reach out to for a coffee to learn more about how those units work and whether there are any openings (or ones coming up)?  If you want to start looking for this type of job outside your company, don\u2019t box yourself in and apply only for jobs that already match your experience. Everybody has to get experience at some point. You just need to convince somebody to bet on you, and you\u2019ll do that best by showing authentic and passionate interest in what they do, with a real focus on what you can do for them, rather than what they can do for you.My husband is in a job that he dreads. His confidence has taken a hit, too. What are the best things he can do to network and job search when self-esteem, energy and will are at a low?My sympathies. Doing work you dread is hard on your soul, and how you feel starts coloring everything else in your life. You can feel trapped and demotivated. Job-hunting reminds me of that expression about running: The first step is the hardest. Your husband just needs to go for a low-stakes, easy win: like a lunch meeting or two with people he already knows, with a focus on new avenues rather than dead ends. He needs a spark, a glimmer of possibility, and that will come through human connections, and will improve his view on the world. Once you start, it gets easier and the momentum builds.My contract with a company in the textile industry is three years long, but I would like to jump into the food and beverage industry after this. What's your suggestion? I have three years as a sales and accounting coordinator. What would be the best way to enter a new industry without any related experience?All that requires knowing people in that industry. You can read articles (and you should), but there is no substitute for friends, allies and acquaintances who are in the business. They can tell you where the opportunities are, and how to position yourself so there is a logical narrative for your background and why it would make sense in their industry.I'm in consulting but it doesn't feel like I'm learning actual skills. I want to eventually go to business school and work in business development and strategy. What should I be doing to set myself on this path?What's the best way to market myself and my 'transferable skills' when trying to leave a niche field within the nonprofit, cultural world?Is there a specific kind of job you want to move into? If so, you need to take a blank sheet of paper (I know, I know. I\u2019m old school, but some work is best done away from a screen.) and start breaking down the underlying skills and work in your current job, and how those can be applied in the new job. It\u2019s like you\u2019re building an argument, but you have to be able to back up the argument with specifics. \u201cThis is what I did, this was the result.\u201d A lot of people prefer to be around Tiggers.How do you know it's time to move on to a next job? Do you make a parallel move to re-energize?If you\u2019ve done your current job well, contributed to the team and learned a lot from it, and you\u2019re feeling like you want to shed your skin and do something new, then it\u2019s time to start looking. Last piece of advice on this: It\u2019s always better to run to something (an exciting new opportunity) rather than just doing anything to escape a job you don\u2019t like.I have been a stay-at-home mother out of the \"workforce\" since 1994. During this time I have been the most underpaid employee, with the greatest benefits. I morphed from a woman running a $17-million cosmetics business into a mother who multitasks 24/7. I've run benefits, championed fundraisers and built an impressive resume, albeit not for a major corporation. Most importantly, I know what my passion is. How would you dive back in?Seems like the easiest transition would be to build on all the work you\u2019ve done with fundraisers and benefits. Those are marketable skills, and a lot of jobs require those talents. It sounds like you\u2019re the kind of person who can make things happen and move the needle in whatever you do! I think you could make a compelling case to an employer. Plus, not everyone has run a $17 million business before.How do you find a balance between a job that inspires, and one that pays the bills?No judgments either way! But you have to know yourself.Is there a different line of work you really want to move into? Any career transition requires some sacrifices and extra work. It\u2019s part of a larger conversation we all have to have with ourselves from time to time: What do I really want, and why? Those are big questions, but always worth wrestling with.I've always wanted to go back to graduate school but my current job is going well. How will I know it's the right time to go back to school?I would pause before going to graduate school at this point, based on what you\u2019ve shared. If your current job is going well, and you\u2019re learning and growing and feel like there is runway in front of you, do you need to give that up?I've been at my job for almost three years. I enjoy the work I do and find that my work is meaningful. But I can't help but wonder where all this is leading to. How do I figure out a broader vision for my life and work toward it?I think a lot of people hit a similar point in their careers, sometimes more than once. The only answer is deep, serious and extended reflection, maybe with a blank sheet of paper or two (no screens!). You can\u2019t realize your goal if it\u2019s not defined. It sounds so simple but it\u2019s true. So the most important piece of advice I can give folks who are coming out of school, even people who\u2019ve already begun their career, is to know what it is they ultimately want to accomplish. And if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but start thinking about what it is, because once you know it, the moment you know it, you begin manifesting it. You manifest it in explicit ways by virtue of knowing and then pursuing it, and you manifest it in implicit ways \u2014 just in the way you talk, in the way you think and the things that you say to others and the people you attract to yourself.And if you don\u2019t know the answer to the broader question, my advice is to optimize for two things: passion and skill, not one at the exclusion of the other. You have to optimize for both.I am an introvert and I feel like I am skipped over for management positions. What can an introvert do to make opportunities?My boss, who is a charismatic, bright and experienced professional, is running his department ragged. Everyone on his team is exhausted because he says yes to every request. What exacerbates the situation: All the meetings we have do not leave much time for \u201creal work.\u201d How do I tell him to slow down?Right now, it sounds like everything is equally urgent, and maybe all the meetings are kind of providing cover for the fact that there is not a clear plan for delivering the results people need. Maybe you can even take a light-hearted approach: \u201cCan we have a meeting about our meetings?\u201d As long as you focus all your feedback on how to help him win better, rather than what he\u2019s doing wrong, he should be more open to the feedback.I have started a new position as a V.P. with a company I consulted with for a few years. I have five people on my team. I have always been a collaborative, successful colleague but am failing as a leader. What can I do to be a better leader, build consensus and inspire them to believe in the work and what we're trying to accomplish?Feels like it\u2019s time for an offsite, whether it\u2019s a literal or metaphorical one. Tell the team you feel it\u2019s time for a reboot, and ideally get people out of the office for a distraction-free and honest discussion. Ask them to come prepared to share some ideas so that you don\u2019t have to worry about awkward silences when you start asking for opinions. Some suggested questions to start the discussion: What are three things that are working well, and three things that are not? What\u2019s slowing our momentum? How can you, as their leader, help them more? What three things are frustrating them the most, and what are their suggestions for fixing them?I work at a fairly large company. What's the best way to meet people outside of my team or department and expand my network?The best tip: Can you find people in your company, maybe through a LinkedIn search, who went to the same school as you? Or grew up in, or were born in, the same city? Or maybe you both worked at the same company early on in your career, long before moving to your current employer?I'm in my mid-20s and have worked primarily at the same small company since I started my career. I love my job and don't want to move, however, how am I supposed to know if my yearly salary, increases and raises are on par with other companies in my field and across the industry?You can probably learn a lot from a deep internet search about salaries for comparable jobs at other companies. But there is also the simple reality that if people don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to leave, sometimes you will feel taken for granted. And that might be reflected in your paycheck. That might not be right. And it may not be fair. But it\u2019s also how much of the world works. Since finishing my master's degree, I have jumped around from job to job, staying at each job for at most one year. How do I find my ideal job and jump start my career without job hopping?The job hopping would be seem to be a symptom of the fact that you haven\u2019t found your ideal job. I\u2019m not sure what that job is, but I would caution against using that phrase, even as you think to yourself about the jobs you\u2019ve done and the job you want. Are you setting too high a bar? The grass-is-always-greener phenomenon is very real, and it\u2019s easy to think everything will be better elsewhere. And maybe it will be. (Again, I don\u2019t know your circumstances.)I graduated in June 2016 with a Bachelor in Business Administration, and I have been working on digital marketing and Google Adwords. Now I want to go back to recruitment (where I did my first internship) but it seems hard to get my CV noticed by recruiters, because of lack of experience. What do I do?I have just graduated college with an engineering degree. What is the best way for me to get started on a great career path?I am 20 years old and currently finishing my undergraduate degree. What are the best ways to stand out to employers among other graduates just coming out of college?I've heard conflicting advice whether to reveal my current salary when asked. How should I answer such question when asked during an interview?Sandy, the reason you\u2019ve heard conflicting advice is that, well, there is always a danger in a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach. If you\u2019re making good money in your current job and want to set the bar at a decent minimum for any discussions, I think it makes sense to go first and say, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m making now.\u201d Implicit in that is that you expect a premium above what you\u2019re making to switch jobs.If you think you\u2019d be coming in at the low end, it can be smart to ask them what they typically pay for someone in that role. From that point on, the negotiation will depend on the leverage of each side. It\u2019s also up to you how hard you want to negotiate. As long as you can build a clear and factual case for why you deserve X, that\u2019s a fine conversation to have. Any work you can do ahead of time to get a sense of what the company pays is also useful for such discussions. The final point is about your temperament. I\u2019ve seen some people negotiate so hard that it adds a real sour note to the start of a working relationship.I go to a lot of interviews, the interviewers like my resume, but I'm not called to work, what am I doing wrong?Employers want to know that you really want to work at their company, rather than just land a job.This may sound obvious but you\u2019d be shocked at how few people do this basic work ahead of time. Hope that helps.Tell me how a resume with gaps between jobs can still get noticed and interviewed?I'm a freelancer and got a full-time job that was great on paper but I quit after three months. I did a lot of great work in that time but left for health reasons. Should I keep it on my resume?I would throw it back to you with a question: How much do you need it on your resume? If it\u2019s important to include it to show you have that experience, and it\u2019s worth including even if you have to go into the explanation of why you left, then sure. But if it\u2019s just another example of the kind of work you\u2019ve done in other jobs, then maybe it\u2019s not worth it? I can\u2019t really answer this for you, but those are some considerations as you\u2019re thinking through this.I left a previous job. Now that boss is giving me bad references. How do I handle that without sinking down to his level?If it\u2019s inevitable that any prospective employer is going to call your previous boss, then you need to bring it up at the right moment and tell people up front what they\u2019re going to hear when they call that previous boss. Just be matter of fact about it, and make your case. \u201cThis is why we had problems working together. This is what I tried to do to fix it. Here\u2019s my take on why it didn\u2019t work. And if you call these other references, you\u2019ll discover that he\u2019s an outlier among all the opinions about me.\u201d I struggle with interviews. What are some tips to make sure my interviews go well?One of the most important questions to prepare for is when the interviewer asks you: \u201cWhat questions do have for me?\u201d This is your chance to shine. Do your homework on the company and its culture, and ask really incisive questions. And learn as much as you can about the person who\u2019s going to be interviewing you. Between LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, you can quickly get a sense of someone\u2019s background and interests. That will help you connect with them at a human level. What is the best approach for a qualified, but older, experienced worker to stand out amongst the coveted more recent grads when interviewing for a job?I was treated poorly in my last job even though my work was exceptional, so I resigned. Now organizations I'm interviewing with focus why I left my previous job. I've always read that you should never say anything negative about your former employer, so I haven't. Yet I've now been passed over for two jobs that I should easily have gotten. Any advice?Be wary of any advice that includes the words \u201cnever\u201d or \u201calways.\u201d If you feel it\u2019s an ongoing issue in your job search, you should probably start addressing it head on in your interviews (at the right moment, of course). It\u2019s all about positioning and attitude. If you can tell a simple and credible story about what happened, and talk about what you learned from the experience and how you can apply those insights in future roles, then you should be fine. Many interviewers (dare I say \u201cmost?\u201d) appreciate somebody who is honest and not trying to present a gleaming, polished facade. Just own the problem and minimize the finger-pointing, talk about what you learned from it and what you\u2019d do differently given a do-over, and people should respond well. Part of being trustworthy is showing vulnerability.Before changing careers, experts say, ask yourself some basic questions. For example, are your current skills obsolete, or will they soon be back in demand?Leaving a dispiriting career to pursue a passion carries risks as well as opportunities for rewards.New evidence shows that a mix of skills, especially technology skills, counts more than simply long experience in one specialty.May 19Sept. 26October 4Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Google Fights Fake News, Voices on the Margins Raise Alarm", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when he dug into the numbers, Mr. North said, he found a clearer explanation: Google had stopped redirecting search queries to the site. He discovered that the top search terms that once brought people to the World Socialist Web Site were now coming up empty.\u201cThis is not an accident,\u201d Mr. North said. \u201cThis is some form of deliberate intervention.\u201dAccusations that Google has tampered with search results are not uncommon and date back to the earliest days of its search engine. But they are taking on new life amid concerns that technology behemoths are directly \u2014 or indirectly \u2014 censoring controversial subjects in their response to concerns over so-called fake news and the 2016 presidential election.In April, Google announced an initiative called Project Owl to provide \u201calgorithmic updates to surface more authoritative content\u201d and stamp out fake news stories from its search results.To some, that was an uncomfortable step toward Google becoming an arbiter of what is and is not a trustworthy news source.\u201cThey\u2019re really skating on thin ice,\u201d said Michael Bertini, a search strategist at iQuanti, a digital marketing agency. \u201cThey\u2019re controlling what users see. If Google is controlling what they deem to be fake news, I think that\u2019s bias.\u201dMost people have little understanding of how Google\u2019s search engine ranks different sites, what it chooses to include or exclude, and how it picks the top results among hundreds of billions of pages. And Google tightly guards the mathematical equations behind it all \u2014 the rest of the world has to take their word that it is done in an unbiased manner.As the dominant search engine, with an estimated 90 percent global market share, Google was criticized by both the right and the left of the political world during the 2016 election.In the research that led to the creation of Project Owl, Google found that a small fraction of its search results \u2014 about 0.25 percent of daily traffic \u2014 were linking to intentionally misleading, false or offensive information. For a company that aims to deliver the most relevant information for all queries, that constituted a crisis.Google said it had added more detailed examples of problematic pages into the guidelines used by human raters to determine what is a good search result and what is a bad one. Google said its global staff of more than 10,000 raters do not determine search rankings, but their judgments help inform how the algorithm performs in the future.Google has often said that it cannot reveal too much or people would use that information to try to game the rankings. The opacity around Google\u2019s algorithm has given birth to a cottage industry of search engine optimization experts who dissect the company\u2019s comments.\u201cThe actual algorithm is not as important as what the algorithm is trying to do,\u201d said Mr. Nayak. \u201cBeing completely transparent of what you\u2019re trying to achieve is the central goal because how you accomplish that can change.\u201dGoogle said hundreds of factors go into its search algorithm and the formula is also constantly evolving. The company said it conducted 150,000 search experiments and implemented 1,600 changes last year.This is why it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly why search traffic plummets for a site like the World Socialist Web Site, which calls itself the \u201conline newspaper of the international Trotskyist movement.\u201d Mr. North, the site\u2019s chairman, said traffic coming in from search is down 70 percent since April, citing data from Alexa, a web traffic analytics firm owned by Amazon.com.In mid-April, a Google search for \u201csocialism vs. capitalism\u201d brought back one of the site\u2019s links on the first results page but, by August, that same search didn\u2019t feature any of its links. The site said 145 of the top 150 search terms that had redirected people to the site in April are now devoid of its links.\u201cThey should be asked to explain how they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mr. North said. \u201cIf they say we\u2019re not doing anything, that\u2019s simply not credible.\u201dMr. North said that Google has not responded to his claims. Google declined to comment on the World Socialist Web Site.Mr. North argued the drop-off in traffic is the result of Google directing users toward mainstream media organizations, including The New York Times. The World Socialist Web Site claimed that search referral traffic had fallen since April at a variety of other left-wing, progressive, socialist or antiwar publications like AlterNet and Consortiumnews.The New York Times could not find the same level of traffic declines at all of those publications, based on data from SimilarWeb, a web analytics firm. Traffic coming from search engines for the World Socialist Web Site was down 34 percent during the months of May to July, compared with the preceding three months, according to SimilarWeb. Traffic that did not come from search was up 1 percent during the same period.Mr. North said his site provides critical analysis for current events and it has nothing in common with sites peddling blatantly untrue stories. But he said he is opposed to any actions taken by Google under the pretext of stopping fake news.\u201cI\u2019m against censorship in any form,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to people what they want to read. It\u2019s not going to stop with the World Socialist Web Site. It\u2019s going to expand and spread.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Giants Face New Political Resistance in Washington", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.\u201cThere is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.\u201cWe are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\u201d said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview. \u201cThe growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\u201dPerhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\u201d Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement.Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook\u2019s discussions with the lawmakers were private.\u201cWe strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.\u201cSilicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \u201cBut selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\u201dOther issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.Even Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reaction to Steelers\u2019 Anthem Decision: How\u2019d We Lose to the Bears?", "Date": "2017-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 The tradition for a fall Monday here is to engage in the true national \u2014 or at least regional \u2014 pastime: celebrating a Steelers\u2019 win on Sunday or complaining about what in the world has gotten into the offense.But this Sunday, like a breaking newscast in the middle of a tight game, in came politics: on the sideline and in the locker room and pretty much everywhere else.The town\u2019s professional hockey team, the Penguins, meanwhile, confirmed that it would, in fact, accept an invitation to visit the White House as winners of last season\u2019s Stanley Cup.On TV news shows and online threads, where one must take a side on all matters, the teams\u2019 divergent approaches made for electric and potentially divisive political drama. But here in the bar stools and diner booths, even widely varying opinions about the issues at the heart tended to come to one big question: When did everything have to get so political?\u201cWhat I want to know is why we gave up 23 points to the Bears; no one seems to be talking about that,\u201d said Rose Morton, who on Monday was waiting for a train wearing a black Steelers T-shirt emblazoned with the words RINGS DON\u2019T LIE and the dates of the Steelers\u2019 six Super Bowl wins. \u201cFootball isn\u2019t politics. Football is football.\u201dBut to start a debate within the sports teams \u2014 and the Steelers in particular, winners in the steeltown era and winners in the tech hub era, too \u2014 may cut deeper than a misbranding of the city\u2019s economic base.\u201cBut this just is a way of dividing us in one of the areas we have always been able to unite,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be that part of Pittsburgh that takes over our politics, not Washington politics taking over Pittsburgh.\u201d\u201cThe N.H.L. is bipartisan,\u201d said Joel Hollies, 34, a bartender sitting before a couple of empty Miller High Life bottles in a Penguin-festooned bar on the south side of town. \u201cI bet Trump can\u2019t name four players on the Pens.\u201dThe conversation was almost exclusively about the Steelers, not only because the team\u2019s decision was the one outside the norm but also because, among the city\u2019s professional franchises, the Steelers are first among equals.The fan base tends to be older than that of the Penguins\u2019, said Gene Collier, a columnist for The Post-Gazette, in large part because the Steelers were very good long before the Penguins were very good, and the Steelers have now been good for decades (the Pirates, Pittsburgh\u2019s major league baseball team, have had longer stretches of not being very good).Steelers loyalty runs deep, but among some, this was tested by the team\u2019s decision on Sunday. Some threatened to burn jerseys or junk season tickets.\u201cWhat they did really sickens me; it\u2019s changed my opinion of them,\u201d said Kristen Trosky, a bartender and lifelong Steelers fan who heard fans complain all day on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you\u2019re invited to a wedding, and you\u2019re not the same religion as the bride or groom. You still follow their customs and respect their traditions. It\u2019s not up to you to voice your opinion there. And the tradition at football games is you stand up during the national anthem.\u201dMr. Hollies found this unconvincing. The team had not injected politics into this past Sunday; the president had. In fact, Mr. Hollies said, echoing the comments by Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin, by staying in the tunnel the team had been trying to avoid politics.\u201cThe staying in the locker room is a nonissue, it\u2019s just Trump supporters who think it\u2019s the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey support Trump more than they support the Steelers. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201dThis was not universally true. At an Eat\u2019n Park diner south of the city, Bill Powers, a veteran, Steelers fan and Trump voter, explained that he did not like when players took a knee during the anthem.But he also saw that Mr. Tomlin had a difficult matter to deal with while also maintaining player discipline and unity. Rather than have some players stand and some kneel on the sideline, it made sense to avoid the issue altogether.\u201cI wasn\u2019t offended in any way,\u201d Mr. Powers said. \u201cIt was a coaching call to keep the team focused.\u201dThe real mystery, he went on, was why the president he voted for decided to pick a fight with the N.F.L. in the first place.\u201cWhat was he thinking?\u201d Mr. Powers said. Then, possibly answering his own question, he added, \u201cSometimes he just doesn\u2019t think.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Self-Driving System Faulted by Safety Agency in Crash", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as the government moved Tuesday to open a clearer path for automakers to develop driverless cars, its leading safety agency waved a new warning flag.The agency said the system, known as Autopilot, had performed as intended, but lacked safeguards to prevent drivers from using it improperly.In the Florida case, the driver was able to use the system on a road for which it was not designed, and to turn his attention away from the road for an extended period just before the crash, the N.T.S.B. said.\u201cThe combined effects of human error and the lack of sufficient system controls resulted in a fatal collision that should not have happened,\u201d Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the N.T.S.B., said at a meeting during which the board\u2019s report was approved.The renewed attention to the Tesla system came as automakers are jockeying to push driverless technologies forward, while lawmakers and regulators scramble to keep pace, with the Trump administration putting forward its approach on Tuesday.The Transportation Department unveiled voluntary guidelines for testing autonomous vehicles on Tuesday as part of a broader government effort to encourage automakers\u2019 development of self-driving technology.The guidelines replace policies set down by the Obama administration last year that called for automakers to submit safety assessments of their self-driving models before testing them on public roads.Under the new guidelines, it will be left to automakers and other companies to decide whether to submit safety reviews to federal regulators. While the Trump administration will encourage public disclosures of such assessments, the documents will not be subject to federal approval.\u201cThis is not an enforcement document,\u201d Ms. Chao said. \u201cThis is a guidance document.\u201dThere will be no waiting period for a company to begin testing autonomous models, although the vehicles remain subject to broader safety rules and standards for equipment and parts.Industry officials lauded the less restrictive guidelines, which are intended to be a model for state policies. \u201cThe guidance provides the right balance, allowing emerging innovations to thrive while government still keeps a watchful eye over new developments,\u201d said the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group.In addition to Tesla\u2019s efforts, the competition to develop self-driving cars has become fierce among auto industry giants such as General Motors and Ford Motor, as well as technology companies including Google and Apple.The companies have been accelerating their testing and have backed legislation exempting autonomous vehicles from current motor vehicle laws.Some safety campaigners and consumer groups have been critical of the move toward voluntary rules covering self-driving technology, including the guidelines introduced by Ms. Chao, saying they reduce federal oversight that was already too limited.\u201cThe voluntary policy announced today is a retreat from the already flawed guidance provided in 2016,\u201d said Jason K. Levine, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. He said the lack of required safety assessments cedes power to automakers \u201cwho have frequently proven they cannot be trusted to protect the public interest in their race for profits.\u201dAutomakers and government officials contend that self-driving technology could reduce vehicle accidents and traffic fatalities, which rose by nearly 8 percent in 2015 to more than 35,000 deaths. Tesla reiterated that safety potential Tuesday after the transportation safety board issued its report on the Florida crash.The system\u2019s forward-looking camera failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky, and neither Mr. Brown nor the Autopilot system activated the brakes. Data from the car showed it had been traveling at 74 miles per hour at the time of the crash and that Mr. Brown had ignored several warnings to keep his hands on the steering wheel. A preliminary N.T.S.B. report found that he had at least seven seconds to notice the truck before impact.Like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the N.T.S.B. found that the version of Autopilot in Mr. Brown\u2019s car had performed as it had been designed to.But Mr. Sumwalt said that version of Autopilot \u201cgave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.\u201d He also said it was intended for use on limited-access highways rather than routes with cross traffic and intersections, such as the state highway Mr. Brown was traveling on.In a statement, Tesla said it \u201cappreciates\u201d the N.T.S.B.\u2019s analysis and will evaluate the agency\u2019s recommendations. \u201cWe will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times,\u201d the company said.Since the accident, Tesla has modified Autopilot to warn drivers more frequently to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the system cannot be engaged without stopping and restarting the car.Tesla has also modified how Autopilot\u2019s radar and camera sensors interact to improve its ability to recognize obstacles. The Autopilot upgrade was rolled out a year ago.Tesla introduced Autopilot in October 2015, to great fanfare. And for a time it seemed that Tesla was far ahead of the big, established automakers as the notion of self-driving cars caught the imagination of both the media and technology enthusiasts.But before long, some drivers, including Mr. Brown, began to post videos on YouTube showing that it was possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel. Some videos show drivers reading while at the wheel; in one, a driver climbs into his car\u2019s back seat.Even before the fatal crash, Tesla had come under criticism for releasing Autopilot without greater safeguards to prevent improper use. And early on, the company referred to it as a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version, suggesting it was a work in progress.Advertisement"}

It was a whydoyoucareaboutit.\u201cMenendez,\u201d written by Mr. Wolf\u2019s longtime associate Rene Balcer, also borrows a tabloid murder case \u2014 that of Lyle and Erik Menendez (Miles Gaston Villanueva and Gus Halper), who were convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents in 1989.But it\u2019s more mechanical and less thoughtful, lacking a larger curiosity. Its first two plodding episodes play like the opening acts of a way-too-extended episode of the original \u201cLaw & Order.\u201dThe series, beginning Tuesday, opens on a lurid, slow-motion re-creation of the shotgun murder, then shifts into police-procedural mode. (We hear our first chung-chung! sound effect twelve minutes or so in.)This means spending a lot of time with the investigators, Detective Les Zoeller (Sam Jaeger) and Detective Tom Linehan (Cliff Chamberlain) \u2014 who are so personality-free my notes distinguish them only as \u201cMustache\u201d and \u201cNo Mustache\u201d \u2014 and the brothers, who are sullen question marks.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month.

But in the attempt to balance the \u201claw\u201d and \u201corder\u201d halves of this series, she\u2019s underdeveloped, with a only few flicks at rounding out her workaholic character.Ms. Falco makes the most of what she has to work with. So do Josh Charles and Heather Graham in a side story about the affair between Erik\u2019s psychologist, Jerome Oziel, and Judalon Smyth, which led to the leak of Erik\u2019s confession in therapy. That subplot at least has some soapy verve, but it feels like it belongs in another, less buttoned-down series.There is the barest germ of an animating idea in \u201cMenendez\u201d \u2014 the wealthy buy justice and get automatic benefit of the doubt from the police \u2014 but it\u2019s perfunctory and blunt. If you\u2019re not familiar with the Menendez story already, you may wonder why it was ever such a media obsession.The missing spark is underscored in the second episode, with the brief appearance of celebrity defense attorney Robert Shapiro (Douglas Olsson). In \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d John Travolta\u2019s eccentric interpretation resembled the real Mr. Shapiro hardly at all physically, but made his aggrieved vanity unforgettable.This Mr. Shapiro looks a bit more like the real one, but he\u2019s purely functional, there to deliver a line, advance the plot and prompt a fleeting \u201cHey, it\u2019s that guy!\u201d reaction.

Pastor, we\u2019re going to take our chances.\u2019\u201dBut with the Trump administration ratcheting up its enforcement efforts, crossing into Texas was considered harder than ever before the storm. So now, many stayed put, deeply fearful about the risks of working there without immigration papers, even if they made it across.Illegal immigration across the Southwest border has already slowed since President Trump took office. Though there has been a slight uptick in recent months, detentions are well down from a year ago.Inside the Tamaulipeco Institute for Migrants here, a group of around 45 men and women who had just been deported from the United States used phones and computers this week to plan their next steps. One man was on Google, searching for news about the storm.\u201cThis kind of catastrophe produces work,\u201d said the man, who gave only his first name, Rigoberto. \u201cOne would like to go, but we just don\u2019t see any way.\u201dThe 42-year-old roofer had tried to cross the border with another man on Monday but they were caught and deported. Rigoberto said he was not sure if he would try again.Border Patrol officials said that while they have deployed personnel and equipment to help with search-and-rescue operations in Houston, they have not altered their staffing levels or protocols along the Southwest border.\u201cWe don\u2019t compromise the scope of the border security operation,\u201d Manuel Padilla Jr., who oversees operations in the agency\u2019s Rio Grande Valley Sector, said in an interview. He added that since the storm hit Texas, the agency had not seen any change in migration or apprehension rates, but that officials were prepared to make \u201cadjustments\u201d should they notice an uptick in illegal crossings.The issue of undocumented immigration came up at the White House on Thursday, with Tom Bossert, the National Security Council official who has spearheaded the White House response to the storm, saying that federal agencies will not deny emergency assistance, shelter or short-term aid for any of the estimated half-million residents of the Houston area without papers. People who have committed \u201ccrimes\u201d in addition to entering the country illegally, will be \u201crounded up as they always are,\u201d he said.\u201cNo individual human being should worry about their immigration status, unless they\u2019ve committed a crime on top of coming here illegally, when it comes to getting food, water and shelter,\u201d Mr. Bossert said. \u201cSo the authorities won\u2019t be conducting any routine swipes or searches inside those shelters.\u201dLarge natural disasters have historically inspired slight increases in illegal immigration from Latin America, as migrants have crossed in pursuit of work in the disaster zones.Migrants\u2019 advocates in Mexico, including shelter directors along the nation\u2019s northern border and in the capital, said they had not yet seen evidence of such an effect this time and that it was probably too early since rebuilding had not yet begun.Javier Mart\u00ednez Hern\u00e1ndez, a lawyer at a migrant shelter in Saltillo, in northeastern Mexico, said migrants in the shelter in recent days had discussed crossing the border for storm-related work.He said that he was working in the shelter in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, and that in the weeks and months after the hurricane struck, the shelter saw a flow of migrants bound for New Orleans.He said that if a similar dynamic occurred this time, it probably wouldn\u2019t be visible until reconstruction began in Houston. Then again, he pointed out, the enforcement situation in the United States is different from what it was 12 years ago. \u201cNow it\u2019s a little more difficult,\u201d he said.Hern\u00e1n, who was deported from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, had already bought his bus ticket to Monterrey, a city further south. He said he would not try to cross again because it was \u201ctoo tough.\u201d If migrants like him flocked to Houston, he said he was sure that federal agents would respond. \u201cWhere they know there are people, that\u2019s where they go,\u201d he said.Annie Correal reported from Nuevo Laredo and Kirk Semple from Mexico City.

Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter based in Seattle, discussed the tech he is using.You cover Amazon and Microsoft. Do you use their technology?The one technology constant in my career as a journalist seems to be Microsoft Word. I take notes for all of my stories in it on a MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve tried Google Docs and OneNote, but can\u2019t stick with them for reasons I can\u2019t explain. I have a feeling I might be cremated with a copy of Microsoft Word.What do or don\u2019t you like about their tech products that you use?I find some of the things you can do on the Echo pretty silly and much easier on a smartphone app. I\u2019ll give you an example. A while back I was installing a sprinkler system in my garden that was connected to a wireless control unit. I found out I could use the control unit with Alexa to turn on the sprinklers with my voice.What are your favorite websites, apps or other tech tools for keeping on top of technology news?I get so much of my news diet, technology or otherwise, through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. I have configured my phone to send me a text message every time Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, tweets because he\u2019ll occasionally make news that way.What tech gadgets or apps are you or your family currently obsessed with and why?I am a contrarian on the Apple Watch, which I believe has been unfairly maligned by tech pundits. I love mine, and I get pretty frustrated by a lot of Apple products. I\u2019m a runner and cyclist and track all of my workouts with it. I use Siri on the watch to respond to text messages.Apple somehow managed to create a wearable device versatile enough that you can wear it on a run and with a suit. That\u2019s impressive.Are there technologies that you\u2019re not crazy about?I\u2019ve never cared for reading books on screens, even though I almost exclusively read newspapers and magazines on my phone and computer.I don\u2019t play video games. My son does. I\u2019m embarrassed to say he spent a decent chunk of the summer wasting bad guys in Call of Duty. He also read a big stack of books and is a sweet, sensitive kid, which is how he got away with it.What\u2019s your advice about how much or how little kids should be on their devices and on games? This is such a difficult issue. Most of my daughter\u2019s homework is on a computer so policing her screen time is really about limiting certain applications or websites. The other day I gave her a hard time when I heard her listening to YouTube. It was for her Spanish class.Overall, I try to encourage personal responsibility rather than hassle my kids all the time about their devices. It has worked so far.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s $1.3 Billion Fine in Europe Requires Review, Court Says", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The highest court in the European Union ruled on Wednesday that Intel\u2019s $1.3 billion antitrust fine get a second look, a decision that could ease some of the legal pressure that American tech giants face in the region.The order, which will send the Intel case back to a lower court for review, is a blow to a sweeping regulatory crackdown in Europe that has ensnared American household names like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. It could also embolden these technology companies, which have long complained that officials in Europe target them unfairly, to challenge the rulings and investigations against them.The case, and its outcome, plays to the legal headaches for Silicon Valley in Europe. The European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has made technology companies a central focus, with investigations into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The companies all deny any wrongdoing.The commission said that such rebates, offered to manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC, were anticompetitive. That argument raised questions about whether some common practices in the digital world, such as the bundling of products or services, could violate antitrust rules.It did not strike down the original ruling, but experts said the decision to send the case back to a lower court was a good sign for businesses looking to offer rebates to customers in exchange for exclusivity deals.\u201cThis decision is the right one for business, consumers, and E.U. antitrust law and policy,\u201d said Dave Anderson, an antitrust partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. \u201cExclusivity rebates are no longer considered in the E.U. as inherently anticompetitive.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line for Intel,\u201d Mr. Anderson added, \u201cis that Intel lives to fight another day.\u201dThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up 2 percent, to $35.72, in midday trading in New York.\u201cWe welcome today\u2019s landmark ruling,\u201d Steven R. Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said. \u201cWhile this case concerns events that happened more than a decade ago, we have always believed that our actions were lawful and did not harm competition. We look forward to the next step in this process.\u201dStill, some critics, particularly in the United States, say Europe\u2019s antitrust officials have too much power to levy fines and to force companies to change business practices without prior court orders.The ruling on Wednesday will give businesses more confidence that they could win a case on appeal if they come under investigation, said Veronica Roberts, a London-based partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, a law firm.\u201cThis gives them more confidence that a defense that they put forward could be reviewed,\u201d she said.The European Commission gave a cautious response when asked what the latest ruling would mean for other technology companies under investigation in Europe, and whether it would give those firms confidence to pursue legal challenges rather than to reach financial settlements.\u201cI cannot comment how companies will proceed or assess the judgment,\u201d Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news conference. \u201cWe ourselves still have to look carefully into the details of the judgment.\u201dThe chip-making industry, including Intel, has changed markedly since the case was brought.Intel was being investigated for its actions from 2002 to 2007. At one point, the company controlled 70 percent of the market for microchips, according to the European Commission. Known for its \u201cIntel Inside\u201d advertising slogan, the company dominated the market for personal computers.But since then, Intel has seen demand for PCs deteriorate, as consumers have shifted to buying increasingly powerful smartphones and tablets, a sector in which chip makers like Qualcomm, ARM and Samsung are major suppliers.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Amie Tsang from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Understand Rising Inequality, Consider the Janitors at Two Top Companies, Then and Now", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsROCHESTER \u2014 Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak\u2019s campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201dPerhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201dFor Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201dAnd that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201dWhen an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.Labor exists on a similar continuum.The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it\u2019s not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees \u2014 meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn\u2019t outsource will have to pay them for everyone.More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.\u201cThere was an overriding concern about equity,\u201d said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. \u201cFirms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn\u2019t as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market.\u201dLinda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today\u2019s equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.\u201cI helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn\u2019t have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had a series of managers who trusted me.\u201dIt bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.In reading the company\u2019s old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years\u2019 annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.\u201cWe definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple,\u201d said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. \u201cBut they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company.\u201d She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management,\u201d she said.Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn\u2019t show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company\u2019s workers from forming one.There is little chance for building connections at Apple. \u201cEveryone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don\u2019t see each other outside of work,\u201d said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.Ms. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.\u201cOne thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people,\u201d said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. \u201cIt was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company.\u201dBut in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized.Neil Irwin reported from Rochester and Cupertino, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Streampunks\u2019 Serves Up YouTube\u2019s Greatest Hits", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionIt\u2019s not easy to write a relevant book about internet culture. By the time it hits the press, the online story has already changed. The narrative has outpaced the publishing schedule for \u201cStreampunks: YouTube and the Rebels Remaking Media,\u201d a book about YouTube video makers written by the company\u2019s chief business officer, Robert Kyncl (with assistance from the Google speechwriter Maany Peyvan). Kyncl\u2019s account is suffused with Obama-age technocratic optimism, but we\u2019re in the Trump era now. Many of the \u201crebels\u201d disrupting the mainstream media these days aren\u2019t exactly humming Kumbaya.\u201cStreampunks\u201d tells the story of a multicultural cast of video creators who have outsmarted the media\u2019s white, male gatekeepers to build the next wave of television, enlightening and empowering viewers with their intimate, straight-to-the-camera dispatches. When Kyncl writes that YouTube \u201ccan show you the breadth of humanity that you may not see outside your window every day,\u201d he is actually referring to a narrow swath of human testimonies \u2014 ones that teach viewers to embrace their nerdiness; or help them understand the experiences of people with physical disabilities; or bring together L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers; or advocate for women\u2019s empowerment in the Middle East. He writes brightly of YouTube \u201cbroadening society\u2019s horizons\u201d and creating a \u201cglobal media melting pot.\u201dBut YouTube can just as easily connect lonely racists as it does isolated queer kids, or accelerate regressive values as quickly as progressive ones. It\u2019s now more obvious than ever that YouTube, like other social networks, has been leveraged by a network of overwhelmingly white, male far-right nativists and chauvinists who use its innovative communication tools to spread messages of terror and domination. In a choice typical of the book\u2019s scope, Kyncl writes glowingly about Vice Media\u2019s chief executive and co-founder Shane Smith, and his mission to remake television news for internet natives ; many of Vice\u2019s raw, on-the-ground videos were hosted on YouTube before they graduated to HBO. Kyncl mentions that Smith started Vice with a Canadian friend named Gavin McInnes, but doesn\u2019t note where McInnes ended up: He\u2019s been making online news videos, too, for far-right sites, and he\u2019s used his media perch to spearhead a crew of \u201cpro-Western\u201d men he calls the Proud Boys.Recent events rocking the platform \u2014 like when PewDiePie, YouTube\u2019s most popular vlogger, was widely criticized for his frequent Nazi jokes, lost his development deal with YouTube, earned the support of the alt-right and ignited a creator-led campaign against YouTube management \u2014 are relegated to asides. There is a brief and illuminating discussion of why black YouTubers haven\u2019t risen on the platform that notes how unseen algorithms can reinforce structural inequalities, and a short nod to the dangers of political polarization and the spread of fake news. More space is given to a celebration of how YouTube has helped turn corporate advertising into must-see-TV.You can see why a person in Kyncl\u2019s position would be eager to cling to a positive story line. He is a YouTube executive who is personally and financially invested in the company\u2019s success. The best you can hope for in an inside account like this is that the insider will serve up some juicy details about how the sausage gets made. Instead, the book hops from new-media conference to new-media conference, often ones featuring Kyncl himself as a speaker. There\u2019s not too much to say about famous YouTubers that they haven\u2019t already vlogged themselves. Meanwhile, the workings of the multinational conglomerate behind the platform remain opaque.Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow covering internet culture for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio and the Politics of iPhone City", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThe idea, which manages at once to be bloodless and blood-boiling, is to fill apartment buildings, gyms, dormitories and so on with app-accessed \u201cpantries,\u2019\u2019 known to previous generations as \u201cvending machines,\u201d and pack them with the sort of things typically found in corner stores but catered to the micro-demographics of particular environments \u2014 paper towels, seltzer, Pirate\u2019s Booty, condoms, cans of chick peas. The human element is conveniently expunged.It is easy to imagine what other politicians past and present would consider doing to two guys who believed that what New York or any city needed was the automation of a serendipitous neighborhood shopping experience \u2014 wrap them in drop cloth and duct tape and send them somewhere toward the Panama Canal. It is hard to think of Mr. de Blasio, who addresses New Yorkers as \u201cbrothers and sisters,\u201d a humorously distancing trope he deploys in his campaign emails as if he were unionizing graduate students at Cornell, getting similarly impassioned.For a long while now the commentariat has wondered how it is that four more years of Mr. de Blasio, who, despite clear successes, still grates on so many of his constituents, could be considered an inevitability. Part of the answer is certainly rooted in the mechanics of the system \u2014 term limits keep potentially serious challengers in the jobs they have until they no longer have them and can mount campaigns more easily. But at a deeper level of the city\u2019s neurology, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s supreme belief in his own way of doing things, his taste for patronizing lecture, his tendency to justify an absence of humility on the grounds that he is driven by virtue above all, seem well synchronized to the invasion of an equally righteous Silicon Valley ethos, and the culture of disconnection it choreographs.At the moment and timed to the mayoral election, Mr. de Blasio is the subject of a book called, \u201cThe Pragmatist.\u2019\u2019 Nine days after it landed, it ranked 74,762 on Amazon, which would only seem to further confirm Mr. de Blasio\u2019s limited prospects for becoming a face of the counterinsurgency in Trump America. Were Mr. de Blasio more popular, this might have been one of the rare occasions in which a local election involving an incumbent produced a vibrant turnout. This is, in part, because of the national conversation on the renewed importance of state and municipal elections, but also because of the depth of antipathy for the current president in New York and what it would mean to come out in a strong gesture of support for a progressive politician. Under the most amicable of circumstances, mayors have to do battle with the federal government to maintain and increase city funding.During Tuesday\u2019s primary in the city, Brooklyn voters were asked to elect five civil court judges out of a slate of 11 \u2014 women won all of the slots and not because they were, across the board, more liberal than their male contestants.

{"Headline": "Will Mark Zuckerberg \u2018Like\u2019 This Column?", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The idea of Mark Zuckerberg running for president was always sort of scary.But now it\u2019s really scary, given what we\u2019ve discovered about the power of his little invention to warp democracy.All these years, the 33-year-old founder of Facebook has been dismissive of the idea that social media and A.I. could be used for global domination \u2014 or even that they should be regulated.Days after Donald Trump pulled out his disorienting win, Zuckerberg told a tech conference that the contention that fake news had influenced the election was \u201ca pretty crazy idea,\u201d showing a \u201cprofound lack of empathy\u201d toward Trump voters.But all the while, the company was piling up the rubles and turning a blind eye as the Kremlin\u2019s cyber hit men weaponized anti-Hillary bots on Facebook to sway the U.S. election. Russian agents also used Facebook and Twitter trolls, less successfully, to try to upend the French election.Finally on Thursday, speaking on Facebook Live, Zuckerberg said he would give Congress more than 3,000 ads linked to Russia. As one Facebooker posted: \u201cWhy did it take EIGHT MONTHS to get here?\u201dRobert Mueller\u2019s team, as well as House and Senate investigators, are hotly pursuing the trail of Russian fake news. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security told 21 states, including Wisconsin and Ohio, that Russian agents had tried to hack their elections systems during the campaign.Some lawmakers suspect that the Russians had help in figuring out which women and blacks to target in precincts in Wisconsin and Michigan.Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee looking into Russia\u2019s intervention in 2016, has a suspect in mind. \u201cPaul Manafort made an awful lot of money coming up with a game plan for how Russian interests could be pushed in Western countries and Western elections,\u201d Heinrich told Vanity Fair.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s C.O.O., apologized for this on Wednesday and promised to fix the ad-buying tools, noting, \u201cWe never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way \u2014 and that is on us.\u201dRoose noted that in addition to the Russian chicanery, \u201cIn Myanmar, activists are accusing Facebook of censoring Rohingya Muslims, who are under attack from the country\u2019s military. In Africa, the social network faces accusations that it helped human traffickers extort victims\u2019 families by leaving up abusive videos.\u201dThe Sandberg admission was also game, set and match for Elon Musk, who has been sounding the alarm for years about the danger of Silicon Valley\u2019s creations and A.I. mind children getting out of control and hurting humanity. His pleas for safeguards and regulations have been mocked as \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201cpretty irresponsible\u201d by Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg, whose project last year was building a Jarvis-style A.I. butler for his home, likes to paint himself as an optimist and Musk as a doomsday prophet. But Sandberg\u2019s comment shows that Musk is right: The digerati at Facebook and Google are either being na\u00efve or cynical and greedy in thinking that it\u2019s enough just to have a vague code of conduct that says \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d as Google does.In July, the chief of Tesla and SpaceX told a meeting of governors that they should adopt A.I. legislation before robots start \u201cgoing down the street killing people.\u201d In August, he tweeted that A.I. going rogue represents \u201cvastly more risk than North Korea.\u201d And in September, he tweeted out a Gizmodo story headlined \u201cHackers Have Already Started to Weaponize Artificial Intelligence,\u201d reporting that researchers proved that A.I. hackers were better than humans at getting Twitter users to click on malicious links.(Musk also tweeted that it was a cautionary tale when Microsoft\u2019s chatbot, Tay, had to be swiftly shut down when Twitter users taught her how to reply with racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic slurs, talking approvingly about Hitler.)Vladimir Putin has denied digital meddling in the U.S. elections. But he understands the possibilities and threat of A.I. In a recent address, the Russian president told schoolchildren, \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d Musk agreed on Twitter that competition for A.I. superiority would be the \u201cmost likely cause of WW3.\u201dOn Thursday, touring the Moscow tech firm Yandex, Putin asked the company\u2019s chief how long it would be before superintelligent robots \u201ceat us.\u201dZuckerberg scoffs at such apocalyptic talk. His project this year was visiting all 50 states, a trip designed by former Obama strategist David Plouffe, which sparked speculation that he might be the next billionaire to seek the Oval Office.Yep.

Welcome back to our show, our pop-culture confession booth.WM: Hi.JW: So, Mr. Morris, what is on your mind this week?WM: Walter Becker died about two weeks ago. He was half of Steely Dan, a group that I thought was two old black dudes my whole life \u2014 or not my whole life, sorry, my entire adolescence. My father had to have a very comical but what for him was an annoyingly, unnecessarily difficult conversation with me.JW: This was pre-Google.WM: They weren\u2019t an MTV act either, but my dad had Steely Dan records. So, I\u2019m still listening to women and the albums they\u2019ve made, and so I was sort of torn about whether to interrupt what I was pleasurably doing to listen to some Steely Dan, and I did that. I listened to \u201cAja,\u201d which was one of their bigger albums. And one of the most famous songs from that record and one of their most famous songs if you\u2019re a hip-hop fan is, of course, \u201cPeg,\u201d which we should play a little bit of right now. We\u2019ll just play, we\u2019ll just go right into the chorus.PEG, STEELY DANWM: I didn\u2019t understand race as a kid. Nobody, no kid understands race.

I wish that somebody would find a way to put her out of business and give her something else to write about, but racism and education seems to persist, nonetheless. So, she had this story about the resegregation of this county in Alabama. It\u2019s really just devastating, mostly because just reading it, you understand just how much states can have been trying through racism to not integrate the schools, and to keep black people and Latinos from having an equal and fair education.JW: Right. It\u2019s exposing something that most people probably thought fundamentally we moved away from, just equal access to education.

It\u2019s just, it\u2019s really sad. We\u2019re thinking about you, everybody. Like we said last week, it\u2019s still true this week. Anyway. What\u2019s going on with you?

And, you know, people get miffed because they\u2019re waving at me, I can\u2019t even see the motion of their hands. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. There have been so many times I\u2019ve been out in the park and I don\u2019t realize someone\u2019s trying to talk to me until they\u2019re right up on top of me, and then I\u2019m like, Oh, I\u2019m so sorry.

Niecy Nash is in it, she\u2019s incredible. Dee Norris, who was actually on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d is like a bisexual crime lord. The only thing that\u2019s weird about the show is that there\u2019s a character on the show named Virginia, who is Vietnamese, and her ethnicity is a running punch line. She\u2019s played by Karrueche Tran, who is a makeup artist and kind of became an insta-celebrity after that for different reasons. I don\u2019t like those jokes, and I don\u2019t know. ... We need to talk about it at some point.WM: This is like, what? Our fourth week of talking about Asian racism, or racism against Asians. There\u2019s always a fight over what the last acceptable form of racism is, and in this race to the bottom \u2014 I mean \u201cacceptable\u201d meaning what shows can get away with without huge protests. For whatever reason, there\u2019s a lot of racism against Asian people that is just in our culture that we don\u2019t really examine. Often because, I think, it comes from nonwhite people and is therefore less \u2014 what? Contested?JW: Right. But the show, overall, if you can get past that, is excellent. Maybe they\u2019ll do better for Season 2, because it was renewed. O.K. A little birdie told me about Rihanna\u2019s beauty launch last week.WM: Tweet, tweet, tweet, right here!JW: I\u2019m not too proud to admit that the invitation didn\u2019t come directly to me, but it came through one Mr. Wesley Robert Morris. Thank you very much for making my birthday dreams true early. We saw, we experienced, we smelled even Rihanna, because she was that close to me that I could tell you precisely from head to toe what she smells like. Cotton candy and hormones. She was everything. Everything. Capital E, capital T. So, I\u2019m not someone who gets very starstruck. I mean, partially because I\u2019m a journalist, but also, I\u2019m just not a hype beast. Like, I don\u2019t like to be the one who can\u2019t keep their [expletive] together when, you know what I mean? Like, some celebrity swans through the room. I don\u2019t like that anyway, and I did keep my composure at this event, but I was shocked to learn that even I was not immune to the privilege and the access and the exclusivity of being at that event. I tweeted it, I Instagrammed it, I storied it, I told everybody in my life about it. And watching myself transform into that monster instantaneously was a little distressing.WM: You weren\u2019t quite monstrous.JW: Um ... but I did transform into a gremlin, and I, you know, I\u2019m still thinking about that. Still thinking about that, what happened. How the water got on my fur.WM: Fenty Beauty is not the only thing we did last week.JW: Very true. Very, very true.WM: We didn\u2019t go to the U.S. Open together, but we were there the same night, and we watched some tennis not together. But together, because you kept texting me about how stressed out you were. Venus Williams played that night, she beat Petra Kvitov\u00e1, and we were talking about how much this woman means to both of us, and to many, many other people, and she just had the best year of her professional tennis life in almost a decade. It\u2019d be great to talk about what you learned and what you have learned watching her play \u2014 and lose. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today.JW: Yes.WM: These two women.JW: Venus and Rihanna.WM: Rihanna\u2019s win, her Fenty Beauty win. Her win over like, a whole aspect of consumer culture. And Venus\u2019s many, many wins, and her ultimate loss and what we take away from that, what the experience of watching her win and lose is like, especially at this point in her career.JW: Alright, stay tuned. Last week, we arrived \u2014 I arrived by car, you arrived by foot. I had to go in separate from you, because I was like, I cannot be late to this event. Anyway, so we arrive at a warehouse \u2014\u2014WM: You were so steamed.JW: Honey. I was like, if you make me miss Robin Fenty because you decide to walk from your house to Brooklyn Navy Yard, uh-uh. I knew, I was just like, We will not be friends anymore, so let me just go ahead. But basically, we arrive at this warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it\u2019s the middle of Fashion Week, which means empty lots, empty warehouses, random parks or whatever get transformed into runway shows of different kinds. And it\u2019s all very exciting, it\u2019s all very fun. You never know who is going to show up. People come dressed up. It\u2019s very fun. We arrive, Rihanna\u2019s launching her new beauty line called Fenty Beauty. Everybody\u2019s excited because it\u2019s supposed to have like, the most number of complexion, like, different foundations and products for the largest number of complexions on the market. Whatever. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. But people were very excited for this event. People get excited for anything Rihanna does in general, so.WM: Well, she\u2019s one of the few people, one of the few pop stars to manage to somewhat instantly have a successful fashion imprint.JW: Well, she feels like she has a vision.WM: Right.JW: What\u2019s remarkable about the space is not how it has been transformed, which is, like, into a spaceship, more or less, for this product launch, but it\u2019s that everyone in the room is done up head to toe, but they\u2019re also starring in their own \u201cLive From Fenty Beauty\u201d show that\u2019s ongoing. So, you have all these people with selfie sticks, they\u2019re doing a long-armed selfie hold. People are shooting each other, they\u2019re shooting the napkins that say Fenty Beauty \u2014 which I took a stack of, which I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit, because I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know what came over me! I couldn\u2019t help myself.WM: You were ... you had no shame.JW: Listen.WM: It was so adorable.JW: I was freaking out. But anyway, the point is, I have not seen ... I know how the beauty world works. I know that there are beauty bloggers. I know that people cover beauty events. I know that people write up product launches. They review them, and I get it. Makeup Instagram is like a whole world unto itself. But I did not realize the degree to which the launch of a makeup line by someone like Rihanna really also rests on the amplification of \u2014 dozens, hundreds? How many people were there? Of those people, you know, Snapchatting and Instragramming and uploading to Facebook and tweeting about this event, also. But it makes total sense. I mean, everything that I buy pretty much is couched within the context of social media. If I see a cute pair of pants on Instagram, I\u2019m probably going to ask that person where they got them. I don\u2019t go to stores to shop. I don\u2019t like stores.WM: This is why brick-and-mortar retail is in the toilet, by the way.JW: It is, though. But it is. But I mean, pretty much all the things I\u2019m interested in buying or wearing or doing \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m copycatting looks, but it\u2019ll be like, a particular shade of a blue. And I\u2019m like, Oh, I like that color blue on that skin tone. I should maybe think about wearing baby blue, too. I get all my fashion pretty much through social media, on people that I know of or trust.WM: So, you now have these video mannequins basically who you can also kind of call your friend.JW: I mean, at the thing itself, so we\u2019re looking at all these video screens, a woman comes out, makes a speech, then Rihanna comes out, makes a speech, and then Rihanna proceeds to swan around the whole event.WM: The minute she was done speaking and the screens had gone up, everybody flipped their phone around and began to say, you know, things like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go try on this base.\u201dJW: Highlighter, I\u2019ve got to try the primer. I\u2019ve got to try the gloss. And at the stations themselves where you could go try on these products and they had the vanity setups, but they actually had cell phone stands in them. So you could put your phone in the stand \u2014WM: Shut up.JW: Did you not see this?WM: I did not notice that.JW: Oh, yeah. They had directly next to the vanity \u2014 I was turning into a Tasmanian devil \u2014 but they had the little stands so you could put your phone in the thing, press with one finger to record and do your makeup, and talk into the camera. It was unbelievable. But I was doing some research last night, and there was a business and fashion article that said according to a recent report from Google, 64 percent of women shop this way today. Via influencers! Like, people who talk about the clothing, accessories that they want and wear them online in their social media. So, you have this entire climate. It\u2019s Fashion Week. You have this entire climate where people who are popular online, who have built these kinds of followings online all the sudden are getting priority seating at fashion shows. All of the sudden, they\u2019re getting priority access to new items of clothing or makeup products, like Fenty Beauty. And I have to say too, you know, I did watch all the outtakes and footage from Rihanna\u2019s Puma fashion show via social media. I wasn\u2019t interested in what Vogue thought of her show. No, I wanted to see what my friends, who were sitting front row at the show, had to say. What looks they zoomed in on. I\u2019m way more interested in what they think versus what an anonymous person at Vogue thinks.WM: I wonder if this is partially a technological-innovation milestone, right? Where you have the ability now to whip out your phone, create content that is qualitative, evaluative of a particular product. Or whether it\u2019s the result \u2014 whether the development is the result of the way fashion media and the fashion industry has tended to fetishize and dollarize and romanticize and favor particular looks, to exclude lots and lots of body types and people from its pages, from its worldview.JW: And this is the upside of social media, right, like it allows anyone to become an entrepreneur, in theory. It allows anyone to build a following. And this is something I spend a ton of time writing about and a ton of time thinking about, because I love new economies that aren\u2019t beholden to the old gatekeepers. I love new types of jobs that exist. I think it\u2019s ... phenomenal that if you are a young person \u2014 or not even that young, but you\u2019re just someone who has an aesthetic for how you want to present yourself online, and you can get thousands, millions of people to follow you, and then in turn, you get paid just because you\u2019re such a dynamic presence, people want to follow you and they want to find out what you\u2019re into ... that\u2019s amazing. I mean, it sounds exhausting, but it\u2019s also amazing, because it\u2019s the same \u2014 it\u2019s a way around these same barriers of access and barriers of entry that you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s why there hasn\u2019t been beauty products that complement my skin tone, or shaving products that work with your skin type.WM: But what do the Anna Wintours take from this disruption? Do they see Rihanna and roll their eyes, or do they see Rihanna and try to get on board? Not just with her celebrity but now, her power as a businesswoman.JW: Yeah, well, I think the Vogues of the world still love the Rihannas of the world, but I think the Vogues of the world\u2014\u2014WM: But do they love the women Rihanna love?JW: I mean, if you\u2019re talking about in terms of coverage, I think we have started to see mainstream fashion sites and beauty sites start to be more inclusive to women of color, because they have to. They know they have to, if not only because of maybe the advertising dollars or digital traffic or ad revenue, IDK, because it\u2019s not a good look to be like, We only speak to white women. You\u2019re just going to get called out on social media. So, I think that\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s been a shift towards more inclusiveness. But I also think the traditional sites across the board are feeling frustrated by the lack of exclusivity that they have. I mean, Rihanna\u2019s always going to do a Vogue cover. But you know, if you\u2019re some really hot collection designer, you might give your pieces to a really young, hot Instagrammer instead, and not an editor at a fashion site. You might bring that person, because you\u2019re like, Well, they\u2019re actually reaching more of the people that I want to reach, and people that are going to be more inclined to buy my products, the people that are directly tapped into them.WM: But I have to ask this, this all sounds great in some ways, but what\u2019s the human downside to this?JW: Yo, like everything else about the internet, human cost can be real expensive. I mean, I think anecdotally speaking, some of the influencers I\u2019ve talked to, this rules their entire lives, and I think also, they ... they work all the time, because they always have to make content. And if you think about how quickly we scroll through our social media feeds, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not a commercial that takes weeks to produce and then you watch it for 30 seconds. This is something that takes hours to produce and then you look at it and digest it and move on in a second. I mean, the beast is always hungry, and it\u2019s always asking for more. And you know, there was a woman at the Rihanna show we spoke with who was like, It\u2019s really difficult, especially during Fashion Week because, I\u2019ve got two children, and they\u2019re part of this, too. But also, I never get to spend time with them, and I don\u2019t want them to remember that Mommy always had her phone in front of her face, because you\u2019re always checking to see what\u2019s going on or what are the new offers.WM: But at the same time, the same person, like her child was part of her thing.JW: She made her child part of thing too, which is, I mean, I don\u2019t know. I follow her now, and I\u2019m kind of into it. But I think the cost is high, and I think when you yourself become the thing that people are consuming, I think it\u2019s hard to anticipate how draining that is. And also what it does to your sense of self and your sense of privacy. I mean, people do make money, though. You can get paid like \u2014 I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as tens of thousands of dollars for a single post depending on who you are.WM: It\u2019s like a Gary Shteyngart novel. It is. It\u2019s \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story.\u201dJW: But here\u2019s my question for you. Like, I feel my brain being rewired.WM: It\u2019s a world in which everything is quantified by your interaction with it and people\u2019s approval of X, Y, or Z interaction.JW: Right. You\u2019re only as valuable as the content you create.WM: So all your behavior is motivated by technology.JW: The feedback loop.WM: He is a visionary, Gary Shteyngart. And it\u2019s funny, because that book, you just sort of felt like that\u2019s the future. And it was so strange to be at \u2014\u2014JW: Literally that narration of it.WM: Yeah, yeah.JW: But the difference between that book and reality, I would say, is that in the book, the protagonist has the wherewithal to be like, This is not normal. And no one else \u2014\u2014WM: But he\u2019s the only person who knows.JW: He\u2019s the only person in that world who knows. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true of this age that we\u2019re in. I think there\u2019s very much a tacit awareness and understanding of the economy that you\u2019re participating in. And what you\u2019re getting out of it, what you\u2019re extracting out of it. And this is the thing that I think people like about Rihanna a lot is that she\u2019s also very aware of her role in all of this too. Like she\u2019s not going to be Justin Bieber who is like, Please, please don\u2019t. Rihanna just won\u2019t show up. She won\u2019t show up in public if she doesn\u2019t want you to take her picture. but I think when she\u2019s there in that role, she really understands like, I\u2019m not a person. I\u2019m an avatar. I don\u2019t know. We could be more skeptical. I should be more skeptical about it. For me, it\u2019s mostly exciting until proven otherwise.WM: I think we have been plenty skeptical. I mean, my other question is like, what happens if all this stuff falls apart, you know? Like, you know about me and my great internet apocalypse. And I don\u2019t even know what that looks like, but I\u2019m always thinking about what happens when the equivalent of a Hurricane Irma or a Hurricane Harvey comes to the internet. And like who survives, who lives, who dies, and what models are viable enough to survive that? I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a fair analogy, but I do wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t quite get the built on a house of cards feeling about quite this, but there\u2019s a lot that goes on in the way that we consume and create culture now that does feel to me, from a business model standpoint, to have a house of cards dimension to it.JW: Yeah. There\u2019s a degree of ephemerality and frailty that we\u2019re not looking at because we\u2019re too busy utilizing it. We\u2019re too busy maximizing it right now. I think that\u2019s real.WM: And the difference between now and before is there\u2019s so much more money to be made from that ephemeral relationship between a consumer or an allegedly critical consumer or a reviewer consumer and the corporate making the products themselves too. There\u2019s just, everything is bigger now.JW: Big social! One of our favorite phrases.WM: Big social!JW: Coming for ya.WM: It\u2019s back.JW: Well, we\u2019ll keep thinking about this, because it\u2019s clearly not going away, and I found it all to be tremendously exciting. I was mostly curious to observe myself get caught up in it, and what that said about me, and also what that says about how social media is ... you know those ants that get infected by spores in the rainforest and then climb up the trees? They go as far as they can and while they\u2019re climbing, the fungus is like, eating their brain, it\u2019s like telling them to go higher and higher, and they get to top, and they explode full of the spores that drift down to the bottom of the rainforest and infect everything else? And then those ants climb back up? You\u2019ve never heard about this?WM: No!JW: Oh, it\u2019s like a cool thing. You should google it. Like zombie ants and mushrooms should bring it up. But I was literally like that ant.WM: You were a zombie ant.JW: I got infected. The virus, you know, I touched infected blood supply, I guess.WM: Well, I guess we should talk about my zombie ant experience now. I have one, and her name is Venus Williams.JW: It sounds so grim. This is so exciting.WM: Well, it is until you think about what you\u2019re really doing. I\u2019m really climbing up a tree waiting to explode.JW: Well, on that cheerful note ... we\u2019ll take a break. We\u2019ll be right back.WM: We\u2019ll be right back.JW: I want to talk to you about the U.S. Open because I like tennis, but you love tennis. You told me that you think Venus Williams is your Billie Jean King. Yeah. The most important \u2014\u2014WM: Yeah. She\u2019s very important, and she\u2019s just about as important as Billie Jean King.JW: And I just want to talk to you about watching her at this point in her career, and you know, she lost the Open, eventually, ultimately, to Sloane. And in the press conference after, I was really moved by what she said when they were like, What\u2019s going to happen next with your career?VW: What do you mean?Reporter: What do you see in your near future?VW: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll continue to play tennis. It\u2019s nothing complicated.JW: She\u2019s amazing.WM: You know, the thing that has been very stressful \u2014 I should say first of all, that in addition to Venus Williams\u2019s being an incredibly important tennis player socially and politically, she fought to get equal prize money for the women at these major tournaments \u2014\u2014JW: Snaps to her.WM: And has been very quietly \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even, outspoken? To know Venus Williams is to know that a word like \u201coutspoken\u201d is not the right word. She has been judicious in her attempt to keep equality between the genders at these tournaments and to make sure that as much attention is paid to the women as to the men. We should say the crucial thing about why we\u2019re talking about her additionally is she\u2019s 37 years old.JW: Which was explained to me is ancient for tennis years. I don\u2019t know how this sport works.WM: She\u2019s the Mummy in tennis. I mean, there\u2019s only been one woman who has played, I mean, I mean, her sister now is close behind her. Serena is almost, I think she\u2019s 35 still. And she\u2019s going to come back to tennis next year after having had this baby a couple weeks ago.JW: And dominate. Completely dominate post \u2014WM: We\u2019ll see. But the exciting thing about Venus Williams now is she has this disease called Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome, which seemed like it was going to derail her career. She might never play again. And she decided to keep playing, and it\u2019s an autoimmune disease that has the power to sap your energy. And so it seemed very much like she would never play again, and if she was going to play, she would just be playing because that\u2019s what she\u2019s always done. And she wouldn\u2019t amount to much in these tournaments, and she would be there just rolling the dice. And for several years, that seemed to be the case. She was losing in the first round, in the second round, in the third round. Wasn\u2019t going very far. And this went on for a long time, and at some point, I think these sports writers were just like, Venus, girl, when are you going to give it up? You\u2019re not winning anything. And then about three years ago, something started to change, and she stopped expiring halfway through a match. You know, the disease, I think she just got control over it. She changed her diet, and she\u2019s figured out how to play great tennis with this disease. And then all of the sudden, she has, she had a really good 2016. She doesn\u2019t play enough tournaments to be at the top of the game just because of the way they factor the points. But basically, she plays enough tennis and if she wins a lot, she\u2019ll be well inside the Top 10. And 2017, she gets to the final of the Australian Open and loses to her sister. Loses somewhat inexplicably in the fourth round of the French Open. She gets to the final of Wimbledon, loses to, to ... Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. And she almost gets to the final of the U.S. Open. For any other player, this an amazing year. For Venus Williams, who is 37 years old and battling this autoimmune disease, it\u2019s extraordinary. And so, you said to me the words that I never want to hear when talking about Venus Williams, which is, I want to talk about the things I\u2019ve learned in watching her lose. And like, I don\u2019t want to talk about her losing at all because it just depresses me. My mood just went south. Yours is up, mine is down. What do you got? What have you learned?JW: The night I saw Venus play at the Open against \u2014\u2014WM: Ugh, the Czech Republic\u2019s Petra Kvitov\u00e1, who \u2014 she and Venus have played some great matches together.JW: I\u2019m going to gesture to you a lot because I don\u2019t know any of the tennis terminology. But you know, she played the first set and she did very well. The second set comes around, Venus is clearly fatigued. You\u2019ve mentioned she has this autoimmune disease, I looked up some of the symptoms. Causes joint pain, it goes extreme feelings of being tired. Um, she was lagging. She was run down. I got so stressed out. She was the lead server or whatever and wasn\u2019t able to get the points?WM: They traded breaks a couple times in that third set.JW: The point was, she wasn\u2019t making contact with the ball as much as she should have been considering her advantage on the court. So, I took the opportunity to relieve myself of that encounter, and I just went out to get my commemorative cup because I was like, I cannot take this tension. I was extraordinarily stressed out. But you know, I was watching from the TVs while I was getting my commemorative cup and then I came back, and you know, she seemed so deliberate. And I watched Kvitov\u00e1 work really hard to beat Venus Williams, and Venus looked unbothered. She looked unflapped, you know.WM: But she always, and she always looks that way. You have no idea whether she\u2019s up or down in a match based on her body language and facial expression.JW: But there was something about the way she came back on the third set. She had a lot more confidence. She had a lot more ... pep in her step, and she just looked like she knew she was going to win. So just, so basically like, as a black woman in America, I am very attuned to how other black women in America move in spaces where they are and have been the only one for the majority of their lives and their careers. I love watching how Venus chooses to operate. I love watching how she tries to be in press conferences, which she doesn\u2019t really take the bait. She answers what she wants to say. You know, she says what she wants to say, she doesn\u2019t respond to the things they try to get out of her about other people. I love watching how Serena moves \u2014 she has so little cares. You know, the cares, I would use another word, but it\u2019ll get bleeped, so I won\u2019t, but she has so few cares about what other people think about her. They\u2019re on back order. We don\u2019t know when the store is going to be back in supply. Serena just lives for herself, and they both take two very different approaches to being these public figures, and I take notes from both of them. And I think what I learned from Venus was that, you know, she was very willing to bide her time. She was very willing to make concessions so that she could ultimately come to victory. I mean, she couldn\u2019t get there in the end, but conservation of energy, conservation of resources. Strategic losing is never, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve ever thought about doing in my life, but watching her do it, I was like, yo, she really knows some things.WM: So you think that \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re not saying she tanked that second set, but \u2014JW: No, I think she was making a decision about what her body could do and what it would mean for the third portion of that.WM: This is fascinating. I never considered this.JW: I mean, I\u2019m speculating. I\u2019m not a mind reader. I don\u2019t have any insight into Venus Williams\u2019s game plan.WM: She has lost a lot of second sets, and I\u2019m not saying \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re not arguing that she\u2019s throwing the second set, because ultimately, she wins a lot of those three set matches. But there is something interesting about like, when she \u2014 we used to call it, like a lot of tennis people call it when a player does this going on a walk. You just go on a walk for part of the match, and the match takes a little longer than you need it to. All great players do it, lesser players do it and lose and never become great because they\u2019re always on a walk. But you know, she is a walker. She can just disappear for a little while during a match. But since she got diagnosed with this disease, I have found that it\u2019s really crucial, and I think she knows it\u2019s crucial, but what was exciting to me is she played a lot of three set matches in this tournament, and \u2014JW: Are they always three sets? I\u2019m sorry, go on.WM: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s the best of three. So, you know, obviously you want to get two sets so you can get off the court. But she played a lot of three sets. It didn\u2019t seem like what happened against Sloane Stephens in that semifinal was the result of being tired. It was the result of Sloane Stephens playing the four best games of tennis she\u2019s ever played in her life.JW: Yeah. She came with a mission.WM: With anybody else, Venus Williams would have won that match. When it was five all, she would have broken, served for the match, she\u2019d be in the final against Madison Keys. I have never seen a player do that to Venus Williams \u2014 get every ball Venus hit, no matter where Venus hit it, in like the most remote back of the court, in the corners, Sloane was there with an amazing shot. It wasn\u2019t just getting a racket on the ball. She was making shots on the dead run, and I\u2019ve never seen anybody play, maybe Serena\u2019s the only other person I\u2019ve seen play Venus quite that way. What happened to Venus in that match was, it wasn\u2019t physical fatigue, it was mental. Like, where on this court can I put this ball so this woman can\u2019t get it? And there was no place she could put it. And I think her will just...Sloane broke her will, like as much as she broke her serve.JW: Fascinating.WM: It was a fascinating match. But I\u2019m curious for you what the difference is between a Venus and a Serena and \u2014 I mean, obviously they\u2019re very different people, but there\u2019s something about the way Venus chooses to kind of be introverted versus Serena\u2019s...obvious extroversion. I mean, Venus isn\u2019t a hermit or anything. She\u2019s more mysterious to me than a lot of other women tennis players, a lot of tennis players in general. It\u2019s like she\u2019s holding onto something and she\u2019s not going to give it to us because it\u2019s hers. And I really respect that.JW: I respect that too. I learn a lot by watching how she moves. I mean, I think I\u2019m more aligned with Serena\u2019s style of approach in terms of how she wants to be in the world, which is you know, she doesn\u2019t want to have to adhere to someone else\u2019s ideas of how she should behave. And I mean, I\u2019ve seen Serena play a few times live, and when people boo her, oh my gosh. Like, I cry. It feels so personal. It feels so personal, because it feels like what they don\u2019t like about her is her unwillingness to be small. And Serena is never going to be small, and Venus isn\u2019t either, I should say \u2014WM: But it\u2019s just a different thing. It\u2019s a different energy.JW: Yeah, she\u2019s just a lot more inward. But at the same time, this is a woman who played, I think, in an outfit that she designed that looked fabulous. She was wearing enormous gold hoops that didn\u2019t slow her down. She did a little twirl at the end when she won. I mean, the look on her face when she won, oh my God. I mean, it\u2019s hard not to feel uplifted by that. It\u2019s hard not to watch her, the extreme physicality of the struggle to win and the struggle of Venus to just be on that court, and you know it means so much to her to arrive on that court every time they do it. I\u2019m not trying to say that I can relate to what they do in life, but on a much different scale, I can. I know what it feels like to arrive in a room where people aren\u2019t really rooting for you or you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re rooting for you, and there\u2019s no one else that looks like you at that table. And if you are arrogant or cocky or you know, you\u2019re not in your place the way people think you should be in your place, you get down voted. I mean, I am intimate with those feelings. So, I love them and I adore them and I love watching them because of what they represent to me. And I think, it was just really um, I just feel like I got a free business seminar from Venus. Like I want to Venmo her five bucks \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she needs it, but you know what I mean. I feel like I just got a free course, like a free business lesson.WM: What I learned watching her play in this tournament was that there\u2019s no limit to how long she can do it. As long as she\u2019s getting to finals and losing only to like her sister and to players who are inspired in a slightly different way than she is, I think the thing, the amazing thing about her is she is redefining what \u201cold\u201d is.JW: Yes!WM: She\u2019s old, she\u2019s not old in real life. She\u2019s trying to prove that she\u2019s not even old in her sport. Like, there are so many players in tennis right now who are doing well over the age of 30, including Roger Federer. So, I think that she sits down and spends the next couple of months thinking about how she can have an even better 2018 than she had in 2017.JW: I love it. Me too.WM: I mean, I think she thinks she...she was crushed by losing to Sloane Stephens because she could have won the whole tournament. And she was two points away from getting to the final.JW: She\u2019s not done.WM: I feel bad for Serena, because I think when Serena comes back...JW: 2018! It\u2019s going to be a good year.WM: Venus is going to want to beat everybody.JW: Oh my God. Well, we need these lighthouses. These are dark times, so you know, if these are the things, these are the ports that get me through the storm, like I\u2019m here for it, so.WM: Well, what was interesting to me about this particular U.S. Open is that the four semifinalists were American, and three of those four women were black.JW: I didn\u2019t realize that.WM: Yeah. Madison Keys, Sloane Stephens, and Venus Williams, all black women. And I think that Venus and Serena faced a lot of skepticism when they started playing because nobody...I mean, Althea Gibson is pretty much, Althea Gibson, Gloria McNeil, Zina Garrison. There weren\u2019t a lot of black women playing this sport, and nobody had ever played it the way these two would. And Venus and Serena...they changed the sport, and a lot of people wanted to hold onto the old ways of thinking about how tennis was played.JW: And the types of people that played tennis.WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was one of those people. I mean, she was their chief rival for a long time, and she played a tactical game. And what Venus and Serena did was put an emphasis on power before tactics. And it sort of got into this, what for me was a really racist mentality in terms of how they talk about Venus and Serena. They were physical. They were tough. They were...they were dominating.JW: They talked a lot about their body shape and their body size.WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was always smart.JW: These very coded words that signify threatening.WM: She knows how to construct a point and Venus just hits the ball like a crazy person. That\u2019s how people used to talk about them, anyway.JW: Well, they still do though, because Maria Sharapova put out a new memoir called Unstoppable \u2014WM: Wait. Excuse me. First of all, Unstoppable, Maria Sharapova?JW: She\u2019s been stopped.WM: Uh, what\u2019s your, what\u2019s your win/loss record with Serena Williams? Can I find that for you? Because uh, Unstoppable? You have been stopped.JW: She writes in the book, you know, Serena\u2019s physical presence is much stronger and bigger than you realize watching on TV. She has thick arms and thick legs and is so intimidating and strong. This is via a Buzzfeed article. But yeah. So she\u2019s still talking about her like she\u2019s a...you know, not human, like a super human human. It\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s crazy.WM: Come on. Really? I mean, it\u2019s bad enough being a woman athlete who doesn\u2019t look like what you think an athlete should look like, or looking too much like \u2014JW: Just a woman in the spotlight, people feel like they can...WM: But to have a Maria Sharapova say this about...I mean, look. She and Serena have their issues with each other, but that\u2019s disappointing. And unsurprising at the same time. That\u2019s why she beat you 16 times in a row. Anyway, go on.JW: From your perspective, looking at where both the Williams sisters are at in their careers, I am really curious to hear what you think tennis would look like without either of the Williams sisters and if they\u2019ve dominated it for so long...as long as I can remember being conscious and aware and thinking about tennis as a sport, it\u2019s only been since they\u2019ve been involved.WM: Well, somebody would have figured a way to play this way, maybe. Somebody would have figured out that serving hard and fast and unreturnably is really important. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like Martina Navratilova had a weak serve. She had the hardest \u2014 Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati had like enormous serves. But there was something about, for instance, Serena\u2019s ability to disguise her toss. You never know where she\u2019s going to hit it. I mean, they just changed a lot of the way tennis should be played by women, and now there\u2019s another conversation happening in their wake about how bad serving is in the women\u2019s game and how it could just be better than it is. And it should be a priority. But sexism \u2014 once again, women get taught how to return, not how to serve. Whereas men get taught to serve and not return. Men, I mean, historically have been pretty great returners, but women are, the reason so many serves get broken in women\u2019s tennis is not just because the serve is weak, but they\u2019re really great returners by and large, statistically. I definitely know that if the Williams sisters don\u2019t show up, you know, your Martina Hingises and Lindsay Davenports are going to a lot more finals and winning more than three and five majors, five and three majors a piece.JW: See you at the Open next year, Wes. I\u2019ll see you. Maybe we can actually go together.WM: Maybe. That\u2019s our show, everybody.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

This year Google Scholar shows about a thousand academic articles using the term, twice the number from 2016.But as the popularity of the words grows, so does the debate over their value. Some critics reject Latinx and Chicanx for being foreign to the Spanish language, off-putting to the public or simply unnecessary.\u201cAs a writer, I feel like these words are so clumsy and artificial.

{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201dThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalans Camp at Voting Sites as Independence Confrontation Looms", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARCELONA \u2014 A confrontation in Catalonia drew closer on Saturday, as people camped out in scores of polling stations throughout the region, intent on keeping them open for Sunday\u2019s referendum in defiance of the Spanish government\u2019s orders.In the polling stations, mostly public school buildings, there was a festive atmosphere, with crowds of people singing protest songs, playing board games, taking dance classes, playing table tennis and otherwise passing the time until 6 a.m. on Sunday, the deadline set by the police to evacuate the buildings.It remained unclear how many polling stations will open. Spain said on Saturday that only 163 voting sites were occupied, far below the 2,315 stations that Catalonian officials had promised. And no one knows what the police will do if, on Sunday morning, the people inside refuse to leave.\u201cThe history of my country is going to be decided in the next few hours, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be staying at home in bed and watch it on TV,\u201d said Eduard El\u00edas, 50, a computer science engineer at a school in the Raval neighborhood of Barcelona, adding that he would leave only if the confrontation became violent.\u201cImagine you would have been offered the chance to fight alongside George Washington,\u201d Mr. El\u00edas said. \u201cAt that time, revolution meant weapons and war, but we\u2019re now in the 21st century and we will have our paper ballots instead to bring about real change.\u201dThe government of Catalonia, an autonomous region in northeast Spain, this month approved laws to hold the referendum, which it said would be binding. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has warned that the vote violates the Constitution and that Spain will use all possible means to stop it.But a large number of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents are likely to ignore that warning, presenting Mr. Rajoy with the uncomfortable choice between using security forces to clear large crowds, or allowing the vote to take place and thereby acknowledging that the nation\u2019s government in Madrid was unable to control events. Among the central players on Sunday will be Catalonia\u2019s regional police, who number 17,000, and who have signaled reluctance to use force on citizens who go to vote.Police on Saturday entered the Catalonian regional government\u2019s telecommunications and information technology center after a court on Friday ordered them to stop electronic voting.

On Wednesday, the companies said they had struck a partnership to develop and test autonomous vehicle designs and technology, with the aim of putting Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles on Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing network in the future. As part of the agreement, the companies plan to focus on issues such as software design, customer experience and user interfaces.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on partnering with the auto industry because frankly, we think we can\u2019t do this alone and need each other to be successful,\u201d said Raj Kapoor, Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do tests with one or two cars.

But it needed photos, too.Now a salesman in Brazil has stepped forward to say that his own family photos were stolen to concoct the profile of \u201cMelvin Redick,\u201d one of many American impostors involved in the spread of Russian propaganda on Facebook and Twitter.The supposed Mr. Redick was an early promoter last year of a website, DCLeaks.com, that American officials believe was created by Russian military intelligence. But The Times could find no American who fit the details he provided on Facebook.There was no such person in Harrisburg, Pa., where Mr. Redick said he lived. The high school and college he listed had never heard of him. And when The Times asked Facebook about him \u2014 as well as other profiles that appeared to be the work of Russians \u2014 the company concluded that they were impostors and removed them from the social network.The Times article noted that one of the Redick photos showed him sitting in a bar in Brazil. In another, a bedroom seemed to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. G1, the online news operation of Globo, Brazil\u2019s biggest media conglomerate, noticed the puzzle and crowdsourced it, asking readers for help.A reader spotted the photos and recognized her son-in-law, Charles David Costacurta, 36, of the city Jundia\u00ed in southeastern Brazil. Mr. Costacurta was suspicious at first, said Carlos Dias, a G1 reporter, but eventually agreed to meet at a television station.\u201cI was scared, and I asked my girlfriend to take a look because I do not understand much about social networks and the internet,\u201d Mr. Costacurta said.Before publishing the photos, The Times tried to find their source using Google\u2019s image search function, but nothing turned up. This suggested that they might belong to a Brazilian Facebook user because Facebook blocks image searches of its profiles. The company declined to say whether it had searched internally and found the photos before Mr. Costacurta came forward.For Mr. Costacurta, his cameo role in Russia\u2019s information war appeared to be a harsh lesson in the fragile nature of privacy in an age of social media.\u201cWe\u2019re totally vulnerable,\u201d he told G1. \u201cYou wonder how much security you have, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hunting for the \u2018Promised Land,\u2019 Haunted by Chuck Berry", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "Road TripThe musician\u2019s 1964 hit chronicles the African-American experience in the 20th century. We followed Mr. Berry\u2019s lyrical route to see what had changed.Supported byChuck Berry\u2019s 1964 classic \u201cPromised Land\u201d is all about motion. The opening guitar riff is a big and fast thing taking off, a bus leaving the station, a jet rising from the tarmac. The poor boy, our narrator, is endlessly rollin\u2019 and ridin\u2019, straddling that Greyhound, smoking into New Orleans, swinging low chariot, coming down easy.And it is a motion designed to pull yourself out of trouble: \u201cEach verse seems to have something happen, or lose something,\u201d the Texas rocker Joe Ely told me, \u201cbut always, at the end of the next verse, it rises up like a phoenix.\u201dWhen Mr. Berry died at age 90 in March, I wondered what it would be like to experience this rising-up approach to travel in 2017, following the lyrics\u2019 itinerary through the South. I love \u201cPromised Land\u201d because it\u2019s not just about one Johnny B. Goode, but all of them, Americans everywhere on a shared spiritual journey, hitting the road when they\u2019re feeling stuck, experiencing all the cathartic guitar solos, trying to outrace their inevitable second thoughts.\u201cIf you wanted to paint a picture of that era,\u201d Mr. Ely observed, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t even have to lift a brush, you could just pick up a guitar and play that song.\u201d In just two minutes and 23 seconds, Mr. Berry establishes a whooshing vision of the American dream, as the poor boy leaves his home in Norfolk, Va., and takes buses, trains and jets to Los Angeles to make it in (presumably) the music business, briefly taking note of the civil rights unrest of the time.My 15-year-old daughter, Rose, and I wanted to see how Mr. Berry\u2019s elaborate pathway to the American dream had changed in this era of mass airline travel and Google Maps. In some ways, we slowed way, way down, watching the South unfold in a blur outside bus and train windows, with long stretches of mesmerizing nothingness.But we also approximated the frantic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll motion of \u201cPromised Land,\u201d spending roughly 24 hours apiece in six of the eight cities the poor boy visits in the song: Norfolk; Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C.; Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; and Houston. We indulged ourselves with two nights each in New Orleans and Los Angeles. Yesterday, the Wheel of Excellence, high over Atlanta; tomorrow, a killer Bourbon Street brass band.We snapped into our vagabond lifestyle with the first city mentioned in the song, Norfolk, taking a midnight Uber from the airport, blathering about \u201cPromised Land\u201d to the driver, an older man who used to spend time at rock concerts but recently shifted to jazz. \u201cWell, Chuck\u2019s gone,\u201d he lamented.Across North Rampart Street is the laundromat that once housed Cosimo Matassa\u2019s famous recording studio, where Fats Domino, Little Richard, Ray Charles and just about every talented musician in New Orleans recorded R&B hits from 1945 to 1956. We encountered a zillion local brass bands, including one of schoolkids going crazy on saxes and tubas at Peters Street and Ursulines Avenue.By the time we left New Orleans the next day, Rose and I were afflicted with blisters and exhausted, but we were delighted to find the morning Amtrak to Houston to be our most luxurious transportation yet. This train had not just a snack counter but a bona fide, reservations-required dining car (O.K., we ate our own Subway sandwiches) and a viewing car to watch the scenery from overhead windows.Finally it was time for our jet to the Promised Land. Several who\u2019d followed our trip on social media were adamant that I eat \u201ca T-bone steak a la cartee\u201d on the flight, like the poor boy does, but I haven\u2019t had red meat since 1994 and the closest thing Spirit Airlines provided to a steak was a $4 snack box of popcorn and a cup of noodles. I asked a flight attendant if the pilot could announce when we were \u201chigh over Albuquerque,\u201d as Mr. Berry sings, but she said he was too busy. It didn\u2019t matter \u2014 soon we were on the ground, trying to figure out which part of Mr. Berry\u2019s \u201cheadin\u2019 to the terminal gate, swing low chariot, taxi to the terminal zone, cut your engines, cool your wings\u201d applied as we approached LAX. Whether Los Angeles was the Promised Land, it was certainly milder.Unlike the smaller cities in the South, Los Angeles was impossible to fully explore in just a day and a half, so we followed the tourists to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I did a Google search the location of Chuck Berry\u2019s star and we dutifully took selfies. Few rockers have risen up as meteorically as Mr. Berry \u2014 his father worked in a Baden, Mo., flour mill with barely enough money to raise his family, and the singer painstakingly built his music career by crisscrossing the United States, overcoming prejudice and segregation.Steve Knopper is a Denver-based contributing editor for Rolling Stone and the author of \u201cMJ: The Genius of Michael Jackson.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical ShopperA couple of months ago, I was idly flitting a night away on the internet when it occurred to me that I should open up Twitter and tweet something that \u2014 in my heart, in that moment \u2014 was unassailably true:Bally >>> GucciNo good story begins with a tweet \u2014 or, good lord, an abandoned one \u2014 but bear with me. By that point, Gucci fetishism had become parodic and comical. Alessandro Michele\u2019s rebrand had infused the company with flamboyance, joie de vivre, whimsy and sass, but looking at some outfits suggested Ed Hardy\u2019s sophisticated older cousin, \u00c9douard.Bally, by contrast, is buttoned-up, quiet, peacockish only in its deep inner core. It has been that way for years. Thanks to hip-hop, Bally was one of the first brands I coveted in the 1980s. There\u2019s a guy I follow on Instagram who sells vintage sneakers and last year posted several gorgeous dead-stock pairs but, agonizingly, none in my size.Whether Bally is indeed >>> Gucci, of course, is up for debate. It\u2019s also the sort of proclamation that makes a certain stripe of the social media ecosystem furrow its brow. Twitter encourages petty rumbles and deadens genuine dissent. Principled disagreement is so easily mistaken for provocation that it becomes easier, if you\u2019re not inclined to howl, to not even bother whispering.A new Bally flagship store opened at the beginning of the summer, however, providing an opportunity to assess the company anew by applying the rigorous science of shopping.From the start, it should be acknowledged that the matchup is imprecise: Gucci is a full-service house, and Bally, which began life as a shoe manufacturer in the 1850s, still focuses on accessories. \u201cAt Bally it\u2019s like the clothes are the accessories to the accessories,\u201d Mr. Coppola said in an interview in 2014, the year he got the job.Indeed, at the store, approximately 30 items of men\u2019s clothing were on display \u2014 that\u2019s it. Some erotic outerwear, like the red velvet trucker jacket with a belt at the waist (a mere $2,795), or the black leather coach jacket with travel-theme green lining (*cough* $2,495).Both were lovely to the touch and on the body. Neither was practical. More reasonable was a purple polo shirt with black and white trim ($310), with the B logo slanted at an angle so that if you squinted, you might see the tilted P of Palace Skateboards. (It was regal. I bought it.)The women\u2019s side wasn\u2019t much different. The emphasis on scarves and purses and shoes was overwhelming, but also logical. I saw a sharp pair of soft-backed striped patent leather loafers ($675) that I recognized because Eva Chen had worn them on Instagram a few days earlier. (I\u2019m not ashamed.)It\u2019s important to remember that Bally is Swiss, not Italian, or French, or British: Restraint is its m\u00e9tier, and any place in the store where it veered from that is where it suffered. I\u2019ve long admired the company\u2019s sneakers. One of my rare shopping regrets is not buying a pair of 1980s too-snug-but-what-the-hell navy low-top sneakers from the old Flight Club on Greene Street \u2014 and its basic high-top, with a crimson and beige stripe pattern, was smartly elegant ($495).But when it strayed too far from purpose \u2014 I saw second- or thirdhand ideas from Valentino, Prada, Nike and, grotesquely, Giuseppe Zanotti \u2014 the charm faded.In general, less is more here. Even when embellishment is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of a certain piece, it\u2019s done minimally. A few wallets were printed with illustrations from old company posters of a dapper half-man, half-shoe hybrid ($395 to $725). A set of leather goods was embroidered with a low-key space desert theme. By the women\u2019s wallets were a set of luxe stickers ($50) designed to be applied to purses and wallets. I liked the pink heart shot through with a lightning bolt.Overall, though, the energy of the store was in its refusal. Unlike other Madison Avenue flagships, it is modest, quietly certain of itself. The nods to flash in the clothing are slight, like the perma-popped collar on the windbreakers ($750). In places, Bally is still determining how far to let the pendulum swing: The in-store journal had an article about the intersection of casinos and style (sure) and one on the Guardian Angels (ummmmm).Certainly, a tasteful and strategic alliance with a celebrity \u2014 say, ASAP Rocky, who would understand the brand\u2019s secret cool history \u2014 might amplify the work the brand is doing in what is, for the luxury world, relative anonymity. But I admire its stoic reserve, holding firm as the surrounding conversation escalates into a meaningless din.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "iPhones, Jemele Hill, Food Memories and Teenage Tattoos: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationAny teenager from anywhere in the world is welcome to participate, anytime until next Thursday.I love flavors that have some life to them. Flavors as interesting as they are high in calories. Ginger-lime. Praline. Raspberry. Coconut with chunks of fresh mango. They are scrumptious! But flavors, like relationships, don\u2019t matter if you start with a bad base.Food scientist Dr. Kanti Parekh gets this. Kwality arrived in India in the 1950s, serving up indulgent, creamy treats. In fact, Dr. Parekh created many of their wildly popular flavors. Intense. Made for Indian taste buds. Seated on a rich base of milk and butterfat. Lots of it. A total success. Then, in 1995, Unilever bought the brand. They cut costs. They changed the base. Watered it down. Sweetened it up. Betrayed their relationship. They cut their flavorist.Like the unraveling of a relationship when it\u2019s clear there\u2019s little below the glittering surface, customers moved away. Dr. Parekh landed in New Jersey. Soon, he opened his own ice cream parlor. And lucky for us, Kwality was born anew, even richer \u2014 with a base as creamy and solid and vibrant as its flavors of fresh glowing mango and butterscotch. Successful and delicious. Yes, I love flavors with life. And like a solid friendship, these flavors work because they sit atop a base of quality._________iPhones have altered my life for the better; they put everything I need for everyday life right into the palm of my hand. An average day without an iPhone would be hectic at best, as many people don\u2019t even know how to use many of the objects that the iPhone has replaced.A little over 100 years ago, the longest distance you could call someone was 3,600 miles. That is just from New York to California. Now, iPhones make it so that you can FaceTime someone across the entire world in seconds, with just a few taps on your phone screen.I think I would be a more talented, and more thoughtful, person if I did not have a phone ... I would prefer if they did not exist. Life might be more difficult in some senses, but the whole realm of friendship and romantic relationships would be totally different. And I believe kids would get their homework done more often and have overall better grades. I think that smartphones have also created a more depressed society. We are lonelier because we spend more time by ourselves on our phones.I honestly am not sure I could go a whole day without my phone. I am brainwashed by it. My parents say all the time that back in their day they didn\u2019t have phones. They had to communicate to each other, pull out actual maps, and figure out answers on their own!Sometimes, I do wish we could wake up at least one day without any iPhones or smartphones, so that people, especially pre-teens like me, could enjoy one day without using our phones on the table. Maybe just enjoy family._________At its core, I think this is an issue of the extent to which an individual belongs to themselves. By that I mean that we are dealing with two Jemele Hills: Jemele Hill, the person, and Jemele Hill, the ESPN host. It\u2019s the same distinction we make with most public figures. Jemele Hill, off the air and on Twitter, is most definitely acting as her own person. It would be different if she made these comments on the air, where she is operating under ESPN and broadcasting through them, but on Twitter she exists outside of this framework, and so I don\u2019t think that ESPN has any real right (regardless of the law of the land) to discipline her for her words. To box Jemele Hill up and forbid her to have opinions outside of sports denies her free agency as an American, a woman, and an African-American. She isn\u2019t just a sports commentator, she is an African-American in the public eye, and most definitely feels that she has a duty to represent her own concerns as well as the concerns of the African-American community.Besides, when you have a president that takes to Twitter to air his personal grievances and launch authoritarian-style attacks on private companies, can we really bring Ms. Hill\u2019s tweets into question?The president and his staff ought be more concerned about why she made these comments, because she surely isn\u2019t the only person thinking this way. Silencing voices may be faster than addressing the issues raising those voices, but it does a lot less for us as a society.Sports journalists have every right to bring up political issues in the realm of sports. The average sports anchor could take all day, even all week, discussing the Colin Kaepernick controversy, Jerry Sandusky, domestic violence issues in the N.F.L., drug usage with players, and a myriad other technically \u201cpolitical\u201d stories pertaining to sports.However, Jemele Hill crossed the line last week with the words she chose about the President, and she should know it. It was not just one hiccup of a tweet, but an entire string of unprofessional and reckless comments made on a Twitter account that reflects directly back onto ESPN. Even though the tweets were from her personal account, everyone knows Jemele Hill as the SportsCenter anchor, and she should not have put the ESPN in that position, especially after much ongoing conflict with the reputation of ESPN being seen as too political and leftist nowadays. Of course, many can argue that President Trump tweets the same type of careless and aggressive content. However, Hill purely stooped to his level and acted on her feelings in an unproductive and impulsive way. Don\u2019t like the president? Think he\u2019s a white supremacist? Call your state representatives and other political influences in your area instead of putting your corporation in a bad light.One of the most politically divisive questions of our day is whether or not professionals in the sports industry have any place in the diffusion of political thought and protest. In a nation with democratic principles and a governing document that explicitly protects the right to free speech, the answer is simple: Yes, but not without consequences. When Hill tweeted about the president, she accepted many risks, including criticism from the public and a response from her employer... Speech is legally protected, but it is not guaranteed freedom from backlash.I have been a sports junkie for as long as I can remember. As I have gotten older, I have started becoming more interested in the political world as well. However, I think the two should remain separate. Politics are a very sensitive topic for all of us and for a lot of people, sports is an escape from that and all of the crazy things that are going on in the world right now. Personally when I\u2019m watching SportsCenter and I see something regarding Colin Kaepernick and the N.F.L. protests, I change the channel.The notion that sports figures shouldn\u2019t be allowed to talk about politics is one that does not make sense to me. Political figures are allowed to talk about sports, even though in the end they are just a cultural function of our society. Politics is about people. Politics is about REAL life in a certain sense of the word. At the end of one game the world doesn\u2019t change in the same way that when a bill is passed into law, or the stroke of a presidential pen meets paper. Political decisions, actions, and choices that are made have a real substantial effect on the country as a whole.A personal opinion on whether Ms. Hill\u2019s actions were a fireable offense is irrelevant. This is a matter of policy. Does ESPN have strict social media rules for its employees? Did Ms. Hill\u2019s tweets break those rules? If yes, then fire her; if no, don\u2019t.It is difficult to back up Trump\u2019s disappointed comments about Hill\u2019s tweets when he posted similarly spiteful ones toward Obama while he hosted \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A principle still stands even when correct action is occasionally not taken. Was Trump\u2019s tweet about Obama in October 2012 a fireable offense? Yes. Are Ms. Hill\u2019s tweets a fireable offense? Yes. Were either fired? No.I believe ESPN is handling this situation very hypocritically and, as a result, deserves all the blowback they are getting from outlets such as Fox News. The company made no hesitation to fire Colin Cowherd and Curt Schilling when they made provocative comments from the other side of the political spectrum. I do not believe the company \u201cempowers (their) hosts to be provocative,\u201d because they do not \u2014 they empower their hosts to express left-wing, progressive opinions. If this company truly did empower free expression, Cowherd and Schilling would still be employed by ESPN.This is why Democrats continue to lose elections. This is also why most of America doesn\u2019t take \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d seriously. Jemele Hill \u2014 like many of her friends \u2014 is quick to insinuate racism or \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d against those with whom she disagrees. Hill\u2019s rhetoric might go over well in the bluest of blue communities. However, this insinuation is extremely offensive. I would argue that being called a \u201cracist\u201d is as vile and offensive as being labeled a \u201cpedophile,\u201d \u201cwife-beater\u201d or, of course, that vile \u201cn\u201d word. Yet, Hill and other celebrities throw such offensive rhetoric and accusations around with reckless abandon. The goal of organizations like BLM is supposedly respect and equality. How do you gain respect when you disrespect the flag, the national anthem or the President of the United States? I wasn\u2019t a fan of President Obama\u2019s policies. In fact, I found some of them to be terrible. Yes, he was still my president. The same is true with President Trump.If employers are allowed to sanction employees who make comments on their personal time and through their personal means and on issues unrelated to their employment, no one with a job will be able to express themselves at all. Heck, they couldn\u2019t even write a comment on a N.Y. Times article like I\u2019m doing right now._________I\u2019m an Irish-American dual citizen born in Singapore and raised abroad, so \u2018home\u2019 used to be a difficult concept for me. Not anymore. Home is a gas-station raspberry Popsicle, plucked from the freezer of a Shell gas station in Muscat, Oman. Home is also three years later, eating a raspberry wine-gummy in the back of a four-door Sedan driving through Adelaide, Australia. And again, four years later, five years later, last week, home is eating anything with artificial raspberry flavouring. Whenever I touch the stuff, I\u2019m brought back to my first home, Oman, and every time I\u2019ve felt at home since then.... If anything, I try to avoid sullying the memories I attach to the food by avoiding eating it too frequently. I fear that somehow I\u2019ll dilute the feeling raspberry flavours bring. It\u2019s the only food I feel anything for. There is no food I shy away from, nor is there any food I reach for. Just one flavour, artificial as it may be, that makes me feel at home.For me I drink a 20-ounce Cherry Coke out of a plastic bottle, it takes me back to when I was at preschool one day, and my best friend/cousin was getting picked up early, and I was upset because I did not want him to leave, and then his dad called my mom and she said that he could take me home, because we were neighbors. After that we went to a little store, because it was a long ride, and we all got a Cherry Coke ... My question is, why is it that the Coke connects me to that memory? Why does something so small, that\u2019s not super relevant to the story, make me remember the story better?Have you ever eaten too much? Have you ever felt that you can\u2019t walk because you ate a lot of food? Five years ago when I was 13 years old, I went to a neighbor\u2019s dinner in my home country. Every year at Christmas in my neighborhood we make this dinner to share and have a nice time with all our neighbors. The dinner is always full of love, hope, neighborliness, and a lot of food.The food was so good that night and I hadn\u2019t eaten the whole day ... That night I was in the front of the house receiving all the people who were coming to the dinner and taking them to the backyard. It was a big and beautiful backyard. When I was done with my work I sat at my table and started eating the food which was so good and tasty. I couldn\u2019t stop eating so at the end of the night I couldn\u2019t get up from my seat. I have never eaten like that since that night. I miss my people.I remember the time back in my country when I use to visit my grandma she always used to make a special pickle, we call it \u201cboroi achar.\u201d This was the best pickle for me in the whole wide world. My grandma was very lovely, she always loved me so much. Sometimes I used to eat too much and hide under the bed then she\u2019d hide the pickle from me, and I would go look for it and steal it. Then she would come run after me and yell \u201cyou\u2019re going to have bad stomach day.\u201dAfter coming to America two years later my Grandma passed away, and that was the saddest day of my life ... Whenever I go back to Bangladesh it brings back all the memories._________To me, being an American means that, whether or not you were born in this country, whether or not you are part of the 1% or the 99%, no matter what race you are, what gender you are, or whether or not your ancestors came here in the 17th Century or the 21st or at any time in between, being an American means that you faithfully adhere to the ideals of the United States. Namely, that all people are created equal, that we all have freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to speak truth to power, freedom of religion, freedom to vote according to our consciences, freedom to resist tyranny and oppression and all of the other freedoms enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.How would I define the values of an American? I believe to be an American you have to be born and raised in America, and throughout your life you have to obey the laws and respect the government\u2019s decisions.To be an American you have to take pride in your country, you can\u2019t be ashamed. An American has to be willing to announce that you are a citizen in the U.S. who follows the countries requirements.America and the citizens who live within the country are known to be independent. We are known to solve conflicts ourselves without assists of others.America is looked up to among other countries, this is because we are not in poverty, we have law in order, and we have citizens who respect each others\u2019 differences.We are a united country, and we hope to spread that unity around the world.Reading this did change my initial answer I gave to the question of what American values mean to me. I thought of them more individually as opposed to them being suggested as more global. American values to me means being united as a country. It means standing up for what we believe isn\u2019t right. It means coming to agreement on decisions that could have big impacts._________As medical students, we are entrusted to advocate for our patients\u2019 health from the first day of school. And yet, after stepping out of a lecture to listen to Ms. DeVos\u2019s speech, I rejoined my peers wondering who is tasked with ensuring I can safeguard my own health on campus. Ms. DeVos\u2019s focus is not on protecting me or my classmates.With changes ahead, I will work to ask my school to maintain its commitment to both complainants and respondents, as has been done successfully at some but not all schools under current policies. I will continue to read comments of those in favor of and opposed to D.O.E. decisions as I try to understand why the narrative of this conversation is changing. This prompt asks which of the NYT\u2019s political writers opinions strikes a chord; the collective silencing of survivors\u2019 voices in reporting from nearly every major paper including the NYT has left a ringing in my ears I am still working to quiet.As I try to become the best physician I can, I place some degree of my own well being in my institution\u2019s hands by becoming a student. My school is helping me build a framework to deliver trusting and compassionate care to patients. When the 2011 DCL guidelines fall, I will ask my school to use this framework in deciding where they stand on sexual assault. Student activists across the US are preparing for this fight; I know we are ready to work to protect each other regardless of what lies ahead.As someone who has personally experienced sexual assault, I think that there should be justice. However, I completely understand false accusations and believe that both sides deserve some form of legal support. Regardless of what new rules are set in place to \u201cprotect\u201d students, sexual assault will still continue to happen. Whether or not it is reported is the question.Individuals who come out about sexual violence experience outrageous amounts of disrespect and victim-shaming. These changes could keep more victims from coming out about their experiences for fear that what happened to them would not respected. There are very few cases of lying and false accusations of sexual violence, so there needs to be an encouraging environment that what happened will be heard.While DeVos has good intentions of keeping innocent people from being convicted of sexual assault or rape, it needs to be kept in mind that this must be dealt with in an extremely careful manner. This issue should not be an issue dealt with exclusively by schools and their guidelines but by a proper process by law. Only after the accused are proven guilty should their privileges be revoked. That being said, guilty offenders should not receive any privileges from their schools, now matter their skill level in sports, academics, or any extra curricular activities. Also, as well as making sure defendants receive the correct representation, DeVos needs to keep in mind the fragile state a victim will be in and how unlikely it is for women to come forward if they\u2019re less likely to get justice ... If DeVos gives more support to either side, she is not interested in keeping campuses and students a safe place for education._________First thing to consider before piercing your tongue is that it is lifelong, and second is that it can cause the worst halitosis (bad breath) possible. The third consideration is that relative to other body parts, the tongue will not \u2018regenerate\u2019 and the hole will be there until death. Fourth thing to consider is that the body was not born with a hole in the tongue, so why would you change that, as an existential question. Lastly, for now, consider what may happen to the money spent if you just saved it rather than spent it on a painful experience \u2014 oh wait! For real, lastly, consider the pain involved! That makes seven things to consider.Lazuli, no. A quick Google search reveals that tongue piercings heal remarkably quickly and are not permanent. \u201cThe body was not born with a hole in the tongue, so why change that\u201d \u2014 Why do you get a haircut? Why do we wear clothes? Why do we disconnect umbilical cords? C\u2019mon, now. What if we saved the money and spared ourselves the painful experience? I ask myself the same thing when I go to the dentist. Obviously the receiver of the piercing considers it worth the pain. If they don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t really matter, because that means they\u2019ve already been impaled by a needle and it\u2019s too late to go back. Childbirth, on the other hand, drags on! Consider that pain! Why do people have babies? Like most things: different strokes for different folks._________Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Readers React: Redemption, Then Rejection From Harvard", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany Times readers debated Harvard University\u2019s decision to rescind its acceptance of Michelle Jones, who was recently released from prison, as a Ph.D. student.Ms. Jones had served 20 years for the murder of her 4-year-old son, and had initially been accepted to Harvard based on her scholarship behind bars. However, top leadership at Harvard revoked the offer after some faculty members questioned whether her application had minimized her crime \u201cto the point of misrepresentation.\u201dComments have been edited for length and clarity.\u201cBut frankly, we knew that anyone could just punch her crime into Google, and Fox News would probably say that P.C. liberal Harvard gave 200 grand of funding to a child murderer, who also happened to be a minority. I mean, c\u2019mon.\u201dSo they opposed her because of possible bad press from Fox? I would consider any attack from Fox a compliment. I mean, c\u2019mon.The comment by a Harvard professor that the admissions committee was \u201cworried/concerned\u201d about her adjustment in an elite institution is so incredibly patronizing and exclusionary that it shocks me that it was actually said on record. The applicant survived prison and found a new path \u2014 let her decide what is right for her.I have no qualms at all with Harvard\u2019s decision. I do, however, take exception to the comments that castigate Harvard for its decision and suggest that this woman is entitled to be admitted there. She is entitled to no such thing in my opinion. Abusing and killing a young child is not washed away by 20 years in prison; it is, and rightly should be, a burden carried for life. If I have two equally qualified candidates, I\u2019m choosing the one that has demonstrated the higher moral code.I think the question that Ms. Jones hasn\u2019t answered is exactly how she murdered and buried her child. Until she faces that, I find it very hard to see how she can be redeemed. The criminal justice system will never be perfect, and the length of \u201ctime served,\u201d whether too much or too little, has nothing to do with fundamental humanity. Whatever the circumstances that led to murdering her 4-year-old child (and it certainly seems she was a victim of terrible circumstances), they should not be papered over. She murdered her son. Getting past that requires full disclosure.Upon reading this article, I was upset that Harvard would reject Michelle. Then, I looked up her appeal and read it thoroughly \u2014 it turned my stomach. The fact that she attempted to have her conviction appealed, using what I think is twisted reasoning, speaks volumes about her sense of responsibility for her brutal treatment of her son and his resultant death. While none of us can truly read the heart of another, I have doubts about how sincere this brilliant woman\u2019s remorse is.An extraordinary woman and scholar, deeply deserving of this chance \u2014 if only she would acknowledge the stunning gravity and cruelty of her youthful offense. Without that acknowledgment, a disturbing piece is missing. One wonders whether her own heartbreaking history of abuse, and the simple need for physical and psychic survival, has blunted her insight or capacity for remorse and empathy. I wish her well.Skimmed her paper (co-authored with Lori Record) \u2014 it is extremely solid work. Normally (even as a product of the Ivy League) I take great glee in making fun of all things loopy-whack-a-doodle PC that are epidemic in the Ivies right now. Colleges now truly deserve every bit of ridicule they get for the utter collapse of common sense. This is not one of those cases. Harvard should not have rescinded admission in this case.I think it\u2019s Harvard\u2019s loss.Strong women like this strike fear in the hearts of others who can\u2019t imagine coping with so much in 45 years of life. Many will never comprehend dealing with something so horrendous, grieving personally every day, and yet still being productive.What does society expect from prisoners? What does society expect them to do when they are no longer prisoners? She was punished for her crime. She served her time and is now entitled to live her life in society. Don\u2019t we all want to see criminals rehabilitated? Instead of accomplishing nothing and sucking up our tax dollars doing nothing for their entire sentence and then winding up back in prison. How many ex-convicts have accomplished what she has?So many prisoners languish inside prison for a set term and then are dumped on the street with $40 and a bus ticket. Ms. Jones is exceptional and should be held as an example of what can be achieved. Society should at the very least honor the commitment that once a sentence is served, society is obligated to make every effort to support prisoners with opportunities for work, education, and mental health services.Are we willing and able to forgive? Do we see merit in forgiveness? How much is too much to be forgiven for? In this case, we are talking about an individual who committed a horrendous crime who has been punished according to the rule of law; there are many examples in which we could ask these questions of institutions, nations, etc. Forgiveness is a term often reserved for religion but perhaps we need to bring it into the public sphere. If we can\u2019t forgive, what is the point of trying to rehabilitate?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Lived Through a Flood. Now We Have a Very Long To-Do List.", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatchBELLAIRE, Tex. \u2014 All I could do was reach for the towels.With the deluge of Hurricane Harvey approaching my house in persistent waves, rising through our bushes and up our brick walls, there was nothing else to do. My wife, Paola, laughed at me, knowing all too well that rolling towels against windows as the water breached our refuge was like grabbing Band-Aids to care for a gushing bullet wound. Within an hour, there was a foot of contaminated water across the first floor of our house, making it smell like a swamp.Now, two weeks later, we are safe, eating well and enjoying the company of close friends who have taken us in. The two of us and our 12-year-old daughter, Emilie, are among the lucky ones, as many continue searching for a decent meal and a place to sleep in peace. Our house is drying, the walls peeled back to their wooden skeleton and the hardwood floors ripped up and strewed across our dying lawn. We are about to move into a short-term apartment. Recovery is in sight, even if I need a pair of binoculars to see it.The damage to our home is considerable, and will be expensive to fix. New windows, appliances, curtains \u2014 it will all add up. Multiply our losses thousands of times, and you can begin to understand the blow to the Houston area, the country\u2019s fourth-largest metropolis. Lost home values, lost tax receipts, damaged schools, countless stores shut for repairs, half-empty restaurants, looting. And now Floridians have taken flight in the face of another monster storm, wondering if a similar fate awaits them.Houston has declared that it is open for business, but road travel can last hours longer than usual, complicated by closed roads and displaced commuters. Some refineries remain shut or are running at reduced capacity, and gasoline prices have soared. On the other side of the ledger, the money I am going to spend, multiplied by thousands, will be a stimulus package for the regional and national economy.Of course, my story is a grain of sand compared with the constellation of wrecked neighborhoods, broken hearts and even deaths. But perhaps my family\u2019s relative comfort has given me time to think about what this all means, beyond the economics. I hope that I come out of this experience stronger as an individual, and that together we come out stronger as a family. I am fairly confident that will happen, although I could be na\u00efve.Apart from financial losses, the storm has brought something else: It has exposed the skeletons of our lives, just as surely as the wooden bones of our stripped walls. It has exposed us to the limitations of our patience, not to mention our insurance, along with our dependency on a contractor and his workers, and the challenging task of juggling our jobs and family needs.It is probably hardest on Emilie, who awaits the opening of school on Monday after a two-week delay. With no room of her own, and mostly separated from her friends, she is bored and moody. Paola, ordinarily sociable, is turning down dinner invitations. The two of them share a bed with our cockapoo, Sweetie, while I sleep on the living-room couch, waking up frantic each day about the tasks that await.Decisions come fast and furiously; they have since the first days. As the waters devoured our house\u2019s first floor, Paola and I had to choose what to save and what to discard. We rolled up our Persian rug and took it upstairs, along with books, CDs and two light tables. Our couches were too heavy to save, but I managed to haul a leather chair onto a couch and saved it from the waters. Paola insisted we should pull up the curtains or take them down. I said let them go. That was a mistake.Once the floodwaters receded, which happened with amazing speed, we went into action to find someone to rip out the walls and floors. It was almost like a race among our neighbors to get the stuff out, to avoid mold, even while we all commiserated, compared notes, shared stories and drinks. I asked a trusted local real estate agent to recommend a contractor, whom we hired on the spot, since there seemed no time to lose. Was he the best? Maybe. I had to go with my gut.Then came calls to the insurance companies. The auto insurer provided a quick, fair payment for my wife\u2019s car (mine was a company car), but our homeowner\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t take care of flood damage to the house. Fortunately we have flood insurance, but it doesn\u2019t cover lodging while the house is repaired, however long that might be. One neighbor said he expected to be out eight months.That leaves FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I registered for assistance, and was quickly offered several weeks in a hotel room \u2014 but told that the room would probably be on the outskirts of Houston or beyond, so my daughter and my wife would probably have to spend hours getting to school and work. We decided to seek temporary housing on our own and see if FEMA would defray some of the costs.I spend part of each day at our waterlogged house, where I have been able to resume working from an upstairs office as well as organize the rebuilding effort. I worried about the adjusters\u2019 visit, having heard that adjusters can be stingy. Scavengers are picking through everything, with trucks to haul it away.But when the adjusters \u2014 a married couple from Mobile, Ala. \u2014 arrived to inspect our house and belongings, they could not help being impressed by the piles of debris on nearly every lawn on our block. They seemed sympathetic, but we will need to see their paperwork before we know what we can spend on repairs.The bad news was what they said would not be covered \u2014 our garage, for instance, because, the adjusters said, it includes a home office above. (They later changed their minds.) The gate to our driveway may or may not be covered because it is only partly attached to the house.I am not particularly religious, but on the first Friday night after the flooding I went to my synagogue to find some solace. Congregants embraced, and I went over to hug a woman I know casually because she was crying. I asked if she had lost her house; no, her mother had just died days before. It dawned on me that hers was a real loss, compared with the material things.Rabbi David Lyon, in his own eloquent way, beseeched those in need to reach out for help and for everyone to assist one another. \u201cHate is not the opposite of love,\u201d he said, citing the Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel. \u201cIndifference is the opposite of love.\u201dThe pastor, Keenan Smith, like my rabbi, appealed for mutual aid. \u201cIt\u2019s times like this, God, that people really see you,\u201d he said. Being an essentially secular person, I probably took that slightly differently from the way he intended. In all the turmoil, what is really important comes into sharp relief: True feelings are shown; the agonies and the brightness of life are displayed.Perhaps my neighbor Todd Lewis put it best. \u201cThere is a realignment of priorities,\u201d he said.Todd and his wife, Amanda, suffered little damage aside from the foot of water that flooded their garage. With a little time on his hands, Todd went door to door in our town and an adjoining neighborhood offering to rip out people\u2019s drywall, while Amanda did people\u2019s laundry and served neighbors dinner. When I told her that I was moved by their generosity, she responded, \u201cWe did nothing.\u201dI have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of emails, phone calls and Twitter messages from relatives and friends asking how we are doing. It is almost embarrassing, but it sure feels good. I even heard from our house\u2019s former owner, who wrote an emotional note to say he was sorry that the home he once loved had been damaged.Neighbors have invited me into their homes, and shared details of their childhoods and other things I would never have known if not for the flood, conversations that have drawn us closer. Strangers have knocked on our door to ask if we need help, or food, or even an embrace. An elderly woman came by to hand me an envelope from our synagogue. There was an assistance check inside, and gift cards to replace towels and other household goods. \u201cI may be back,\u201d she said, smiling.The search for housing, meanwhile, became a priority. I stopped at various buildings to see if anything was available. Most places wanted me to sign leases for six or seven months. Paola scanned Google for apartments near Texas Medical Center, realizing that doctors and patients regularly come and go. Smart move. We found a furnished two-bedroom apartment, and the management agreed to find a desk for Emilie to do her homework.I know that a company-leased car is on the way for me. But we still needed to find a new one for Paola. We decided to lease, and keep more of the insurance money from her destroyed car. Right now I am still on a list to rent a car even temporarily, and dependent on a rickety old Volvo station wagon with a less-than-perfect muffler lent by a good friend. If it breaks down, we are in trouble.I need cataract surgery, since the cataract in my right eye is worsening after my retina detachment surgery a few months ago. (Yes, it\u2019s been a bad year!) Do I go with the expensive surgery that is not completely covered by insurance, or do I do it on the cheap? Time to plan for Emilie\u2019s bat mitzvah. Move ahead, or do something modest? Our finances are up in the air.And beyond those decisions is the uncertainty about how long it will take to get our house together, and replace things it took years to collect.As a reporter who has worked in Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa and made four trips above the Arctic Circle, I have had ample opportunities to meet people from all walks of life. The storm has given me another chance, perhaps the most intimate.The other day we got a call that a tow company was coming for one of our cars. We assumed it was the Subaru parked in the driveway, which was blocking my company Malibu in the garage. But when Jon of Jon\u2019s Wrecker Service came by, he had been contracted to pick up the wrong car. He thought he might be able to move the Subaru and get the Malibu out, and managed to start both cars. When the Malibu started, water began to gush out of the exhaust pipe. He couldn\u2019t move the Subaru because of the electronic parking brake, which was immobilized by the flood damage.Not only was his trip a waste of time, but now I also had a spill of water in the garage, with furniture in renewed danger of damage. Even though Jon had many more cars to pick up, he stayed to help me clean up, and he tried to work with me to get the damaged garage door working again. We began talking about our families, and how we had been affected by the storm. He is of Mexican descent, and his wife is from El Salvador. One of his children goes to a local school, and is missing classes. He told me about his career, beginning as an aviation mechanic, how his family loved to go to El Salvador every summer to swim at the beach.\u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of work,\u201d he said, but without a glimmer of glee. He was clearly tired. He said he wanted his children to go to college, something he now wishes he had done. When we parted, we said we hoped to see each other again.One neighbor asked me if becoming a victim had made me a more empathetic interviewer. I have to think about that. But I do know that many people are in far more dire need than I am, and I feel for them.While reporting in Crosby, I went to the high school, where employees from the Arkema plant were passing out checks from the company to needy families. I met two Mexican women who spoke broken English at best, so we spoke in Spanish. They had been forced to evacuate their homes because they were so close to the plant.Both had families of five and had to wait in line for $100 checks, which weren\u2019t going to take them very far. Araceli Reynosa, who works with her husband in a Mexican restaurant in Houston over 30 miles away, found the check insultingly inadequate considering her car was flooded and inoperable. \u201cWe have no car to go to work,\u201d she said with a sigh.The other woman, Leticia Sanchez, was no happier. \u201cMy house was totally flooded, and my animals \u2014 my dogs, my chickens, my goats \u2014 are all lost,\u201d she said. With a sad but steady voice, she added, \u201cThey must be dead.\u201dAll I could say was that my house was flooded, too.\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said. I thanked her for her concern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Future, Warehouse Robots Will Learn on Their Own", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 The robot was perched over a bin filled with random objects, from a box of instant oatmeal to a small toy shark. This two-armed automaton did not recognize any of this stuff, but that did not matter. It reached into the pile and started picking things up, one after another after another.\u201cIt figures out the best way to grab each object, right from the middle of the clutter,\u201d said Jeff Mahler, one of the researchers developing the robot inside a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.For the typical human, that is an easy task. For a robot, it is a remarkable talent \u2014 something that could drive significant changes inside some of the world\u2019s biggest businesses and further shift the market for human labor.Today, robots play important roles inside retail giants like Amazon and manufacturing companies like Foxconn. But these machines are programmed for very specific tasks, like moving a particular type of container across a warehouse or placing a particular chip on a circuit board. They can\u2019t sort through a big pile of stuff, or accomplish more complex tasks. Inside Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers \u2014 where sorting through stuff is the primary task \u2014 armies of humans still do most of the work.The Berkeley robot was all the more remarkable because it could grab stuff it had never seen before. Mr. Mahler and the rest of the Berkeley team trained the machine by showing it hundreds of purely digital objects, and after that training, it could pick up items that weren\u2019t represented in its digital data set.\u201cWe\u2019re learning from simulated models and then applying that to real work,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, the Berkeley professor who oversees the university\u2019s automation lab.The robot was far from perfect, and it could be several years before it is seen outside research labs. Though it was equipped with a suction cup or a parallel gripper \u2014 a kind of two-fingered hand \u2014 it could reliably handle only so many items. And it could not switch between the cup and the gripper on the fly. But the techniques used to train it represented a fundamental shift in robotics research, a shift that could overhaul not just Amazon\u2019s warehouses but entire industries.\u201cThis can extend to tasks of assembly and more complex operations,\u201d said Juan Aparicio, head of advanced manufacturing automation at the German industrial giant Siemens, which is helping to fund the research at Berkeley. \u201cThat is the road map.\u201dPhysically, the Berkeley robot was nothing new. Mr. Mahler and his team were using existing hardware, including two robotic arms from the Swiss multinational ABB and a camera that captured depth.The Berkeley team began by scouring the internet for CAD models, short for computer-aided design. These are digital representations of physical objects. Engineers, physicists and designers build them when running experiments or creating new products. Using these models, Mr. Mahler and his team generated many more digital objects, eventually building a database of more than seven million items. Then they simulated the physics of each item, showing the precise point where a robotic arm should pick it up.That was a large task, but the process was mostly automated. When the team fed these models into a neural network, it learned to identify a similar point on potentially any digital object with any shape. And when the team plugged this neural network into the two-armed robot, it could do the same with physical objects.When facing a single everyday object with cylindrical or at least partly planar surfaces \u2014 like a spatula, a stapler, a cylindrical container of Froot Loops or even a tube of toothpaste \u2014 it could typically pick it up, with success rates often above 90 percent. But percentages dropped with more complex shapes, like the toy shark.What\u2019s more, when the team built simulated piles of random objects and fed those into the neural network, it could learn to lift items from physical piles, too. Researchers at Brown University and Northeastern are exploring similar research, and the hope is that this kind of work can be combined with other methods.\u201cPicking an object up is the first thing you want a manipulator robot to do,\u201d said Stefanie Tellex, a professor at Brown. \u201cA lot of more sophisticated behavior begins with that. If you can\u2019t pick it up, game over.\u201dThe research demonstrated how a task learned in the digital world can be transferred to the physical. Since the camera on Berkeley\u2019s robot could see depth, it captured three-dimensional images that were not unlike the CAD models the team uses to train its neural network.For this reason, some organizations are hoping to train robots using complex virtual worlds \u2014 digital recreations of our physical environment. If a system can train itself to navigate a car racing game like Grand Theft Auto, the thinking goes, it can navigate real roads.This is still largely theory. But at places like Berkeley and Northeastern, researchers are showing that digital learning can indeed make the leap into the real world.\u201cThis is a challenge,\u201d said Rob Platt, a professor at Northeastern. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenge we\u2019re dealing with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Firms Add $300 Million to Trump Administration\u2019s Computer Science Push", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe companies have said that donating money, technology and volunteers to schools is often the only way to fill gaps in American school systems\u2019 STEM offerings. Half of all schools in the country with students in kindergarten through 12th grade, where the money announced on Tuesday is to go, offer computer science education. In rural areas, the percentage is even smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the public and private sectors work together to ensure all American students have the opportunity to learn computer science and take part in the fastest growing sector of our economy,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that announced the new donations, said in a statement.The money will be disbursed over a five-year period, with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce contributing $50 million each. Lockheed Martin said it would donate $25 million and Accenture, General Motors and Pluralsight, an online education company, said they would give $10 million apiece.Some companies will also donate software and other technology as part of the initiative. Salesforce.org, Salesforce\u2019s philanthropy arm, said it would give 10 software subscriptions to every school in the country.Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, began organizing the effort about two months ago. She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills. And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York,\u201d Ms. Trump said in an interview, \u201cbut the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.\u201dMs. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education. In a news release, the Education Department said it had a \u201cgoal of devoting\u201d that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education.

{"Headline": "From Prison to Ph.D.: The Redemption and Rejection of Michelle Jones", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichelle Jones was released last month after serving more than two decades in an Indiana prison for the murder of her 4-year-old son. The very next day, she arrived at New York University, a promising Ph.D. student in American studies.N.Y.U. was one of several top schools that recruited her for their doctoral programs. She was also among 18 selected from more than 300 applicants to Harvard University\u2019s history program. But in a rare override of a department\u2019s authority to choose its graduate students, Harvard\u2019s top brass overturned Ms. Jones\u2019s admission after some professors raised concerns that she played down her crime in the application process.Elizabeth Hinton, one of the Harvard historians who backed Ms. Jones, called her \u201cone of the strongest candidates in the country last year, period.\u201d The case \u201cthrows into relief,\u201d she added, the question of \u201chow much do we really believe in the possibility of human redemption?\u201dWhile top Harvard officials typically rubber-stamp departmental admissions decisions, in this case the university\u2019s leadership \u2014 including the president, provost, and deans of the graduate school \u2014 reversed one, according to the emails and interviews, out of concern that her background would cause a backlash among rejected applicants, conservative news outlets or parents of students.The admissions dean of Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences declined to be interviewed, and a university spokeswoman did not respond to a set of eight questions about the case, saying that \u201cas a policy, we do not comment on individual applicants.\u201dInstead, the spokeswoman offered a general statement saying the graduate school \u201cis committed to recruiting and enrolling students from all backgrounds\u201d and \u201cstrives to create an inclusive and supportive environment where all students can thrive.\u201dIn that mode of outreach, staff members of both Harvard\u2019s history and American studies departments took it upon themselves to type Ms. Jones\u2019s application into Harvard\u2019s online system since she could not.But after the history department accepted her and the American studies program listed her as a top alternate, two American studies professors flagged Ms. Jones\u2019s file for the admissions dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In a memo to university administrators, these professors said the admissions dean had told them Ms. Jones\u2019s selection would be reviewed by the president and provost, and questioned whether she had minimized her crime \u201cto the point of misrepresentation.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t have some preconceived idea about crucifying Michelle,\u201d said John Stauffer, one of the two American studies professors. \u201cBut frankly, we knew that anyone could just punch her crime into Google, and Fox News would probably say that P.C. liberal Harvard gave 200 grand of funding to a child murderer, who also happened to be a minority. I mean, c\u2019mon.\u201dMs. Jones got pregnant at 14 after what she called non-consensual sex with a high-school senior. Her mother responded by beating her in the stomach with a board, according to the prosecutor who later handled her case, and she was placed in a series of group homes and foster families.In a personal statement accompanying her Harvard application, Ms. Jones said she had a psychological breakdown after years of abandonment and domestic violence, and inflicted similar treatment on her own son, Brandon Sims.The boy died in 1992 in circumstances that remain unclear; the body was never found.Two years later, during a stay at a mental-health crisis center, Ms. Jones admitted that she had buried him without notifying the police or Brandon\u2019s father and his family. At her trial, a former friend testified that Ms. Jones confessed to having beaten the boy and then leaving him alone for days in their apartment, eventually returning to find him dead in his bedroom.Ms. Jones was sentenced to 50 years in prison, but was released after 20 based on her good behavior and educational attainment.In her statement to Harvard, Ms. Jones wrote of Brandon: \u201cI have made a commitment to myself and him that with the time I have left, I will live a redeemed life, one of service and value to others.\u201dBrandon\u2019s father and grandmother could not be reached for comment.Her blossoming as a historian began in 2012, when Kelsey Kauffman, a former professor who volunteered at the prison, encouraged inmates to research the origins of their involuntary home, which opened in 1873 as the first adult female correctional facility in the United States. Soon, Ms. Jones was placing library requests for reference books and, when they arrived months later, scouring the footnotes for what to order next.After meticulously logging demographic data from century-old registries from the Indiana Women\u2019s Prison, Ms. Jones made a discovery: There were no prostitutes on the rolls. \u201cWhere,\u201d she asked, \u201cwere all the ladies?\u201d meaning so-called ladies of the night.Ms. Jones was supposed to be released in October, but received a two-month reduction of her sentence so she could start a Ph.D. program on time this fall. She applied to eight, with Harvard her first choice because of historians there whose work on incarceration she admired.While those historians embraced her application, others at Harvard questioned not only whether Ms. Jones had disclosed enough information about her past, but whether she could handle its pressure-cooker atmosphere.\u201cOne of our considerations,\u201d Professor Stauffer said in an interview, \u201cwas if this candidate is admitted to Harvard, where everyone is an elite among elites, that adjustment could be too much.\u201dAlison Frank Johnson, director of graduate studies for the history department, dismissed that argument as paternalistic.\u201cMichelle was sentenced in a courtroom to serve X years, but we decided \u2014 unilaterally \u2014 that it should be X years plus no Harvard,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it that she did not show the appropriate degree of horror in herself, by applying?\u201cWe\u2019re not her priests,\u201d Professor Johnson added, using an expletive.But most of these efforts focus on giving a fresh start to nonviolent offenders, especially those caught up by tough sentencing laws for drug crimes.\u201cIt\u2019s like we only have enough imagination \u2014 and courage \u2014 to envision second chances for the people who shouldn\u2019t have been in prison in the first place,\u201d Professor Johnson said.\u201cLook, as a mother, I thought it was just an awful crime,\u201d said Ms. Marger Moore, now a lawyer at a large firm in Los Angeles. \u201cBut what Harvard did is highly inappropriate: I\u2019m the prosecutor, not them. Michelle Jones served her time, and she served a long time, exactly what she deserved. A sentence is a sentence.\u201dHer backers saw her background as an asset, given the growing academic interest in incarceration.\u201cIt was a chance for us to do something that we\u2019ve been saying we\u2019re trying to do at Harvard, which is to set up conversations between academics and eyewitnesses,\u201d said Walter Johnson, director of an American history study center at the university.But the American studies professors said in their memo to administrators that \u201chonest and full narration is an essential part of our enterprise,\u201d and questioned whether Ms. Jones had met that standard in framing her past. In the personal statement, which was not required, she did not detail her involvement in the crime, but wrote that as a teenager she left Brandon at home alone, that he died, and that she has grieved for him deeply and daily since.Professor Stauffer emphasized in interviews that he and his departmental colleague, Dan Carpenter, were simply trying to ensure that Harvard did its due diligence about the candidacy.\u201cWe do not want to stand in the way of, advance a case against, or in any way hijack the career of Michelle Jones, who has served her time, who has clearly done amazing things while incarcerated, who shows passion for her craft, and whose full story the two of us can never really know,\u201d they wrote in the memo.\u201cIf officials who take a careful look at the case decide that Harvard should move forward, then we think that the university should do everything in its power and ability to welcome Ms. Jones here and support her, and we are indeed happy to play a part in that effort,\u201d they continued. \u201cWe have stated our concerns as questions, and we hope they are treated as nothing more nor less than questions, not as an implicit or explicit judgment against a person and her candidacy.\u201dMs. Jones, in an interview, said that if anyone at Harvard wanted her to elaborate on the criminal case or her preparedness for the Ph.D. program, they should have asked. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want my crime to be the lens through which everything I\u2019d done, and hoped for, was seen,\u201d she said.\u201cI knew that I had come from this very dark place \u2014 I was abhorrent to society,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut for 20 years, I\u2019ve tried to do right, because I was still interested in the world, and because I didn\u2019t believe my past made me somehow cosmically un-educatable forever.\u201dYale University also rejected Ms. Jones, though it is unclear what role her crime may have played in its decision; officials would not discuss her application.But she was courted by the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Michigan; the University of Kansas; and N.Y.U., which assigned graduate students to send Ms. Jones welcoming notes on JPay, a prison email app.She arrived in Manhattan during the back-to-school season of fresh starts, having never used a smartphone. She wore prison-issue glasses and carried boxes full of jailhouse research notes.\u201cWe\u2019re having her come up here for that partly out of a sense of pique,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.At N.Y.U., Nikhil Singh, faculty director of the prison-education program, acknowledged that \u201cMichelle will have a lot to prove.\u201d\u201cOur hope is that she is actually far, far more resourceful and driven than most college students,\u201d he added, \u201cwho take for granted they are supposed to be here.\u201dOn the Friday before classes started, in a lounge on the N.Y.U. campus, Ms. Jones said any presumption that she is not ready for a Ph.D. underestimates her own moxie and \u201csells prison short.\u201d\u201cPeople don\u2019t survive 20 years of incarceration with any kind of grace unless they have the discipline to do their reading and writing in the chaos of that place,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cForget Harvard. I\u2019ve already graduated from the toughest school there is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Gap on Climate Policy? It\u2019s Under His Front Door", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio wants to be seen as a leader in fighting global warming, and he says that everyone needs to do their part. But when it comes to two buildings he owns in Brooklyn, it\u2019s not clear that he is following his own advice.But when he was asked what he had done to make the two small buildings he owns in Park Slope, Brooklyn, more energy efficient \u2014 and whether they would meet the high standards he wants to set for others \u2014 he said that he did not know.\u201cI cannot tell a lie about being an expert about whether our two very small buildings meet these standards,\u201d he said at a news conference last week. \u201cBut I can say, as we have been improving the buildings we\u2019ve been putting energy efficiency elements into them. So, I\u2019d be happy to come back with a clearer answer.\u201dOver the next several days, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press office refused to provide additional information in response to repeated requests. On Wednesday, at a news conference to announce expanding electric vehicle charging stations, the mayor once again promised details would be provided in the future.Some information, however, is available through city records.Department of Buildings records show that in 2010, Mr. de Blasio installed a new natural gas-fueled boiler and hot water heater in one of his buildings, a two-story clapboard rowhouse that includes two rental units.Neither appliance appeared to have Energy Star certification \u2014 a federal program that indicates appliances that use less energy \u2014 suggesting that in each case, Mr. de Blasio could have made a more energy-efficient, although potentially more expensive, choice. (City records indicate that a final signoff on the installation was rejected, but a Buildings Department spokesman said that was because of a filing error by the installer.)The Buildings Department database includes no information about the boiler or water heater, and no permits were issued for a boiler replacement, so it is likely the building has an older and potentially less energy-efficient unit.There are many things the mayor could do to make his buildings more energy efficient, experts said.Ken Levenson, a founder of 475 High Performance Building Supply, recommended an energy audit of the houses, which would indicate a variety of steps to improve efficiency. He said that replacing windows, sealing around doors and windows to prevent air leaks, and adding roof insulation would be important steps.A brief inspection of the exterior of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s buildings suggested that he has not taken many basic measures. The windows on his former residence appeared old and not well sealed. Some window air-conditioning units on both buildings were enclosed by plastic accordion panels that easily let in heat and cold. There was a half-inch gap under the front door of the two-story rental building, with nothing in place to prevent drafts.The energy efficiency mandate that Mr. de Blasio has proposed applies to buildings of more than 25,000 square feet, which includes thousands of apartment buildings, office buildings, factories and warehouses.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s buildings are much smaller: One is about 1,500 square feet, and the other is about 1,250 square feet, according to city data.Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, stressed the size difference between the mayor\u2019s buildings and those targeted by the proposed mandates.\"Comparing these two scenarios is like comparing the emissions and environmental responsibilities of a semi-truck and a bicycle,\u201d he said in an emailed statement.The timing of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s announcement last week \u2014 days before he was the keynote speaker at a climate change forum before an international gathering of urban leaders \u2014 surprised and angered his legislative allies on the City Council, whose support he needs to pass an energy efficiency mandate.At the forum, held in New York on Monday, the mayor discussed the buildings mandate as if it already were in effect \u2014 when in fact his proposal lacks details and faces an uncertain future in the Council.At the announcement last week, Mr. de Blasio suggested that the owners of large buildings and wealthy landlords were resistant to the changes because of a desire for profit.\u201cThey can handle it, they just don\u2019t like to spend money,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter, With Accounts Linked to Russia, to Face Congress Over Role in Election", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump\u2019s admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee.As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States.But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using \u201cbot\u201d accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts \u2014 arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service. Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts.Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent \u201chad a primary theme of anti-Americanism,\u201d the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa \u2014 short for anti-fascist \u2014 protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea\u2019s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump\u2019s earlier wiretapping claims.In the face of such public scrutiny, Twitter has said almost nothing about what it knows about Russia\u2019s use of its platform. But Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he would like to know exactly what the company has done to find covert Russian activity and what it has discovered so far about fake accounts \u2014 including their reach and impact.\u201cI think right now the public is aware of only a subset of a subset of Russian activity online,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in an interview. He said Facebook long denied that there had been Russian exploitation of its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6.Mr. Schiff said the tech companies have asked for assistance from American intelligence agencies in trying to find and stop illicit interference from other countries, a request he said he supports.The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Experts on Russia inside and outside the government say President Vladimir V. Putin had multiple goals in last year\u2019s campaign of hacking, leaking and stealth propaganda. He hoped to damage, if not defeat, Mrs. Clinton, whom he blamed for encouraging pro-democracy protests in Russia and neighboring states.Last week, Facebook said it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to Congress. Many of those ads, like the opposing Twitter hashtags on the N.F.L. anthem issue, targeted divisions in American society by simultaneously sending conflicting messages to different users segmented by political and racial characteristics.\u201cWhat we see over and over again is that a lot of the messaging isn\u2019t about politics, a specific politician, or political parties,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating societal division, identifying divisive issues and fanning the flames.\u201dFor its part, Twitter has not said much about what it plans to say in the Congressional briefing.\u201cTwitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies, and will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation that violate our Terms of Service,\u201d Twitter said in a statement.Twitter has also said it was working to crack down on bots that distribute tweets en masse or that attempt to manipulate the platform\u2019s trending topics.Colin Crowell, Twitter\u2019s vice president of public policy, government and philanthropy, said in a blog post in June that the company should not be an arbiter of whether a tweet is truthful or not. Because Twitter is open and real-time, he said the platform is the best antidote to misinformation, when \u201cjournalists, experts and engaged citizens Tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds.\u201dKaren North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said the company\u2019s defense has some merit.\u201cTwitter functions more like a broadcast network,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say things and everyone can hear it. When false information is stated, people can jump on false statements and challenge it.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Scott Shane from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Are Not the Robots We Were Promised", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFrom the moment we humans first imagined having mechanical servants at our beck and call, we\u2019ve assumed they would be constructed in our own image. Outfitted with arms and legs, heads and torsos, they would perform everyday tasks that we\u2019d otherwise have to do ourselves. Like the indefatigable maid Rosie on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d the officious droid C-3PO in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the tortured \u201chost\u201d Dolores Abernathy in \u201cWestworld,\u201d the robotic helpmates of popular culture have been humanoid in form and function.It\u2019s time to rethink our assumptions. A robot invasion of our homes is underway, but the machines \u2014 so-called smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home and the forthcoming Apple HomePod \u2014 look nothing like what we expected. Small, squat and stationary, they resemble vases or cat food tins more than they do people.Echo and its ilk do, however, share a crucial trait with their imaginary forebears: They illuminate the times. Whatever their shape, robots tell us something important about our technologies and ourselves.Although smart speakers have been around just three years, they already have a hold on us. The devices, powered by \u201cchatbots\u201d like Siri and Alexa, are in the midst of a sales boom. Some 35 million Americans now use the diminutive, talking computers \u2014 more than twice the number of just a year ago, according to estimates by eMarketer \u2014 and analysts predict that three-quarters of United States households will own at least one of the gadgets by 2020.It\u2019s not hard to understand the attraction. Smart speakers are oracles of the countertop. They may not be able to speak for the gods, but they can deliver reports on news, traffic and weather. And they have other talents that their Delphic ancestor couldn\u2019t even dream of: They can serve as D.J. They can diagnose ailments and soothe anxieties. They can read bedtime stories.They can even bark like a watchdog to scare off burglars. And they promise to be the major-domos of home automation, adjusting lights, controlling appliances and issuing orders to specialized robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.Still, if you were looking forward to having a Rosie scurrying around your abode, feather duster in hand, an Echo feels like a letdown. It just sits there.There are good reasons that the domestic robot has taken such an uninspiring form. Some are technical. Visualizing a nimble, sure-footed android is easy, but building one is hard. As the Carnegie Mellon professor Illah Nourbakhsh explains in his book \u201cRobot Futures,\u201d it requires advances not only in artificial intelligence but also in the complex hardware systems required for movement, perception and dexterity.The human nervous system is a marvel of physical control, able to sense and respond fluidly to an ever-changing environment. Achieving such agility with silicon and steel lies well beyond the reach of today\u2019s engineers. Even the most advanced of our current automatons still get flustered by mundane tasks like loading a dishwasher or dusting knickknacks.Meanwhile, thanks to gains in networking, language processing and miniaturization, it has become simple to manufacture small, cheap computers that can understand basic questions and commands, gather and synthesize information from online databanks and control other electronics. The technology industry has enormous incentives to promote such gadgets. Now that many of the biggest tech companies operate like media businesses, trafficking in information, they\u2019re in a race to create new products to charm and track consumers.Smart speakers provide a powerful complement to smartphones in this regard. Equipped with sensitive microphones, they serve as in-home listening devices \u2014 benign-seeming bugs \u2014 that greatly extend the companies\u2019 ability to monitor people\u2019s habits. Whenever you chat with a smart speaker, you\u2019re disclosing valuable information about your routines and proclivities.Beyond the technical challenges, there\u2019s a daunting psychological barrier to constructing and selling anthropomorphic machines. No one has figured out how to bridge what computer scientists term the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d \u2014 the wide gap we sense between ourselves and imitations of ourselves. Because we\u2019re such social beings, our minds are exquisitely sensitive to the expressions, gestures and manners of others. Any whiff of artificiality triggers revulsion. Humanoid robots seem creepy to us, and the more closely they\u2019re designed to mimic us, the creepier they are. That puts roboticists in a bind: The more perfect their creations, the less likely we\u2019ll want them in our homes. Lacking human characteristics, smart speakers avoid the uncanny valley altogether.Although they may not look like the robots we envisioned, smart speakers do have antecedents in our cultural fantasy life. The robot they most recall at the moment is HAL, the chattering eyeball in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d But their current form \u2014 that of a stand-alone gadget \u2014 is not likely to be their ultimate form. They seem fated to shed their physical housing and turn into a sort of ambient digital companion. Alexa will come to resemble Samantha, the \u201cartificially intelligent operating system\u201d that beguiles the Joaquin Phoenix character in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Through a network of speakers, microphones and sensors scattered around our homes, we\u2019ll be able to converse with our solicitous A.I. assistants wherever and whenever we like.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook C.E.O., spent much of last year programming a prototype of such a virtual agent. In a video released in December, he gave a demo of the system. Walking around his Silicon Valley home, he conducted a running dialogue with his omnipresent chatbot, calling on it to supply him with a clean T-shirt and toast bread for his breakfast, play movies and music, and entertain his infant daughter.

{"Headline": "Why Texas Is No Longer Feeling Miraculous", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Call it the season of Texas\u2019 discontent. Of course there was Hurricane Harvey, which blasted the coastline, leaving cities flooded and an estimated $180 billion in damage. But Harvey is just the headline.There\u2019s also the dysfunctional, ideologically driven State Legislature, which spent the last weeks of this year\u2019s session debating, of all things, who gets to use which bathroom. Then there\u2019s the oil and gas sector, which, as it has so many times before, expanded into a bubble and then, as global energy prices sank, popped, taking thousands of jobs with it.Texas\u2019 woes are interconnected. Rising energy prices allow politicians to take their hands off the legislative wheel. Less attention to smart, controlled growth at the state and local level allowed unchecked sprawl along the coast. And now declining revenues will make it harder for the state to address its very real needs, assuming the Legislature can get its act together. The silver lining to this tale? It finally seems to be dawning on people that low taxes, less regulation and more oil are no substitute for actually governing.If this doesn\u2019t sound like the Tall Tale of the Texas Miracle of just a few years ago, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. Way, way back \u2014 in early 2015 \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry rode out of office with his head held high: The boom years had created over 1.4 million jobs since the end of 2007. We had escaped the housing bust, oil and gas prices were rising and the state\u2019s economy had diversified and profited mightily from free trade. Texas was the promised land, reminiscent of Davy Crockett\u2019s observation that our state \u201cis the garden spot of the world.\u201d At the height of this latest Texas miracle, the cost of living was so low and there were so many jobs that 1,000 people flocked here every single day.Times, however, have changed. Two years ago Texas had one of the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rates; today it is in 28th place. Though it is now at 4.4 percent, it was as high as 5 percent a few months ago, and there\u2019s a good bet it will bounce back up, and likely higher, soon.The reason: the oil patch. When oil fetched $100 per barrel, we fracked away, even in our own suburbs. Roughnecks rented trailer spots in front yards and showered towns from Odessa to Victoria with money. A drive across West Texas\u2019s vast, oil-rich Permian Basin in late 2015 revealed equipment crowding roads. Now much of that equipment is idle, and energy companies are planning on $40 a barrel as far as they can forecast.The Lone Star State also slipped in the business rankings. For the first time in years, Texas tumbled out of the top two most desirable states for business in CNBC\u2019s annual survey of executives. No. 1? Washington State. The reason, executives said, was a stalled state economy \u2014 because of the oil slump. Governing magazine ranked the Texas economy 21st; in 2013, it was third. WalletHub has Texas in 20th place.It\u2019s not just the oil slump. Even though we don\u2019t have a state income tax, we have high sales and property taxes. WalletHub ranks our effective tax burden 30th in the country, basically tied with Massachusetts. And the state isn\u2019t about to help: The Legislature can\u2019t even figure out how to fund public schools.Will business turn up its nose at Texas? It already has. Yes, Toyota\u2019s new North American headquarters is in Plano, outside Dallas. But General Electric was looking to move its headquarters from Connecticut to North Texas, too. Instead, 800 G.E. employees are going to Boston. The reason? Massachusetts may be home to high taxes and high regulations, but it\u2019s also a pro-trade and pro-smart growth. Texas, meanwhile, is home to Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an ardent opponent of the Export-Import Bank, on which G.E. and many other companies depend for export assistance.And what are the chances that Amazon, now in the hunt for a second headquarters site, will choose Dallas, which has thrown its 10-gallon hat in the ring? Whatever the city can offer, the state taketh away in the form of do-nothing legislators and governor who sport, as their recent crowning achievement, an Arizona-style law that allows the police to question people\u2019s citizenship and immigration status. The law immediately stalled in the courts.The governor, Greg Abbott, also called the legislature back into a special session in part to pass a North Carolina-style bill regulating which public bathroom transgender people could use. It lost, but not before it had pitted Republicans against AT&T, American Airlines, Dell, Google, the major oil companies, Southwest Airlines and the Texas Association of Business.Texas Republicans, somehow, have become the anti-business party. \u201cMost of the threats to the future of Texas are self-imposed: Inadequate education and infrastructure funding can stifle growth,\u201d said M. Ray Perryman, an economist who describes himself as a fiscal conservative. \u201cDiscriminatory social legislation can irreparably damage the business climate, and hard-line immigration posturing is counterproductive.\u201dMr. Abbott hasn\u2019t shown much interest in toiling in the garden of economics, anyway; where Mr. Perry doled out some $500 million in incentives to companies to move, stay or grow in the state, Mr. Abbott has parsimoniously offered enticements often measured in the several hundred thousand dollars (except for Toyota, which got $40 million in incentives from the state to move to Plano).And then came Harvey. In addition to the immense human suffering, applications for unemployment benefits have spiked to Great Recession levels. If the federal government comes through with all the money, then those costs would eventually be zeroed out as money pours into rebuilding. But that\u2019s a huge if, given the politics of Washington, the highly politicized history of recent hurricane relief and the fact that only $15 billion has been approved. Of that, only $1 billion has been disbursed; almost a third of that will be needed just to clean up trash.The tale of the Texas Miracle was a big fat lie: Plentiful oil, low regulation and even lower taxes are not a panacea. Sure, they don\u2019t hurt. But they don\u2019t help, not without consistent, well-considered state policy to attract and build businesses.Still, there is hope. Harvey is forcing Texans to rethink our political dogma of small government at any cost. Harris County, which surrounds Democratic Houston and includes bedrock Republican suburbs, has placed everything on the table to prevent disasters in the future: from radical rezoning to land conservation and a giant Dutch-style engineering project to protect the region from another direct hit. That will take at least tens of billions of taxpayer dollars.Even the state\u2019s right-wing lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has found religion, singing the praises of expensive engineering. Mr. Abbott is being too clever by half so far, refusing to tap the state\u2019s $10 billion rainy day fund while asking for the federal government to pick up the entire tab for the hurricane. Though as a politician he has done nothing but oppose the federal government, his re-election may end up hinging on how effective he is at bringing home the federal bacon. The same is true of the state\u2019s junior senator, Ted Cruz, notorious for opposing aid to areas hit by Superstorm Sandy.Yes, Harvey has flooded the garden of the Texas economy. But the garden was already unkempt. And fall, in Texas, is a good time to start over with honest perspiration.

Standard-definition videos are less expensive to buy, often by about $5, and $1 or $2 less to rent in some online stores. Certain devices cannot fully display HD video anyway because the screens lack the needed resolution or the hardware is not compatible. (Some files may automatically download in standard definition anyway depending on the device you are using.)Because they contain more data, downloaded HD videos need more bandwidth to stream and, when downloaded, take up more space on your device. For example, the 720p HD version of \u201cThe Martian\u201d in Apple\u2019s iTunes Store is a 5.36-gigabyte file, while the SD edition weighs in at 2.54 gigabytes. If you are downloading a movie to a mobile device to watch offline, the SD edition is a space saver. If you plan to watch the movie on a high-definition television or high-resolution computer monitor, though, SD video can look flatter and less vibrant than the HD version.Advertisement"}

Competitors have complained that this forces them to pay money to what they say is a search monopoly, thus violating the spirit of competitive markets. The fix offered by Google appears to address the complaint that it was unfairly promoting its own services.Alphabet will proceed with its appeal. That is important, as the idea that a dominant company cannot favor its own services at the expense of rivals is contentious and could lead to future cases against Amazon, Facebook and others.But the real action is over Android.Most of the smartphones in the world are powered by Google\u2019s operating system. The company does not charge manufacturers for it, but consumers value these phones because they can download apps.The European Commission asserts that Alphabet is acting abusively by giving financial incentives to manufacturers to exclusively use Google search and forcing them to set it as the default if they want access to Android\u2019s app store.Nearly 90 percent of Alphabet\u2019s top line comes from advertising. And mobile will probably account for about two-thirds of its net digital advertising revenue this year, according to estimates from the research firm eMarketer.Considering the existential threat to Alphabet if the company were to lose its grip on mobile search, it\u2019s little wonder that the tech giant wants as few distractions as possible to focus on this fight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A de Kooning, a Theft and an Enduring Mystery", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was finally recovered last month, and investigators are focusing on several theories. And one of them is, in its own way, extraordinary: They are trying to determine if the heist was engineered by a retired New York City schoolteacher \u2014 something of a renaissance man \u2014 who donned women\u2019s clothing and took his son along as his accomplice, and then hung the masterwork in the bedroom of his own rural New Mexico home, where it remained.In other words, they are examining whether he stole a painting now valued at in excess of $100 million simply so he could enjoy it.The teacher, Jerome Alter, and his wife, Rita, both died at 81, he in 2012 and she earlier this summer.\u201cMy driving instinct is to say: \u2018This couldn\u2019t be my aunt and uncle who had it since the beginning,\u2019\u201d said Ron Roseman, Rita Alter\u2019s nephew. \u201cBut, well gosh, it\u2019s like I said, I\u2019m as clueless as everybody else. It\u2019s hard to believe that they were that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the word for it is.\u201dMr. Roseman, who lives in Houston and is the executor of his aunt\u2019s estate, said he was completely mystified as to how the painting had ended up in his aunt and uncle\u2019s quirky one-story pink ranch-style house in Cliff, a hamlet of barely 300 people some 225 miles from the museum in Tucson.It was the day after Thanksgiving in 1985. An older woman and a younger man walked into the museum about 9 a.m. A security guard had just unlocked the glass doors to admit an arriving employee, whom the pair followed inside. The sky was overcast and it was 55 degrees; both of the visitors wore heavy winter coats.A few minutes later, the two left in such haste that they attracted the attention of staff members. One museum employee hurried up the steps to the second-floor gallery, where the man had spent less than 10 minutes while his companion asked a security guard about another piece of art.The 40-by-30-inch de Kooning painting was gone. Investigators believe the man cut it from its frame and rolled up the canvas and stuffed it under his heavy blue coat while the woman distracted the guard, who could not see the gallery from the landing where they had talked. The two drove away in a rust-colored two-door car. At the time, \u201cWoman-Ochre\u201d was valued at $400,000.It was a highly unusual crime. Despite the depiction of art heists in movies and television, a vast majority involve works taken from storage areas by employees or people in a position of trust. With few leads beyond a description of the thieves \u2014 and sketches of the pair prepared by an F.B.I. artist based on witness accounts \u2014 the crime became an enduring mystery.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at everything \u2014 absolutely,\u201d said Brian Seastone, the University of Arizona police chief, when asked about whether investigators were looking into the possibility that Jerome Alter and his son, Joseph, were involved in the theft. He would not say what other avenues were being pursued. The university Police Department is assisting the F.B.I. with the case; Chief Seastone was involved in the initial investigation in 1985, when he was a police officer with the department.Jill McCabe, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Phoenix, would not comment other than to say that the bureau has \u201can active and ongoing investigation into the theft.\u201d The inquiry is being conducted by agents in the Tucson office, with the assistance of the agency\u2019s Art Crime Team in New York.The sketch of the female suspect \u2014 described at the time of the theft as being between 55 and 60 years old \u2014 bears a resemblance to Mr. Alter, who was known as Jerry and was then 54. And the sketch of the young man \u2014 described at the time as between 25 and 30 years old \u2013 bears a resemblance to his son, Joseph M. Alter, who was then 23. At around that time, the Alters had a red two-door Nissan sports car, according to a family member, a family friend and owner of a gas station less than a mile and a half from the Alter home.Witnesses described the woman as having blondish-red shoulder-length hair, covered by a scarf of the same color. She wore tan polyester bell-bottom slacks and a red water-repellent winter coat.The man was described as being 25 to 30 years old, with an olive complexion, dark wavy hair and a mustache. He wore heavy framed glasses and a blue water-repellent winter coat with a hood.Joseph Alter, now 55, who has lived in Silver City, about 30 miles from Cliff, could not be reached for comment. Several people who knew his parents, and Mr. Roseman, said Joseph has had severe psychological problems since the mid-1980s and has been in and out of mental institutions. Mr. Roseman said he was currently hospitalized.During one of several telephone interviews in recent days, Mr. Roseman noted that some people with whom he has spoken, including friends, see the resemblance and some do not. \u201cHalf of them look at it and say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 and half of them look at it and say, \u2018No way!\u2019\u201d he said. But he was quick to add: \u201cI didn\u2019t take a tally or anything.\u201dMr. Roseman said he did not see the resemblance in the sketches, but added, \u201cI\u2019m not objective about it, so when I look at it, honestly, I\u2019m not seeing it \u2014 but I\u2019m pretty good at knowing when I\u2019m objective or not.\u201dM.J. Burns, a Grant County, N.M., sheriff\u2019s deputy who has patrolled Cliff and the surrounding rural communities for more than a decade, recalled the Alters as polite, well-spoken but private people who never had trouble with the law. But he said that after the news media reported the discovery of the de Kooning in the couple\u2019s home, some longtime residents of the area concluded that the sketch of the woman more closely resembled Mrs. Alter and that the sketch of the younger man resembled her husband.Mr. Alter\u2019s sister, Carole Sklar, 81, an artist who lives in New Jersey, scoffed at the notion that either her erudite, cultured brother or his sweet, gentle wife \u2014 let alone their troubled son \u2014 had been involved in the theft. She called it \u201cabsurd\u201d and said the notion that her brother would dress in women\u2019s clothing was laughable.\u201cThat Jerry and Rita would risk something as wild and crazy as grand larceny \u2014 risk the possibility of winding up in prison, for God\u2019s sake \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said.The Alters built their three-bedroom house, set on 20 acres of rugged scrub brush on a mesa overlooking a mountain valley, after they moved to New Mexico in the late 1970s. They surrounded it with landscaped gardens, a large swimming pool, and an unlikely collection of sculptures, including a semicircle of more than a dozen busts of the likes of Beethoven and Moli\u00e8re, each mounted on a stone pedestal.In addition to teaching music in a New York City school in Washington Heights, Manhattan, the elder Mr. Alter worked as a professional clarinetist before retiring to Cliff. Rita Alter worked for a number of years as a speech pathologist in the public schools in Silver City.The couple, who people in Cliff said largely kept to themselves, were avid travelers, having visited more than 140 countries on all seven continents, according to a book of fictionalized short stories based on their trips that Mr. Alter self-published in 2011. (Mr. Alter also published two other books, and with his wife, a collection of poetry and a selection of Aesop\u2019s fables, which was set to verse.)David Van Auker, an antiques and furniture dealer whom Mr. Roseman hired to appraise the contents of the Alters\u2019 home, discovered the painting. He and his two business partners went to the house on Aug. 2 to photograph and catalog the furniture and other items for sale after Rita Alter\u2019s death.He found \u201cWoman-Ochre\u201d hanging between a corner of the bedroom and the door, he said, situated so that it was completely obscured when the door was open, but visible from the bed when the door was closed.While he didn\u2019t recognize it as a masterwork, he liked it and ended up buying the contents of the house for roughly $2,000, he said. He took the painting back to their store in Silver City, and that day, several patrons who saw it on the floor said they thought it was a de Kooning.It was a very emotional homecoming at the museum, which had been hoping for nearly 32 years to get \u201cWoman-Ochre\u201d back. \u201cThis is a moment the institution has been talking about and thinking about since the painting was stolen,\u201d said Meg Hagyard, the institution\u2019s interim director.If Mr. Alter had a role in the theft, he may have hidden clues in his writing. He included two stories about thefts from museums in the United States in his book based on the couple\u2019s travels, \u201cThe Cup and the Lip.\u201d And while a number of aspects of the tales differ from the 1985 heist, there are notable similarities.In one story, \u201cThe Eye of the Jaguar,\u201d a grandmother and her granddaughter steal a 120-carat emerald from a display case in broad daylight, striking when a guard\u2019s attention is focused elsewhere. \u201cHaving made their escape with no witnesses present, the thieves left absolutely no clues which the police could use to even begin a search for them!\u201d he wrote.He ends the story by describing how the stolen gem was later kept in a hidden display case, apparently in the grandmother\u2019s home, \u201cseveral miles from the place where this event transpired.\u201d\u201cAnd two pairs of eyes, exclusively, are there to see,\u201d he wrote.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bell Pottinger, British P.R. Firm for Questionable Clients, Collapses", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fraught world of image makeovers, Bell Pottinger stood out for venturing where others feared to go. It courted embattled governments, controversial clients and powerful people who ran afoul of public opinion. Along the way, it reaped hefty fees and became one of Britain\u2019s most influential public relations firms.Bell Pottinger\u2019s swift downfall sent shudders through the public relations industry and raised questions about the increasingly combative tactics used by those who engage in what critics call \u201creputation laundering.\u201d\u201cBell Pottinger has brought the P.R. and communications industry into disrepute with its actions, and it has received the harshest possible sanctions,\u201d Francis Ingham, the public relations association\u2019s director-general, said in a statement.The firm\u2019s failure underscores the broader pressures roiling the public relations industry in a whipsaw online world, where fake news, Twitterbots, gaming Google searches and revising Wikipedia pages are valuable tools for helping to shape narratives and recast reputations.Bell Pottinger\u2019s collapse also highlights the eagerness of politicians, celebrities, companies and governments around the world to hire communications firms that will sometimes go to extreme lengths to influence opinion and media coverage, or to ignite activism through social networks.Many firms do similar work, but Bell Pottinger\u2019s penchant for taking on questionable clients raised concerns about its own ethics, especially among its British counterparts.Timothy Bell, a London political and social operator who helped Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, start her political career, was a founder of Bell Pottinger in 1998.The firm counted Airbus and Coca-Cola as clients, but it also advised President F.W. de Klerk of apartheid-era South Africa on how to run against Nelson Mandela, and helped a foundation backed by supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, fight his detention by Britain for human rights violations.Lord Bell, a gregarious, blunt-spoken man whom Mrs. Thatcher nominated for knighthood, insisted that there were two sides to every story, and that Bell Pottinger\u2019s job was to make sure that the version it was telling prevailed. He left the firm last year to start a new venture.\u201cWe help shape client reputations, tell effective stories and run creative campaigns to enhance their brand and deliver commercial success,\u201d the firm said on its website.As Bell Pottinger\u2019s client list grew increasingly controversial, so did the tactics it employed.Other investigations by the journalism bureau showed that Bell Pottinger had used similar tactics for other clients.Such methods are not illegal, and are widely used by companies, governments and other public relations firms. But Bell Pottinger appeared to test the limits of its approach in South Africa last year when it was hired by Oakbay Capital, a holding company run by the Gupta brothers, members of a powerful Indian family with widespread business interests in South Africa and close ties to Mr. Zuma.After being hired by Oakbay for a monthly fee of 100,000 British pounds, or about $133,000, Bell Pottinger initiated what it called an \u201ceconomic emancipation campaign.\u201d The firm sought to portray opponents of the Guptas and Mr. Zuma as agents of white-owned businesses eager to economically disenfranchise black South Africans.The firm edited the Guptas\u2019 Wikipedia page to tone down negative material, and encouraged activists to spread stories online that suggested \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d was deepening in South Africa because of the minority white population.A hashtag, #WhiteMonopolyCapital, circulated on Twitter, and the term \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d began to be used on a television station owned by the Guptas, according to local news reports. Mr. Zuma also spoke of \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d as being a driving force behind calls for his resignation.The campaign began to unravel when thousands of emails from Gupta company accounts were leaked in May. The messages, published by South African and British media outlets, suggested that Mr. Zuma\u2019s son, Duduazne, a former director of some Gupta-owned companies, had instructed Bell Pottinger to pursue a strategy of racial division \u201calong the lines of #EconomicEmancipation or whatever.\u201dThe inquiry, conducted by the British law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, found that Bell Pottinger had breached ethical principles by engaging in a \u201cracially divisive and/or potentially offensive\u201d campaign. The firm had also sought to mislead or undermine journalists asking questions about the campaign, the report said. The investigation also found that the firm had used \u201cunsavvy\u201d employees with little knowledge of South Africa\u2019s political situation.A week after the report\u2019s release, Bell Pottinger crumpled into insolvency.An article on Wednesday about the collapse of the British public relations firm Bell Pottinger misstated the connection of one of the firm\u2019s former clients, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, to Belarus. He is the current president and dictator of the country; he is not a former dictator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Far Right Came to Love Hippie Food", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome time ago, I found myself in a buffet line around piles of inedible looking grains, greens and grassy-smelling gratins at an alternative food cooperative\u2019s Sunday dinner. No part of this meal, I was assured, had been touched by the corporate food chain, the Big Ag puppeteers with their taxpayer-subsidized toxins.The evening was all very yeasty and dreadlocky, as you would expect. The food was \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 wretched. I didn\u2019t see it then, but I understand now that many social movements start on the fringe frontier, where earnestness ultimately wins out over the skepticism of people like me.It\u2019s no secret that Whole Foods, the $13.7 billion dollar acquisition of Amazon, took the \u201cbusiness\u201d model I found in a leaky old loft in Port Townsend, Wash., long ago, and gave it a profitable corporate sheen.But what\u2019s less well known and somewhat surprising is how that same food ethic drifted over into the paranoid world of the far right, where no truth is self-evident and the apocalypse is always imminent. At the dark confluence of hippie and Hitler, you can buy a year\u2019s supply of earth-friendly quinoa.What\u2019s sad, and indicative of the wretched Trump era, is how something that started in a wave of hope and optimism migrated to closed-minded, mercenary quarters.You can trace a bit of this transition to John Mackey, the Texas co-founder of Whole Foods. A libertarian and admirer of Ayn Rand, he once lived in a vegetarian collective. \u201cI thought I\u2019d meet a lot of interesting women,\u201d he told The New Yorker. \u201cAnd I did.\u201dBy the time Whole Foods had purchased Wild Oats, the communal ethic had been overtaken by imperial ambition. But that was nothing compared with some of the current peddlers of alt-foods.So, in between rants about how Ku Klux Klan members are \u201cjust Jewish actors,\u201d the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones sells an exhaustive line of strange food. His market is \u201cpreppers,\u201d people who\u2019ve been preparing for the End, for some time.Jones\u2019s website urges fellow knuckle-draggers to \u201csecure your food independence\u201d with his organic-sounding Patriot Pantry. From \u201cfluoride-free mouthwash\u201d \u2014 the better to secure precious bodily fluids, one assumes \u2014 to \u201cstrawberry fields cream of wheat,\u201d he assures his followers that his \u201cnon-GMO meals have a 25-year shelf life.\u201d Plus, no added MSG!Over at The Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s soft-rock version of the hard right, a targeted demographic is the grumpy Trump supporter who wants to Grow Your Own. The site\u2019s story diet is heavy on the threat of transgender kindergartners. But with food, Beck is closer to that co-op I visited.One of Beck\u2019s sponsors promotes \u201cbetter ideas for off-the-grid living.\u201d Another offers \u201cnext level gardening with a geodesic green house.\u201d These items would have fit, years ago, into the Whole Earth Catalog, a must-read for the no-deodorant set.One side, now, is heavily armed, and the other seems friendlier, the products named for Burt and Annie, Ben and Jerry. A consistent thread through the years is distrust of institutions, of the Man. Another shared belief is self-sufficiency.The 1969 Whole Earth Catalog heralded the \u201cpower of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment and share his adventure with whoever is interested.\u201dThere was a brief, shining point when we seemed to have reached a national consensus in the politics of natural food: Michelle Obama\u2019s vegetable garden. It was simple, instructive and Jeffersonian, backing the notion that there\u2019s an easy alternative to all the awful additives at the American table.But even something as wholesome as a healthy diet message got dragged through the right-wing swamp, prompting a defiant Sarah Palin to offer sugar cookies to students living through an obesity epidemic.One of the first acts of President Trump\u2019s administration was to reverse an Obama era proposed ban of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide shown to cause brain damage in children. Trump has also rolled back new food rules designed to reduce sodium levels in schools and give consumers more nutritional information.And while Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters in the hard right are preparing for End Times with chemical-free freeze-dried and other pseudo organics, their man gorges himself on Big Macs and slabs of well-done steaks and tries to keep the rest of us in the dark. The food message from this White House: eat your poisons, and don\u2019t ask where they came from.Advertisement"}

Either he doesn\u2019t have one, or it\u2019s subtle \u2014 like a group of especially awkward 12-year-old boys yucking it up in the cafeteria.A minute on Google produces an encyclopedia of moments when we have been assured Trump was \u201conly joking.\u201dSome prime examples include Sean Spicer saying Trump was joshing when he urged the Kremlin to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails during the campaign. Then there was the painful moment when his spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, \u201cI believe he was making a joke,\u201d after Trump suggested that police officers slam prisoners\u2019 heads into the door jambs of their cars.The \u201cjoking\u201d dodge, of course, falls into the category of language tics that actually mean the opposite (\u201cDid you actually pay someone for that haircut? Only kidding!\u201d or \u201cWith all due respect, I think your ideas are terrible.\u201d)It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the wacky sense of fun among Trump and his supporters is selective.

{"Headline": "S.&P. 500 Crosses 2,500 for First Time", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets continued their march higher Friday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index passing the threshold of 2,500 for the first time in its 60-year history.Wall Street is riding the second-longest bull market in history, with investors repeatedly shrugging off domestic and international turmoil as they pile into shares of technology and other companies. On Friday, for example, the rally continued despite news that North Korea had launched its second missile in a month over Japan. Instead, the market focused on strong performances from tech stocks.Standard & Poor\u2019s bellwether stocks index spent much of the day flirting with 2,500. In the final moments of the trading day, investors nudged the benchmark to 2,500.23, up nearly five points on the day. Other indexes, including the Dow Jones industrial average, also closed at record highs.While the stock-buying spree continues, the market\u2019s upward march has left some investors nervous that a geopolitical crisis or a sudden bout of bad financial or economic news could spark a downturn.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to be alarmingly overvalued, but it\u2019s possible things have gone too far,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. \u201dThough obviously that\u2019s hard to judge, because it\u2019s something we\u2019ll only realize in hindsight.\u201dThe S.&P. index has gained nearly 270 percent since March 2009, when the last bear market ended. A bull market is defined by a prolonged rally uninterrupted by any decline of 20 percent or more. The longest bull market lasted for roughly a decade between 1990 and 2000.The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 22,268.34, rising 0.29 percent, or 64.86 points. The Nasdaq composite narrowly missed the record of 6,460.19 it set on Wednesday, closing up 0.30 percent, or 19.38 points, at 6,448.47.Behind the recent rally are at least two trends. First, the technology sector has been on a tear, with investors racing to get a piece of companies that could become the next Apple or Google.Among Friday\u2019s biggest winners was Nvidia, a chip maker in California. Its shares rose 6.3 percent, or $10.71, to $180.11 after its leadership in artificial-intelligence development was lauded in a client note from Evercore ISI.Second, the extended period of ultralow interest rates has been a boon. The question is how long that will continue. Traders will closely monitor the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next week for any signs about its intentions. Inflation rose in August, increasing the likelihood that the Fed will lift rates by the end of the year.\u201cThe good times should keep on rolling for a while,\u201d said Barry Sine, director of research at Drexel Hamilton. \u201cThis is going to head to 2,800 by year end.\u201d\u201cThe initial impact of Harvey and Irma will be negative, but there\u2019s going to be a lot of economic activity \u2014 a huge number of cars getting replaced, more building,\u201d Mr. Sine said. \u201cAnd as that happens, we\u2019ll be going into the Christmas season.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Price Tag to Protect Speech at Berkeley: $600,000", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief.Free speech is expensive. That was one takeaway from the University of California, Berkeley campus on Thursday as the Berkeley College Republicans hosted Ben Shapiro, the latest in a line of conservative speakers to roil the flagship campus. The university estimated it spent $600,000 on security for Mr. Shapiro\u2019s visit, not a pittance for an institution that has struggled financially in recent years.Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, said a similar amount was spent in April to secure the campus during the planned visit, later canceled, of Ann Coulter, the right-wing pundit.Like Ms. Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos, another right-wing provocateur whose visit to the campus sparked outrage in February, Mr. Shapiro has made a career out of poking fun of liberal beliefs and casting college campuses as bastions of intellectual intolerance. The 1,000 tickets to see Mr. Shapiro\u2019s Thursday show, titled \u201cSay No To Campus Thuggery,\u201d sold out in less than an hour.This was not Mr. Shapiro\u2019s first speech at Berkeley. But in a measure of how politicized the free-speech issue has become at the campus, his previous visit in April 2016 occurred with little protest.On Thursday, with news helicopters hovering and hundreds of police officers deployed across the campus, many Berkeley students lamented they had become unwitting actors in a show of political Kabuki.Meanwhile, if the university needed another symbol of the cost of the ideological battles, Sproul Plaza, famous as the site of Free Speech movement protests of the 1960s, was closed off as a security precaution.Jim Wilson, our Bay Area photographer, captured some of the scenes on Thursday:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)State lawmakers have been voting on a flurry of bills during the final week of the legislative session.Among those sent to Gov.

{"Headline": "Lurid Lawsuit\u2019s Quiet End Leaves Silicon Valley Start-Up Barely Dented", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "For all the outcry over how women are treated in the tech industry, the resolution of a sexual harassment case against Upload, a virtual reality start-up, shows that little has changed.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At Upload, the parties never seemed to stop.The start-up began by hosting impromptu gatherings to promote virtual reality as the next big thing. It quickly became an entertainment and news hub for the VR industry, hosting hundreds of events. The crowds were young and eager to network. Models did demos, and the liquor flowed.The freewheeling atmosphere was not restricted to the evening hours. There was a \u201crampant sexual behavior and focus\u201d in the Upload office that created \u201can unbearable environment,\u201d a former employee, Elizabeth Scott, said in a lawsuit filed in May.Ms. Scott said in her suit that the Upload office had a room with a bed \u201cto encourage sexual intercourse at the workplace.\u201d It was referred to as the kink room. Men who worked for the company were described in the suit as frequently talking about being so sexually aroused by female colleagues that it was impossible to concentrate. When Ms. Scott, Upload\u2019s digital media manager, complained about the hostile atmosphere and other issues in March with her supervisor, she was fired, the suit said.In a statement after the suit was filed, Upload said that \u201cour employees are our greatest asset\u201d and that \u201cthese allegations are entirely without merit.\u201d The company said Upload\u2019s chief executive, Taylor Freeman, and president, Will Mason, could not discuss the lawsuit and its specifics. On Friday, as this article neared publication, the men issued another statement that said, \u201cWe let you down and we are sorry.\u201dIf the claims were striking, so was the response.A few weeks ago, the suit was crossed off Upload\u2019s to-do list when it was quietly settled for a modest sum, said two people with knowledge of the case who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Both sides had an incentive to come to terms: Upload could say the problem was now in its past, and Ms. Scott, 26, got a victory of sorts without the risk of going to trial.Shortly after Ms. Scott filed her suit, at least a half-dozen members of Upload\u2019s team quit in solidarity, but they did not go public with their complaints. (At its peak, the company had about 20 to 25 employees.) In interviews, two of those who left described what happened but said that even though they were now working elsewhere, they did not want their names used.Behind the scenes, in members-only Facebook groups and other forums, the virtual reality industry is still roiled. People have opinions, they just do not want to be caught uttering them.In more than two dozen interviews for this story, even those inclined to see Upload in the most favorable light said it was the story of a company run by young, immature men who were flush with cash and did not know how to handle their power.The situation at Upload was particularly fraught because its principal product was parties. In the great tradition of Silicon Valley start-ups, the company was less interested in making a profit than in getting attention, said former employees. So the line between work and play, often fuzzy, was entirely erased.The existence of the kink room became the enduring symbol of Upload as soon as Ms. Scott filed her suit. Employees of the porn site Kink.com came to an early Upload party and left behind a sign, said two people with knowledge of the events. It became the name of a room toward the front of the office, a narrow chamber equipped with a bed.\u201cThere was a lack of leadership to cultivate a healthy work environment, and investors who failed to take a more active role in oversight,\u201d Mr. Bye said. \u201cThe only way to resolve these sorts of problems is to confront them head on, and that is precisely what no one seemed prepared to do.\u201dUpload was founded in 2014 as entrepreneurs \u2014 many of them women \u2014 flocked to virtual reality. There was a feeling of vast potential in the young industry, a sense of being able to make a mark by moving quickly and meeting the right people.Upload was the place to do it. Two of the founders \u2014 a third had dropped out \u2014 were in their mid-20s, with energy and ideas but not many credentials. Mr. Freeman, the chief executive, listed \u201cbackpacking in Europe\u201d and \u201cfreelance user experience designer\u201d on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201cI tend to be fairly passionate about things and wear my heart on my sleeve,\u201d Mr. Mason explained in an email about his petition. \u201cLooking back, there are definitely ways I would handle this differently.\u201dAlthough Upload\u2019s ambitions were ill-defined, the company was popular from the start. It quickly raised $1.25 million. One of its most prominent early investors was Joe Kraus, a Silicon Valley veteran who is now at GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm. Mr. Kraus, who invested $25,000 of his own money in Upload, was described by the company as an adviser. He declined to be interviewed.Larger sums came from Shanda Group in China and, in a second funding round of $4.5 million, Colopl, a Japanese mobile gaming company. Colopl\u2019s Shintaro Yamakami is the only non-Upload employee on the company\u2019s board. A spokeswoman for Mr. Yamakami said he was currently \u201crefraining from public relations activity.\u201d A spokeswoman for Shanda, an investment firm, said, \u201cWe do not have comments to offer.\u201dMs. Scott joined Upload in April 2016. She had graduated in 2012 from Emory University, where she was president of a group called the Alliance for Sexual Assault Prevention.She declined to be interviewed. Her mother, Jenny Scott of Gainesville, Fla., said, \u201cElizabeth had several incidents growing up that targeted her physical safety and developed her sense of right and wrong.\u201dMs. Scott, whose Facebook page describes her as \u201cshort, sassy & blonde. Take it or leave it,\u201d managed the stories generated by Upload\u2019s writing team on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube, produced videos and handled relationships with software developers.She said in the suit that she had other work, too: The women at Upload were required to do what were called \u201cwomanly tasks,\u201d including cleaning up. They were also told to act like \u201cmommies\u201d to the men and help them with whatever they needed.The suit presented a portrait of a deeply entitled male culture, one that clashed with the fresh start VR seemed to offer the tech industry. But Ms. Scott\u2019s suit was the second in the virtual reality industry in just a few months to present such an unwelcoming picture.Two-thirds of the women, Ms. Hart said, had experienced unwanted sexual interactions, such as being groped or kissed, or hearing comments about the physical attractiveness of women colleagues and sexual jokes or references that made them uncomfortable. One-third talked about men they worked with expressing romantic interest that was not reciprocated.This and other surveys suggest that in some ways, Silicon Valley has not evolved much over 50 years, even as more and younger women arrived.Some young women said they did not expect much from Silicon Valley. Amanda Joan, a VR developer, said the \u201cmisogynistic and lewd culture\u201d described in Ms. Scott\u2019s suit was as common to Silicon Valley as heavy traffic and expensive housing.About 11 months after Ms. Scott joined Upload, Ms. Scott said in her suit, she complained to a supervisor about the office atmosphere, about being shunned by Mr. Freeman and Mr. Mason and about being paid less for equal work and forced to perform menial and demeaning tasks. She was subsequently fired.All the success on the surface masked a workplace where, one former employee said, \u201cwomen are seen as the candy in the room.\u201d At Upload events, VR technology was demonstrated by women hired from a company called Models in Tech. Ms. Scott\u2019s suit said the founders tried to secure \u201csubmissive Asian women\u201d for a fund-raising trip to Asia.\u201cUpload was a boisterous culture, a \u2018bro\u2019 culture,\u201d said another former employee, Greg Gopman, in an interview. \u201cVirtual reality is hyped and no one was hyping it more than Upload. Within the industry, they were loved for giving people attention in the most positive way. They had a lot of clout and were able to act as they wanted until someone called them out.\u201dMr. Gopman, 33, is mentioned in Ms. Scott\u2019s suit. Other male employees, the suit said, would talk about how he \u201crefuses to wear a condom\u201d and \u201chas had sex with over 1,000 people.\u201dMr. Freeman, the chief executive, said in an interview that the company was moving on. The lesson he learned, he said, was that employees need to talk more, and that especially in times of trouble they need someone to hear their complaints. Under the agreement to end Ms. Scott\u2019s suit, Mr. Freeman was precluded from discussing it.\u201cA lot of things could be avoided if there is an open line of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you have five people, male or female, at a start-up you need external HR. Not having someone to go talk to about your potential concerns just makes it so much worse.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re the strongest as a company that we\u2019ve ever been because of this.\u201dAs for Ms. Scott, she now works for a camera company. She told friends that she had numerous interviews with VR companies, but as soon as they found out she had filed suit against her previous employer, they all declined to hire her.A woman runs Upload now. Kind of.Anne Ahola Ward, a specialist in increasing internet traffic, was a consultant to Upload. In June, when many of the employees were quitting, she proposed taking over. Her title is chief operating officer.\u201cAnne has had a lot of experience, and experience is a huge thing,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. He demurred when asked whether she was the \u201cadult supervision\u201d that all start-ups are said to need. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults here,\u201d he said.Ms. Ward, 38, is wry about the opportunity.\u201cI\u2019m a woman in Silicon Valley,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think someone would have handed me the keys to a start-up that wasn\u2019t beleaguered?\u201d Her husband asked the obvious question: Why aren\u2019t you the chief executive? \u201cThe title isn\u2019t important to me,\u201d she said.The kink room is now Ms. Ward\u2019s office. There is no bed there. She has instituted mandatory anti-harassment training: a two-hour session led by an outside consultant. There is now a human resources department. People have formal job descriptions. And as a joke \u2014 but not quite \u2014 people in the office gave Ms. Ward a sheriff\u2019s badge.An article on Saturday about a lawsuit against the virtual reality start-up Upload misstated the age of Elizabeth Scott, the plaintiff in the case.

{"Headline": "Attacked by Rotten Tomatoes", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood had a horrible summer.Between the first weekend in May and Labor Day, a sequel-stuffed period that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales, box office revenue in North America totaled $3.8 billion, a 15 percent decline from the same span last year. To find a slower summer, you would have to go back 20 years. Business has been so bad that America\u2019s three biggest theater chains have lost roughly $4 billion in market value since May.Ready for the truly alarming part? Hollywood is blaming a website: Rotten Tomatoes.\u201cI think it\u2019s the destruction of our business,\u201d Brett Ratner, the director, producer and film financier, said at a film festival this year.Some studio executives privately concede that a few recent movies \u2014 just a few \u2014 were simply bad. Flawed marketing may have played a role in a couple of other instances, they acknowledged, along with competition from Netflix and Amazon.But most studio fingers point toward Rotten Tomatoes, which boils down hundreds of reviews to give films \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201crotten\u201d scores on its Tomatometer. The site has surged in popularity, attracting 13.6 million unique visitors in May, a 32 percent increase above last year\u2019s total for the month, according to the analytics firm comScore.Studio executives\u2019 complaints about Rotten Tomatoes include the way its Tomatometer hacks off critical nuance, the site\u2019s seemingly loose definition of who qualifies as a critic and the spread of Tomatometer scores across the web. Last year, scores started appearing on Fandango, the online movie ticket-selling site, leading to grousing that a rotten score next to the purchase button was the same as posting this message: You are an idiot if you pay to see this movie.Mr. Ratner\u2019s sentiment was echoed almost daily in studio dining rooms all summer, although not for attribution, for fear of giving Rotten Tomatoes more credibility. Over lunch last month, the chief executive of a major movie company looked me in the eye and declared flatly that his mission was to destroy the review-aggregation site.How did a clunky website that has been around for 19 years amass such power?The 36 people who work for Rotten Tomatoes hardly seem like industry killers. The site\u2019s staff occupies a relatively ordinary Beverly Hills office complex \u2014 albeit one with conference rooms named \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cOz\u201d \u2014 and includes people like Jeff Voris, an easygoing former Disney executive with graying hair who oversees operations, and Timothy Ryan, a former newspaper reporter who is a Rotten Tomatoes senior editor and lists \u201cLeonard Maltin\u2019s Movie Guide\u201d as favorite reading.The employee with the pink mohawk is Grae Drake, senior movie editor. She does a lot of video interviews and lately has been helping to fill a void created when Matt Atchity left as editor in chief in July for a bigger job at TYT Network, an online video company.Jeff Giles, a 12-year Rotten Tomatoes veteran and the author of books like \u201cLlanview in the Afternoon: An Oral History of \u2018One Life to Live\u2019,\u201d writes what the site calls Critics Consensus, a one-sentence summary of the response to each film. (Disney\u2019s latest \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie was summarized as proving \u201cthat neither a change in directors nor an undead Javier Bardem is enough to drain this sinking franchise\u2019s murky bilge.\u201d)\u201cEveryone here sweats the details every day,\u201d said Paul Yanover, the president of Fandango, which owns Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cBecause we are serious movie fans ourselves, our priority \u2014 our entire focus \u2014 is being as useful to fans as we absolutely can be.\u201dHold on a minute. Fandango?Mr. Yanover said it was silly for studios to make Rotten Tomatoes a box office scapegoat.\u201cThere is no question that there is some correlation to box office performance \u2014 critics matter \u2014 but I don\u2019t think Rotten Tomatoes can definitively make or break a movie in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who says otherwise is cherry-picking examples to create a hypothesis.\u201dHe cited \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d which was the No. 1 movie of the summer, with $410 million in ticket sales. It was undoubtedly helped by a strong Tomatometer score of 92. \u201cDunkirk,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d all received high scores and drew huge crowds. Other films did not do well on the Tomatometer (\u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard,\u201d \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d) but still managed to find audiences.Some filmmakers complain bitterly that Rotten Tomatoes casts too wide a critical net. The site says it works with some 3,000 critics worldwide, including bloggers and YouTube-based pundits. But should reviewers from Screen Junkies and Punch Drunk Critics really be treated as the equals of those from The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker?For the studios, the question of how individual reviews get classified as fresh or rotten is also a point of contention. Only about half of critics self-submit reviews and classifications to the site. Rotten Tomatoes staffers comb the web and pull the other half themselves. They then assign positive or negative grades.\u201cWe have a well-defined process,\u201d said Mr. Voris, the vice president of Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cOur curators audit each other\u2019s work. If there is any question about how a review should be classified, we have three curators separate and do independent reads. If there still isn\u2019t agreement, we call the journalist.\u201dStaff members also fact-check what critics have self-submitted. In one recent instance, a review of \u201cAlien: Covenant\u201d that was submitted as fresh seemed rotten. The site reversed the categorization after contacting the critic for clarification.Mr. Voris brushed aside the studios\u2019 protests \u2014 shared by many critics \u2014 that the Tomatometer ratings damage films because they reduce nuanced reviews to blunt scores.Still, it is the Tomatometer scores that have become ubiquitous across the web. Rotten Tomatoes makes money through partnerships with companies like Apple, which lists the scores next to iTunes movie rentals and purchases. And to the dismay of movie marketers, Google has started to prominently display the scores even when users do not specifically search for them: Enter the name of a film into the search bar and the Tomatometer results pop up on the top right side of the results page, directly under the film\u2019s poster.\u201cRotten Tomatoes isn\u2019t new, but its omnipresence is,\u201d said Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s president of theatrical marketing. \u201cThe scores are even part of the local TV news on Friday going into the weekend.\u201dIn past years, studio publicists would occasionally lobby Rotten Tomatoes to include positive reviews from far-flung publications as a way of improving scores, especially for films with a 59 \u2014 on the line between receiving a red, plump fruit label (fresh) or the dreaded splotch of green goo (rotten). But Hollywood more or less lived with it.Four things changed.There was Fandango\u2019s integration of Tomatometer scores with its ticketing platforms, which service about 28,000 movie screens in North America. Now, when Fandango customers buy tickets to a movie in the days leading up to its release, they are confronted by the film\u2019s Tomatometer score. After the movie is released, a different Rotten Tomatoes rating \u2014 one based on audience response, which is invariably positive \u2014 begins to pop up on Fandango next to the Tomatometer score.Then there is Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 growth into a very popular hub. In 2009, the site, which sells advertising, attracted about 1.8 million unique visitors per month. It now attracts as many as 14 million unique visitors a month. The broader Fandango portfolio of sites reaches 60 million unique visitors a month.Consumer behavior is also changing. People increasingly rely on review aggregation sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor to make all kinds of spending decisions. The trend is especially visible among young people, who make up Hollywood\u2019s most important audience. According to National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm, 34 percent of American teenagers now check Rotten Tomatoes before buying a ticket, up from 23 percent in 2014.Most importantly, studios are panicking because moviegoing is no longer a habit for most Americans. Because of climbing prices and competition from other forms of entertainment, a trip to the multiplex has become a special event. In particular, more movie fans are ignoring low- and mid-budget films when they are in theaters: Ehh, let\u2019s wait until they show up on Netflix.Studios are trying to battle Rotten Tomatoes on multiple fronts.Another way to undercut Rotten Tomatoes involves restricting reviews until the last possible minute. Sony set a review embargo of opening day for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which left the Tomatometer blank until after many advance tickets had been sold and families had made weekend plans. \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which ultimately received a Tomatometer score of 8, squeezed out decent opening-weekend ticket sales of $24.5 million.If Rotten Tomatoes is a monster, the studios helped create it. As much as they fear and loathe low scores, they love high ones. Sony recently ended its trailer for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d a heist thriller, by flashing the Rotten Tomatoes logo and \u201c100 percent,\u201d the film\u2019s Tomatometer score at the time. (It later slipped to 94.) Annapurna did the same thing for \u201cDetroit\u201d in television ads. (Not that it helped; that drama flopped.)And Rotten Tomatoes is getting stronger. The site is working to build its Tomatometer scores for TV shows into a more formidable force. Also in development are a half-dozen video series, including one built around a cheeky event created by Ms. Drake, the senior movie editor, called Your Opinion Sucks.At that event, which started at the Comic-Con International fan convention in San Diego a few years ago, movie fans debate critics. The hourlong sessions can get heated.\u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s not an accident that I chose a costume that needs a whip,\u201d Ms. Drake said as she prepared to co-host one of three sessions at Comic-Con in July. (She was dressed as Catwoman.)Snarky wisecracks from the critics and hosts started to fly. The stars have as much chemistry as \u201ca mop and a bucket,\u201d one said. Ms. Drake\u2019s co-host, the comedian Scott Aukerman, said that \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth movie in the action series, should have been called \u201cNo one wants to act with Vin Diesel anymore\u201d because the actor had a separate storyline for much of the film.It was time for the audience to vote. Most of the 200 or so people assembled raised green paddles, and so the movie was pronounced rotten.With an intestinal gurgle sound effect.Advertisement"}

I respect the wishes of the Colvin family and join in honoring Mark Colvin\u2019s memory as a courageous foreign correspondent and an extraordinary writer and broadcaster. And I\u2019d particularly like to thank Michael Fullilove for not rescinding the invitation.This has become the depressing trend on American university campuses, where the roster of disinvited speakers and forced cancellations includes former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, former Harvard University President Larry Summers, actor Alec Baldwin, human-rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, DNA co-discoverer James Watson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, filmmaker Michael Moore, conservative Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George Will and liberal Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen, to name just a few.So illustrious is the list that, on second thought, I\u2019m beginning to regret that you didn\u2019t disinvite me after all.The title of my talk tonight is \u201cThe Dying Art of Disagreement.\u201d This is a subject that is dear to me \u2014 literally dear \u2014 since disagreement is the way in which I have always earned a living. Disagreement is dear to me, too, because it is the most vital ingredient of any decent society.To say the words, \u201cI agree\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s agreeing to join an organization, or submit to a political authority, or subscribe to a religious faith \u2014 may be the basis of every community.And the problem, as I see it, is that we\u2019re failing at the task.This is a puzzle. At least as far as far as the United States is concerned, Americans have rarely disagreed more in recent decades.We disagree about racial issues, bathroom policies, health care laws, and, of course, the 45th president. We express our disagreements in radio and cable TV rants in ways that are increasingly virulent; street and campus protests that are increasingly violent; and personal conversations that are increasingly embittering.This is yet another age in which we judge one another morally depending on where we stand politically.The polarization is geographic, as more people live in states and communities where their neighbors are much likelier to share their politics.The polarization is personal: Fully 50 percent of Republicans would not want their child to marry a Democrat, and nearly a third of Democrats return the sentiment. Interparty marriage has taken the place of interracial marriage as a family taboo.Finally the polarization is electronic and digital, as Americans increasingly inhabit the filter bubbles of news and social media that correspond to their ideological affinities. We no longer just have our own opinions. We also have our separate \u201cfacts,\u201d often the result of what different media outlets consider newsworthy. In the last election, fully 40 percent of Trump voters named Fox News as their chief source of news.Thanks a bunch for that one, Australia.It\u2019s usually the case that the more we do something, the better we are at it. Instead, we\u2019re like Casanovas in reverse: the more we do it, the worse we\u2019re at it. Our disagreements may frequently hoarsen our voices, but they rarely sharpen our thinking, much less change our minds.It behooves us to wonder why.* * *Thirty years ago, in 1987, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago named Allan Bloom \u2014 at the time best known for his graceful translations of Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic\u201d and Rousseau\u2019s \u201cEmile\u201d \u2014 published a learned polemic about the state of higher education in the United States. It was called \u201cThe Closing of the American Mind.\u201dThe book appeared when I was in high school, and I struggled to make my way through a text thick with references to Plato, Weber, Heidegger and Strauss. But I got the gist \u2014 and the gist was that I\u2019d better enroll in the University of Chicago and read the great books. That is what I did.What was it that one learned through a great books curriculum? Certainly not \u201cconservatism\u201d in any contemporary American sense of the term. We were not taught to become American patriots, or religious pietists, or to worship what Rudyard Kipling called \u201cthe Gods of the Market Place.\u201d We were not instructed in the evils of Marxism, or the glories of capitalism, or even the superiority of Western civilization.As I think about it, I\u2019m not sure we were taught anything at all. What we did was read books that raised serious questions about the human condition, and which invited us to attempt to ask serious questions of our own. Education, in this sense, wasn\u2019t a \u201cteaching\u201d with any fixed lesson. It was an exercise in interrogation.To listen and understand; to question and disagree; to treat no proposition as sacred and no objection as impious; to be willing to entertain unpopular ideas and cultivate the habits of an open mind \u2014 this is what I was encouraged to do by my teachers at the University of Chicago.It\u2019s what used to be called a liberal education.The University of Chicago showed us something else: that every great idea is really just a spectacular disagreement with some other great idea.Socrates quarrels with Homer. Aristotle quarrels with Plato. Locke quarrels with Hobbes and Rousseau quarrels with them both. Nietzsche quarrels with everyone. Wittgenstein quarrels with himself.These quarrels are never personal. Nor are they particularly political, at least in the ordinary sense of politics. Sometimes they take place over the distance of decades, even centuries.\u201cThe Closing of the American Mind\u201d took its place in the tradition of these quarrels. Since the 1960s it had been the vogue in American universities to treat the so-called \u201cDead White European Males\u201d of the Western canon as agents of social and political oppression. Allan Bloom insisted that, to the contrary, they were the best possible instruments of spiritual liberation.He also insisted that to sustain liberal democracy you needed liberally educated people. This, at least, should not have been controversial. For free societies to function, the idea of open-mindedness can\u2019t simply be a catchphrase or a dogma. It needs to be a personal habit, most of all when it comes to preserving an open mind toward those with whom we disagree.* * *That habit was no longer being exercised much 30 years ago. And if you\u2019ve followed the news from American campuses in recent years, things have become a lot worse.These attitudes are being made plain nearly every week on one college campus or another.The protesters succeeded in shutting down the lecture. We were forced to move to another site and broadcast our discussion via live stream, while activists who had figured out where we were banged on the windows and set off fire alarms. Afterward, as Dr. Murray and I left the building . . . a mob charged us.Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray, but when I took his right arm to shield him and to make sure we stayed together, the crowd turned on me. Someone pulled my hair, while others were shoving me. I feared for my life. Once we got into the car, protesters climbed on it, hitting the windows and rocking the vehicle whenever we stopped to avoid harming them. I am still wearing a neck brace, and spent a week in a dark room to recover from a concussion caused by the whiplash.Middlebury is one of the most prestigious liberal-arts colleges in the United States, with an acceptance rate of just 16 percent and tuition fees of nearly $50,000 a year. How does an elite institution become a factory for junior totalitarians, so full of their own certitudes that they could indulge their taste for bullying and violence?There\u2019s no one answer. What\u2019s clear is that the mis-education begins early. I was raised on the old-fashioned view that sticks and stones could break my bones but words would never hurt me. But today there\u2019s a belief that since words can cause stress, and stress can have physiological effects, stressful words are tantamount to a form of violence. This is the age of protected feelings purchased at the cost of permanent infantilization.The mis-education continues in grade school. As the Brookings findings indicate, younger Americans seem to have no grasp of what our First Amendment says, much less of the kind of speech it protects. This is a testimony to the collapse of civics education in the United States, creating the conditions that make young people uniquely susceptible to demagogy of the left- or right-wing varieties.Another consequence of identity politics is that it has made the distance between making an argument and causing offense terrifyingly short. Any argument that can be cast as insensitive or offensive to a given group of people isn\u2019t treated as being merely wrong. Instead it is seen as immoral, and therefore unworthy of discussion or rebuttal.The result is that the disagreements we need to have \u2014 and to have vigorously \u2014 are banished from the public square before they\u2019re settled. People who might otherwise join a conversation to see where it might lead them choose instead to shrink from it, lest they say the \u201cwrong\u201d thing and be accused of some kind of political -ism or -phobia. For fear of causing offense, they forego the opportunity to be persuaded.Take the arguments over same-sex marriage, which you are now debating in Australia. My own views in favor of same-sex marriage are well known, and I hope the Yes\u2019s wins by a convincing margin.But if I had to guess, I suspect the No\u2019s will exceed whatever they are currently polling. That\u2019s because the case for same-sex marriage is too often advanced not by reason, but merely by branding every opponent of it as a \u201cbigot\u201d \u2014 just because they are sticking to an opinion that was shared across the entire political spectrum only a few years ago. Few people like outing themselves as someone\u2019s idea of a bigot, so they keep their opinions to themselves even when speaking to pollsters. That\u2019s just what happened last year in the Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election, and look where we are now.If you want to make a winning argument for same-sex marriage, particularly against conservative opponents, make it on a conservative foundation: As a matter of individual freedom, and as an avenue toward moral responsibility and social respectability. The No\u2019s will have a hard time arguing with that. But if you call them morons and Neanderthals, all you\u2019ll get in return is their middle finger or their clenched fist.One final point about identity politics: It\u2019s a game at which two can play. In the United States, the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d justifies its white-identity politics in terms that are coyly borrowed from the progressive left. One of the more dismaying features of last year\u2019s election was the extent to which \u201cwhite working class\u201d became a catchall identity for people whose travails we were supposed to pity but whose habits or beliefs we were not supposed to criticize. The result was to give the Trump base a moral pass it did little to earn.* * *So here\u2019s where we stand: Intelligent disagreement is the lifeblood of any thriving society. Yet we in the United States are raising a younger generation who have never been taught either the how or the why of disagreement, and who seem to think that free speech is a one-way right: Namely, their right to disinvite, shout down or abuse anyone they dislike, lest they run the risk of listening to that person \u2014 or even allowing someone else to listen. The results are evident in the parlous state of our universities, and the frayed edges of our democracies.Can we do better?This is supposed to be a lecture on the media, and I\u2019d like to conclude this talk with a word about the role that editors and especially publishers can play in ways that might improve the state of public discussion rather than just reflect and accelerate its decline.I began this talk by noting that Americans have rarely disagreed so vehemently about so much. On second thought, this isn\u2019t the whole truth.Yes, we disagree constantly. But what makes our disagreements so toxic is that we refuse to make eye contact with our opponents, or try to see things as they might, or find some middle ground.Instead, we fight each other from the safe distance of our separate islands of ideology and identity and listen intently to echoes of ourselves. We take exaggerated and histrionic offense to whatever is said about us. We banish entire lines of thought and attempt to excommunicate all manner of people \u2014 your humble speaker included \u2014 without giving them so much as a cursory hearing.The crucial prerequisite of intelligent disagreement \u2014 namely: shut up; listen up; pause and reconsider; and only then speak \u2014 is absent.Perhaps the reason for this is that we have few obvious models for disagreeing well, and those we do have \u2014 such as the Intelligence Squared debates in New York and London or Fareed Zakaria\u2019s show on CNN \u2014 cater to a sliver of elite tastes, like classical music.Fox News and other partisan networks have demonstrated that the quickest route to huge profitability is to serve up a steady diet of high-carb, low-protein populist pap. Reasoned disagreement of the kind that could serve democracy well fails the market test. Those of us who otherwise believe in the virtues of unfettered capitalism should bear that fact in mind.I do not believe the answer, at least in the U.S., lies in heavier investment in publicly sponsored television along the lines of the BBC. It too, suffers, from its own form of ideological conformism and journalistic groupthink, immunized from criticism due to its indifference to competition.Nor do I believe the answer lies in a return to what in America used to be called the \u201cFairness Doctrine,\u201d mandating equal time for different points of view. Free speech must ultimately be free, whether or not it\u2019s fair.But I do think there\u2019s such a thing as private ownership in the public interest, and of fiduciary duties not only to shareholders but also to citizens. Journalism is not just any other business, like trucking or food services. Nations can have lousy food and exemplary government, as Great Britain demonstrated for most of the last century. They can also have great food and lousy government, as France has always demonstrated.But no country can have good government, or a healthy public square, without high-quality journalism \u2014 journalism that can distinguish a fact from a belief and again from an opinion; that understands that the purpose of opinion isn\u2019t to depart from facts but to use them as a bridge to a larger idea called \u201ctruth\u201d; and that appreciates that truth is a large enough destination that, like Manhattan, it can be reached by many bridges of radically different designs. In other words, journalism that is grounded in facts while abounding in disagreements.I believe it is still possible \u2014 and all the more necessary \u2014 for journalism to perform these functions, especially as the other institutions that were meant to do so have fallen short. But that requires proprietors and publishers who understand that their role ought not to be to push a party line, or be a slave to Google hits and Facebook ads, or provide a titillating kind of news entertainment, or help out a president or prime minister who they favor or who\u2019s in trouble.Their role is to clarify the terms of debate by championing aggressive and objective news reporting, and improve the quality of debate with commentary that opens minds and challenges assumptions rather than merely confirming them.This is journalism in defense of liberalism, not liberal in the left-wing American or right-wing Australian sense, but liberal in its belief that the individual is more than just an identity, and that free men and women do not need to be protected from discomfiting ideas and unpopular arguments. More than ever, they need to be exposed to them, so that we may revive the arts of disagreement that are the best foundation of intelligent democratic life.The honor the Lowy Institute does tonight\u2019s nominees is an important step in that direction. What they have uncovered, for the rest of you to debate, is the only way by which our democracies can remain rational, reasonable, and free.An earlier version of this article misidentified Charles Murray\u2019s host for his speech at Middlebury College.

{"Headline": "Want Geniuses? Welcome Immigrants", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe \u201csome are rapists,\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s nasty words. But many are geniuses. Just ask the MacArthur Foundation, which responded to our president\u2019s frequent demonization of immigrants, including that infamous phrase, by doing a little math.Every year since 1981, the foundation has bestowed so-called genius grants on more than 20 of the country\u2019s most accomplished and promising scientists, scholars, artists and writers. These awards are a huge deal, trumpeted in the media and worn with pride forevermore. And the winners, typically in the middle of their careers, get $625,000 each.Conrad wondered whether MacArthur fellows are anomalies. They\u2019re not. She looked back over the past three and a half decades \u2014 which is the life span of the fellowships \u2014 to see who\u2019d received other top honors given only to United States citizens and residents.He studied hard and got a master\u2019s degree from Princeton. He said that his four siblings, like him, have good jobs, two as high school teachers. Long before Trump\u2019s campaign, he heard and cringed at complaints that Mexican immigrants were criminals, freeloaders. \u201cEspecially early on, I began to believe: Maybe I was lazy, maybe I was broken?\u201d said Qui\u00f1onez, 46, who now lives in Oakland, Calif. \u201cBut there was something in our family that helped us reject that narrative. We fought back against that narrative. I never allowed it to seep into my soul.\u201dIt\u2019s possible that the bounty of immigrants who\u2019ve won MacArthur grants demonstrates some predisposition among foundation executives toward certain life stories and a desire to promote people who have been overlooked and underappreciated. Some critics of the foundation have asserted that.But it\u2019s worth noting that if the foundation took into account children of immigrants as well as immigrants themselves, the percentage of its geniuses that reflects the benefits of immigration would be higher than 21.7. It\u2019s also worth noting that for most of the grant\u2019s history, foreign-born people constituted less than 10 percent of the United States population.I asked her what she made of immigrants\u2019 prevalence among MacArthur geniuses. \u201cI think most of us feel very lucky to be here, so we work extremely hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think maybe trauma is part of what drives us.\u201d She added that in terms of innovation, \u201cHaving the different perspectives, having the different life experiences, makes you see things differently.\u201d Fresh ideas and great art are often born that way.Conrad, the MacArthur Foundation executive, said that in all the debate lately about how many immigrants our country needs for jobs of varying skill levels, she hears too little about the ambient impact of immigrants on America\u2019s creative climate. \u201cThey have certain attributes,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey are risk takers.\u201d And their thinking and discoveries are nourished by \u201cthe experience of dislocation, of navigating a new culture and a new set of norms,\u201d she said.They come with a sort of hunger and a kind of gaze that don\u2019t subtract from what those of us already here have but, instead, add to it. They give us insights, inventions, art. Embracing their genius is the genius of America.An earlier version of this column described the acronym STEM incorrectly.

{"Headline": "Facebook Wins, Democracy Loses", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 On Wednesday, Facebook revealed that hundreds of Russia-based accounts had run anti-Hillary Clinton ads precisely aimed at Facebook users whose demographic profiles implied a vulnerability to political propaganda. It will take time to prove whether the account owners had any relationship with the Russian government, but one thing is clear: Facebook has contributed to, and profited from, the erosion of democratic norms in the United States and elsewhere.The audacity of a hostile foreign power trying to influence American voters rightly troubles us. But it should trouble us more that Facebook makes such manipulation so easy, and renders political ads exempt from the basic accountability and transparency that healthy democracy demands.The majority of the Facebook ads did not directly mention a presidential candidate, according to Alex Stamos, head of security at Facebook, but \u201cappeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201dThe ads \u2014 about 3,000 placed by 470 accounts and pages spending about $100,000 \u2014 were what the advertising industry calls \u201cdark posts,\u201d seen only by a very specific audience, obscured by the flow of posts within a Facebook News Feed and ephemeral. Facebook calls its \u201cdark post\u201d service \u201cunpublished page post ads.\u201dThis should not surprise us. Anyone can deploy Facebook ads. They are affordable and easy. That\u2019s one reason that Facebook has grown so quickly, taking in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, virtually all of it from advertisers, by serving up the attention of two billion Facebook users across the globe.The service is popular among advertisers for its efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness. Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more. There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it\u2019s being used for commerce instead of politics. What\u2019s alarming is that Facebook executives don\u2019t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.A core principle in political advertising is transparency \u2014 political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from. And it\u2019s expensive to run even one version of an ad in traditional outlets, let alone a dozen different versions. Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.None of that transparency matters to Facebook. Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing. The potential for abuse is vast. An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened. Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.Unfortunately, the range of potential responses to this problem is limited. The First Amendment grants broad protections to publishers like Facebook. Diplomacy, even the harsh kind, has failed to dissuade Russia from meddling. And it\u2019s even less likely to under the current administration.Daniel Kreiss, a communication scholar at the University of North Carolina, proposes that sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a repository of campaign ads so that regulators, scholars, journalists and the public can examine and expose them. But the companies have no impetus to concur and coordinate. And Congress is unlikely to reform a system that campaigns are just learning to master.Facebook has no incentive to change its ways. The money is too great. The issue is too nebulous to alienate more than a few Facebook users. The more that Facebook saturates our lives, families and communities, the harder it is to live without it.Facebook has pledged to install better filtering systems using artificial intelligence and machine-learning to flag accounts that are run by automated \u201cbots\u201d or violate the site\u2019s terms of service. But these are just new versions of the technologies that have caused the problem in the first place. And there would be no accountability beyond Facebook\u2019s word. The fact remains that in the arms race to keep propaganda flowing, human beings review troublesome accounts only long after the damage has been done.Our best hopes sit in Brussels and London. European regulators have been watching Facebook and Google for years. They have taken strong actions against both companies for violating European consumer data protection standards and business competition laws. The British government is investigating the role Facebook and its use of citizens\u2019 data played in the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 national elections.We are in the midst of a worldwide, internet-based assault on democracy. Scholars at the Oxford Internet Institute have tracked armies of volunteers and bots as they move propaganda across Facebook and Twitter in efforts to undermine trust in democracy or to elect their preferred candidates in the Philippines, India, France, the Netherlands, Britain and elsewhere. We now know that agents in Russia are exploiting the powerful Facebook advertising system directly.In the 21st-century social media information war, faith in democracy is the first casualty.Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, is writing a book about Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coming War on Business", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe only time I saw Sam Francis face-to-face \u2014 in the Washington Times cafeteria sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s \u2014 I thought he was a crank, but it\u2019s clear now that he was at that moment becoming one of the most prescient writers of the past 50 years. There\u2019s very little Donald Trump has done or said that Francis didn\u2019t champion a quarter century ago.In a series of essays for conservative magazines like Chronicles, Francis hammered home three key insights. The first was that globalization was screwing Middle America. The Cold War had just ended, capitalism seemed triumphant and the Clinton years seemed to be an era of broad prosperity. But Francis stressed that the service economy was ruining small farms and taking jobs from the working class.His second insight was that the Republican and conservative establishment did not understand what was happening. He railed against the pro-business \u201cEconomic Men\u201d who thought G.D.P. growth could solve the nation\u2019s problems, and the Washington Republicans, who he thought were infected with the values of the educated elites.In 1991, when his political mentor, Pat Buchanan, was contemplating a presidential bid, Francis told him to break with the conservative movement. \u201cThese people are defunct,\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cGo to New Hampshire and call yourself a patriot, a nationalist, an America Firster, but don\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.\u201dHis third insight was that politics was no longer about left versus right. Instead, a series of smaller conflicts \u2014 religious versus secular, nationalist versus globalist, white versus nonwhite \u2014 were all merging into a larger polarity, ruling class versus Middle America.\u201cMiddle American groups are more and more coming to perceive their exploitation at the hands of the dominant elites. The exploitation works on several fronts \u2014 economically, by hypertaxation and the design of a globalized economy dependent on exports and services in place of manufacturing; culturally, by the managed destruction of Middle American norms and institutions; and politically, by the regimentation of Middle Americans under the federal leviathan.\u201dMiddle American voters, he wrote, were stuck without a party, appalled by pro-corporate Republican economic policies on the one hand and liberal cultural radicalism on the other. They swung to whichever party seemed most likely to resist the ruling class, but neither party really provided a solution. \u201cA nationalist reaction is almost inevitable and will probably assume populist form when it arrives. The sooner it comes the better.\u201dFrancis urged Buchanan to run an unorthodox campaign (of the sort Trump ended up running), and was ignored. \u201cIf Buchanan loses the nomination, it will be because his time has not yet come,\u201d Francis wrote. The moment would end up coming in 2016, 11 years after Francis\u2019 death.Francis\u2019 thought was infected by the same cancer that may destroy Trumpism. Francis was a racist. His friends and allies counseled him not to express his racist views openly, but people like that always go there, sooner or later.The Civil War was an open wound for many in his circle, and in 1994 Francis told a conference, \u201cThe civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.\u201dHe was fired by The Washington Times and cast out of the conservative movement by William F. Buckley and others.When you look at today\u2019s world through the prism of Francis\u2019 work, a few things seem clear: Trump is not a one-time phenomenon; the populist tide has been rising for years. His base sticks with him through scandal because it\u2019s not just about him; it\u2019s a movement defined against the so-called ruling class. Congressional Republicans get all tangled on health care and other issues because they don\u2019t understand their voters. Finally, Trump may not be the culmination, but merely a way station toward an even purer populism.Trump is nominally pro-business. The next populism will probably take his ethnic nationalism and add an anti-corporate, anti-tech layer. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple stand for everything Francis hated \u2014 economically, culturally, demographically and nationalistically.As the tech behemoths intrude more deeply into daily life and our very minds, they will become a defining issue in American politics. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a new demagogue emerged, one that is even more pure Francis.Advertisement"}

He might not even be in town. And even if he were, he would make a point of staying below the radar.Now that stylists are media stars in their own right, that\u2019s a rare situation. Consider the surging profile of the self-described illusionist Arianne Phillips, the costume designer for Katy Perry, Madonna, \u201cKingsman\u201d and more. Or that of Karla Welch, who has engineered red carpet looks for Elisabeth Moss, Ruth Negga and Sarah Paulson as well as Justin Bieber and Lorde.Powerful public relations executives deny knowing him (if they even return an inquiring call). Ask in person and they change the subject. Designers whose clothes the first lady has worn are quick to say they have never met him, either (they\u2019re dying to, obviously). Locate a willing intermediary and Mr. Barthelat, as he is known, will decline \u2014 politely, firmly, repeatedly \u2014 to be interviewed. Like Meredith Koop, the stylist to Michelle Obama from 2009 to 2016, he prefers life behind the scenes.Even online, he hasn\u2019t left many traces. Aside from references to long-ago stints in the communications departments at midlevel brands like Zadig & Voltaire, Cerruti and Loft Design By, scant details turn up in a Google search. On Instagram, Mr. Barthelat is more inclined to post scenes of his home in Burgundy than anything fashion-related.But reality TV is not what paved his way to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Mr. Barthelat recognized Mrs. Macron at the theater late last year, before she became a media darling. In a fan moment, he worked up the courage to introduce himself. The call came shortly thereafter.Mrs. Macron\u2019s style has always skewed less-is-more. Judging by her public appearances since they began working together this year, Mr. Barthelat\u2019s influence has been both subtle and significant.The first lady has been loyal to Louis Vuitton, wearing designs by its artistic director, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, a friend whose runway shows she attended before becoming a public figure. Other classic French names in her wardrobe include Balmain, Courr\u00e8ges and Dior.But recently she has also taken to wearing sharp jackets by lesser known designers and labels: Alexandre Vauthier (in red or black), St\u00e9fanie Renoma (powder blue) and the tailoring specialist Pallas (beige, at the G20 meeting in July in Hamburg, Germany), the better to cast a halo around a larger group of French names.\u201cFor an unknown designer like me, it\u2019s wonderful to be in the spotlight,\u201d Mr. Auclert said, \u201cbut at the same time it\u2019s not about the brand. It\u2019s brainier than that.\u201cMrs. Macron epitomizes the 21st-century woman, particularly because of her intellect. That\u2019s the new generation. That\u2019s Mathieu. His service is all about excellence and expertise. It\u2019s so much more interesting than being a name brand.

{"Headline": "Amazon Wants You to Wake Up With Alexa, and That\u2019s Just the Start", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon released the first Echo smart speaker three years ago, not long after the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone proved to be a humiliating failure.So far, the results for the Echo have been anything but humiliating. Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities.On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks.Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick \u2014 aggressive pricing \u2014 and by finding ways to embed Alexa\u2019s hooks more deeply into customers\u2019 lives.If the strategy works, Amazon could gain an edge in a new wave of computing. Most big technology companies are convinced that voice commands and intelligent assistants will be primary ways that people interact with technology, perhaps more vital than touch screens and keyboards.David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said Wednesday that the company had about 5,000 employees working on Alexa projects. The company held its event on the 30th floor of one of its high-rise buildings in Seattle, where it had created a living room and kitchen to test how the Alexa devices worked in a homelike setting.The company has identified music, communications and controlling smart home appliances as the most popular uses of Alexa. Although Amazon has not released specific sales figures for Alexa devices, Mr. Limp said tens of millions had been sold.\u201cThey\u2019re literally scattering them around the house, putting them in hallways, workshops and garages,\u201d he said.Echo Spot, a $129.99 spherical device with a 2.5-inch touch screen, is Amazon\u2019s version of an alarm clock. In addition to displaying the time and weather, its microphones will allow people to make phone calls, turn lights on and off and ask how long a morning commute will take. A tiny camera makes videoconferencing possible.The device, and its camera, could also provide a test for Amazon. Whether customers feel comfortable having a camera aimed at their beds will depend partially on whether they trust Amazon to protect their privacy.Also introduced Wednesday was an updated version of the original, cylinder-shaped Echo. The new iteration is shorter, with sleeves made of fabric, wood veneer and other materials that allow it to blend in better with the rest of a home\u2019s d\u00e9cor. The company said it had improved the device\u2019s speakers as well. The biggest change is the price: $99.99 instead of the original Echo\u2019s $179.99.Another new device, Echo Plus, resembles the original Echo, but comes with technology that helps control certain household devices like light bulbs that are automated. Echo Plus, priced at $149.99, is designed to find many of those automated devices with little configuration required.A new version of Fire TV, the company\u2019s device for streaming internet video to televisions, is small enough to dangle from the back of a television\u2019s video port. Amazon said that media companies including Bravo, Netflix and Showtime planned to use a new Alexa capability that lets people use voice commands to control Fire TV video apps.Amazon also said that BMW Group had agreed to embed Alexa in its BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles starting next year, the latest in a series of relationships that Amazon has entered with carmakers to spread the use of Alexa outside the home.Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research said he believed Amazon\u2019s goal was to strengthen the loyalty of its customers, especially those enrolled in its Prime membership program.\u201cOverall, today\u2019s announcements felt like Amazon doubling down on its Echo and Alexa strategy,\u201d he said, adding that the company was \u201creminding all of us that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make money on Echo hardware for the strategy to be successful.\u201dMr. Dawson said the strategy created \u201cinteresting competitive challenges for others like Google and Apple who don\u2019t have such obvious non-hardware revenue streams associated with their smart voice speakers.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the devices introduced by Amazon on Wednesday. Is the updated version of the original Echo, not the Echo Plus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Lawmakers Pressure Facebook Over Racially Divisive Russian Ads", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Members of the Congressional Black Caucus pressured Facebook this week to seriously examine how the site allowed Russian operatives to use advertising to target Black Lives Matter and sow racial divisions ahead of last year\u2019s election.Now, Ms. Kelly said, she wants insight into how Facebook examines prospective advertisers, how it vets ads placed by foreign authorities and the \u201ctrue cost and scope of Russia advertisements placed during the 2016 election cycle.\u201dRepresentative Robin L. Kelly, Democrat of Illinois, sent a letter on Tuesday to Mark Zuckerberg, the C.E.O. of Facebook, expressing concern about the advertising practices of the social media company.\u201cIt is my belief that Facebook cannot be the Trojan horse through which America\u2019s vulnerabilities are exploited,\u201d Ms. Kelly wrote in the letter. \u201cWith the information we now have in tow, you have a moral responsibility to rigorously assess your advertising policies and implement reforms that ensure that malicious actors \u2014 both foreign and domestic \u2014 do not pervert your site to promote a divisive and destabilizing agenda.\u201dA spokesman for Facebook confirmed that the company received Ms. Kelly\u2019s letter and that it was in communication with her office.Ms. Kelly, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee\u2019s subcommittee on information technology, and several of her colleagues contacted Facebook seven days after President Trump\u2019s win in November to express deep concerns about Facebook allowing advertisers to exclude and target ethnic groups.Tuesday\u2019s letter ratchets up their concerns as several social networking sites face scrutiny from Congress and as other Congressional Black Caucus members such as Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, say they worry about Facebook\u2019s role in the election and in allowing users to discriminate online.Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, noted that for many African-Americans, the incident raised memories of past government-orchestrated espionage and intimidation efforts, such as the F.B.I.\u2019s surveillance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u201cHistorically, those in the struggle for civil rights have not only been forced to confront institutions of racism in our society, they have also been forced to confront attacks and espionage activity from individual actors and organizations in and outside of government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my hope that our tech community takes this matter seriously, is forthright with the special counsel and Congress, and does everything it can to make sure it is not manipulated like this again.\u201d\u201cWe will continue to work to build a community for all people,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe will do our part to defend against nation states attempting to spread misinformation and subvert elections. We\u2019ll keep working to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, and to ensure our community is a platform for all ideas and force for good in democracy.\u201dThe House Intelligence Committee also announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google officials have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Fake News Turned a Small Town Upside Down", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "FeatureAt the height of the 2016 election, exaggerated reports of a juvenile sex crime brought a media maelstrom to Twin Falls \u2014 one the Idaho city still hasn\u2019t recovered from.Supported by\u201cWe have been made aware of a situation,\u201d said the first speaker, an older man with a scraggly white beard who had hobbled up to the lectern. \u201cAn alleged assault of a minor child and we can\u2019t get any information on it. Apparently, it\u2019s been indicated that the perpetrators were foreign Muslim youth that conducted this \u2014 I guess it was a rape.\u201d Brown recognized the man as Terry Edwards. About a year earlier, after The Times-News reported that Syrian refugees would very likely be resettled in Twin Falls, Edwards joined a movement to shut the resettlement program down. The group circulated a petition to put the proposal before voters. They failed to get enough signatures to force a referendum, but Brown was struck by how much support around town the movement attracted. In bars after work, he began to overhear conversations about the dangers of Islam. One night, he heard a man joke about dousing the entrance to the local mosque with pig\u2019s blood.After he finished watching the video, Brown called the police chief, Craig Kingsbury, to get more information about the case. Kingsbury said that he couldn\u2019t discuss it and that the police reports were sealed because minors were involved. Brown made a couple phone calls: to the mayor and to his colleague at the paper who covers crime. He pieced together that 12 days earlier, three children had been discovered partly clothed inside a shared laundry room at the apartment complex where they lived. There were two boys, a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old, and a 5-year-old girl. The 7-year-old boy was accused of attempting some kind of sex act with the 5-year-old, and the 10-year-old had used a cellphone borrowed from his older brother to record it. The girl was American and, like most people in Twin Falls, white. The boys were refugees; Brown wasn\u2019t sure from where. In his article about the meeting, Brown seems to anticipate that the police chief\u2019s inability to elaborate was not going to sit well with the people whose testimony he had just watched.That weekend, Brown was on his way to see a movie when he received a Facebook message from Jim Dalos Jr., a 52-year-old known to Twin Falls journalists and police as Scanner Man. Dalos is disabled; he works six hours a week as a dishwasher at a pizzeria but spends most of his time in his apartment, sitting in a reclining chair and drinking Diet Pepsi out of a 52-ounce plastic mug, voraciously consuming news. He reads the local paper, old issues of which litter his living-room floor, and keeps the television blaring \u2014 usually Fox News. He got his nickname because he constantly monitors an old police scanner, a gift he received as a teenager from his father, and often calls in tips to the media based on what he hears. He also happens to live at the apartment complex, Fawnbrook, where the laundry-room incident occurred.Dalos told Brown that he had seen the police around Fawnbrook and that the victim\u2019s mother told him that the boys had been arrested. He also pointed Brown to a couple of Facebook groups that were created in response to the crime. Brown scrolled through them on his cellphone and saw links flying back and forth with articles that said that the little girl had been gang raped at knife point, that the perpetrators were Syrian refugees and that their fathers had celebrated with them afterward by giving them high fives. The stories also claimed that the City Council and the police department were conspiring to bury the crime.Over the weekend, Brown plowed through his daily packs of cigarettes as he watched hundreds, then thousands, of people joining the groups. Their panic appeared to be piqued by a mass shooting, the deadliest in American history, that had just occurred at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The perpetrator had declared allegiance to ISIS. The commenters also posted stories that claimed refugees were responsible for a rash of rapes in Europe and that a similar phenomenon in the United States was imminent. \u201cMy girl is blond and blue-eyed,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cI am extremely worried about her safety.\u201dThe details of the Fawnbrook case, as it became known, were still unclear to Brown, but he was skeptical of what he was reading. For one thing, he knew from his own previous reporting that no Syrians had been resettled in Twin Falls after all. He woke up early on Monday to get a head start on clarifying things as much as possible in order to write a follow-up article. Before he got into the office, a friend texted him, telling him to check the Drudge Report. At the top, a headline screamed: \u201cREPORT: Syrian \u2018Refugees\u2019 Rape Little Girl at Knifepoint in Idaho.\u201dMost Twin Falls residents are churchgoing, and about half of those are Mormons. Locally owned stores and restaurants are generally closed on Sundays, and the city has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936. Liberals often register as Republicans just to have an opportunity to participate in the electoral process, by voting in the primaries. If a Republican is going to win regardless, the thinking goes, they would at least like to play a role in deciding which one prevails.The same qualities that bind the townspeople together can, in turn, be alienating to newcomers. The refugee community has begun to experience this effect as its demographic makeup has changed. Over the past decade and a half, as conflict spread across North Africa and the Middle East, Twin Falls started to resettle larger numbers of refugees with darker skin who follow an unfamiliar religion \u2014 two things that make it difficult to blend into a town that is 80 percent white.On a national scale, an ascendant network of anti-Muslim activists and provocateurs has exploited the fears brought on by these changes, finding a platform and a receptive audience online. The narrative they espouse \u2014 on blogs with names like Jihad Watch \u2014 is that America, currently 1 percent Muslim, is in the midst of an Islamic invasion. Central to the worldview of these bloggers, some of whom have celebrity-size social-media followings, is that Muslims have a propensity toward sexual violence. They seize on any news item that bolsters this notion. Perhaps their biggest touchstone is an incident that took place in Cologne, Germany, on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2015. Mobs of men, many of them asylum seekers from the Middle East, pick-pocketed and groped more than a thousand women in and around a train station. The German police acknowledged the incident had taken place only under pressure, as the women\u2019s stories began to leak out through the media. This established, for these activists, the contours of a narrative that they believe has been repeating itself. The Fawnbrook incident quickly drew their interest.What happened in Twin Falls was sadly somewhat commonplace but not in the way the activists believed. The local Police Department investigates sex crimes on a weekly basis, and in about half a dozen of those that proceed to court each year, the victims and the accused are both minors. \u201cIf it\u2019s younger kids, it\u2019s them being curious,\u201d J.R. Paredez, the lead investigator on the case, explained to me. Some children who act out sexually have been victimized themselves, he said, while others have been exposed to explicit material at home or at school or, as is more common recently, on their cellphones. \u201cAs they start to get older, there\u2019s more of the actual sexual component to it.\u201dTwo weeks after the incident, the boys were charged with lewd and lascivious behavior against a minor. (The 14-year-old who lent his cellphone to the boys was initially charged with the same crime. He was not present in the laundry room, and his charge was eventually reduced to make him an accessory.) In Idaho, this statute applies to physical contact \u201cdone with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person, such minor child, or third party.\u201d Paredez said that the cellphone video made clear what specifically had happened between the children, but that he couldn\u2019t show it to the reporters who asked him about it, because doing so would have constituted criminal distribution of child pornography. He called most of the details that he read about the case on the internet \u201c100 percent false, like not even close to being accurate.\u201d (The family of the accused declined to comment.)As more time passed without a solid account of what happened inside the laundry room, lurid rumors continued to surface online and came to dominate conversations in grocery stores and at school events. And while the City Council members did not have control over the case, the bloggers who wrote about it placed much of the blame on them.On the Monday when Twin Falls was the top story on Drudge, the City Council held another weekly meeting. Normally only a handful of people attend, and Brown is one of the few reporters among them. But that night, the auditorium filled until there was standing room only, and television news crews appeared from Boise and other nearby cities. When it came time for public comments, one man got up and praised the city\u2019s handling of the case, followed by more than a dozen others who laid into the council members. Terry Edwards handed each of them a small copy of the Constitution and told them to do their jobs. A woman named Vicky Davis, her hair in a satiny white bob, stood up and proclaimed that Islam had declared jihad on America.\u201cThey are not compatible with our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cThey hate us. They don\u2019t want to be Americans. They don\u2019t want to assimilate. What do you need to see? What more proof do you need?\u201dThis was a highly unusual meeting, but Brown wasn\u2019t exactly surprised. Several months earlier, when the anti-refugee activists began to organize, he started reading up to try to better understand their views. He picked up a book by Ann Coulter and began to follow the anti-refugee blogs. At the meeting, he felt as if he were hearing all that he had read being repeated aloud by his neighbors.Kingsbury, the police chief, read from a statement while fumbling with a thicket of microphones piled onto the lectern by visiting reporters. In between exasperated breaths, he explained why he could not disclose the details of the incident but said that he could address some of the misinformation that was spreading online. There was no evidence of a knife, he said, or of any celebration afterward or of a cover-up, and no Syrians were involved: The boys were from Sudan and Iraq. \u201cI\u2019m a kid who grew up in Idaho,\u201d he said. \u201cLaw enforcement takes these types of allegations very seriously. However, we can\u2019t act on them within an hour. It\u2019s not like a crime show.\u201d He told the audience that the boys had been arrested, to applause.But online, Kingsbury\u2019s words only inflamed the activists more. Just after midnight, someone posted his work email address on Jihad Watch, along with those of the council members and the mayor. A commenter on another website called The Muslim Issue posted the phone numbers and email addresses for the town\u2019s government officials, the head of the refugee-resettlement center and some administrators at the college, which runs the refugee resettlement program. From there, the information spread to more blogs and to the comments sections of far-right news outlets with massive audiences.By 9 the next morning, messages were pouring into the inbox of the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, nearly every minute. Barigar grew up in a neighboring town and went to work in Boise as a television news anchor before moving back to start a family. His even keel and the air of sophistication he picked up while living in a comparatively big city have made him popular politically. He is left of the town on many social issues, which has made some of his constituents suspicious of him. But most of the people who contacted him that summer were from other states and even other countries. Some people demanded that the city pay for a new car and apartment for the victim and her family. Others said that local officials\u2019 attempts to correct inaccurate details about the incident were veiled efforts to suggest that no crime had occurred at all, in order to protect the refugees. Others accused him of being a \u201cglobalist,\u201d a word that has taken on many definitions but in this case meant he was part of a vast, arcane conspiracy. They believed that establishment politicians wanted to turn red states like Idaho blue by starting wars and then importing refugees from those war zones as cheap labor who would not only displace American workers but also reliably vote Democratic.Many of the people who wrote to the mayor had a much simpler goal: to unleash their hatred of Islam. One message, with the subject line \u201cMuslims,\u201d said that refugees were committing rapes and hit-and-runs and urinating on women and that the mayor was guilty of treason. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the bag, [expletive],\u201d it read. \u201cWe will and are holding you responsible for any and all crimes committed by these quote refugees. No courts. No police. Just us. You will answer to us in the darkness of night.\u201dThe next day, Camille Barigar, the mayor\u2019s wife, arrived in her office at the college, where she ran the performing-arts center, and started listening to her voice mail. In a calm, measured voice, a man who sounded as if he was reading from a script went on for nearly four minutes. \u201cI wonder, Miss Barigar, if your residence was posted online and your whereabouts identified, how you would feel if half a dozen Muslim men raped and sodomized you, Miss Barigar, and when you tried to scream, broke every tooth in your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I wonder how you\u2019d feel if, when you went to the Twin Falls Police Department, they told you to run along, that this is simply cultural diversity.\u201dThe caller said that life was \u201cbecoming difficult\u201d in the United States, just as it had in England. He referenced Jo Cox, a British member of Parliament who spoke out in support of refugees and later \u201cmet with opposition in the form of a bullet to the head.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s dead now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve buried her.\u201dThen 50, Stranahan was relatively new to journalism. He had spent a few decades as a television producer and a graphic illustrator in Los Angeles, and on the side he shot erotic photography, which is how he met his wife. Stranahan\u2019s transition into journalism began during the television writers\u2019 strike of 2007 and 2008. To keep himself entertained, he created parody political advertisements and posted them on YouTube. One of the first was a satirical Rudy Giuliani ad, asking Republican primary voters to support him because he had taken good care of his mistress, offering her private security courtesy of the N.Y.P.D., whereas Mitt Romney \u201cdidn\u2019t even bother\u201d to take on a paramour. Stranahan says that within weeks, the videos led to invitations to appear on CNN and to meet with a vice president at NBC and to a job offer, which he accepted, writing political comedy for The Huffington Post.In college, Stranahan was a libertarian and even attended Ayn Rand\u2019s funeral. But when he moved to California, he became a liberal, vehemently opposing the Iraq war and the presidency of George W. Bush. He voted for Barack Obama in 2008. Two years later, Stranahan interviewed Andrew Breitbart, a fellow Huffington Post alumnus, for an article he was writing about Jon Stewart\u2019s Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. They spoke for more than three hours, bonding over their shared love of Depeche Mode. Eventually, Breitbart became Stranahan\u2019s mentor, converted him to conservatism and offered him a job. In 2011, Breitbart took Stranahan to the Conservative Political Action Conference and introduced him to Michele Bachmann, who, in Stranahan\u2019s recollection, convinced him that she had uncovered disturbing details about Islam that no one in the establishment was willing to talk about. Stranahan says this conversation was the genesis of his concerns about the religion.Stranahan arrived in Idaho in August, after covering the national party conventions. The sealed nature of the case prevented any journalist from an exhaustive examination, and the accused and the victim\u2019s families refused to speak to the mainstream media. But Stranahan thrived in the void of facts. He was granted one of the few interviews with the victim\u2019s family, but his account of the crime offered little more information than others\u2019 had \u2014 and far more inaccuracies, according to the police and the county prosecutor. He described what took place as a \u201chorrific gang rape\u201d and wrote graphic details about the incident, which the Twin Falls Police say are untrue. On Breitbart radio, Stranahan openly wondered whether Barigar, the mayor, was \u201ca big, you know, Shariah supporter.\u201d And he suggested repeatedly that mass rapes by refugees had occurred in Europe and were inevitably coming to the United States. \u201cIf you want to wait until your country turns into France or Cologne, Germany. If you want to wait, you can wait,\u201d he warned the audience. \u201cBut if you want to watch it and stop it now, you\u2019ve got a chance to do it in November.\u201dStranahan says his Breitbart editors sent him to Twin Falls to report on the \u201cMuslim takeover\u201d of the town. (Breitbart denies this and says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd.\u201d) But he soon became enamored of a grander theory about what was happening in southern Idaho: globalism. He wrote that local businesses received government kickbacks for employing foreigners instead of Americans. (Stranahan did not cite any evidence of this, and it is untrue, according to the state Department of Labor.) And he often referred to a Syrian refugee crisis, though no Syrians were ever resettled there. Then, to bring the story full circle, he claimed these Muslim refugees were being used to replace American workers and that the government, big business and law enforcement were either conspiring to conceal the sexual-assault case or intentionally looking the other way, in order to keep the machine turning.\u201cBottom line, this is bad for business,\u201d he told me in an interview last winter, explaining his interpretation of the city officials\u2019 rationale: \u201c\u2009\u2018I\u2019m not really going to look into this too deeply because if I find out the truth, if I discover what actually happened, if I figure out the truth, it\u2019s not really good for business.\u2019\u2009\u201d Stranahan believed that Chobani, a Greek-yogurt company, was at the center of the scheme. Breitbart had been covering the company for months, ever since the owner, Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish-born businessman, made a speech at the World Economic Forum at Davos encouraging other chief executives to pledge financial and political support to refugees.While he was in town, Stranahan embedded with critics of the refugee program. They drove him to some of his interviews and to the yogurt factory to shoot drone footage. Stranahan doesn\u2019t get around well on his own in part because he has been mostly blind in one eye since grade school, when a neighborhood kid threw a rock at him, shattering his right optic nerve. Rather than a round pupil, his is jagged-edged, and so large that it nearly covers his iris. He shuffles when he walks because of neuropathic foot pain from diabetes, which he regulates by eating a ketogenic diet, usually one meal a day, consisting entirely of protein and fat. In Twin Falls, he subsisted most days on blackened chicken from Popeyes.During the three months he was in Twin Falls, City Council members refused his interview requests, leaving him stuck inside an echo chamber with the activists, which he amplified online. When I was in Twin Falls, I found myself empathizing: These same activists refused to speak with me. One of the most outspoken among them is a woman named Julie DeWolfe, who lives atop a grassy hill 20 minutes outside town and who spent significant time with Stranahan. When I went there to ask for an interview, she came outside with several barking dogs and told me to leave. \u201cThe company you work for is not trustworthy,\u201d she said.As the summer came to a close, The Times-News was bombarded with threatening phone calls and email from all over. After it received a threat that was deemed credible enough to engage the F.B.I., the editor of the paper told Brown and the other reporters to conduct their interviews outside the office and ordered the entire staff to walk in pairs when going out to their cars. For months, the reporters covered protests around town, which were widely hyped on social media but, for the most part, sparsely attended. At least once the Police Department deployed plainclothes officers into the crowds, with instructions to look after the journalists. Later, it turned out that fake Facebook accounts linked to the Russian government helped to spread stories about Twin Falls and even organized one of the rallies there. The event was also poorly attended but is the first known Russian attempt to spark a demonstration on American soil.The phone and email attacks continued through the fall and spiked each time a new conspiracy theory was posted online. One council member told me that she gained 15 pounds from the stress. At night, Shawn Barigar would lie down with his iPad and spend hours reading stories that called him a crook, a liar or an ISIS sympathizer. He had to shut down his Twitter account after someone accused him of having been convicted of sexual assault. Before he could debunk the myth, the post had spread, leaving untold numbers of constituents under the impression that he was a rapist. He stopped sleeping and struggled to focus at work or to be present with his family. He and his wife say they bickered all summer.\u201cIt was like being in a hole,\u201d he told me, his eyes welling up with tears. \u201cIt was all-consuming.\u201dHe expressed no contrition about the reporting he did in Twin Falls, though many of the conclusions that he drew on the radio and online have been debunked. Still, many of the outlets that covered Twin Falls made only minor tweaks to their stories or did nothing at all. Many of the falsehoods that were written about the Fawnbrook case still appear at the top of a Google search of the city.The most transparent course-correction resulted from a lawsuit against Alex Jones, the publisher of InfoWars, for its misleading stories about Chobani. After initially vowing to fight the yogurt company in court, Jones retracted several stories and issued an apology in order to make a lawsuit go away. Stranahan said that his editors forced him off the Twin Falls story during the fall and suggested that they had done so under threat from Chobani. (Breitbart denies this.)Stranahan and I spoke a handful of times over the course of the last year, each time for several hours. Talking with him feels like being inside one of his conspiracy theories. When you ask him a question, he begins to answer and then immediately swerves in a different direction, bouncing like a pinball between topics that barely connect to one another \u2014 from the Fawnbrook case to clitorectomies and stoning, then Syrian refugees, then a prominent Wahhabi cleric \u2014 and seems to increase in velocity as he ricochets off them. It\u2019s an exhausting exercise, but also a fascinating one. He seems perpetually on the precipice of pulling the argument together, sparking just enough curiosity that you let him keep going. Stranahan uses this talent most effectively in his work, painting himself as a champion of people who are understandably uninformed about other cultures and religions based on their own experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s just easy to brand these people as a bunch of Islamophobic, racist yokels,\u201d he told me, with a hint of disgust in his voice. \u201cI just don\u2019t like it.\u201dStranahan struck me as passionate about his stories; not about their veracity but about the freedom he and the critics of refugee resettlement should have to speculate as they wanted without being belittled by the fact-mongering mainstream. When I reached him by phone this June, he told me he was planning to travel back to Idaho for more reporting on Fawnbrook, now that he was no longer constrained by his editors at Breitbart. He told me that he believed that he had uncovered another dimension of his globalist theory related to Chobani\u2019s participation in the federal school-lunch program. He felt compelled to follow up on the earlier coverage, because he was frustrated that Alex Jones and others were forced to retract their stories and apologize under pressure. \u201cI don\u2019t like people getting shut up like that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if their stories have problems, I don\u2019t like journalists getting shut down.\u201dI started to ask why anyone should be allowed to publish false information for the express purpose of angering their audience and pushing them further away from those with whom they disagree, but Stranahan cut me off. \u201cHey, I\u2019m walking into the White House right now,\u201d he said. He had just arrived for a press briefing with the president\u2019s spokesman. \u201cLet me call you back.\u201dLate one Monday night in June I received a phone call from Dalos, the Scanner Man. He asked if I had heard about the \u201cfireworks flying around Twin Falls.\u201d The news of the boys\u2019 fate had somehow reached the public. \u201cThe suspects didn\u2019t go to jail or nothing,\u201d he said, adding that people in town were \u201cirate.\u201d Facebook posts about the story were again flooding his feed. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming it on Muslim law,\u201d he said. One of the articles circulating, from a site called Bare Naked Islam, included a photograph of the judge in the case with a large red arrow pointing toward his head, next to the caption \u201cCorrupt Judge.\u201d Another article published the judge\u2019s home address and phone number, inciting another flood of harassment, a year after the initial onslaught.Shawn and Camille Barigar\u2019s bickering has subsided, but they have discovered that they disagree over whether Islamic teachings conflict with American social norms. \u201cI can\u2019t take the leap,\u201d Shawn told me, \u201cthat because you are Muslim therefore you are reading the Quran verbatim, and you\u2019re going to go out and do genital mutilation.\u201d Camille said she supported the local resettlement program but thought that her husband\u2019s unwillingness to even consider cultural differences or acknowledge any nuance was na\u00efve. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be afraid to talk about it entirely or, like, sound racist.\u201d It is precisely this discomfort that provides an opening for people like Stranahan to dominate the conversation.Part of the reason a fear of Islam has persisted in Twin Falls is because the local leadership refused to defuse it, according to Matt Christensen, 36, the editor of The Times-News. While Brown wrote articles that sorted out the truth about the Fawnbrook case, Christensen was publishing commentary that castigated the people who were spreading falsehoods. He told me that he had closed-door meetings with city officials, in which he asked them to write guest editorials doing the same, but none of them did. Christensen suspected that they were afraid of one of the most reliable political dangers in the region, the same force that leads would-be Democrats there to register as Republicans: being outflanked on the right is the quickest way to lose your job.\u201cBehind closed doors, they would all tell you they were pro-refugee, and we wanted them to step forward and make that declaration in a public arena, and it just never really happened,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was frustrating to us especially at the beginning because it really felt like the newspaper was out there all alone.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere were days where we felt like, Godammit, what are we doing here? We write a story and it\u2019s going to reach 50,000 people. Breitbart writes a story and it\u2019s going to reach 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 million people. What kind of a voice do we have in this debate?\u201dThe refugee resettlement center received a dramatic increase in donations from local residents during the last year. But those in the town who support the program have often been drowned out by the relatively smaller, but louder, group of activists who oppose it. Brown said he expected to see an anti-Shariah bill introduced in the State Legislature when the next session starts in 2018. Bills like this, which try to bar Islamic law from being used in American courts, have been introduced in the past two years in Boise but never passed. He speculated that the momentum of the past year could force a different outcome. \u201cThere are a lot of people who feel like society is changing too quickly, like the community is changing too quickly,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd who view other people not like them or who don\u2019t speak their language as a threat or a sign that their culture is going to be weakened. And they want to do what they can to stop that.\u201dCaitlin Dickerson is a national reporter for The Times.

{"Headline": "Dear Amazon, We Picked Your New Headquarters for You", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nThe company announced in September that it was looking for a metropolitan area in North America with at least a million people, so we\u2019ve started with the map above. (With apologies to Canada, we\u2019ve set aside Toronto and several other large cities because they\u2019re not included in most of the data sets we\u2019ve used to determine which places meet Amazon\u2019s needs.)Here we\u2019ve cut the contenders by half, keeping those metropolitan areas that have had the best job growth over the last decade, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Metro areas that have actually lost jobs (Tucson; Birmingham, Ala.) and those that have grown more sluggishly are out of the running.Sentimental picks like Detroit fail this first test. Amazon\u2019s request for proposals doesn\u2019t suggest that it will prioritize places it could help revitalize, but the company would certainly have that effect if it chose such an underdog.Amazon is also clear that it needs a lot of skilled tech labor. Remember, it could ultimately hire 50,000 employees. And we\u2019re not primarily talking about warehouse workers, but executives, software engineers, and legal and accounting experts.Amazon wants the kind of place that would lure and keep those workers. That means, in short, a metro area with the features that young, skilled workers like, and where they think they can afford to live.This next criterion narrows the field significantly:Amazon also wants easy access to an international airport with direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York and Washington, which these four finalists provide. At this point, though, we\u2019re going to eliminate Portland, because it makes little sense for the company to put a second headquarters so close to Seattle. So we\u2019re down to three: Boston, Washington and Denver.Amazon could easily sort through all the criteria above by itself (the company knows data, after all). But there are two questions it can\u2019t answer without information from potential host cities: What are they willing to give the company in incentives and tax breaks? And what real estate is on the table? This leads us to our winner:The company has asked for very specific information on all the state, regional and local incentives communities are willing to offer, and the timelines for how long it would take to approve them. Amazon concludes its proposal by stressing that this a \u201ccompetitive project.\u201d So let the competition among cities begin!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn Says U.K. Labour Party Is Ready to Govern", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn some respects a British version of Bernie Sanders, Mr. Corbyn, 68, has championed an agenda that includes nationalizing utilities, abolishing university tuition fees and increasing taxes for the wealthy and for corporations.Mrs. May built her election campaign around the assumption that, with his left-wing platform, Mr. Corbyn was unelectable, but many voters saw Mr. Corbyn as personable and authentic, compared with wooden performances from the prime minister. A member of Parliament since 1983, he spent years as a backbencher before winning a once-improbable bid for leadership of the party after Labour lost a general election in 2015.On Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn mocked Mrs. May\u2019s campaign claims that she provided \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership and that voting for Labour would usher in a \u201ccoalition of chaos.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re certainly not strong and they\u2019re definitely not stable,\u201d he said, adding that the government was \u201changing on by their fingertips,\u201d and suggesting that the political center of gravity had shifted to the left as \u201ca new consensus is emerging from the great economic crash and the years of austerity.\u201dHis party, which was led until 2007 by the more centrist former Prime Minister Tony Blair, has certainly moved politically, said Mark Wickham-Jones, a professor of political science at the University of Bristol.\u201cLabour is now a left-wing party, with a left-wing membership, with support from the trade unions and an institutional structure that is shifting to the left,\u201d he said, predicting that left-wingers would probably control Labour for the next decade and a half.He said he accepted voters\u2019 decision to quit the European Union, but added that the bloc\u2019s three million citizens in Britain should be allowed to stay and that he wanted long-term \u201cunimpeded access\u201d to its single market \u2014 words that will please those who want Britain to keep close economic ties to the Continent.The Labour leader described Mr. Trump\u2019s disdain for the Paris climate change accord as \u201calarming,\u201d and his recent speech at the United Nations as \u201cdisturbing,\u201d and called on Mrs. May to stand up to American threats to impose hefty tariffs on Bombardier aircraft, parts of which are produced in Northern Ireland.Outside the main hall at the conference, party members bought T-shirts and mugs emblazoned with Mr. Corbyn\u2019s famously-bearded image, while the party\u2019s politicians lavished praise on their leader from the podium.In one speech on Monday, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Emily Thornberry, described Mr. Corbyn\u2019s leadership as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cinspirational,\u201d She has long been a loyal Corbyn supporter, however, unlike Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, who last year supported Mr. Corbyn\u2019s opponents in a leadership challenge.This year, Mr. Khan described Mr. Corbyn as the \u201cking of Glastonbury,\u201d a reference to the music festival where this year young fans chanted the name of the Labour leader. (They did at meetings in Brighton, too.)Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has made no secret of his differences with Mr. Corbyn. But his praise of the party leader prompted one journalist to compare Mr. Watson\u2019s speech to \u201cthose nervous interviews captured soldiers give on enemy state TV.\u201d\u201cIt is like a cult of personality, with T-shirts of Jeremy Corbyn, and every speaker obliged to say what a glorious leader he is,\u201d said Denis MacShane, a former Europe minister under Mr. Blair. Mr. MacShane likened some speeches in Brighton to those at Soviet party congresses under Stalin, and added: \u201cI think it is going slightly to his head.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Corbyn, a soft-spoken, vegetarian who makes his own jam, said that he often feels \u201cdeeply embarrassed,\u201d by the adulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not my wish, not my doing,\u201d he told Sky News.This year, Momentum is more integrated into the party. It helped the leadership to shape the conference agenda and to avoid an internal party vote on Brexit \u2014 an issue that splits Labour, and one that Mr. Corbyn has so far successfully dodged.\u201cMomentum has been more disciplined,\u201d said Roland Singer-Kingsmith, a co-founder of The World Transformed. \u201cLast year we were partly celebrating defending Jeremy Corbyn, and partly defending ourselves as we were seen as, at worst, entryist, and at best a competitor to the Labour Party.\u201cThis year, we want to be seen as a dynamic and creative compliment to the Party,\u201d he added.With many party members convinced that power is a real prospect, the campaigning focus of the left has broadened. At one event, John McDonnell, the party\u2019s spokesman on national finances, said that his team was making contingency plans in the event of a backlash \u2014 including a run on the pound \u2014 against a left-wing government. That provoked some negative headlines, but it underscored the fact that Labour is thinking about power.The next general election is not due until 2022, but it could happen earlier, and the government could well struggle on until then. But businesses are taking Labour more seriously, and the hall where firms pay a fee to exhibit included several companies that were not in Liverpool in 2016, such as Google and BP \u2014 whose stand Mr. Corbyn visited.Though one of his main appeals in June was his reputation for authenticity, the scent of power also seems to have changed Mr. Corbyn, whose media appearances have become smoother and a little more evasive. Mr. Corbyn is not known as a great orator, but his speech on Wednesday was better drafted and more smoothly delivered than last year\u2019s.That does not seem to have dimmed his appeal to some younger supporters who are drawn to his left-wing agenda. Dominic Cooper, a 23-year-old party member from London, said that he saw Labour as \u201ca party that says: \u2018We are actually going to try to change things quite seriously and we will be up front about it, rather than ashamed of it.\u2019\u201dAs for Mr. Corbyn, Mr. Cooper said approvingly: \u201cAs a party member, it seems to me that he seems finally to have grasped how to do politics, rather than just saying what he thinks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Offers Concessions to Europe After Record Antitrust Fine", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle announced concessions on Wednesday to European regulators over its online shopping service, signaling a new willingness by the Silicon Valley company to bow to tightening pressures from governments around the world.Google said the changes would be introduced early on Thursday morning, meeting a deadline to open up its shopping platform to greater competition or potentially face further fines from the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm. As a result, about a dozen shopping sites from companies besides Google could become more visible and accessible.\u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping,\u201d Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said.The fine against Google in June was among the most aggressive moves against an American technology company taken anywhere in the world. It immediately confirmed Europe\u2019s role as the Western world\u2019s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany\u2019s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.\u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,\u201d said Mr. Verney.The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.Google would like the measure it\u2019s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google\u2019s formidable search platform.Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.Any decision to separate traditional web search from other search-related functions, such as shopping for products, looking for travel bookings or seeking restaurant reviews, could reverse a profitable evolution of the company\u2019s moneymaker.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Intel, the world\u2019s largest chip producer and a maker of the semiconductors that have long been the brains of machines like PCs, had revenue growth of just 9 percent in the most recent quarter.\u201cThey are just cruising,\u201d Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said of Nvidia, which he has tracked since it went public in 1999.\u201cThe cost to the company was incredible,\u201d said Mr. Huang, 54, who estimated that Nvidia had spent $500 million a year on the effort, known broadly as CUDA (for compute unified device architecture), when the company\u2019s total revenue was around $3 billion. Nvidia puts its total spending on turning GPUs into more general-purpose computing tools at nearly $10 billion since CUDA was introduced.The slowdown led designers to start dreaming up more specialized chips that could work alongside Intel processors and wring more benefits from the miniaturization of chip circuitry. Nvidia, which repurposed existing chips instead of starting from scratch, had a big head start. Using its chips and software it developed as part of the CUDA effort, the company gradually created a technology platform that became popular with many programmers and companies.\u201cThey really were well led,\u201d said John L. Hennessy, a computer scientist who stepped down as Stanford University\u2019s president last year.Now, Nvidia chips are pushing into new corporate applications. German business software giant SAP, for example, is promoting an artificial-intelligence technique called deep learning and using Nvidia GPUs for tasks like accelerating accounts-payable processes and matching resumes to job openings.SAP has also demonstrated Nvidia-powered software to spot company logos in broadcasts of sports like basketball or soccer, so advertisers can learn about their brands\u2019 exposure during games and take steps to try to improve it.\u201cThat could not be done before,\u201d said Juergen Mueller, SAP\u2019s chief innovation officer.Such applications go far beyond the original ambitions of Mr. Huang, who was born in Taiwan and studied electrical engineering at Oregon State University and Stanford before taking jobs at Silicon Valley chipmakers. He started Nvidia with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993, setting out initially to help PCs offer visual effects to rival those of dedicated video game consoles.The company\u2019s original product was a dud, Mr. Malachowsky said, and the graphics market attracted a mob of rivals.But Nvidia retooled its products and strategy and gradually separated itself from the competition to become the clear leader in the GPU-accelerator cards used in gaming PCs.GPUs generate triangles to form framelike structures, simulating objects and applying colors to pixels on a display screen. To do that, many simple instructions must be executed in parallel, which is why graphics chips evolved with many tiny processors. A new GPU announced by Nvidia in May, called Volta, has more than 5,000 such processors; a new, high-end Intel server chip, by contrast, has just 28 larger, general-purpose processor cores.Nvidia began its CUDA push in 2004 after hiring Ian Buck, a Stanford doctoral student and company intern who had worked on a programming challenge that involved making it easier to harness a GPU\u2019s many calculating engines. Nvidia soon made changes to its chips and developed software aids, including support for a standard programming language rather than the arcane tools used to issue commands to graphics chips.The company built CUDA into consumer GPUs and high-end products. That decision was critical, Mr. Buck said, because it meant researchers and students who owned laptops or desktop PCs for gaming could tinker on software in campus labs and dorm rooms. Nvidia also convinced many universities to offer courses in its new programming techniques.Programmers gradually adopted GPUs for applications used in, among other things, climate modeling and oil and gas discovery. A new phase began in 2012 after Canadian researchers began to apply CUDA and GPUs to unusually large neural networks, the many-layered software required for deep learning.Those systems are trained to perform tricks like spotting a face by exposure to millions of images instead of through definitions established by programmers. Before the emergence of GPUs, Mr. Buck said, training such a system might take an entire semester.Aided by the new technology, researchers can now complete the process in weeks, days or even hours.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how we\u2019d do it without using GPUs,\u201d said Silvio Savarese, an associate professor at Stanford who directs the SAIL-Toyota Center for A.I. Research at the university.Competitors argue that the A.I. battle among chipmakers has barely begun.But Nvidia will not be easy to dislodge. For one thing, the company can afford to spend more than most of its A.I. rivals on chips \u2014 Mr. Huang estimated Nvidia had plowed an industry record $3 billion into Volta \u2014 because of the steady flow of revenue from the still-growing gaming market.Nvidia said more than 500,000 developers are now using GPUs. And the company expects other chipmakers to help expand its fan base once it freely distributes an open-source chip design they can use for low-end deep learning applications \u2014 light-bulbs or cameras, for instance \u2014 that it does not plan to target itself.A.I., Mr. Huang said, \u201cwill affect every company in the world. We won\u2019t address all of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blocked in China, Facebook Is Said to Seek a Shanghai Office", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook is blocked in China, but it is feeling comfortable enough there to look for its own place.The social media giant in recent months has quietly scouted for office space in Shanghai, according to two people with knowledge of its efforts there. Those offices would house employees working on Facebook\u2019s effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans.Facebook\u2019s plans are tentative, the people said, and would depend on approval from the Chinese government. But if successful, it would be a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade.\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to questions about the office plans.At the moment, Facebook uses third parties and its own employees to sell ads in China. Because of cybersecurity concerns, Facebook employees run special security software on devices when they travel in China and do not have access to secretive or critical business information.Opening an office in Shanghai allows more support for its employees when they are in China, but also raises security questions. The Building 8 teams, which focus on their own hardware projects, would have less need to access sensitive Facebook data when in China, one person said. The office could also help Facebook work more with local Chinese companies.If it opens a Shanghai office, Facebook would not be the only Western internet company banned in the country to have some space there. Google, which pulled its servers out of China in 2010 after it decided to stop censoring search results, retained offices in Beijing and Shanghai that support both advertising and research and development. Google still maintains extensive advertising sales and research facilities there.Facebook over the past three years has pulled out all the stops to court the Chinese government and gain approval for its network. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has showed off his Mandarin at one of the country\u2019s top universities and has directly courted Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.The office search comes just months after Facebook released the Chinese-language version of Moments. That app, called Colorful Balloons, originally went largely unnoticed but briefly rose into the top 50 in the photo and video section of China\u2019s iPhone app store after The New York Times reported its release last month, according to app research company App Annie.Like other cities in China, Shanghai has been eager to attract technology start-ups and other internet-related investments.That the Colorful Balloons app has not come down could be a sign that Facebook has done something right with the government, said Teng Bingsheng, a professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. Opening an office, if it happens, would be another sign.\u201cIt has symbolic meaning,\u201d Mr. Teng said, \u201cbecause it must be the result of good communication with the government.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

A Start-Up\u2019s Plans Draw Fire", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDon\u2019t mess with the beloved bodega.That was the overriding sentiment online on Wednesday when a start-up suggested its internet-connected vending machines would upend traditional big-city corner stores, and not-so-gracefully borrowed a name for these stores.When word got out, \u201cbodega\u201d started trending on Twitter. And not in a good way.Frank Garcia, chairman of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told Fast Company that \u201cto compete with bodegas and also use the \u2018bodega\u2019 name is unbelievably disrespectful.\u201d\u201cDespite our best intentions and our admiration for traditional bodegas, we clearly hit a nerve this morning, we apologize,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLike NYC\u2019s bodegas, we want to build a shopping experience that stands for convenience and ubiquity for people who don\u2019t have easy access to a corner store.\u201dThe company declined to comment further.Saiful Islam, who has been working at the Corner News Grocery Store in Midtown Manhattan for about 14 years, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cMachines can\u2019t be the brain,\u201d he said.In most corner stores, customers are not necessarily looking for home goods or groceries. Bodegas are a place, often featuring a friendly neighborhood cat, to order breakfast sandwiches and coffee. A place to buy lottery tickets, cigarettes and foreign language newspapers.Day by day, tech creates a world in which fewer people are needed to do jobs, Mr. Islam said. But at the store where he works, where many lottery tickets are sold, \u201cyou need a person to handle things.\u201dBut Michael L. Kasavana, a former professor at Michigan State University and a researcher on automated merchandising systems, thinks vending machines could replace stores in the future.\u201cAmericans have shown that they\u2019re not afraid to do self-service, whether it be at the gas pump, replacing banking or online purchases,\u201d he said.Ying Luo, who has worked at the 39 & 9th Grocery in Midtown Manhattan for about a year, said that he\u2019d happily be a customer of a ramen-dispensing vending machine in the United States. But without the ability to serve hot or cold items, he thought the Bodega machines were a \u201cstrange idea.\u201dThere\u2019s \u201cno way that could replace bodegas,\u201d he said.She added that the United States was decades behind other countries. Tokyo and Seoul \u201care way, way more advanced technologically in terms of payment,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is digital.\u201dThere might be evidence, though, that bodegas and Bodegas can mutually exist. In Japan, despite its high concentration of sophisticated vending machines, there are about 40,000 convenience stores, according to Foresight Valuation Group.Whether a proliferation of vending machines would prompt a drop in mom-and-pop stores in the United States is hard to determine, according to Foresight: \u201cThe blame would likely be better directed at Walmart, Amazon and Google Express.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Avoiding Cameras While Training the Lens on Food", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Pete Wells, The Times\u2019s restaurant critic, discussed the tech he is using.How has tech transformed the world of dining?There are lots of incremental, behind-the-scenes changes that affect restaurants more than consumers, such as more sophisticated reservation systems and point-of-sale software, but I think the most powerful, sweeping change has come from digital photography hooked up to the internet. Photography is now the main way we communicate about restaurant cooking. As a word guy I hate to say this, but it\u2019s true.Now everybody is installing pin spots in the ceiling pointing straight down at the table, which is why you see all these very sharp and high-contrast pictures of plates on Instagram. The restaurants are doing this because it\u2019s largely free marketing. (Some Instagrammers are so popular that restaurants will invite them in for a comped meal, so it\u2019s not entirely free.) I was told that one major restaurant publicity firm in New York has a full-time employee who does nothing but help restaurants with Instagram.This solves one of the main problems that restaurants used to have in the days when \u201cold\u201d media was the only game in town: How do you keep people talking about your place after the initial buzz dies down?Besides the marketing, there are creative implications. For one thing, chefs are much more focused now on sending out food that photographs well. So I end up eating a lot of flowers and leaves that don\u2019t really taste like much but make the plate more colorful, because most cooked food is brown. Ditto all the boards and slates and rocks that are being asked to stand in for plates.It has also sped up the rate at which ideas about food travel from one place to another. Chefs don\u2019t just use photography for marketing. They are also documenting their work for their peers; you see this in the way Ren\u00e9 Redzepi in Copenhagen uses Instagram. It\u2019s one reason his style has spread around the world in the span of just a few years.And how has it changed the way you do your job? What are the pros and cons?The best thing about having everybody take pictures of food is that I can do it without giving myself away. I used to be really self-conscious when I took out my phone; I\u2019d run to the restroom and take surreptitious notes in the stall. Now I just snap away all night long, and I look like everybody else. And photography is the first stage of my note-taking now. After I get home I reconstruct my impressions of the meal, starting with my pictures of my food and the menu. When I started this job, a former critic advised me to steal menus when I could get away with it, and that\u2019s completely unnecessary now.What\u2019s your opinion on Yelp, where everyone is a wannabe food critic?The basic problem is that Yelp was built to reward frequent posting rather than knowledge or insight or expertise. And yet there are people on Yelp who know a lot about food and eat around and have a pretty solid basis for comparison. I find that Yelp is most useful with Korean, Chinese and Japanese food, because, for a number of reasons, there tend to be a lot of Yelpers who know those cuisines pretty well.I don\u2019t. I almost never eat at home, and when I do, I want to cook. I did use Caviar in the context of a restaurant review a few weeks ago and was pretty happy with how well it worked.Sites like Yelp give people plenty of information about restaurants. Yet many restaurants still have their own websites. Is this necessary?The most valuable thing a restaurant can do on its website is post the current menu and drinks lists, with prices. All the other data you might want, and there\u2019s not really very much, can be served up much more efficiently by Google, although I still think website designers who don\u2019t put the restaurant\u2019s address and phone number and hours right on the home page should be sued for malpractice.As our food critic, you have to stay unrecognized when you try new restaurants. How do you do that in an era that demands us to sacrifice privacy on the internet?This isn\u2019t a major issue. People are always surprised when I say that, but it\u2019s one of the things that has been least affected by technology.Now the fidelity and resolution are higher, but the picture of me that most restaurants seem to have on their wall is about 10 years old. There are a few more recent shots, taken across a dining room while I was eating, that are in circulation, but they\u2019re pretty terrible. My friends know they\u2019re not supposed to put pictures of me on Facebook. I don\u2019t take selfies, but I probably wouldn\u2019t be a selfie guy even if I had another job.Most of the time when I\u2019m recognized it\u2019s because somebody is working in that restaurant who waited on me in another place I\u2019ve reviewed. I don\u2019t get caught by technology; I get caught by human memory. It\u2019s sort of reassuring, I guess.Advertisement"}

Russia has 56 times the territory and more than twice the population of Italy. Yet Italy\u2019s economy, troubled as it is, is 44 percent larger than Russia\u2019s.Nor is it sheer scale. China\u2019s G.D.P. may eventually outstrip America\u2019s. But per capita Chinese G.D.P. is lower than Mexico\u2019s, making it a rich country of relatively poor people.A better measure of national greatness is the ability of nations to cultivate, attract and retain human capital. People tend to vote with their feet. To trace the rise or decline of nations is to watch where those feet go \u2014 and where they leave.Take Hungary. Since 1960, seven Hungarians have won the Nobel Prize. Not bad for a small country \u2014 except that all of them left Hungary to make their lives and careers elsewhere.The United States provides the opposite example. The American economy is 12 percent larger today than it was at the time of the financial crisis. We\u2019re also taking in roughly half a million legal new arrivals a year. The foot-voting continues, and we\u2019re still coming out on top.A common American conceit is that we attract brilliant foreigners because we have brilliant things: great universities, vast financial resources, a dynamic economy, high-tech. That gets things mostly backward. It\u2019s because we have brilliant foreigners that we have those things in the first place. Google. Comcast. eBay. Kraft. Pfizer. AT&T. They all had immigrants as founders.Opponents of a liberal immigration policy often insist they welcome legal immigrants and only object to illegal ones. Rubbish. The immigration reform bill introduced in Congress this year by Republicans Tom Cotton and David Perdue and endorsed by Donald Trump aims to cut legal immigration by half.Restrictionists also argue that we need to favor newcomers with \u201cskills\u201d and educational credentials. More rubbish. Jan Koum arrived in the U.S. from Ukraine in 1992 as a 16-year-old boy with his mother, living off food stamps. She worked as a babysitter. He later dropped out of college. In 2009 he came up with an idea for a mobile messaging app. Five years later Facebook purchased WhatsApp for $22 billion.Should it make any difference to WhatsApp\u2019s billion-plus users that Koum arrived in the United States legally? And if it turned out that he hadn\u2019t, should he be required to leave the country, presumably so he can pay income tax \u2014 and create jobs \u2014 in his native Ukraine?That would be self-defeating. But it\u2019s the fate that may soon await 800,000 or so young people who were brought without visas to the United States as children, grew up in the country, in some cases only speak English, and now face deportation because the Trump administration seems poised to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that allowed them to stay in school or their jobs.Lose that faith, and lose what\u2019s best about America, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Luxury Building Boom Hits Montreal", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetAlong the main shopping street in the area of downtown Montreal known as the Golden Square Mile, Sonya Szczygiel and her husband, John Guinto, have sold beaded bracelets made of semiprecious stones for the last five years.From their kiosk on Saint Catherine Street, near Montreal\u2019s downtown Apple Store, the pair have had front row seats for a transformation playing out in the neighborhood and throughout Montreal.It is one of the many changes that Ms. Szczygiel welcomes. \u201cHigh-end hotels, stores and restaurants attract people with a higher disposable income,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should obviously benefit us and other retailers.\u201dThe current revitalization of the Golden Square Mile mirrors the larger comeback of Montreal.During a period of political instability, starting in the 1980s and leading up to a referendum about Quebec leaving Canada in 1995, many companies became skittish of keeping outposts in Montreal. The Four Seasons, which had opened a hotel in 1976 called Le Quatre Saisons, stopped managing the location in 1994. As businesses left, retail and restaurants, particularly the high-end sector in the Golden Square Mile, suffered.But over the last decade, after the city\u2019s politics had stabilized, companies started to come back. New start-ups have popped up, for example, particularly in the fields of technology, artificial intelligence and gaming. Facebook just announced it is creating an artificial intelligence research lab in Montreal, and last fall Google said that it would open a similar facility there.\u201cThe stable political environment in Montreal these last years, especially when we take into consideration the more unstable global environment created by Brexit and other elections in Europe, has made Montreal more attractive to business and leisure visitors,\u201d said Denis Coderre, Montreal\u2019s mayor.\u201cThe Montreal economy is booming,\u201d Mr. Coderre said.He added that the unemployment rate had reached one of its lowest levels since 2010, the labor force was growing and investments were increasing. New taxes on foreign investors in Toronto and Vancouver also appear to have played a part.But the city also has something else appealing to business, according to J. Allen Smith, the Four Seasons chief executive: \u201ccultural sophistication, European influences and storied history.\u201dPartnering with Carbonleo Real Estate, a Quebec developer and property manager, the Four Seasons project will include a 166-room hotel and 18 condos priced from nearly $3 million to over $12 million. The hotel will be connected to the flagship location for Ogilvy, a high-end department store that is undergoing more than $100 million in renovations and merging with Holt Renfrew, another luxury retailer.Near the new Four Seasons, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel just reopened its doors this July after a $114 million renovation.The Ritz Carlton blazed the path for high-end hoteliers in Montreal. The hotel, which first opened in 1912, reopened in 2013 after renovations that cost about $200 million. Those changes added 45 condos, larger hotel guest rooms and now features Maison Boulud, the first Montreal restaurant of acclaimed French chef Daniel Boulud.Visitors flock to Montreal for business, bachelor and bachelorette parties, as well as music festivals and sports events such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix car race. With four major universities, Montreal also attracts many students and educators.The Golden Square Mile, where the new Four Seasons will sit, is at the foot of the hilly Mont Royal park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted about 16 years after he helped create Central Park in New York. Between 1850 and 1930, some of North America\u2019s wealthiest families built mansions, as well as churches and universities in the Golden Square Mile. Now boutiques, restaurants, theaters, cinemas, art galleries and book stores populate the area.The developers of the new Four Seasons in Montreal, which is set to open next year, expect the shopping to be a big draw. While many high-end hotels feature luxury boutiques on their street level, the Four Seasons will be connected directly to the 250,000 square foot-luxury Ogilvy/Holt Renfrew department store.The Four Seasons will be a monochromatic 18-story building with tinted windows creating a reflective charcoal facade broken up by \u201ca golden thread that emphasizes the shift between volumes and outlines its main entrances,\u201d said Eric Pelletier, an architect and design principal at the firm designing the project. The gold inlay also highlights the 6,000-square-foot ballroom that will seat 500 guests.Four Seasons brought in Parisian-based architects Gilles and Boissier to design the hotel rooms, which are \u201ca balance of New World and Old World,\u201d said Dana Kalczak, vice president of interior design for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.In contemporary shades of white, cream, rose and gold, the rooms maximize natural light, including bathrooms with windows that allow light to pass in from the room outside. Old world touches include a built-in cocktail cabinet featuring all the equipment for \u201cshaking up a great cocktail or pouring a super scotch,\u201d said Ms. Kalczak.The building will include condos, which went on sale this June and range from 2,886 to 6,910 square feet. The largest penthouse includes a home gym and 2,060-square foot terrace with a fire pit and the option of a pool.It remains to be seen whether the timing is good. This year the overall condo market is \u201ca lot healthier than it was,\u201d says H\u00e9l\u00e8ne B\u00e9gin, a senior economist at Desjardins Economics. But she noted that a surplus of high-end condos remain on the market.The most interest in purchasing Four Seasons residences has come from affluent empty nesters from Montreal and further afield, people looking to swap out large family homes for new homes \u201cthat don\u2019t represent a downgrade in lifestyle,\u201d said Jos\u00e9e Legault, a marketing director for Carbonleo Real Estate.While Ms. Szczygiel and her husband have been upbeat about how the various new developments, along with Montreal\u2019s many festivals and events, have made the city more dynamic and increased tourism, she acknowledged there is a downside.\u201cWe are unfortunately in for a lot of construction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hopefully it will lead to long term benefits for business owners.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Still, that doesn\u2019t necessarily identify who is running the page.)\u2022 \u201cWe will strengthen our ad review process for political ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg promised.\u2022 Facebook will hire 250 more employees for its security team.\u2022 The company will expand coordination with global election commissions.\u2022 It also promised to work closely with other technology companies to share threat information.Mr. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was monitoring activity related to the German elections on Sunday:\u201cWe\u2019re also examining the activity of accounts we\u2019ve removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany. This is incredibly important and we have been focused on this for a while.\u201dThe ResponseSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, to The Times:\u201cThis is a good first step,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed it\u2019s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they\u2019ve become much more transparent.\u201d He said he believed there were additional \u201ctroll farms\u201d in both Russia and Eastern Europe, \u201cand it\u2019s really important that Facebook work with us to investigate other sources of advertising and fake accounts.\u201d\u201cIt will be necessary to hear directly from Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as others in the tech sector, including in open hearings that will inform the American public,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, the committee\u2019s investigation will require greater and ongoing cooperation by Facebook and other social media companies on this and other issues.\u201dThe ContextFacebook is trying to stave off stricter government regulation. Tech executives have been worried that new rules could lay huge burdens on the world\u2019s biggest advertising business.\u201cTelevision stations have to keep records that literally anyone in the public can see, in windows close to elections, who bought ads,\u201d Mr. Rutenberg said. \u201cMaybe who bought it is \u2018Citizens for Blue Skies,\u2019 and you have to figure out who they are, but there\u2019s a record of this. And there\u2019s talk now about making social media properly accountable for this kind of advertising.\u201dAt the same time, Facebook and Alphabet are finding themselves under pressure from older tech companies and other sometime allies.In the debate-du-jour in the U.S. Senate, Oracle, Disney, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and 21st Century Fox recently voiced support for an anti-sex trafficking bill that would change the bedrock internet platform law, the Communications Decency Act\u2019s Section 230, to put more legal liability on web companies like Facebook and Alphabet. Co-sponsored by Republican senator Rob Portman of Ohio, it is aimed mainly at Backpage.com, a classifieds site that ran ads connected with sex trafficking. But it is written broadly enough that most big consumer internet companies have voiced concerns. Related Reading\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better,\u201d he asks with a sly smile, \u201cif it was actually an accepted thing for people to want to go understand how other people were living?\u201dHe also complained about perceptions among the media that he is being inauthentic:As he says this, his publicist stands up and indicates the interview is over, but Zuckerberg isn\u2019t quite done. He smiles and then says, \u201cI need to give you a hard time.\u201d He proceeds to complain about a Bloomberg Businessweek story in January that noted he employs a team of about a dozen content moderators \u2014 as well as communications managers, professional photographers, video producers, Morgan Freeman \u2014 who are all responsible for maintaining his personal Facebook page. \u201cYou\u2019re taking away from all the time that I spent on this,\u201d he says. \u201cTo some degree some of these companies are very old-school advertising companies in a completely new dress. Some of the things that they do, they are amazing. These are innovations that have changed our societies. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they still have a responsibility. If you\u2019re a dominant company, you have a special responsibility.\u201dI asked Bengio if the companies should be broken up. He harrumphed and responded that antitrust laws should be enforced. \u201cGovernments have become so meek in front of companies,\u201d he said.Schultz spoke with The Washington Post at a job fair for young people on Wednesday, and while he insisted he wasn\u2019t talking politics, it wasn\u2019t difficult imagine him delivering the same words in a stump speech in Des Moines.On the Political FrontAfter months of very public infighting among her cabinet members, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain appears ready to commit to a negotiating strategy for her country\u2019s exit from the European Union.At a speech in Florence today, Ms. May is expected to announce plans for a two-year transition period after leaving the political bloc.The goal is to maintain trade ties to the U.K.\u2019s biggest market and give businesses time to adjust to the new regime. A holdover period would protect companies from being hit with unwieldy tariffs and regulations overnight, if no long-term trade deal has been struck by Brexit day in March 2019.It is thought May will offer to pay enough into the EU to ensure no member state need make extra contributions during the current budget round, which ends in 2020 \u2013 a year after the UK leaves. This would amount to about \u20ac20bn (\u00a318bn), although she may not mention a figure.On the Business FrontBritain is hoping to keep the financial services sector from fleeing to continental Europe with a more industry-friendly approach to regulation.[David Davis, Britain\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator] believes that if Britain maintained the same regulatory framework for financial services as the EU in the long term \u2014 without having any influence over its composition \u2014 this would erode any competitive advantage the UK-based industry would gain from being outside the bloc.For years, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s independence was all but guaranteed by the 33-percent stake held by the family of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of the cosmetics giant.A spokeswoman for Nestl\u00e9 told DealBook that the company declined to comment beyond this statement:\u201cIt is with great sadness that we received the news of the passing away of Mrs. Liliane Bettencourt. We express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to Mrs. Bettencourt\u2019s family and to all at L\u2019Or\u00e9al at this difficult moment.\u201dWhat Investors ThinkShares of L\u2019Or\u00e9al were up 3.5 percent this morning on the Euronext Paris stock exchange, at 182.80 euros, or nearly $218, their highest level since July.Related ReadingL\u2019Affaire Bettencourt had captivated France since 2007, when a daughter\u2019s lawsuit charged that Mrs. Bettencourt, ranked as the richest woman in the world, had been bamboozled by a society photographer 25 years her junior for cash, annuities, fine art and, it seemed, an island in the Seychelles.This became a government scandal, too, when a former family accountant suggested that Mrs. Bettencourt had made contributions to Nicolas Sarkozy shortly before his election as president of France.Ms. Ruden recounts how a student in a Latin class she had taught was outraged at having received an A-minus.From her piece:This professor didn\u2019t ask to see any evidence.

Though some of the anointed developed their capabilities to the full, the institutional imperative to establish a hierarchy between them and us took precedence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chips Off the Old Block: Computers Are Taking Design Cues From Human Brains", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "New technologies are testing the limits of computer semiconductors. To deal with that, researchers have gone looking for ideas from nature.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We expect a lot from our computers these days. They should talk to us, recognize everything from faces to flowers, and maybe soon do the driving. All this artificial intelligence requires an enormous amount of computing power, stretching the limits of even the most modern machines.Now, some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are taking a cue from biology as they respond to these growing demands. They are rethinking the very nature of computers and are building machines that look more like the human brain, where a central brain stem oversees the nervous system and offloads particular tasks \u2014 like hearing and seeing \u2014 to the surrounding cortex.After years of stagnation, the computer is evolving again, and this behind-the-scenes migration to a new kind of machine will have broad and lasting implications. It will allow work on artificially intelligent systems to accelerate, so the dream of machines that can navigate the physical world by themselves can one day come true.\u201cThis is an enormous change,\u201d said John Hennessy, the former Stanford University president who wrote an authoritative book on computer design in the mid-1990s and is now a member of the board at Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cThe existing approach is out of steam, and people are trying to re-architect the system.\u201dThe existing approach has had a pretty nice run. For about half a century, computer makers have built systems around a single, do-it-all chip \u2014 the central processing unit \u2014 from a company like Intel, one of the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor makers. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in the middle of your own laptop computer or smartphone.Now, computer engineers are fashioning more complex systems. Rather than funneling all tasks through one beefy chip made by Intel, newer machines are dividing work into tiny pieces and spreading them among vast farms of simpler, specialized chips that consume less power.Changes inside Google\u2019s giant data centers are a harbinger of what is to come for the rest of the industry. Inside most of Google\u2019s servers, there is still a central processor. But enormous banks of custom-built chips work alongside them, running the computer algorithms that drive speech recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence.Google reached this point out of necessity. For years, the company had operated the world\u2019s largest computer network \u2014 an empire of data centers and cables that stretched from California to Finland to Singapore. But for one Google researcher, it was much too small.In 2011, Jeff Dean, one of the company\u2019s most celebrated engineers, led a research team that explored the idea of neural networks \u2014 essentially computer algorithms that can learn tasks on their own. They could be useful for a number of things, like recognizing the words spoken into smartphones or the faces in a photograph.In a matter of months, Mr. Dean and his team built a service that could recognize spoken words far more accurately than Google\u2019s existing service. But there was a catch: If the world\u2019s more than one billion phones that operated on Google\u2019s Android software used the new service just three minutes a day, Mr. Dean realized, Google would have to double its data center capacity in order to support it.\u201cWe need another Google,\u201d Mr. Dean told Urs H\u00f6lzle, the Swiss-born computer scientist who oversaw the company\u2019s data center empire, according to someone who attended the meeting. So Mr. Dean proposed an alternative: Google could build its own computer chip just for running this kind of artificial intelligence.This trend toward specialty chips and a new computer architecture could lead to a \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d of artificial intelligence, said Gill Pratt, who was a program manager at Darpa, a research arm of the United States Department of Defense, and now works on driverless cars at Toyota. As he sees it, machines that spread computations across vast numbers of tiny, low-power chips can operate more like the human brain, which efficiently uses the energy at its disposal.\u201cIn the brain, energy efficiency is the key,\u201d he said during a recent interview at Toyota\u2019s new research center in Silicon Valley.There are many kinds of silicon chips. There are chips that store information. There are chips that perform basic tasks in toys and televisions. And there are chips that run various processes for computers, from the supercomputers used to create models for global warming to personal computers, internet servers and smartphones.For years, the central processing units, or C.P.U.s, that ran PCs and similar devices were where the money was. And there had not been much need for change.By 2010, however, doubling the number of transistors was taking much longer than Moore\u2019s Law predicted. Dennard\u2019s scaling maxim had also been upended as chip designers ran into the limits of the physical materials they used to build processors. The result: If a company wanted more computing power, it could not just upgrade its processors. It needed more computers, more space and more electricity.At the time, Microsoft was just beginning to improve Bing using machine-learning algorithms (neural networks are a type of machine learning) that could improve search results by analyzing the way people used the service. Though these algorithms were less demanding than the neural networks that would later remake the internet, existing chips had trouble keeping up.Mr. Burger and his team explored several options but eventually settled on something called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or F.P.G.A.s.: chips that could be reprogrammed for new jobs on the fly. Microsoft builds software, like Windows, that runs on an Intel C.P.U. But such software cannot reprogram the chip, since it is hard-wired to perform only certain tasks.With an F.P.G.A., Microsoft could change the way the chip works. It could program the chip to be really good at executing particular machine learning algorithms. Then, it could reprogram the chip to be really good at running logic that sends the millions and millions of data packets across its computer network. It was the same chip but it behaved in a different way.Microsoft started to install the chips en masse in 2015. Now, just about every new server loaded into a Microsoft data center includes one of these programmable chips. They help choose the results when you search Bing, and they help Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing service, shuttle information across its network of underlying machines.In fall 2016, another team of Microsoft researchers \u2014 mirroring the work done by Jeff Dean at Google \u2014 built a neural network that could, by one measure at least, recognize spoken words more accurately than the average human could.Xuedong Huang and his fellow Microsoft researchers had trained their speech-recognition service using large numbers of specialty chips supplied by Nvidia, rather than relying heavily on ordinary Intel chips. Their breakthrough would not have been possible had they not made that change.\u201cWe closed the gap with humans in about a year,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Mr. Huang said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the weapon \u2014 the infrastructure \u2014 it would have taken at least five years.\u201dBecause systems that rely on neural networks can learn largely on their own, they can evolve more quickly than traditional services. They are not as reliant on engineers writing endless lines of code that explain how they should behave.But there is a wrinkle: Training neural networks this way requires extensive trial and error. To create one that is able to recognize words as well as a human can, researchers must train it repeatedly, tweaking the algorithms and improving the training data over and over. At any given time, this process unfolds over hundreds of algorithms. That requires enormous computing power, and if companies like Microsoft use standard-issue chips to do it, the process takes far too long because the chips cannot handle the load and too much electrical power is consumed.So, the leading internet companies are now training their neural networks with help from another type of chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. These low-power chips \u2014 usually made by Nvidia \u2014 were originally designed to render images for games and other software, and they worked hand-in-hand with the chip \u2014 usually made by Intel \u2014 at the center of a computer. G.P.U.s can process the math required by neural networks far more efficiently than C.P.U.s.Nvidia is thriving as a result, and it is now selling large numbers of G.P.U.s to the internet giants of the United States and the biggest online companies around the world, in China most notably. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue from data center sales tripled to $409 million over the past year.G.P.U.s are the primary vehicles that companies use to teach their neural networks a particular task, but that is only part of the process. Once a neural network is trained for a task, it must perform it, and that requires a different kind of computing power.After training a speech-recognition algorithm, for example, Microsoft offers it up as an online service, and it actually starts identifying commands that people speak into their smartphones. G.P.U.s are not quite as efficient during this stage of the process. So, many companies are now building chips specifically to do what the other chips have learned.Google built its own specialty chip, a Tensor Processing Unit, or T.P.U. Nvidia is building a similar chip. And Microsoft has reprogrammed specialized chips from Altera, which was acquired by Intel, so that it too can run neural networks more easily.Other companies are following suit. Qualcomm, which specializes in chips for smartphones, and a number of start-ups are also working on A.I. chips, hoping to grab their piece of the rapidly expanding market. The tech research firm IDC predicts that revenue from servers equipped with alternative chips will reach $6.8 billion by 2021, about 10 percent of the overall server market.Across Microsoft\u2019s global network of machines, Mr. Burger pointed out, alternative chips are still a relatively modest part of the operation. And Bart Sano, the vice president of engineering who leads hardware and software development for Google\u2019s network, said much the same about the chips deployed at its data centers.Mike Mayberry, who leads Intel Labs, played down the shift toward alternative processors, perhaps because Intel controls more than 90 percent of the data-center market, making it by far the largest seller of traditional chips. He said that if central processors were modified the right way, they could handle new tasks without added help.But this new breed of silicon is spreading rapidly, and Intel is increasingly a company in conflict with itself. It is in some ways denying that the market is changing, but nonetheless shifting its business to keep up with the change.Two years ago, Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, which builds the programmable chips that Microsoft uses. It was Intel\u2019s largest acquisition ever. Last year, the company paid a reported $408 million buying Nervana, a company that was exploring a chip just for executing neural networks. Now, led by the Nervana team, Intel is developing a dedicated chip for training and executing neural networks.\u201cThey have the traditional big-company problem,\u201d said Bill Coughran, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital who spent nearly a decade helping to oversee Google\u2019s online infrastructure, referring to Intel. \u201cThey need to figure out how to move into the new and growing areas without damaging their traditional business.\u201dIntel\u2019s internal conflict is most apparent when company officials discuss the decline of Moore\u2019s Law. During a recent interview with The New York Times, Naveen Rao, the Nervana founder and now an Intel executive, said Intel could squeeze \u201ca few more years\u201d out of Moore\u2019s Law. Officially, the company\u2019s position is that improvements in traditional chips will continue well into the next decade.Mr. Mayberry of Intel also argued that the use of additional chips was not new. In the past, he said, computer makers used separate chips for tasks like processing audio.But now the scope of the trend is significantly larger. And it is changing the market in new ways. Intel is competing not only with chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm, but also with companies like Google and Microsoft.Google is designing the second generation of its T.P.U. chips. Later this year, the company said, any business or developer that is a customer of its cloud-computing service will be able to use the new chips to run its software.While this shift is happening mostly inside the massive data centers that underpin the internet, it is probably a matter of time before it permeates the broader industry.The hope is that this new breed of mobile chip can help devices handle more, and more complex, tasks on their own, without calling back to distant data centers: phones recognizing spoken commands without accessing the internet; driverless cars recognizing the world around them with a speed and accuracy that is not possible now.In other words, a driverless car needs cameras and radar and lasers. But it also needs a brain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google and Sex Traffickers Like Backpage.com", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySex traffickers in America have the police and prosecutors pursuing them, but they do have one crucial (if secret) ally: Google.Now Google is using its enormous lobbying power in Washington to try to kill bipartisan legislation that would crack down on websites that promote sex trafficking.It\u2019s not that Google is taking ads from Backpage (it doesn\u2019t) or giving it money. But as Backpage fights off prosecutors and worries about the legislation, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, Google has emerged as its behind-the-scenes champion.Why? Why would Google ally itself with Backpage, which is involved in 73 percent of cases of suspected child sex trafficking in the U.S., which advertised a 13-year-old whose pimp had tattooed his name on her eyelids?That impresses few people outside the tech community, for the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act was crafted exceedingly narrowly to target only those intentionally engaged in trafficking children. Some tech companies, including Oracle, have endorsed the bill.\u201cThis bill only impacts bad-actor websites,\u201d notes Yiota Souras, general counsel at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \u201cYou don\u2019t inadvertently traffic a child.\u201dSenator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and lead sponsor of the legislation, says that it would clearly never affect Google. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to work with them,\u201d Portman told me.Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the lead Democratic sponsor, adds that \u201cit\u2019s truly baffling and perplexing\u201d that some in the tech world (Google above all) have dug in their heels. He says the sex trafficking bill gathered 28 co-sponsors within a week, making it a rare piece of bipartisan legislation that seems likely to become law.Baby Face said that when she balked, the pimp threw her down a stairway. Finally, one day she was hurting badly and could not bear to be raped any more. So when her pimp sold her on Backpage in Brooklyn and waited outside the building, Baby Face pounded on the door of another apartment, begged to use the phone and called her mom. The police rescued her and the pimp went to prison.In response to my inquiries, Google issued a statement: \u201cBackpage acted criminally to facilitate child sex trafficking, and we strongly urge the Department of Justice to prosecute them for their egregious crimes against children. \u2026 Google will continue to work alongside Congress, antitrafficking organizations and other technology companies to combat sex trafficking.\u201dFine, but then why oppose legislation? Why use intermediaries to defend Backpage? To me, all this reflects the tech world\u2019s moral blindness about what\u2019s happening outside its bubble.Even if Google were right that ending the immunity for Backpage might lead to an occasional frivolous lawsuit, life requires some balancing.For example, websites must try to remove copyrighted material if it\u2019s posted on their sites. That\u2019s a constraint on internet freedom that makes sense, and it hasn\u2019t proved a slippery slope. If we\u2019re willing to protect copyrights, shouldn\u2019t we do as much to protect children sold for sex?\u201cOur children can\u2019t be the cost of doing business,\u201d she said. Google understands so much about business, but apparently not that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erick Erickson: How to Find Common Ground", "Date": "2017-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionA year ago my life went to hell. After I declared myself unable to support the election of Donald Trump because of my faith and conservative convictions, three protesters showed up on my front porch. They did not threaten physical harm. But they did express feelings of betrayal and declared their intention to ruin my career as a conservative talk radio host and writer. I needed to carefully reconsider, or else.I just could not bring myself to do it. For the next three months, we had armed guards parked outside our house. People called my radio station demanding I be fired. My children came home from school in tears because other kids were wondering when I would be shot or telling them about all their family members who hated me.A woman in my wife\u2019s Bible study group said that she and her friends wanted to punch me in the face. For a while we stopped going to church. At the grocery store, my children were accosted by a stranger yelling that their father was destroying their lives and the country. And in the middle of this I found it harder and harder to breathe. But it wasn\u2019t the stress of the situation causing it.In April 2016, with my blood oxygen level below 90 percent, doctors rushed me into a cardiac intensive care unit when they discovered blood clots in my lungs. There were so many that a doctor who saw my scan wondered if my corpse had been taken to the morgue yet.As I lay in a CT machine getting scanned that day, the Mayo Clinic called my wife to inform her that doctors thought she had lung cancer. Less than six months later they confirmed she has a genetic, incurable form of the disease. Fortunately, she can take an oral chemotherapy pill that keeps her cancer at bay. The cancer cells will eventually mutate so they can\u2019t be suppressed by the medicine, and we can only pray new drugs are developed before each mutation. Our family life is now focused on three-month windows of normalcy between my wife\u2019s CT scans.Contemplating these things, last November I posted a short essay on my website of things I would want my children to know if their mother and I died before they woke. I would want to confess my sins, some of which have been written about in this newspaper. I was mindful that should they Google me they would find out a lot of terrible stuff, some of it very true and some of it not so much.A publisher asked me to turn my essay into a book of love letters for my children, \u201cBefore You Wake.\u201d Little did my editors know they would also get a collection of recipes as the penultimate chapter.Writing a book like that forced me to confront my faults, my fears and my aspirations for my children. I want them to do what is right, not what is popular, and I want them to measure their self-worth by being ethical individuals, not by the applause they receive on social media.As we have moved more of our lives onto the internet, we have stopped living in actual communities. Instead we have created virtual communities where everyone thinks the same. We do not have to worry about the homeless man under the bridge because he is no longer part of our community. He is someone else\u2019s problem. But that simply is not true.Even as the internet provides us great advances, it also segments us. We have social-media tribes and our self-esteem is based on likes and retweets. We have hundreds of television channels and even more video choices online where Hollywood no longer has to worry about broad appeal. There is a channel for everyone, and everyone in the tribe will get the inside jokes. Social-media interactions have replaced the value of character.The truth, though, is that our Facebook friends are probably not going to water our flowers while we are on vacation and our Twitter followers will not bring us a meal if we are sick. But the actual human being next door might do both if we meet him.This is what I want my children to know if I should die before they wake. The kitchen table is the most important tool they have to reshape their community. Preparing a home-cooked meal and inviting people over, both those we know and those we want to know, forces us to find common ground.Not everything should be political, and we can only make everything political when we decide the other side is evil just because they disagree with us. We can see the world only in this polarized way if we never take the time to know anyone on the other side, if we never find ways to build friendship despite our differences.Every person has an interesting story to tell. I want my children to know my story. But I also want them to know that the stranger next door has one, too, and that even if they disagree on much, they can still be friends.We may also never find that common ground with people whose politics or faith conflicts with ours. But we owe it to one another to disagree agreeably, without anger or intimidation, whether on a front porch or a Facebook page. A little more grace among us all would go a long way toward healing the nation.Erick-Woods Erickson is the editor of the website The Resurgent and a talk-show host on radio station WSB.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IBM Now Has More Employees in India Than in the U.S.", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "IBM has shifted its center of gravity halfway around the world to India, making it a high-tech example of the globalization trends that the Trump administration has railed against.Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 IBM dominated the early decades of computing with inventions like the mainframe and the floppy disk. Its offices and factories, stretching from upstate New York to Silicon Valley, were hubs of American innovation long before Microsoft or Google came along.But over the last decade, IBM has shifted its center of gravity halfway around the world to India, making it a high-tech example of the globalization trends that the Trump administration has railed against.Today, the company employs 130,000 people in India \u2014 about one-third of its total work force, and more than in any other country. Their work spans the entire gamut of IBM\u2019s businesses, from managing the computing needs of global giants like AT&T and Shell to performing cutting-edge research in fields like visual search, artificial intelligence and computer vision for self-driving cars. One team is even working with the producers of Sesame Street to teach vocabulary to kindergartners in Atlanta.\u201cIBM India, in the truest sense, is a microcosm of the IBM company,\u201d Vanitha Narayanan, chairman of the company\u2019s Indian operations, said in an interview at IBM\u2019s main campus in Bangalore, where the office towers are named after American golf courses like Peachtree and Pebble Beach.The work in India has been vital to keeping down costs at IBM, which has posted 21 consecutive quarters of revenue declines as it has struggled to refashion its main business of supplying tech services to corporations and governments.The tech industry has been shifting jobs overseas for decades, and other big American companies like Oracle and Dell also employ a majority of their workers outside the United States.But IBM is unusual because it employs more people in a single foreign country than it does at home. The company\u2019s employment in India has nearly doubled since 2007, even as its work force in the United States has shrunk through waves of layoffs and buyouts. Although IBM refuses to disclose exact numbers, outsiders estimate that it employs well under 100,000 people at its American offices now, down from 130,000 in 2007. Depending on the job, the salaries paid to Indian workers are one-half to one-fifth those paid to Americans, according to data posted by the research firm Glassdoor.Ronil Hira, an associate professor of public policy at Howard University who studies globalization and immigration, said the range of work done by IBM in India shows that offshoring threatens even the best-paying American tech jobs.\u201cThe elites in both parties have had this Apple iPhone narrative, which is, look, it\u2019s O.K. if we offshore the lower-level stuff because we\u2019re just going to move up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a wake-up call. It\u2019s not just low-level jobs but high-level jobs that are leaving.\u201dWhile other technology titans have also established huge satellite campuses in India, IBM caught the attention of President Trump. At a campaign rally in Minneapolis just before the November election, he accused the company of laying off 500 Minnesotans and moving their jobs to India and other countries, a claim that IBM denied.IBM declined to make Ms. Rometty or another top executive available for an interview. But the company noted that it is investing in the United States, including committing $1 billion to training programs and opening new offices.Ms. Narayanan, who spent 12 years working at IBM in the United States and China before moving to India in 2009, said the company decided where to put jobs based on where it could find enough qualified workers and the customer\u2019s budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if someone says, \u2018Oh, jeez, let me just take these jobs from here and put them there,\u2019\u201d she said.William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who has studied the globalization of business, said IBM and other tech companies had benefited greatly from the emergence of a low-cost, technically skilled English-speaking work force in India.\u201cIBM didn\u2019t create this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut IBM would be a totally different company if it wasn\u2019t for India.\u201dIBM, which opened its first Indian offices in Mumbai and Delhi in 1951, is now spread across the country, including Bangalore, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai.Most of the Indian employees work in IBM\u2019s core business: helping companies like AT&T and Airbus manage the technical sides of their operations. Indians perform consulting services, write software and monitor cloud-based computer systems for many of the world\u2019s banks, phone companies and governments.But researchers here also try out new ideas. Looking to build a new system for searching with images instead of words, a team in Bangalore turned to Watson to index 600,000 photos from the world\u2019s top fashion shows and Bollywood movies. Last spring, a major Indian fashion house, Falguni Shane Peacock, tried the tool, which helps designers avoid direct copies or even do a riff on an old look, and generated new patterns for three dresses.\u201cIt has the capability of doing research in a couple of seconds that would take a long time,\u201d Shane Peacock, who runs the Mumbai firm with his wife, said in an interview.IBM even has a Bangalore \u201cgarage\u201d full of app designers who build corporate iPhone and iPad apps to simplify tasks like helping airline agents rebook passengers, bankers make loans and doctors update patient files.During a recent visit, Ramya Karyampudi, a user experience designer, was at the whiteboard sketching out an app for a smart refrigerator that would solve the universal problem of what to make for dinner.Starting with a drawing of a husband trying to plan a surprise meal for his wife, Ms. Karyampudi depicted the internet-connected refrigerator looking at what food was inside, sending over relevant recipes, telling him what extra ingredients he needed to pick up, and playing a video showing him how to cook it all.IBM re-entered the country through a joint venture with Tata in 1993, initially intending to assemble and sell personal computers. IBM\u2019s leaders soon decided that India\u2019s potential was far bigger \u2014 both as a market and as a base from which to serve customers around the world. The company took full control of the venture, established an Indian branch of its famed research labs, and in 2004, landed a landmark 10-year, $750 million contract from Bharti Airtel, one of India\u2019s biggest phone companies, which remains a major customer.IBM\u2019s chief executive at the time, Samuel J. Palmisano, was so proud of his India initiative that he rented out the grounds of the Bangalore Palace in June 2006, flew out the board, and told a crowd of 10,000 that IBM would invest $6 billion in India over the next three years.Today, India does not just deliver services to IBM\u2019s global clients. It is also a crucial market and the center of IBM\u2019s efforts to help businesses serve the next big slice of customers: the billions of poorer people who have been largely ignored by the tech revolution.For example, teams here have been applying IBM technology to process very small loans so that banks can make a profit on them.IBM has also been working with Manipal Hospitals, a chain based in Bangalore, to adapt Watson to help doctors treat certain cancers. Presented with a patient\u2019s medical history, the system taps into a database that includes advice from doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to recommend the best treatments \u2014 including the price, a big consideration since most Indians lack health insurance.Dr. Ajay Bakshi, Manipal\u2019s chief executive, said the biggest potential for the technology was in rural hospitals with few doctors. Manipal has just begun offering online \u201csecond opinions\u201d from Watson for 2000 rupees, or about $31. \u201cIt never sleeps. It never forgets. It doesn\u2019t get biased,\u201d he said.IBM executives say projects like these represent the company\u2019s future. \u201cI am looking for India to be my hub for affordable innovation,\u201d Ms. Narayanan said.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}

JAB Holdings has created an empire that includes third-wave pioneers like Stumptown Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea. And Starbucks has been rolling out its Reserve brand of coffee bars.Why is there so much interest in brands like Blue Bottle? Taylor Palmer, an analyst at the research firm IBISWorld, says that such companies offer higher-priced products that customers can regularly afford:\u201cAffordable luxury brands like Blue Bottle are pricing their coffee high enough that consumers feel like they\u2019re splurging, but low enough that that splurge can be rolled up into their weekly budget.\u201dMr. Trump said he would support legislation to protect the young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation if it were accompanied by a \u201cmassive\u201d border security upgrade.He said the package did not need to include funding for a border wall. \u201cThe wall will come later,\u201d he said.The tax plan, which Republican leaders said would be released in two weeks, may take a little longer.Mr. Trump said on Thursday that a detailed plan would be introduced the week of Sept. 25.He added that economic growth meant that the plan would not add to the deficit and that some Democrats were likely to support it. \u201cThis is not a plan for the rich,\u201d he said.Alphabet and SoftBank want a bigger piece of the ride-hailing market.

{"Headline": "Citizens of Gucci-land, Unite!", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewMILAN \u2014 On a giant industrial campus in the far reaches of Milan, past the room with the giant chinoiserie swans painted on the walls and the plush velvet chairs, past the garden with its crawling ivy and purple blooms, in a cavernous space traced by a river of winding blue, a mummy lay.Nearby was the Sphinx; diagonally across the room, an enormous Buddha; somewhere in close vicinity, an Aztec arch. Greek statuary was mounted on plinths, ditto Egyptian gods, and flanking it all on one wall were the arches of the Roman Forum. Then the strobe lights came on.So did Milan Fashion Week begin.It\u2019s where, in any case, the designer Alessandro Michele is attempting to build his own brave new world. One without borders or even boundaries; one where everyone is free to be you and me, as Marlo Thomas once sang. Or perhaps more pertinently, to let their freak fly. To pledge allegiance to \u201cResist the mantra of speed.\u201d And \u201cResist the illusion of something new at any cost.\u201d(Those appeals from the rallying cry/show manifesto entitled \u201cThe Act of Creation is an Act of Resistance,\u201d handed to attendees entering the spring show.)If nowhere else at least on his runway, surrounded by the souvenir stand relics of civilizations past. Lots of civilizations past.107 PhotosMr. Michele\u2019s omnivorous imagination is like the Blob, indiscriminately absorbing any adjective, philosopher and decorative detail in its path.Or at least that\u2019s how it looked under the strobes. They were there to make everyone focus on the \u201cexperience\u201d instead of the clothes, or so said Mr. Michele (blue-jeaned, bejeweled, purple aviators covering his eyes and rock star-worthy shaggy brown hair covering his face) before the show.The problem is it just underscored the fact that if everyone embraces the same wild idiosyncrasy, then they all start to look the same. Even reduced to a constituent part, you can spot a denizen of Gucci-land from across a crowded room. Unrelenting nonconformity bears an ironic resemblance to conformity \u2014 which once upon a time was called fashion victimhood.It\u2019s possible that\u2019s what people want now: citizenship in a community defined by a brand, be it the phone they carry or the clothes they wear. After all, more traditional communities are breaking down. Certainly it\u2019s become a working premise for fashion.In the hills of Umbria, Brunello Cucinelli has a campus of his own (more like a feudal town, actually, but perhaps these days that\u2019s semantics), which the designer transplants to his Milan headquarters , the better to model the slow life and his deeply seductive vision of high luxury athleisure: cashmere hoodies with glinting gold stripes down the arm; dark denim evening vests atop feather and sequined playsuits; T-shirts made from stiff pleated tiers of tulle.You can see the appeal when faced with the head-scratching about-face of Alberta Ferretti, who abandoned her signature frothy, fragile femininity in search of what she called renewal. Which began with bathing suits and ended with some metallic sorbet-shaded trousers and shirts knotted above the waist by way of Halston-lite jersey gowns and sparkly baby-doll dresses.Where was she going with this? It was hard to tell, because she never actually arrived.(By contrast, Fausto Puglisi\u2019s decision to detour from his recent trash-\u2019n\u2019-vaudeville version of Siciliana to produce a collection of relatively simple white and black lace and linen slip dresses, shirtdresses and ballerina frocks was a good one.)And you can, perhaps, begin to understand the impetus for the unexpected return of logomania, not just at Gucci (yes, Mr. Michele did that, too) but at Max Mara, where a rococo rendering of the brand\u2019s name was revived as a print on beige pencil skirts paired with matching jean jackets and matching shoulder bags, and at Fendi.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s like our personal monogram,\u201d Silvia Fendi said of the double F, before a show with its own unforced energy that layered \u2014 literally \u2014 the geometries of Italian Futurism with the leaves and lightness of the tropics.Shoulders and waists did double duty as erogenous zones, and stripes \u2014 \u201canother one of our codes,\u201d according to Ms. Fendi \u2014 soared diagonally, horizontally and every other which way, mixed in and over logos old and new (\u201cI refreshed it,\u201d the designer Karl Lagerfeld said of the single gold F in a pink circle that created a punctuation mark at the end of the runway).The letter appeared on belts and buckles, bags, mink bombers, socks and sheer nylon mesh skirts. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for everyone to be part of our family,\u201d Ms. Fendi said. To signal, perhaps, their membership in a social network of a different kind.slide showslide showslide showslide showAdvertisement"}

The Wildhorse was a divine revelation \u2014 white people, they\u2019re just like us!My visit to the South was long overdue. I\u2019ve lived in five countries on three continents, but the United States has always been the unifying thread; my America is diverse and dynamic and molded by immigrants. But how well did I really know it? Last fall, when I returned from a four-year stint as an expat in South Africa, I deplaned into unfamiliar territory. There was an acrid, unseen fog looming: two weeks later came Election Day.President Trump began his term with a travel ban on certain Muslim-majority countries; this week he\u2019s expanding that diktat, and in what\u2019s become the hallmark of a turbulent presidency, no one has any clue what\u2019s next. As a Muslim American immigrant, am I just a few 140-character proclamations away from having my citizenship revoked? But fear also sparked curiosity. To me, \u201cWyoming\u201d sounds foreign and peculiar, spilling lazily off the tongue like a yawn and evoking in my mind the wild terrain someone else might associate with a Zimbabwe or Mozambique. What\u2019s exotic to me isn\u2019t food gilded with turmeric and six-day weddings \u2014 it\u2019s grits and rodeos. How much time did I have left to experience them?I wondered if, given Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, I would feel like a foreigner in my own home. So I hit the road over the Fourth of July to see how much of an outsider I really was.\u201cThe songs really don\u2019t help the stereotypes,\u201d Sobia remarked.Every explorer needs a sidekick, so I\u2019d drafted a friend whose curiosity rivaled my own. Sobia was the Clark to my Lewis, the Finn to my Sawyer, the Buzz Lightyear to my Woody; we were two Muslim-American women trying to demystify guns, cowboys, and church, and hopefully evading lard in the process. At that moment, however, our ambitions were limited to making sense of the song on the radio: \u201cI was sittin\u2019 there sellin\u2019 turnips on my flatbed truck\u2026\u201dYou have to hand it to country music. You want to mock its clich\u00e9s? It\u2019ll cram each verse with so many mommas and daddies and shotguns and Chevys that it insulates itself from satire. It\u2019s self-aware and sassy, somewhere between caricature and cultural anthropology \u2014 just look up the lyrics to Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s \u201cA Country Boy Can Survive.\u201d Recurring themes of booze, small-town boys chasing blonde-haired girls, guns, and pickup trucks are not my domain. The heartbreak, however, is breathtakingly relatable.If the God-fearing and gun-loving bumper stickers in these parts are anything to go by, Jesus himself might have drafted the Second Amendment. So as we hit the highway from Nashville, I insisted on a pit stop at Walmart to see what the hype was about.A gun-browsing native by the display of hunting rifles caught me ogling and chuckled. \u201cHow many do you own?\u201d I asked him.\u201cFour, including this one,\u201d he answered, lifting his shirt. My eyes widened at my first glimpse of a gun in the wild. \u201cYou need one in Memphis.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m... headed to Memphis.\u201d\u201cThen I suggest you get one.\u201dI invested in a $6 red, white, and blue cowboy hat instead.The Mississippi Delta\u2019s history is shaped by slavery and poverty, igniting a musical genre that\u2019s inspired everything from jazz to rock \u2018n roll to R&B. \u201cWhen I first got the blues, they brought me over on a ship, men were standing over me, and a lot more with a whip,\u201d sang B.B. King. \u201cAnd everybody wanna know why I sing the blues. Well, I\u2019ve been around a long time, I\u2019ve really paid my dues.\u201dSobia and I found many nationalities and shockingly few sequins among Graceland\u2019s pilgrims. \u201cSo many people try to copy him, but he was the ultimate,\u201d said Rishi Khanna, a fan since his youth in India, before singing a few bars of \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling in Love.\u201d \u201cElvis\u2019s music is from the divine.\u201dHis words lingered that evening, when a jovial elderly man chatted us up at a doughnut shop. The store had run out of doughnuts; I may have missed dessert, but I was treated to a serving of white privilege when I asked him about life in Memphis during the civil rights struggle.\u201cBlacks and whites never had problems,\u201d he claimed.\u201cBut weren\u2019t blacks second-class citizens?\u201d\u201cThey never thought about it until Martin Luther King,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf they thought about it, it never came up.\u201dThe man was in his 80s, and his filter had clearly reached its expiration date. Most people of color have heard rumors of this camaraderie that exists among some white folks, where racist banter is exchanged with strangers as nonchalantly as chitchat about the weather. But I\u2019ll never be part of that club, and was startled by his bluntness. I don\u2019t wear a head scarf that identifies me as Muslim, yet surely one would assume I\u2019m Indian, or Arab, or Hispanic, or Persian \u2014 origins rooted in some place where the people are brown, the governments are temperamental, and the food is delicious (\u201cthe hot-sauce zone,\u201d my friend Aarti dubs it).It was more peculiar since I was joined by my friend Nazia, a Memphis transplant, who does wear a scarf. Confederate statues aside, though, she feels Southern hospitality typically trumps bigotry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of respect for people of faith,\u201d she said later. \u201cThey might not agree with you, they might think Jesus needs to save you, but they believe they need to be good and kind because that\u2019s the way Jesus would have been.\u201dThis ain\u2019t my first rodeo. I liked my first one so much that I was back for seconds the next night.Is this how outsiders feel when they encounter their first Indian wedding? Was my flimsy Walmart-issue cowboy hat cultural appropriation?After the show it\u2019s the after-party, and a packed Dairy Queen was where we found some cowboys hanging out post-rodeo. \u201cIt\u2019s like strapping yourself onto a moving truck and rolling it down a hill,\u201d said Dalton Epperson when I tried to pinpoint the appeal of mounting a riled-up bull. \u201cPretty much tying yourself to death.\u201d In two nights, I only saw one bull rider last a full eight seconds; when I attempted a turn atop a mechanical bull, I went airborne after two.Cavorting with death is a common Western pastime, in the way I might go to brunch or a museum. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world out here. This is the wilderness,\u201d said Ron, a local I met on Cody\u2019s main drag. \u201cYou go 15 minutes one way and there\u2019s a wolf; 15 minutes in the other direction there\u2019s a grizz. Guns aren\u2019t a macho thing, it\u2019s a way of life.\u201dI tried that way of life at a shooting range, unloading a Ruger SR22 semiautomatic into a target that offered visual confirmation that I had not uncovered a hidden talent.\u201cHave you ever had to use one in self-defense?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, but it\u2019s the same thing as having a fire extinguisher \u2014 I have one in my house but I hope I never have to use one, either.\u201d I personally wouldn\u2019t brandish a fire extinguisher on my belt while running errands, but that\u2019s a sartorial choice I\u2019ll have to live with.The frontier has always intrigued me, but from a safe, playing-Oregon-Trail-in-a-computer-lab kind of distance. Now there I was, except I was steering an American-made Ford, not a rickety wagon prone to absconding wheels, and death by dysentery wasn\u2019t a significant concern. We stopped at a ranch to try horseback riding, and Caleb, a teenager who could ride before he could walk and has had his own gun since he was nine \u2014 the kind of fella who probably would have survived a non-pixelated Oregon Trail just fine \u2014 guided us through a forest of lodgepole pines with snowcapped mountains, pleated like the folds of a sari, rippling in the distance.Things weren\u2019t as serene inside the world\u2019s oldest national park. Yellowstone was established by Ulysses S. Grant in 1872 as \u201ca public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\u201d; people took that to heart, and now they seem to outnumber bison and buffalo. We battled peak summer crowds to see blindingly white hot springs, steaming pools whose kinetic colors resemble semiprecious gemstones in liquid form, and one particularly unreliable geyser. Despite its tardiness, Old Faithful draws crowds that rival Disneyland. \u201cThis feels more like a theme park than Graceland did,\u201d Sobia said.Rebranding aside \u2014 looking at the map, one thing is for sure: Minneapolis is a long way from Mogadishu.\u201cI wanted to bring the goodness to the mainstream,\u201d said the owner Abdirahman Kahin. \u201cThe goodness\u201d is Somali cuisine; judging by the patrons \u2014 college students, middle-aged officegoers \u2014 the mainstream loves it.It\u2019s not a perfect world, and the community is anxious about perception problems \u2014 several young Somali Americans asked not to be quoted. But with the anti-refugee rhetoric surging across the country, I came to Minneapolis to see what it looks like when a city throws open its doors.\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my city \u2014 we\u2019re breaking stereotypes,\u201d said Sumaya Keynan, a designer and social media influencer. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Minnesota Nice\u2019 for a reason. With elections things have changed in America, but Minneapolis hasn\u2019t.\u201dTrying to understand how Minneapolis became a beacon for refugees \u2014 the city also has notable Hmong, Bosnian, Liberian, Tibetan, and Syrian populations \u2014 I met with a former mayor, R.T.

{"Headline": "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical \u2018Fuzzy Logic,\u2019 Dies at 96", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLotfi Zadeh, the computer scientist and electrical engineer whose theories of \u201cfuzzy logic\u201d rippled across academia and industry, influencing everything from linguistics, economics and medicine to air-conditioners, vacuum cleaners and rice cookers, died on Wednesday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 96.His son, Norman, confirmed the death.If someone asks you to identify \u201ca very tall man,\u201d for instance, you can easily do so \u2014 even if you are not given a specific height. Similarly, you can balance a broom handle on your finger without calculating how far it can lean in one direction without toppling over.Mr. Zadeh envisioned a mathematical framework that could mimic these human talents \u2014 that could deal with ambiguity and uncertainty in similar ways. Rather than creating strict boundaries for real world concepts, he made the boundaries \u201cfuzzy.\u201d Something was not in or out, for example. It sat somewhere on the continuum between in and out, and at any given moment a set of more complex rules defined inclusion.\u201cIt was a bridge between theory and reality,\u201d said Rudolf Seising, a professor at the University of Jena in Germany who specializes in fuzzy logic and worked alongside Professor Zadeh in his later years.In academic circles, Professor Zadeh\u2019s work was controversial and sometimes ridiculed, in part because it challenged other forms of mathematics and in part because of his terminology. \u201cFuzzy logic\u201d seemed to make fun of itself.But the logic itself was not fuzzy, said Professor Timothy Ross of the University of New Mexico. It was a way of dealing with \u201cfuzzy sets,\u201d collections of information whose boundaries were vague or imprecise. Over the years it proved to be an enormously influential idea.According to the website Google Scholar, Mr. Zadeh\u2019s 1965 paper, titled \u201cFuzzy Sets,\u201d has been cited by more than 90,000 scholarly works, and his mathematical concepts have provided practical new ways to build consumer electronics, trade stocks, forecast weather and more.Lotfi Asker Zadeh was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Baku, Azerbaijan, which was then a Soviet Socialist republic. His father was a journalist, and his mother, born in Russia, was a doctor.After the family moved across the Soviet border to Iran, Mr. Zadeh graduated with a science degree from the University of Tehran. During World War II he sold goods to the American Army, earning enough money to continue his education in the United States, his son said. He received a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946 and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1949.As a professor at Columbia, working alongside John Ragazzini, Mr. Zadeh developed a mathematical method called z-transformations, which became a standard means of processing digital signals inside computers and other equipment. He moved to Berkeley in 1959.Elijah Polak, a professor emeritus at Berkeley, recalled in an interview that Professor Zadeh\u2019s theory of fuzzy sets emerged during their walks across the campus. Professor Zadeh began noticing that when people parked their cars, they would intuitively turn their wheels slightly to the left and then slightly to the right before pulling into a parking space.\u201cBut how much is slightly?\u201d he would ask.Fuzzy sets began as an effort to use mathematics to define \u201cslightly\u201d \u2014 or \u201ctall\u201d or \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cbeautiful\u201d or any other concept that has ambiguous boundaries.Professor Zadeh originally envisioned fuzzy sets as simply a framework for harnessing language. But the idea expanded into other areas. It could provide a way for insurance companies to assess damage after an earthquake, for instance. Is the damage serious, moderate or minimal under company rules? Fuzzy sets could help.\u201cThey opened up a whole new way of addressing problems where you don\u2019t have precise data,\u201d said Professor Ross, the author of a textbook on the practical uses of fuzzy logic.The method could also help build machinery and electronics that gradually move from one state to another, like an automobile transmission, which shifts smoothly from first gear to second, or a thermostat, which flows just as smoothly from hot to cold. Hot and cold need not be precisely defined. They could exist on a continuum.In the 1980s, Professor Zadeh\u2019s ideas became popular among Japanese manufacturers, thanks to heavy investment from the government. Today the hype has faded, but fuzzy logic remains an active part of the mathematics that underpin the modern world.In recognition of his work, Professor Zadeh received more than 50 engineering and academic awards. From 1963 to 1968 he was chairman of Berkeley\u2019s electrical engineering department, helping to shift its focus toward computer science, a move that gave rise to one of the world\u2019s top university computer science programs.Professor Zadeh\u2019s son is his only immediate survivor. His wife, Fania, died this year. A daughter, Stella, died in 2006. He was to be buried in Baku.Professor Zadeh and others saw fuzzy logic as a tool for eventually building true artificial intelligence, and though many academics, including some Berkeley colleagues, questioned how effective these methods would be, he held firm.\u201cHe always took criticism as a compliment,\u201d said Stuart Russell, a Berkeley professor who worked next door to Mr. Zadeh for many years. \u201cIt meant that people were considering what he had to say.\u201dAn obituary on Sept. 12 about the computer scientist Lotfi Zadeh referred imprecisely to the status of Azerbaijan when he was born there in 1921. While it officially became a Soviet Socialist republic in 1920, it was not yet part of the Soviet Union, which was established in late 1922.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Unveils iPhone X and 8 Models as It Upgrades TV Set-Top Box", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple unveiled iPhone X, its first premium-tier phone, at an event in Cupertino, Calif., on Tuesday. Here\u2019s what else the company had to say.\u2022 iPhone X is priced at $999, the most expensive ever for a new iPhone model. It will ship on Nov. 3. (Pro tip: The X is pronounced 10, and not \u201cex.\u201d)\u2022 The phone has a newer screen technology known as OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.\u2022 The screen on the X has a so-called edge-to-edge display that takes up the entire face by eliminating the borders around the screen. Apple also eliminated the physical home button that has been a signature feature of the iPhone for a decade.\u2022 iPhone 8 is also here, as well as its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus. The models include a glass body and a faster chip.\u2022 Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box that has never been a blockbuster hit, got an upgrade. The device will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs.\u2022 Apple took the wraps off a new Apple Watch. Called Apple Watch Series 3, it has cellular capabilities. There\u2019s also a new Watch OS.With the $999 iPhone X, Apple moved to a new premium level of pricing. The smartphone will cost $300 more than the iPhone 8 and $200 more than the iPhone 8 Plus.While that will be too expensive for many people, the company said it saw the iPhone X defining a new era for the smartphone, much like the original iPhone did 10 years ago. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the device would \u201cset the path for the next decade.\u201d That\u2019s because Apple will likely build on some of the iPhone X\u2019s most notable features, including infrared facial recognition, wireless battery charging and sophisticated camera effects.Consumer reaction to the new phone will have a big impact on the company\u2019s revenue and stock price. Right now, analysts are betting on a slow uptake of the top-end phone, both because of production delays and the high price. But if it turns out to be an unexpected hit, like the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 Plus, the company\u2019s sales \u2014 and stock price \u2014 could surge.Wall Street wasn\u2019t immediately dazzled by Apple\u2019s presentation, however, with the stock price down more than 1 percent by the end of the event.The iPhone X is the first redesigned iPhone in three years, and Apple says it is the blueprint for \u201cthe future of the smartphone.\u201d Many of the design details had leaked to the press before today\u2019s unveiling \u2014 we\u2019d heard that it would have a new display that stretched across much more of the phone\u2019s front, and that it would do away with the trademark home button.Much of that turned out to be true. The iPhone X is essentially the same size and overall shape as the iPhone 7, but because the screen occupies all of the front of the phone, it is far larger than that of older models. The screen uses a technology new for Apple (which many competitors already use), called OLED. It produces better image quality than Apple\u2019s older LCD screens.What we didn\u2019t quite know was how Apple would integrate the new button-free design with the operating system \u2014 how would you navigate the phone without a physical button?It\u2019s quite simple: You swipe. To go home, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To see other apps, swipe up from the bottom and pause \u2014 now you see the multitasking pane. And to unlock your phone, you look at it. The iPhone X eliminates Apple\u2019s Touch ID, and replaces it with a facial-recognition system that Apple calls Face ID.Whether people will adjust to the button-free system remains to be seen. For better or worse, Apple has used essentially the same interface for the iPhone for the last decade. Swiping is easy, but it isn\u2019t as easy as hitting a button, and it may throw some people off at first. The learning curve will be interesting to watch.\u2014 Farhad ManjooThe brand-new feature in the iPhone X that has never existed on any other iPhone is infrared face scanning.The technology, called Face ID, uses an infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the phone and authorize mobile payments. The technology works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.For Apple, Face ID has been years in the making. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a camera system that scanned people\u2019s bodies so people could play Xbox games using body movements.Face ID is a direct response to the face-recognition feature in smartphones offered by Samsung, Apple\u2019s fiercest rival. Experts have criticized Samsung\u2019s face-recognition feature, which could be tricked by holding a photo of the smartphone owner\u2019s face in front of the camera.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.The new iPhone 8 line includes the iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the 8 Plus.The phones include a six-core processor that will handle more complex tasks and 3D games more quickly and efficiently than previous iPhones. The phones generally look the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with the exception of glass bodies, as opposed to aluminum.Apple improved the phones\u2019 cameras with new sensors and added new motion sensors to better support applications made for augmented reality, which use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.In particular, the dual cameras in the iPhone 8 Plus take photos with sharp details in low light. Apple also added a new portrait mode to improve the lighting on faces regardless of the background.Another notable new feature is the introduction of magnetic induction to the iPhones. Similar to Apple Watch, the iPhones can now be charged by being placed on a charging pad as opposed to being plugged in with a cable.The new iPhone 8 line will be one of the most important for Apple. Wall Street analysts have estimated that more than half of iPhone buyers will buy the 8 and 8 Plus over the next year. The models have a slightly higher starting price than their predecessors: The iPhone 8 starts at $699, up from $650 for older iPhone models.The new Apple TV, called Apple TV 4K, it is an iteration of the last model, which introduced a touch pad remote control. The new box will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, added that 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, and those who previously bought high-definition titles would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost.Apple said the new Apple TV 4K is also two times faster than the last one and includes support for a new color technology called H.D.R., or high dynamic range. This software feature enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture. In bright colors, you will see brighter highlights; in dark colors, you will see more details.The Apple Watch has been a sleeper hit for the company. Though early reviews were mixed, Apple has steadily improved the device, and now the smartwatch is the best-selling watch in the world, according to Apple.Today, Apple unveiled the third version of the device. It looks identical to the old version, but the new one carries a much-requested feature for the first time: It will come with a cellular chip, meaning it can access the internet even if it isn\u2019t connected to your phone. Among other capabilities, the cellular version can make calls, send texts and stream music when you\u2019re on the go.\u201cNow you have the freedom to go anywhere with just the Apple Watch,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.The cellular version completes a long-term vision for the Watch \u2014 to liberate you, in some small way, from Apple\u2019s best-selling phone. In a demo, a live call was made from the keynote address to an Apple employee on paddle board in the middle of a lake.This is a slightly risky strategy, of course; Apple doesn\u2019t want to kill its golden iPhone goose. But the new cellular watch is unlikely to be a replacement for the phone, just a high-priced complement.The new cellular version sells for $399; a WiFi-only version of the new version sells for $329, and you can still buy the older version for $249. The new watch will begin shipping on Sept. 22.Apple is set to unveil several new gadgets later this morning, but the highlight of today\u2019s event isn\u2019t something you can buy. It\u2019s Apple Park, the company\u2019s new $5 billion spaceship-shaped campus, which the company is showing off to the media for the first time.The press were penned off just out of range of the main building, at the Steve Jobs Theater, the 1,000-seat venue with a commanding view of the spaceship. A quick review: This place is just what you\u2019d imagine an Apple-designed campus would look like. Think of the aesthetics of an Apple Store \u2014 lots of wood and glass, everything in muted tans and greys, all signage in white-on-black Apple Sans type \u2014 set on an otherwise barren landscape.It is, unsurprisingly, very pretty, but its beauty comes with a deliberate touch of fright. Nothing here is to human scale, and the overall impression is one of being overwhelmed by Apple\u2019s sheer might.\u2014 Farhad ManjooAn earlier version of this article misstated the cost comparison of content streamed in 4K resolution on the new Apple TV 4K that was given by Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services. Mr. Cue said that the 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, not rent.An article on Wednesday about Apple\u2019s newly released iPhone models described incorrectly a phone call made during Apple\u2019s product announcement at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. An executive onstage at headquarters demonstrated Apple Watch capabilities by calling an employee on a paddle board in a lake; the employee did not initiate the call.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mass Psychology Supports the Pricey Stock Market", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThat was the observation of John Maynard Keynes, who suggested that investors do not actually make money by picking the best companies, but by picking stocks that waves of other traders will want to buy.Investing, in other words, is an exercise in mass psychology.I\u2019ve spent decades studying it, and believe that one way to predict future market moves is to sort through the narratives that sweep through the population and influence decisions on whether to buy or sell. Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.The current number is troubling. After the ratio\u2019s peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market\u2019s history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.The notion that investors were laboring under \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: \u201cSTOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED.\u201dIn early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with \u201c.com\u201d in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing \u201cdot-bombs,\u201d articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.So where are we today?That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else. I don\u2019t really know.That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no danger of a crash. But at the moment, the psychological preconditions for a spiraling downturn don\u2019t appear to be in place.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces a New World as Officials Rein In a Wild Web", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a muggy, late spring evening, Tuan Pham awoke to the police storming his house in Hanoi, Vietnam.They marched him to a police station and made their demand: Hand over your Facebook password. Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called \u201cMother\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d which criticized how the communist country was run.One line read, \u201cOne century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?\u201dThe diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cGovernments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.\u201dFacebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet\u2019s fragmentation \u2014 and increasingly, its consequences.The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people \u2014 about a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: From L.A. to Florida, With Rescue Boats in Tow", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.They responded after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Harvey.Now, just days after their deployment to the floods of southeast Texas, the Los Angeles search-and-rescue team known as California Task Force 1 is preparing to do it again in Florida.\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of preparing for battle right now,\u201d said Carlos Calvillo, an assistant fire chief with California Task Force 1, which has about 70 members.When not deployed, most of the members work in neighborhood fire stations across the state.Even as an intense wildfire season has strained California\u2019s firefighting forces, all of the teams were tapped to help out in Texas.Four of those \u2014 from San Diego, Los Angeles, Menlo Park and Oakland \u2014 were subsequently deployed to Florida, said Brad Alexander, spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services.California Task Force 1 was on the road home from Houston, where they logged more than 50 rescues, when they got the call to turn around, said Mr. Calvillo.Four days and more than 1,700 miles later, on Saturday, they were at a staging area in Orlando.The task force\u2019s members spent the weekend gearing up for what could be a vast rescue effort. At one point, they passed around pictures of the devastation Hurricane Andrew left Florida with 25 years ago.They wanted to get a sense of what, exactly, could happen in the state.The team has been touched by the many of the encounters they\u2019ve had since leaving home, said Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\u201cIt was just really neat to see what people did \u2014 little things,\u201d said Mr. Humphrey. \u201cAnd little things just mean so much.\u201dSam Hodgson, a photographer for The New York Times, has been embedded with the team in Orlando.A few of his photos from over the weekend:Alan Blinder contributed reporting from Orlando.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)When the conditions are right, California sunsets erupt in pinks, oranges and reds.For the full effect, some well-placed clouds act like a movie screen, reflecting even more color to the ground.But are California sunsets unique?First, a little science:Sunsets are colorful because of a process called scattering, which refers to molecules in the atmosphere sending the light off in different directions.The wavelengths on the red end of the spectrum pass more easily through the atmosphere than do those at the blue and violet end.So when light travels longer distances through the atmosphere, such as at sunset and sunrise, more of the blue gets filtered out, making it appear redder.It\u2019s commonly said that Los Angeles smog actually enhances the effect.Pollution actually mutes the colors by deflecting light, he said. The brightest hues are produced when the air is cleanest, hence the vivid displays characteristic of the tropics.The same principle applies to sunsets over the Pacific, where less pollution above the ocean gets in the way. That means Californians on the coast can usually count on bright colors.Even so, Mr. Corfidi wasn\u2019t prepared to write off the smog-affected sunset as inferior.\u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people might like that, if you like pastel shades.\u201dA few California sunsets shared by readers over the last year:The California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "Should the Middle Class Invest in Risky Tech Start-Ups?", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtJason Calacanis cuts an unusual figure for a financial savior in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s fashionable for the world\u2019s richest men to feign embarrassed modesty about their wealth and power.Mr. Calacanis, an entrepreneur and investor who claims to be worth more than $100 million, harbors no such restraint. He is a rich man who often behaves like the caricature of a rich man \u2014 a brash, big-talking native New Yorker who flaunts his cars (\u201cI have all the Teslas\u201d), humblebrags about a popular podcast he hosts (he guesses it makes about $1 million in annual revenue, \u201cbut it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s brand-building\u201d), and even promotes his own branded paper coffee cups.\u201cHave you seen my new cups?\u201d he asked by way of greeting during an interview last month. \u201cI love my cups. They\u2019ve got my tagline: \u2018Do The Work.\u2019 \u201dMr. Calacanis, 46, admits his personality is not for everyone. \u201cMost folks think I\u2019m lucky, some say I\u2019m a complete fraud, and a handful think I\u2019m a brilliant hype man, and I don\u2019t agree with any of them \u2014 I agree with all of them,\u201d he writes in his new book, published in July, whose full title is a mouthful: \u201cAngel: How to Invest in Technology Startups \u2014 Timeless Advice From An Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000.\u201dYet there is something refreshing and clarifying about Mr. Calacanis\u2019s frankness regarding his tech-fueled riches. He states plainly what many in Silicon Valley believe but are too politic to say \u2014 and which has lately been dawning on the rest of the world: that the tech industry is decimating the rest of the planet\u2019s wealth and stability.Still, Mr. Calacanis is offering a much more dismal view of the disruptions caused by tech \u2014 and a more radical, if also self-serving, plan for dealing with it. To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future \u2014 and you need to learn Silicon Valley\u2019s ways rather than expect to defeat it.\u201cMost of you are screwed,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel,\u201d arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America. \u201cThe world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which you\u2019re reading this.\u201dMr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead. \u201cIn my mind, candidly, we\u2019ve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dBe warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as \u201cangel investing.\u201d Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing \u2014 he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.\u201cI want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors,\u201d he says.Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice. They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks. Invest in start-ups with your \u201cfun money\u201d but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.Even other tech investors aren\u2019t sold on Mr. Calacanis\u2019s movement. Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms. \u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to lose all your money, you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Walk said.Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups. His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacanis\u2019s isn\u2019t without its apparent grifts. Mr. Calacanis runs a \u201csyndicate,\u201d a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets. The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate \u2014 and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors\u2019 returns.Not that he\u2019s shy about any of this. \u201cOf course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dYou could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades. He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, \u201cWhat would it be like to be rich?\u201dHe got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York. Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million. Along the way, he made dozens of connections \u2014 he casually name-drops every big name in tech \u2014 and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into \u201cdeal flow,\u201d getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.One charge against Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice is that his wins aren\u2019t widely replicable \u2014 not everyone can make a fortune off their friends\u2019 billion-dollar ideas, after all.But Mr. Calacanis isn\u2019t suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to wind up being the GOAT,\u201d he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.\u201dInstead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business. He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his. Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals. He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort \u2014 people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.And he is frank about the risks. The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, \u201cDON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.\u201dBut to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking. The world seems to have lost its moorings; it\u2019s changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.So shouldn\u2019t you do something big? As Mr. Calacanis argues: \u201cNo gamble, no future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 8: The Best Screen, for a Hefty Price", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThere is as much to love about the new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 as there is to hate.If you are the forgiving type, you may love the Note 8 despite its flaws. It has the best smartphone display \u2014 as bright and vivid as a screen on a high-end television set \u2014 that I have ever tested. The camera is fast and takes professional-quality photos. Jotting down notes with the stylus feels almost as good as writing on a paper notepad. And most importantly, Samsung did extra safety checks to make sure this one doesn\u2019t explode.The positives outweigh the negatives to make the Note 8, which costs roughly $950 and is scheduled to arrive in stores on Sept. 15, the best big-screen Android smartphone you can buy today.The Note 8 uses a technology known as OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. In the coming years, all higher-end smartphones will probably transition to OLED.On the Galaxy Note 8\u2019s 6.3-inch screen, the benefits of OLED are pronounced. Photos looked amazing. They popped out with vivid colors and nice shadow detail. For reading, web articles looked great, with crisp, clear text that was easy on the eyes \u2014 a boon for anyone with less-than-perfect vision. The roomy screen, which has roughly the same dimensions as a pocket notepad, is a nice size for taking notes with the digital pen; I used it to outline this review in a coffee shop.Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate, a consulting firm that studies displays, also tested the Note 8 and gave it an A+, his highest rating. He praised the screen for its exceptional brightness and wide color gamut, among other features.The downside is that OLED is an expensive screen technology, which is reflected in the Note 8\u2019s price tag. Apple\u2019s next premium iPhone, which is also expected to have an OLED screen, will cost upward of $999.The Note 8 calls this feature Live Focus, which worked quickly and proficiently in my tests. In the end, the Note 8\u2019s photos looked clear and vibrant but oversaturated to me \u2014 though some people prefer that their photos appear exaggerated.Long story short: You can buy the Galaxy Note 8 with a fair amount of confidence. Unlike its predecessor, the Galaxy Note 8 is unlikely to burn down your house, be banned from use on airplanes or explode in your ear.\u201cWhat is important is they\u2019ve done the right things,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said about the safety checks. \u201cBut the proof will be in the pudding, which would be selling these and not having an issue of any kind.\u201dThat brings us to what stinks about the Note 8. Some of the biometrics, including the ability to unlock your phone by scanning your face or irises, are so poorly executed that they feel like marketing gimmicks as opposed to actual security features.The iris scanner shines infrared light in your eyes to identify you and unlock the phone. That sounds futuristic, but when you set up the feature, it is laden with disclaimers from Samsung. The caveats include: Iris scanning might not work well if you are wearing glasses or contact lenses; it might not work in direct sunlight; it might not work if there is dirt on the sensor.I don\u2019t wear glasses or contact lenses and could only get the iris scanner to scan my eyes properly one out of five times I tried it.When you set up the face scanner, Samsung displays another disclaimer, including a warning that your phone could be unlocked by \u201csomeone or something\u201d that looks like you. (Hopefully you don\u2019t have a doppelg\u00e4nger.) In addition, face recognition is less secure than using a passcode. So why would you even use it?As a result, you will probably continue to use the phone\u2019s fingerprint scanner, a feature that has been available on many smartphones for several years. Unfortunately, the fingerprint scanner is located on the back of the phone, adjacent to the camera flash, which is next to the lenses. In my tests, I accidentally touched the camera lenses multiple times, leaving smudges. If you eventually own a Note 8, make it a regular habit to wipe the camera lenses with a cloth.At the end of the setup, Bixby explicitly says it is not perfect and it is working to improve all the time. So why should anyone use it? Nobody wants their time wasted by an assistant who is insecure and incompetent.In my tests, Bixby failed to dictate my latest email, provide traffic data for a commute, bring up a map to the gym and order delivery food, among many other tasks. The upshot: Bixby is an unfinished product and it should not be a reason to consider buying the Note 8.Similarly, with its hefty price tag of nearly $1,000, the Note 8 is part of a new category of high-end phones. You should buy it today if you want the best screen right now.But just know that in a year or two, phones that cost a fraction of the price will be just as good.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a safety consultant used by Samsung Electronics, based on information provided by Samsung. The company\u2019s name is UL, not Underwriters Laboratories.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Renews Offensive on Silicon Valley With Tax Reforms", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s offensive against Silicon Valley looks as though it is likely to resume, as officials in Brussels consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by digital titans like Facebook and Amazon.The new proposals, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times on Wednesday, broadly aim to tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.But the plans will give ammunition to critics who argue the European Union unfairly targets the United States technology sector. Though the bloc\u2019s leaders deny that they single out American firms, opponents point to an array of investigations against household names for suspected violations ranging from how they handle user data to antitrust complaints.But it was not clear whether the latest effort by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, would gain sufficient traction. Any such reform would require the unanimous approval of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states. While several major countries like France have pushed for a crackdown, others do not want to change a system in which some of them can attract corporations with tax incentives and other inducements.In seeking to tax revenue rather than profit \u2014 one of the options being considered \u2014 European regulators want to ensure that major internet companies pay taxes to national treasuries where they do business. For example, Amazon, a target of the commission in the past, operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000, and so can take advantage of its low taxes.\u201cThe main challenge is to reform the international tax framework, which was first designed at the start of the 20th century and is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d the report said. It will be published by the commission on Thursday.The existing system \u201chas worked well for traditional \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 companies but as business activities have become more globalized and digitalized the old rules work less well,\u201d it continued.It found that companies that did their business online were paying an effective tax rate of 8.5 percent, or less than half that paid by more traditional businesses.The European Union stepped up its efforts to curb tax avoidance, by companies as well as wealthy individuals, after the financial crisis, which forced many of its member states to adopt belt-tightening measures, slashing public services and raising taxes.The commission said in its latest proposals that it wants to agree to a long-term solution with other countries around the world. But that could take a long time to negotiate, and may not close enough loopholes, so it put forward several shorter-term plans that could wind up meaning companies like Amazon, Facebook and Netflix pay larger tax bills in Europe much sooner.\u201cIn the absence of adequate global progress, E.U. solutions should be advanced,\u201d the commission said, adding that it could make more formal proposals on taxation in the coming months.The potential reforms it outlined include taxing companies based on their revenue rather than their profits, allowing national authorities to tax payments made by consumers to digital businesses, and allowing individual countries to tax revenue generated from advertising by internet companies.France has thrown its weight behind the first of those reforms, in particular. But questions have been raised over whether taxing revenue is a viable plan. Businesses that turn a hefty profit could effectively pay the same as a company of a similar size that has narrower margins, or even loses money.\u201cThe fundamental question is where is the business really being conducted,\u201d said J. Scott Marcus, an analyst at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe devil is in the details with a digital service across borders \u2014 the service can be made anywhere.\u201d\u201cThe question is who gets the tax,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine challenge.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simple Investing for Nonprofits", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe boards of small nonprofit organizations must make major investment decisions, but they are often flying in the dark.There is a simple answer, which works for many small institutions as well as for individuals saving for retirement. It is to put money into low-cost stock and bond funds, allocate the money appropriately and rebalance periodically. But the boards of nonprofits don\u2019t always find this straightforward approach appealing for a variety of reasons, many of them psychological.For one thing, not every nonprofit has board members who want to take responsibility for decisions that could affect their institution\u2019s financial health. Even members with financial expertise may feel ill equipped to make an investment decision in a stressful market.Hiring outside money managers to handle these burdens comes at a price and with no guarantee of success. Assembling a team of superb money managers, as Yale, Princeton and other universities have tried to do, may not be realistic for nonprofits that don\u2019t have an enormous endowment.That\u2019s why Larry Kochard, who oversees the University of Virginia\u2019s $8.6 billion endowment and sits on the board of the $18 million Virginia Environmental Endowment, says the simple solution, equity and bond index funds, makes sense for smaller institutions.Finding good outside advisers is possible for institutions without deep pockets, he said, but it is very difficult. \u201cThe odds of a small endowment finding the right managers are very slim,\u201d Mr. Kochard said.For the most part, he advocated modest goals, saying: \u201cIf we are watching our allocations and spending and rebalancing, we are meeting our obligations.\u201dMs. Shuman also favors index funds for nonprofits, but warns that the success of index funds over the past several years has largely been driven by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\u201cThey drove a disproportionate return,\u201d she said, and if these stocks decline, the indexes will fall, too. She recommends Vanguard\u2019s managed equity and international funds for low-cost but actively managed alternatives.When considering whether to hold hedge funds, which often do not allow immediate liquidation of investments, many nonprofits may need to examine whether they can afford to forgo access to their money for long periods.That\u2019s not always an issue, however. Before Patti Birch died in 2007, for example, she directed that her Patti and Everett B. Birch Foundation spend down all of its funds in the years ahead. The foundation\u2019s president, Vartan Gregorian, said it still gave money to \u201cthe arts, women\u2019s rights, religious and ethnic tolerance, freedom of speech and strengthening American democracy,\u201d all causes that were important to Ms. Birch. Mr. Gregorian is also president of the Carnegie Corporation.The foundation\u2019s remaining funds are all being held in low-risk short-term bonds, said Mark Imowitz, whose firm, Imowitz Koenig and Company, handles the finances.\u201cPatti was not worried about having great appreciation in her investment assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was natural to keep them in low-return funds since the money was being spent down.\u201dMany nonprofits have to think much longer term, however, and don\u2019t have the luxury of holding all of their assets in a single low-risk asset class.Roughly 80 percent of it is allocated to Commonfund\u2019s multistrategy equity fund, which includes a smattering of hedge funds, and it underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by 2.5 percentage points in the three years through April, Mr. Kempner said. The fund has improved lately, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a manager underperforms their benchmarks, you should not just immediately trade managers. You have to understand what is wrong and how can they plan to fix it \u201cFees vary widely and are not always transparent. Commonfund, which manages about $24 billion in nonprofit money for about 1,400 clients, charges an average fee of 0.3 percent directly, according to Keith Luke, Commonfund\u2019s president. But because the managers selected by Commonfund for nonprofit portfolios also charge fees and because there are additional expenses, the overall fee paid by nonprofits is about 1 percent on average, he said.Commonfund \u201cis like an institutional mutual fund,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cWe create a commingled investment vehicle of managers who pick stocks across all strategies.\u201d\u201cThere is scaled pricing,\u201d he said, \u201cand the larger the portfolio, the smaller the fee.\u201d For sizable portfolios \u2014 about $20 million \u2014 the overall fee would be less than 0.14 percent with Vanguard, he said.Geraldine Fabrikant is a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Rich Said No to Getting Richer", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA half-century ago, a top automobile executive named George Romney \u2014 yes, Mitt\u2019s father \u2014 turned down several big annual bonuses. He did so, he told his company\u2019s board, because he believed that no executive should make more than $225,000 a year (which translates into almost $2 million today).The old culture of restraint had multiple causes, but one of them was the tax code. When Romney was saying no to bonuses, the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent. Even if he had accepted the bonuses, he would have kept only a sliver of them.The high tax rates, in other words, didn\u2019t affect only the post-tax incomes of the wealthy. The tax code also affected pretax incomes. As the economist Gabriel Zucman says, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to try to earn $50 million in income when 90 cents out of an extra dollar goes to the I.R.S.\u201dThe tax rates helped create a culture in which Americans found gargantuan incomes to be bizarre.The theory behind all those high-end tax cuts \u2014 a theory that I once found persuasive, I admit \u2014 was that it would unleash entrepreneurial energy: The lure of great wealth would inspire business leaders to work harder and smarter, and the economy would flourish.The first half of that theory may well have come true. Many of the world\u2019s most successful companies are American \u2014 not only Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but also Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and JPMorgan Chase. The second half of the theory, however, has been a bust. Most Americans have not flourished in the era of a reduced top-end tax rate.Across society, the most powerful members of organizations have fought to keep more money for themselves. They have usually won that fight, which has left less money for everyone else.What would be the right top tax rate today? I don\u2019t know the precise answer. A top rate of 90 percent clearly has the potential to drive away entrepreneurs. But I am convinced that the current top tax rate, 39.6 percent, is too low.This week, President Trump and Congress will turn their attention to tax policy. After the failure of their health care bill, they are desperate for a legislative win and hope to pass a bill by year\u2019s end. Of course, they are not considering a higher top tax rate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: CPR Training", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationAt the beginning of summer, as I prepared to teach a seven-week writing workshop to 35 teenagers, I received a frightening email from my boss. Before class started, this email informed me, I had to pass a basic CPR-and-first-aid class. My first thought was, simply, Oh, no. Second thought: Maybe it\u2019s not really required. (I Googled: It was.) Third thought \u2014 admittedly, more of a question, charged from within by a hot embarrassment that bordered on shame \u2014 What if I pass out?For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve become faint easily, almost always in response to intrusive fears about the human body\u2019s softness and permeability, the million ways it can be compromised or suddenly fail. A bad feedback loop gets going: The idea of bodily malfunction makes me feel woozy; the wooziness makes me suspect my body is malfunctioning; this suspicion snowballs; I get woozier. Usually, it passes. Now and then, I pass out.In sixth grade, I conked out in science class, pushed over the edge by a teacher who supplemented our lesson on the endocrine system with a collection of his own kidney stones encased in a Ziploc bag, which he then passed around the room. In junior high, I crashed to the floor in health class, unable to tolerate a short animation on how extreme scoliosis affects internal organs. Needles have always been tough for me, as are pharmaceutical advertisements, depending on their level of detail.For the last few years, I\u2019ve been doing better, at least in part because I married a fellow low-grade hypochondriac. By reassuring each other, we\u2019ve gotten better at reassuring ourselves. But last summer, underhydrated and sleep-deprived, I passed out on a plane. Ever since, I\u2019ve felt that bad feedback loop stalking the back alleys of my mind, waiting to strike.When the day for my CPR training arrived, I showed up early to brief the instructors on my problem, hoping that naming it publicly might neutralize it. (According to the American Heart Association, up to 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t feel comfortable performing CPR, either because they\u2019ve never been trained or their training has lapsed.) The nurses nodded, polite and unconcerned, and made sure I saw a table full of sugary fruit snacks and granola bars. For the next few hours, I endured a breakneck tour of physical woes that might befall the students under my watch: breaks, burns, seizures, strokes. The instructors seemed to be using a \u201cscared straight\u201d strategy. One dwelt far too long and far too graphically on a certain pen-lodged-in-eyeball scenario; it was clear that she\u2019d seen one firsthand and that the memory still had a pull on her. Another warned us that, while administering first aid, we had to take hygienic precautions against, among other things, the flesh-eating MRSA bacteria. Rolling up her sleeve, she revealed a MRSA-devoured divot in her upper arm. \u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201dEvery few minutes, I would catch myself feeling like a John Updike narrator, full of wide-eyed awe at the body\u2019s miraculous machinery, all it did for us, every second. Then I would feel sick. I took notes, lots and lots of distracting notes. I inhaled. I exhaled. I ordered myself to just grow up already. I blew air into a plastic dummy\u2019s mouth and pressed on its chest to the rhythm of the Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d which sounds like a dark joke but is actually an official American Heart Association suggestion. I inhaled. I exhaled. I ate three bags of fruit snacks in four minutes. In the end, I was approved for a certificate. It\u2019s very hard not to get approved for a certificate.Immediately afterward, I fled the training center, relieved. But every day since then, I\u2019ve felt the spirit of the course at work inside me, kick-starting some good feedback loop I don\u2019t yet have a name for. I had worried the course would make me (even more) obsessed with bodily failure and misfortune; but first aid, I learned, is less about the body\u2019s universally inevitable breakdown and more about what happens when some particular body breaks down. In your classroom. At a party you\u2019re attending. On your bus. So much contemporary discourse encourages us to vigilantly monitor the world as an ever-shifting arena of dangers. First aid, by contrast, frames the world as an unpredictable set of chances to do your modest best and at least try nudging a body \u2014 maybe a friend\u2019s, maybe a stranger\u2019s \u2014 in a slightly better direction until the professionals show up.Each time that I\u2019ve passed out has been an unwanted reminder of a deep, dizziness-inducing fact of life, one I generally prefer to avoid contact with. Eventually, every body stops working. My body will eventually stop working. The body of every person I know and every person I love will eventually stop working forever and nothing that I or anyone else does will change this. But that\u2019s not the whole story. After each blackout, I\u2019ve returned to consciousness surrounded by people ready to help. They\u2019ve made things better for me. This is, of course, yet more evidence of my frustrating fragility: I need other people. My CPR certificate \u2014 on which my name is misspelled, but, oh well \u2014 is a reminder of something that has taken longer to sink in: Other people just might need me, too.Peter C.

There are the Regency romances (descended from the superb Georgette Heyer, whose first one, \u201cRegency Buck,\u201d appeared in 1935). And there are the contemporary young-woman-finding-her-way stories that are the successors to the working-girl novels that for decades provided comfort and (mild) titillation to millions of young women who dreamed of marrying the boss. This formula reached its apogee in 1958 with Rona Jaffe\u2019s \u201cThe Best of Everything,\u201d whose publishing-house heroines find either (a) business success at the price of stunted love, (b) true love and wifey bliss, (c) death. But almost 60 years have gone by since the virgins of \u201cThe Best of Everything\u201d hit the Big Apple, and real life has had its impact not only on modern romance but \u2014 as we shall see \u2014 on modern Romance.Here are the books mentioned in this week\u2019s \u201cWhat We\u2019re Reading\u201d:From a desktop or laptop , you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your Android phone or tablet:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Not-So-Glossy Future of Magazines", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne evening in mid-September, a gaggle of writers and bon vivant editors gathered by the outdoor fireplace and ivy-covered trellis of a West Village tavern. Steak was served, and the toasts lasted late into the night, the revelry trickling out to the nearby sidewalk.It could have been a scene from the Jazz Age heyday of the Manhattan magazine set \u2014 or even the 1990s, when glossy monthlies still soaked up millions of dollars in advertising revenue, and editors in chauffeured town cars told the nation what to wear, what to watch and who to read.Suddenly, it seemed, longstanding predictions about the collapse of magazines had come to pass.Magazines have sputtered for years, their monopoly on readers and advertising erased by Facebook, Google and more nimble online competitors. But editors and executives said the abrupt churn in the senior leadership ranks signaled that the romance of the business was now yielding to financial realities.As publishers grasp for new revenue streams, a \u2018\u2018try-anything\u2019\u2019 approach has taken hold. Time Inc. has a new streaming TV show, \u201cPaws & Claws,\u201d that features viral videos of animals. Hearst started a magazine with the online rental service Airbnb. Increasingly, the longtime core of the business \u2014 the print product \u2014 is an afterthought, overshadowed by investments in live events, podcasts, video, and partnerships with outside brands.The changes represent one of the most fundamental shifts in decades for a business that long relied on a simple formula: glossy volumes thick with high-priced ads.\u201cSentimentality is probably the biggest enemy for the magazine business,\u201d David Carey, the president of Hearst Magazines, said in an interview. \u201cYou have to embrace the future.\u201dAt a time of belt-tightening, celebrity editors, with their big salaries and expensive tastes, are increasingly pass\u00e9. Budget-minded executives at publishers like Hearst and Cond\u00e9 Nast are looking more critically at requests for six-figure photo shoots and $5-a-word writers.\u201cThe timing doesn\u2019t really surprise me,\u201d said Tom Harty, president and chief operating officer at Meredith, which publishes Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle. Magazines, Mr. Harty said, often circulate upcoming budget numbers in September.\u201cWhen you start thinking about the revenue stream for the following year,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cit must lead to some cost discussion.\u201dIn some ways, the spate of departures was a coincidence. Mr. Carter, 68, said he would have left earlier this year if not for the election of President Trump, whom he enjoys covering. Mr. Wenner, 71, has been deferring to his son, Gus, 27, who this year was named president of Wenner Media. Nancy Gibbs of Time had worked at the company for 32 years. And Cindi Leive of Glamour and Robbie Myers of Elle both served for nearly two decades.Quietly, optimists in the business say that it may be healthy for a younger generation of editors to take the reins. Older editors are less accustomed to the rhythms and forms of web journalism; Jann Wenner, for instance, famously resisted posting Rolling Stone stories online. Many of the industry\u2019s rising stars are finding ways to raise revenue and gain readers on the digital side.\u201cIf you want to do the same thing year in and year out, you shouldn\u2019t do these jobs,\u201d Mr. Carey said.Kurt Andersen, a former editor of New York and, with Mr. Carter, a founder of Spy magazine, said that print magazines were still breathing, but that the recent upheaval was a sign that the denouement might not be far off.\u201cThe 1920s to the 2020s was kind of the century of the magazine,\u201d he said, noting that The New Yorker and Time were founded in the decade before the Great Depression. Today, he added, the industry was in \u201cmore of a dusk, a slow dusk, and we\u2019re closer to sunset.\u201dIn his spacious aerie in Hearst\u2019s Midtown Manhattan tower, Mr. Carey displays trinkets of an earlier, more glamorous magazine age.Behind his desk is a framed quote from Malcolm Forbes, the exuberant late chairman of Forbes magazine, and a yellowing memo about Tina Brown from Mr. Carey\u2019s days as publisher of The New Yorker. His 43rd floor office overlooks the Hudson River and Central Park.But as the executive leading Hearst\u2019s magazine business into an uncertain future, Mr. Carey said that he was focused on identifying new ways to increase revenue and trim expenses.\u201cWe know that we have to constantly force ourselves to shake things up,\u201d said Mr. Carey, dressed meticulously in navy pinstripe. \u201cAll media companies are going through a period of change, and we\u2019re not immune from that.\u201dHearst, like Cond\u00e9 Nast, is privately held, so the details of its financial performance are unclear. But recent earnings reports from Hearst\u2019s publicly traded competitors provide a glimpse into the magazine industry\u2019s falling fortunes.Revenue at Time Inc. has declined every year since 2011; the company, which recently took itself off the market after speculation about a potential sale, is now aiming to cut $400 million in costs over the next 18 months. Although the print business still accounts for roughly two-thirds of Time Inc.\u2019s $3 billion in annual revenue, the company is shifting resources to video and television.Meredith, whose headquarters in Des Moines has test kitchens, craft studios and a wood shop, is doing comparatively better than its more glamorous rivals based in New York. Its magazines, which focus largely on perennial topics like decorating and recipes, remain popular with the company\u2019s mostly female readers. Still, Meredith reported a slight drop in revenue for its magazine business in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in June.A flurry of recent sales also suggest that smaller publishers are having trouble surviving on their own.Before Mr. Wenner put Rolling Stone up for sale, Wenner Media sold Us Weekly and Men\u2019s Journal to American Media Inc., the owner of The National Enquirer. Johnson Publishing, which is based in Chicago, sold the magazines Ebony and Jet last summer to a private equity firm. Rodale, whose titles include Bicycling, Runner\u2019s World and Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Health, recently said it, too, was for sale; a deal is expected to be announced in the coming weeks.\u201cThere have never been brand names like that that have been sold in such a concentrated period,\u201d said Reed Phillips, a managing partner at the investment bank Oaklins DeSilva & Phillips. \u201cThat alone indicates something is going on.\u201dThe financial outlook remains bleak. Analysts and executives expect double-digit annual declines in print advertising to continue. The ad buying firm Magna projects print magazine ad sales to fall 13 percent this year, with a similar rate of decline in 2018, according to a report released last week.Mr. Phillips said it was only a matter of time until these trends were felt at the industry\u2019s highest levels. \u201cIn the past, magazines could support celebrity editors, but it\u2019s becoming harder and harder with the revenue declines to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really not about making the numbers in 2017, but making the numbers in 2018.\u201dOne day after the fete for Mr. Carter at the Waverly Inn, Time Inc. rolled out a major initiative: PeopleTV.A new iteration of a streaming video network that the company introduced last year, PeopleTV will feature pop culture programming in conjunction with Entertainment Weekly, another Time Inc. title. Among the shows on offer: \u201cPaws & Claws,\u201d which, according to a news release, will feature \u201call of the adorable, viral and buzzworthy animal stories of the week.\u201dPet videos are a favorite on social media, so it is easy to see why Time Inc. wants to jump on the fluffy bandwagon. But that material is a far cry from the award-winning journalism that filled once-thick issues of Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Time, where Mr. Carter got his start in New York journalism.These experiments are part of an industrywide race to find some way \u2014 any way \u2014 to make up for the hemorrhaging of revenue.Hearst recently introduced The Pioneer Woman Magazine, a partnership with the Food Network host Ree Drummond that was initially sold only at Walmart. Its new travel publication, Airbnbmag, is geared toward customers of the do-it-yourself online rental site, with distribution at newsstands, airports and supermarkets. Meredith has started a magazine called The Magnolia Journal with the HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.Even Cond\u00e9 Nast, the glitzy purveyor of luxury titles, has recognized the advantages of outside partnerships. In recent weeks, the company debuted a quarterly print title for Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle brand, with a cover featuring a topless Ms. Paltrow submerged in mud from France.At Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter resisted efforts by Cond\u00e9 Nast executives to shift his design, photo, research and copy teams out of the magazine\u2019s purview, a move required of nearly every other title as part of a companywide cost-cutting effort, according to two people who spoke anonymously to describe private discussions. Mr. Carter was reluctant to make additional cuts that may be forced upon his magazine in the future, the people said.Some veteran editors rue the trend toward corporate metrics in the industry.Terry McDonell, a former top editor at Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone, said that celebrity editors of the past embodied and defined the magazines they ran. \u201cNow that is being replaced by people who believe that you can, in fact, engineer creativity and quality journalism,\u201d he said.Mr. Andersen, who now writes books and hosts a public radio show, said that magazines might eventually gain a cult following akin to the interest around other obsolete media, like vinyl records.\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll become like sailboats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to exist anymore. But people will still love them, and make them and buy them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Moves to Keep Ads From Running on Objectionable Videos", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook\u2019s enormous audience has long been catnip to advertisers. But the company\u2019s vast ecosystem has come under scrutiny this year from major brands, which are increasingly sensitive to the possibility of inadvertently showing up next to objectionable content.The rules, which will be enforced by a mix of automation and human review, restrict ads from content that depicts, among other topics, real-world tragedies, \u201cdebatable social issues,\u201d misappropriation of children\u2019s show characters, violence, nudity, gore, drug use and derogatory language. Facebook is extending the guidelines immediately to videos \u2014 which the company hopes will become an increasingly lucrative part of its business \u2014 and, in the coming months, to articles.Facebook said users who repeatedly violate its content guidelines, share sensational clickbait or post fake news may lose the ability to run ads.\u201cThere have been concerns that marketers have had that are wide-ranging around digital, and we want to do everything we can to ensure that we are providing the safest environment for publishers, advertisers and for people that utilize the platform,\u201d said Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions.The companies are moving quickly to address such issues, particularly as they seek to attract a greater portion of the money earmarked for television advertising to the video content on their sites.\u201cFacebook is this huge, huge, huge platform, and they haven\u2019t really been monetizing original content in the same way as YouTube has,\u201d said John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at GroupM, a media investment group for the advertising giant WPP. \u201cWhat I think is different for Facebook is that this is a much earlier stage for them that they\u2019re going into this, and the scale is different in that there will be much, much less content uploaded than those stupefying numbers you hear about on YouTube.\u201d (YouTube has said 400 hours of video are added to the site every minute.)That should be an advantage in policing content, Mr. Montgomery said, especially with the limits that Facebook is placing on who can make money from certain features. For example, the company required pages and profiles that wanted to run ads on live videos this year to have more than 2,000 followers. They could only show ads if they had at least 300 concurrent viewers after four minutes.Facebook also said it would begin showing advertisers a preview of where their messages may appear before campaigns start, giving advertisers a chance to block undesirable destinations. The company will also report on where the ads actually run.When brands use Facebook to target specific people with ads, they are able to select from a cornucopia of traits, including age, gender and how many lines of credit a person has. Many ads then show up in the main Facebook and Instagram feeds that people flick through, but they can also appear in articles and videos within Facebook and on outside apps and mobile websites that are part of Facebook\u2019s \u201caudience network.\u201dAs YouTube has moved to limit ads from running alongside unsavory content, many creators on the platform have complained that their videos have been unfairly penalized by automated systems. Facebook will probably have to grapple with similar complaints as it expands the number of people who can make money from video ads on the site.\u201cWe are not censoring their content; as long as it abides by our community standards, the content can run on the platform,\u201d Ms. Everson said. \u201cIf a publisher wants to monetize that content, they have to adhere to the monetization eligibility standards.\u201dFacebook previously let advertisers opt out of a more limited list of topics, including sites and apps related to dating, gambling and \u201cdebated social issues\u201d like religion and politics, Ms. Everson said. She added that the new rules would allow publishers to \u201cunderstand where we\u2019re placing ads\u201d and make it easier for advertisers to avoid offensive content.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Google Gets Serious About Producing Better Phones", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle once owned a phone maker. It didn\u2019t work out. Now it\u2019s trying a different approach.Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.A beefier hardware team should also help Google bring much more of the design in-house. It should also help it realize some of its bigger smartphone hardware ambitions, which include things like making its own SoCs and building machine learning coprocessors.FlashbackGoogle was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later.The decision to buy Motorola was \u201cthe extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap,\u201d said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that\u2019s not a fixer-upper.\u201dStandard & Poor\u2019s move, which cut China\u2019s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999. The outlook on China was changed to stable from negative.\u201cChina\u2019s prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased its economic and financial risks,\u201d S.&P. said. \u201cAlthough this credit growth had contributed to strong real G.D.P. growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent.\u201dMoody\u2019s had cut China\u2019s credit rating in May.Hackers penetrated the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s electronic system for storing public company filings and may have traded on them.The commission said the hack was detected in 2016, but that regulators didn\u2019t learn about the possibility of related illicit trading until August, when they started an investigation and began cooperating with what the S.E.C. called \u201cappropriate authorities.\u201dSpecifically, a software vulnerability in the test filing component of the commission\u2019s Edgar system, which was patched promptly after discovery, was exploited and resulted in access to nonpublic information. It is believed the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk.The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.\u201cSo, as you may have read, I was fired by the president of the United States.\u201dThe HighlightAt the start of the podcast, Mr. Bharara recounted his interactions with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to his dismissal as a United States attorney.

{"Headline": "At Google, Employee-Led Effort Finds Men Are Paid More Than Women", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Female employees are paid less than male staff members at most job levels within Google, and the pay disparity extends as women climb the corporate ladder, according to data compiled by employees that provide a snapshot of salary information at the internet giant.A spreadsheet, obtained by The New York Times, contains salary and bonus information for 2017 that was shared by about 1,200 United States Google employees, or about 2 percent of the company\u2019s global work force.While Google said the data painted an incomplete picture of how people are paid, the salary details shared by employees are likely to heighten concerns over gender disparities in Silicon Valley.Even as America\u2019s technology giants continue to grow in wealth and influence, most have shown little progress in leveling the playing field for women, who are underrepresented in key engineering and leadership roles and are paid less than men. These gender imbalances are reflected in long-term studies of large companies around the world by the McKinsey Global Institute.The scrutiny has been especially intense at Google. Long regarded as one of the world\u2019s best workplaces because of its perks and generous compensation, the company is under examination by the Labor Department and has faced criticism from investors and some of its own employees over differences in how women and men are paid.\u201cSilicon Valley has established itself as the boys\u2019 club of the West, just like how Wall Street has established itself as the boys\u2019 club of the East,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, a wealth management firm that takes activist positions on issues such as gender pay.At a shareholder meeting for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, earlier this year, Arjuna Capital put forward a proposal for the company to disclose what women make compared with their male peers. Arjuna had successfully persuaded seven of nine technology companies, including Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft, to disclose that data. Alphabet\u2019s directors urged shareholders to vote against the measure, and it failed.The self-reported Google salary spreadsheet was started in 2015 by a former employee who wanted to help co-workers negotiate better salaries. That employees were keeping track of this information became public knowledge soon after, but the spreadsheet\u2019s details remained private.The salary information in the spreadsheet cannot be viewed as an exact portrait of what people make at the company, because some employees may have erred when they put in their information. At some job levels, only a handful of employees volunteered to share their salary information, so a few salaries can skew the data. Even though it\u2019s not a random sample of staff members, the information is tracked closely throughout the company.The spreadsheet covers levels one through six of Google\u2019s job hierarchy, from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six. It does not include company executives and top-level engineers, who receive a wider range of salaries.At five of the six job levels, women are paid less than men. At level three, the entry level for technical positions, women make 4 percent less than men at $124,000 in salary and bonus. But it widens to 6 percent by the time employees reach midcareer status, around level five, with women earning, on average, $11,000 less than men.Google said the spreadsheet\u2019s information does not take into account a number of factors, like where employees are based, whether they are in higher-paying technical positions, and job performance.Based upon its own analysis from January, Google said female employees make 99.7 cents for every dollar a man makes, accounting for factors like location, tenure, job role, level and performance.Google said its analysis includes salary, bonus and equity compensation for 95 percent of employees between levels one and nine \u2014 three levels beyond what was reflected in the data shared with The Times \u2014 while excluding vice presidents and above. Google did not provide a breakdown of how it arrived at that calculation.Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, said the gender pay disparity reflected in the internal spreadsheet is \u201cnot a representative sample\u201d for other, more complex reasons. For example, a person in a nontechnical role may be at the same job level as an engineer, but will be paid significantly less because \u201cthere is a premium paid in all markets for highly technical talent.\u201dThe percentage of women in technical positions is lower than the overall percentage of female employees, with more women in sales, marketing, human resources or legal. Those roles, according to Ms. Naughton, do not have the same entry-level or midcareer salaries as technical positions.Other factors include geography and job performance. A position at Google\u2019s main office in Mountain View, Calif. \u2014 where the cost of living is high \u2014 may pay a lot more than a Google employee of a similar rank hired in a cheaper market. In addition, job performance significantly governs a person\u2019s pay over time \u2014 another factor not reflected in the spreadsheet.Google said it tries to exclude gender when determining salaries. Human resources analysts who determine what salary a person is offered when he or she joins Google do not know the candidate\u2019s gender. Similarly, when an employee\u2019s salary is up for annual review, the company takes into account the person\u2019s job performance, location and competitive salaries \u2014 but the analysts are not informed of the person\u2019s gender.\u201cThere\u2019s a meme around tech companies and Silicon Valley, around issues having to do with gender equity in tech,\u201d Ms. Naughton said. \u201cI do believe Google, because of its size and perhaps our size or our prominence in people\u2019s everyday lives, I think we\u2019re in the spotlight. It feels a little unfair.\u201dWhat Google pays men versus women is at the heart of a dispute with the Department of Labor. The company is fighting over how much data it needs to hand over as part of a routine audit of its pay practices. Google is a federal contractor because it sells advertising to the government.Google said it has already shared a lot of data and documents and that the Labor Department is overreaching by asking for employees\u2019 private information. An administrative law judge ruled in July that Google had to disclose some data but not as much as the Labor Department had wanted.James Finberg, a civil rights lawyer and partner at Altshuler Berzon L.L.P., said he expected to bring a class-action lawsuit against Google for \u201csubstantial gender disparities\u201d later this month. Mr. Finberg said more than 90 current and former female employees have come forward to be plaintiffs.He said that these women spoke about experiencing discrimination by being slotted into positions at a level below a man with similar qualifications and that women are not promoted with the same frequency as men. He said that some of the gender stereotypes cited in the memo are widespread and that they kept women out of higher-paying engineering jobs.\u201cIt is an atmosphere filled with stereotypes, that the comments espoused in the memo were not isolated incidents,\u201d Mr. Finberg said. \u201cThey are more of the norm than the anomaly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Help, Tab Media Targets Young and Cheeky on Campus", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American news operations of Tab Media are on a Brooklyn side street in a nondescript brick building that also houses an acupuncture studio and a mortgage lender.Most of the 13 editors working out of the office are younger than Taylor Swift. A white picnic table strewn with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts cups and magazines like Teen Vogue and The New Yorker doubles as a meeting hub. A box of wine is perched on a kitchenette microwave.The d\u00e9cor fits the mission. Tab, a British import that recently received financing from backers including Rupert Murdoch and the Knight Foundation, is largely unknown to the general public but is gaining currency on college campuses around the country. It relies on a network of unpaid student journalists who write about youth and campus culture. It also has a small cadre of writers commenting, usually snarkily, on issues of interest to young women.\u201cThe mind-set we\u2019re looking for is super hungry, anti-establishment and a little subversive,\u201d said Joshi Herrmann, who, at 28, is both editor in chief and office elder.Ambition is also part of the mix. Since starting in the United States two years ago, Tab has set out to become a touchstone for the 18-to-22-year-old demographic it believes is underserved by other news organizations.Jack Rivlin, who founded Tab Media with two other Cambridge University students in 2009 and now splits his time between New York and London, envisions the enterprise as a generation-defining media brand \u00e0 la MTV.Other publications should beware, said Mr. Rivlin, 28, who jokes that he has only recently begun to grow facial hair: \u201cI want to eat their lunch.\u201dIn Tab\u2019s Williamsburg office \u2014 there\u2019s another in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 story ideas slingshot around the room, from the Pennsylvania State University hazing trial to wedding training programs at high schools to potential Dream Act-related deportations. There was also an idea from one correspondent to report on local sex parties by participating in several.Tab uses traditional journalism tools like Freedom of Information Act filings, door-to-door sleuthing and libel training. But it also digs deep into Reddit, excavates meme chains and cultivates gossip.Tab Media has two parts: The Tab, which publishes the college-centric content, and Babe, a website for young women that specializes in \u201cgood news reporting, trash trends, personal stories\u201d and stories about men with certain unappealing qualities and \u201cthe pettiest celebrity drama.\u201dEach month, 40 million people watch videos that the two outlets post on social media, according to data the company compiled from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. Ten million people a month visit Tab sites, with roughly two-thirds going The Tab and the rest to Babe, according to Tab\u2019s Google Analytics data.In the past year, 2,300 students globally have written for the organization, nearly 1,000 of them regularly. The Tab has outlets at every Ivy League university and plans to expand to more than 100 American campuses.Mr. Rivlin and The Tab\u2019s other founders came up with the idea for company while working for the Cambridge student newspaper, a stuffy publication that none of their friends read, he said.The Tab\u2019s name is a play on \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201cCantab,\u201d a nickname for Cambridge alums. The enterprise initially drew criticism for its \u201cTab Totty\u201d feature, which showcased photos of scantily clad female undergraduates. While that feature was quickly eliminated, two of The Tab\u2019s British outlets still run a \u201cRear of the Year\u201d competition.But the website, which soon spread to other British campuses, also featured exclusive stories about a student who fought for ISIS and a Cambridge student in white tie burning cash in front of a homeless man. In the United States, much larger media organizations made reference to The Tab\u2019s reporting on campus protests, and the publication delivered a scoop last year by reporting on Malia Obama\u2019s decision to attend Harvard.Mr. Herrmann, who first wrote for The Tab at Cambridge and later for The London Evening Standard, said that many of the volunteer writers sign up out of curiosity but eventually pursue media careers.That is partly because The Tab offers its reporters training about sourcing, social media and privacy and sends out regular emails with journalism job listings. Editors at the two headquarters are paid, but few of the reporters are, and only for significant projects.Roughly 70 percent of Tab Media\u2019s revenue \u2014 $600,000 in August, the company said \u2014 comes from sponsored stories commissioned by companies like Spotify and Unilever and written to resemble news articles. The rest comes from display advertising from companies like Netflix and Ikea.The company completed a round of financing this year that brought in $6 million for website improvements, training and special projects. The lead investor was News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.Mr. Rivlin said he and George Marangos-Gilks, one of the other founders, pitched the site to the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, using a 100-page book of printed Tab stories. Mr. Rivlin attended the meeting wearing shoes borrowed from a friend\u2019s father. He still had traces of glitter on his face from a music festival he had recently attended.The Tab is often compared to other youth-focused websites such as The Odyssey Online, launched from Indiana University in 2014, which also uses volunteer writers to cover a range of topics. Spoon University, which was bought in May by Scripps Networks Interactive, compiles articles about food contributed by college students and other young writers.Balderton Capital, a venture capital firm in London, chose to invest in Tab Media. Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner, said he was impressed by company\u2019s high engagement rates and reader loyalty.\u201cIn a world where most new media titles basically push themselves on social media with click-bait headlines and hope for a random click, The Tab was able to write high quality journalism on serious and fun topics and have a community of readers come back loyally every week and sometimes every day,\u201d Mr. Chandratillake wrote in an email.Alumni of The Tab have gone on to work for Vice, The Guardian, Reuters, Huffington Post and many other publications. Several have stayed on to help shape the company as it evolves.\u201cIn five years, what we\u2019re going to be doing might be a bit broader,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep passing this on, kind of recklessly throwing the keys to very young editorial people and see what they come up with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sometimes there are none at all.Last Sunday, their creator materialized, in a baseball cap, shorts and soggy sneakers, to scoop fresh rocks out of the murky water and dispel the mystery. He is Uliks Gryka, 33, a lanky Albanian immigrant with no art training who goes by the more familiar variant of his given name: Ulysses.The reason for their constant transformation, he explained, is not the assaults of wind or water, which never seem to trouble the neatly interlocking rocks. Someone keeps knocking them over \u2014 eight times, so far, in just seven weeks. And Mr. Gryka keeps reassembling them into new forms.He had arrived that morning at 11:30 by bicycle from his apartment in North Riverdale, the Bronx, to find the entire collection \u2014 a week\u2019s effort \u2014 pulled down.\u201cI was angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must have been big people to be able to move these rocks. They pushed over every single one, even the big, heavy bases.\u201dThen he slipped his earbuds back in and got to work. Three hours later he had finished a new cluster of towers \u2014 more than 35 in all. By week\u2019s end, there were close to 100.\u201cWhen I started out, it was a small, shy exhibition,\u201d Mr. Gryka said. \u201dBut it\u2019s grown larger with each destruction. This has been a very perseverant work.\u201d\u201cGoldsworthy, Noguchi, Giacometti,\u201d Mr. Gryka rattled off the names his visitors drop. \u201cI want to be extremely honest: I didn\u2019t know who these people were until I went and Googled them.\u201dHe thanks search engines and childhood earth-science classes for an acquaintance with his materials. \u201cManhattan schist, composite rock, quartz,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some granite over there.\u201dBut Mr. Gryka\u2019s real passion is the personalities he discovers once he has combined stones into a single statue. \u201cAll of them have something different, something particular. I can see traits.\u201dHe pointed out a warrior and a mariner. Although he sometimes calls them the stone men, there are women, too: one with wide shoulders that suggested a shawl, and a seated Madonna holding a child. At the front of the group, he always erects a figure, taller than the others, that he calls \u201cthe high priestess.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s like a leader conducting the orchestra, and all are looking to her,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are like a hive of bees \u2014 they need a queen.\u201dHis father, a surveyor for bridge and building projects, kept beehives as a hobby before the family fled Albania\u2019s civil unrest in the mid-1990s for Italy. Mr. Gryka, who speaks four languages, studied political science at the University of Milan, then came to the United States in 2007 with a green card he obtained in a visa lottery.In New York, he became a United States citizen and earned a master\u2019s degree in international affairs from the New School, but jobs in his field, conflict and security, have not been easy to come by. He worked as a server in restaurants, then quit in April to take a break from the stress and restart his job search.He toils on the site most days for at least a few hours, his earbuds piping a stream of Sufi chants.Each new figure begins with a face. \u201cFirst I find what looks like a head,\u201d he said. \u201cThen a hat. Every head needs a hat.\u201d (Five minutes later, he spotted a man placing a pebble on top of a finished piece. \u201cSomeone added a hat!\u201d Mr. Gryka exulted. \u201cGood work.\u201d)Then he looks for a base and other parts, using sight, feel and instinct to find surfaces that will fit together. \u201cYou work with what\u2019s around you. You study the top edge, and look for a rock that matches. It\u2019s like a puzzle.\u201dOn Sunday, Jessica Woods and her 8-year-old daughter, Aine, made a pilgrimage from their apartment at 148th Street and Riverside Drive, after a neighbor told them about the stones. Ms. Woods called out to Mr. Gryka: \u201cThank you! We\u2019re so grateful to you for this.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re magical \u2014 the patience and balance,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the grace with which he\u2019s handling how his creations were pushed over by vandals.\u201dThe damage to Mr. Gryka\u2019s pieces hasn\u2019t all come at the hands of strangers. On Labor Day, he dismantled his figures after a Parks Department employee warned him that they could topple onto someone, and ordered him to take them down. The next day, Mr. Gryka says, he sought out a parks crew, hoping to apologize; one told him that he had done nothing wrong and that he should rebuild. (The department did not respond to questions about its policy on such matters.)Mr. Gryka is not sure how long he\u2019ll keep at it \u2014 maybe another few weeks or a month, when colder weather sets in. Even the labors of Sisyphus must end sometime.A stone I died and rose again a plant;A plant I died and rose an animal;I died an animal and was born a man.Why should I fear?

{"Headline": "The Terrifying Power of Internet Censors", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last month where a man drove a car into a crowd, killing a counter-demonstrator, the American neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published a long, hate-riddled post mocking the victim.Generally speaking, there are two kinds of corporate players on the internet: companies that build infrastructure through which content flows, and companies that seek to curate content and create a community.Internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast, domain name servers, web hosts and security services providers like Cloudflare are all the former \u2014 or the \u201cpipe.\u201d They typically don\u2019t look at the content their clients and customers are putting up, they just give them the means to do it and let it flow. Social media platforms like Facebook are the latter. They encourage their users to create, share and engage with content \u2014 so they look at content all the time and decide whether they want to allow hateful material like that of neo-Nazis to stay up.While there have long been worries about internet service providers favoring access to some content over others, there has been less concern about companies further along the pipeline holding an internet on/off switch. In large part, this is because at other points in the pipeline, users have choice. Private companies can make their own rules, and consumers can choose among them. If GoDaddy won\u2019t register your domain, you can go to Bluehost or thousands of other companies.But the fewer choices you have for the infrastructure you need to stay online, the more serious the consequences when companies refuse service. This is why Cloudflare\u2019s decision to drop The Daily Stormer is so significant. Denying security service to one Nazi website seems fine now, but what if Cloudflare started suspending service for a political candidate that its chief executive didn\u2019t like?One of the additional difficulties with Cloudflare is that it is not so much a piece of pipe as it is a service.

{"Headline": "Tumult After AIDS Fund-Raiser Supports Harvey Weinstein Production", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn May 2015, the entertainment producer Harvey Weinstein arranged for two items to be auctioned off at a fund-raiser for amfAR, a New York-based charity that works to cure AIDS.The offers \u2014 a sitting with a famous fashion photographer and a package of tickets to a Hollywood film awards event and parties \u2014 came with a condition: $600,000 of the money raised at the auction, in Cannes, France, would go to the American Repertory Theater, a nonprofit playhouse that had done a trial run of \u201cFinding Neverland,\u201d a Broadway musical that Mr. Weinstein produced.The theater had agreed to reimburse Mr. Weinstein and other investors for a $1.25 million payment and $500,000 charitable contribution toward the show if they could get third parties to donate those amounts, according to records of the arrangement.Now, amfAR\u2019s board of directors is embroiled in conflict. Some members are questioning the deal involving the auction proceeds, saying that the details were not disclosed and that the organization was not protected.The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, is investigating corporate governance at the charity. \u201cOur charities bureau is working with amfAR in connection with a dispute among board members, with the goal of achieving a resolution as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said in a statement.Mr. Weinstein, who is a longtime supporter of the AIDS organization and was a chairman of the 2015 event, said that he had done nothing wrong and that everyone benefited from the arrangement, which raised $309,669 for amfAR. \u201cI honestly thought we were doing something fantastic for both sides,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe get money, they get money, and it\u2019s all our money.\u201dGibson, Dunn & Cutcher, a law firm hired by the amfAR board, reviewed the $600,000 transaction and determined that it was legitimate and lawful.But a lawyer who first investigated the way the arrangement was handled concluded that it put the charity\u2019s financial integrity at risk, according to several people who reviewed his confidential report, which was commissioned by amfAR.And in a June 2015 email to the charity\u2019s chief financial officer, its chief executive, Kevin Frost, expressed concern: \u201cNothing about this deal feels right to me, and I believe we have not done due diligence to understand exactly what this money is being directed to or why amfAR is being used to facilitate these transfers.\u201dIn April of this year, four members of the 19-person board complained to the attorney general\u2019s office. They said that Kenneth Cole, the fashion designer and board chairman, had signed off on the $600,000 transfer \u201cdespite the clear objections of the executive management team,\u201d said their spokesman, Steven Goldberg. They say board members were never informed that the auction proceeds would help cover the \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d investors\u2019 costs.Mr. Cole said that he welcomed an arrangement that would bring in money for the AIDS cause and that executive staff had signed off on it. He said that he did not recall Mr. Weinstein telling him it would serve a business deal with the American Repertory Theatre, but that he was satisfied knowing the $600,000 was going to a credible nonprofit.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a man on the street asking \u2014 it was someone who has raised a lot of money for us,\u201d Mr. Cole said in an interview. \u201cOne tends to address requests based on whom they\u2019re coming from.\u201dIt is not uncommon for commercial shows, before they hit Broadway, to go through an incubation period at a nonprofit theater, with infusions of financial support from investors. Under so-called enhancement agreements, the theaters are able to mount larger productions than their budgets normally allow, while producers and investors get feedback and a chance to polish their shows before going to New York.What was unusual about the agreement that Mr. Weinstein\u2019s theatrical production company, Weinstein Live Entertainment, struck in 2014 with the repertory theater \u2014 located in Cambridge, Mass., and affiliated with Harvard University \u2014 is that the show\u2019s 24 investors would be reimbursed if they brought in third-party charitable contributions.In the end, $1.95 million in contributions were made to the theater as \u201ccontemplated by the agreement,\u201d according to a July 2015 email from a lawyer for the theater to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer. In addition to the money that came from the amfAR auction, Mr. Weinstein helped arrange for a $200,000 donation from a family foundation that fights poverty in South Africa, a $600,000 donation from the Louis Vuitton fashion house and hundreds of thousands of dollars more from online charitable auctions.Lloyd Mayer, a professor of nonprofit law at the University of Notre Dame, said the agreement appeared to allow charitable contributions to serve the private benefit of Mr. Weinstein and the other commercial investors.Jason Lilien, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, said it did not matter if the other \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d investors \u201cincidentally benefited\u201d from the charitable contributions because the primary purpose was to put on a production for the public\u2019s benefit. The theater declined to comment.Mr. Lilien said Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Cole that the money raised through the auction would serve a \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d business agreement. Orin Snyder, a lawyer with Gibson, Dunn & Cutcher, said in a statement that \u201cduring our inquiry, Harvey Weinstein disclosed and we confirmed that the contribution was part of his company\u2019s \u2018Finding Neverland\u2019 agreement with A.R.T.,\u201d referring to the theater.The auction catalog for the amfAR fund-raising gala disclosed that some of the money raised from the sitting with the fashion photographer would go to the theater, but did not note that for the Hollywood experience package arranged by Mr. Weinstein. Tom Ajamie, the first lawyer hired by the charity to review the $600,000 transaction, concluded that failure to disclose was \u201cfraud on the bidders\u201d by amfAR, according to people who reviewed the report. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys said it was a clerical mistake by amfAR.Mr. Weinstein said that when arranging the charitable contributions that flowed to the theater he told some donors that the funds were to support the \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d production. But, he said, it wasn\u2019t his responsibility to further disclose that the money would be used to reimburse him and the other investors or otherwise cover their business obligations. If people wanted to learn more, he said, they could have done internet research.\u201cToday, if you want to know something, it\u2019s easy,\u201d he said. \u201cGoogle \u2018A.R.T.,\u2019 whatever. You don\u2019t want to make a donation to that, don\u2019t. Whatever. These people aren\u2019t forced to write a check to A.R.T. They can Google it, they can call it, they can speak to it, people will answer them.\u201dAfter Gibson, Dunn & Cutcher concluded its investigation, Mr. Weinstein asked amfAR board members and executive staff to sign pledges that there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that they would not probe further. In exchange, he said that he \u201cwill not at any time in the future engage in wrongful conduct involving amfAR.\u201dMr. Weinstein has helped raise millions of dollars for amfAR over the years at its annual benefit at Cannes, which draws celebrities and is one of the most glamorous charitable events in the world. In 2016, he also helped arrange a fund-raiser for the organization in New York. This year, he pledged a $1 million in donations to the charity. Mr. Weinstein said he paid $600,000 of that commitment this year to try to smooth over the conflict.\u201cI went to them. I said, \u2018I\u2019m paying you $600,000 \u2014 shut up, you\u2019re hurting the goddamn charity,\u2019\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Honesty Could Make You Happier", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoicesMy plan was to jot down different instances throughout the day where I had to make a choice about honesty and notice how it felt.The day I started the journal, the same 6-year-old daughter asked me during her bath if the cat really went to sleep last year, and if that actually meant that I had killed him. I rinsed her hair and sighed, wondering if I should wait to start this honesty project until my children were grown. But I braved it and told her that yes, I had made the choice for him to die, because he was suffering and I wanted him to be at peace. She lost interest about halfway through my explanation, which was O.K. with me.It struck me that the choice to lie or be honest was often a choice between two equally undesirable things. Telling my daughter the truth did not make me happier, but lying wouldn\u2019t have either.A bigger opportunity arose with my 8-year-old son. Though he didn\u2019t know anything about the journal, after a few weeks, he seemed to open up in a new way, asking me things he was too embarrassed or scared to ask before, like what the word \u201cpimp\u201d meant and why people kill themselves. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways was that we shouldn\u2019t lie to children when they are asking us about grown-up words or ideas \u2014 otherwise, they will just ask Siri. If it\u2019s between YouTube and me to explain prostitution, I pick me.But was brutal truth what I really wanted when it came to my marriage?Over all, I found that I struggled more with the small instances of honesty, rather than the big. So, when a client accidentally paid me twice for a project \u2014 sending a duplicate $1,000 check a week after they\u2019d already paid me \u2014 there was no internal debate. It was $1,000, so obviously, I notified the client. But when the McDonald\u2019s drive-through cashier gave me an extra dollar in change and the line had been SO long and all I wanted was a Diet Coke and my kids were acting crazy in the back seat and why was this stupid McDonald\u2019s always so slow anyway?!\u2026 it was a different story. Even though I gave the dollar back, I almost didn\u2019t, because an extra dollar was such a small thing and seemed somehow justified. Had I not been focused on honesty, I\u2019m not sure I would have given it back.The bottom line is that focusing on honesty is a way to actively engage with the world, versus passively complaining about it. It might even make you feel as if you have gold in your brain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Contradictions of Hajj, Through the Lens of a Smartphone", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs it permissible to take a selfie in front of the Kaaba during hajj? With spotty internet, I was unable to Google the answer. Forced to call an audible fatwa, I decided, \u201cYes, if indeed my intention is pure.\u201dAwe-struck by the privilege of participating in this tradition while often agitated by the contradictions that surround it today, I made sense of the experience by sharing it \u2014 filtering the pilgrimage through the lens of my smartphone.The most painful aspect of hajj wasn\u2019t the physical toll that came with navigating cramped space with my two million diverse fellow pilgrims, or the intense spiritual concentration. It wasn\u2019t the hiking-induced blisters and chafing. It was witnessing the erasure and razing of my religion\u2019s culture, history and narrative by the House of Saud.The Saudi royal family follows the revisionist and extreme ideology of Wahhabism, which preaches an interpretation of strict monotheism that is often at odds with centuries of theological scholarship. They consider veneration and respect of most holy sites and visitations of graves as a form of idolatry.That explains why, in their country, while the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s mosque and courtyard in Medina are spacious, cooled and immaculate, Jannat al-Baqi \u2014 a graveyard directly across from the green dome housing the remains of thousands of Islam\u2019s luminaries \u2014 looks like a set from \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d There are no tombstones, just slabs of rock sticking out like middle fingers from the dirt. If you linger too long to pay respects or offer a prayer, the mutawwa \u2014 religious police \u2014 rush you along. When you ask them who\u2019s buried here, they answer, \u201cAllah knows best,\u201d although they know the truth: the daughter of the prophet, his family members and some of his most loyal companions.My friends and I spent hours at the prophet\u2019s tomb and the rawdah \u2014 a space between his original pulpit and grave considered by Muslims to be some of the hottest spiritual real estate on earth. The moving experience was tempered by the awareness that most Muslims long to offer their \u201csalaams\u201d (prayers of peace) to the prophet, but cannot afford to visit his mosque. Also, women are often unable to properly perform the \u201cziyarat\u201d (religious visitation) there because they\u2019re allowed only limited access.In Mecca, I hiked nearly an hour under the remorseless afternoon sun to visit the Cave of Hira, where the prophet is believed to have received his first revelation: \u201cRecite!\u201d There are no golden signs, air-conditioning, wheelchair ramps or video presentations here. The austere cave used to offer a clear line of sight to the Kaaba, but now the view is now obscured by that monstrous, $15 billion, Saudi-government-funded clock tower and the accompanying world\u2019s tallest hotel.That tableau is a perfect symbol of the strained marriage between the house of God \u2014 the Kaaba, in Mecca \u2014 and the House of Saud, which controls everything related to the sacred mosques. In adherence to the reactionary religious ideology it embraces, the government has allowed the prophet\u2019s house to fall into decrepitude. It has flattened the home of his first wife, Khadija, and installed public toilets where it used to stand. But it has no objection to the construction of extravagant hotels not far away.These government\u2019s conflicting values were on display wherever I looked: While non-Muslims are forbidden from even entering Mecca, everyone is free to eat American Hardee\u2019s hamburgers or KFC fried chicken, or buy a Rolex watch across from the Kaaba. It\u2019s forbidden to excessively venerate the prophet and his companions, but there\u2019s no problem with the giant posters of King Abdulaziz, King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, that are all around town.But whenever I found myself lamenting the ugliness and hypocrisy of these elements of my journey, the people I met reminded me why I was there, with displays of untarnished spirituality. In the prophet\u2019s mosque, local people brought bread, dates and milk to feed fasting pilgrims. Children begged me to eat from the plates they had prepared, hoping to gain some of the blessings. In the desert plain of Arafat, east of Mecca, I walked with nearly two million pilgrims to the Mount of Mercy. Men and women offered whatever they had: water, food, ice cream, a helping hand for a wheelchair-user. They shared the shade under their umbrellas, and sometimes even the clothes off their back with fellow pilgrims. We were united in a shared journey: seeking to find forgiveness, mercy and salvation.It made sense to invite fellow Muslims and friends along for a view of this often-schizophrenic experience, unfiltered through Wahhabi propaganda. While I initially worried it might distract me from my prayer, sharing the photos and Facebook Live videos made hajj a communal experience, in the most modern way possible.In Mecca and Medina, often through my camera\u2019s lens, I looked up at the heavens and at the shiny buildings, but I also looked around me and engaged with a community of believers \u2014 some of them with me on ground, and some of them looking at screens on the other side of the world. That\u2019s where I found God \u2014 and beauty \u2014 in all its glorious contradictions.Wajahat Ali is a playwright, lawyer and contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Good job. So...what\u2019s topping your personal pop chart this week?WM: So, the Emmys happened on Sunday. There was a lot of good news. One extremely infuriating thing that had nothing to do with anybody winning or losing, except America. But there were two good speeches! The first was Ann Dowd\u2019s speech, your favorite, Ann Dowd from The Leftovers and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. She won supporting actress in a drama for Handmaid\u2019s Tale. And she just gave this really strange, peculiar speech. I just want to play a little bit from it.AD: Well, I think this is a dream, you know. Um...I know it\u2019s an actor\u2019s dream, and I\u2019m deeply grateful to you. I\u2019ve been acting for um, a long time, and that this should happen now, I don\u2019t have the words, so I thank you.WM: And then...the other great speech from that night was Lena Waithe winning for writing the best episode of Master of None, with Aziz Ansari. The Thanksgiving episode.LW: And last, but certainly not least, my LGBTQIA family. I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers. Every day, when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world, because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it.

There\u2019s one thing in this movie that really freaked me out. There\u2019s a really great surprise playing around with dimensionality, you know, big and small, and it\u2019s so effective and so unexpected and so scary. I actually don\u2019t think the reason that move is popular is because it\u2019s a horror movie. Or even because of Stephen King necessarily. I think the movie is popular because we\u2019re going through some weird nostalgia thing right now where it\u2019s so much more fun to be in 1988 than it is to be in 2017.JW: That\u2019s super real.WM: I have a real world problem that we have to talk about. Last week, it was announced that Nestle is buying Blue Bottle Coffee.JW: I can\u2019t believe I missed that. It\u2019s gross. I mean, good for them, but also, that\u2019s gross.WM: I didn\u2019t know anything about how bad Nestle was, and I open up our newspaper on Sunday and there\u2019s a story about how Nestle is one of these companies that is responsible for the obesity epidemic in countries that aren\u2019t ours! In Brazil, for instance, the obesity rates have gone up because of the influx of processed food from places like Nestle. The reason I\u2019m upset about this is because I\u2019ve been drinking Blue Bottle Coffee since Blue Bottle Coffee started. It was just a cute little thing that I did in California, and it was one of many coffee purveyors, but I preferred this one. It\u2019s like one of the only products that I feel a very personal affinity for and connection to. You know what I mean? It\u2019s one of those things where like, I\u2019ve been there from the beginning, and then you know, I have no say in what their business thinking is. If they want to, you know, I\u2019m not a shareholder. If they want to let Nestle buy them, what should I do?JW: Find another coffee place to support, or just keeping Blue Bottle. What are you going to do?WM: I don\u2019t know. I feel like this is probably what we\u2019re going to wind up talking about today, which is like, wherever you look...JW: The milk is never clean.WM: I know. I know, we talk about this so much. Such a quandary. What\u2019s going on with you?JW: I\u2019ll start with a little spot of good news. Ever since I witnessed Rihanna/Robin Fenty at the launch of Fenty beauty, resplendent in yellow top to bottom, head to toe, looking like the reboot of Beauty from Beauty and the Beast that I would watch, that I would pay $10 to watch \u2014WM: Oh, yeah. It was very Beauty and the Beast. I didn\u2019t even appreciate that.JW: Our Belle of the ball. I just have had a renewed appreciation for yellow, the color yellow, which I never wear because I have a yellow undertone and I just feel like it will make me look ill or not be flattering, so I\u2019ve been conditioned out of wearing yellow. But I started wearing yellow, and I get so many compliments.WM: It\u2019s a good color for you.JW: Everyone on the street knows it\u2019s in reference to Rihanna, which makes it even more delightful. A guy in a bodega was like, Fenty, head to toe. And I was like, yes, boo! And then that was it, and I got my sandwich and left. So, as usual, I like to know more about why colors resonate and what is speaking to what universe, and so, I did a little research on Google and I found that the color yellow correlates to the third chakra in the body, which is the solar plexis. It refers to something known as the lustrous gem of the body. So, your solar plexis is a source of personal power. It governs the self esteem, warrior energy, and the power of transformation, so thank you, Rihanna, for yet another gift into my life.WM: Oh my God. She just keeps giving.JW: She never stops giving.WM: What else?JW: Last week, I had the privilege of being taken on a date to see Ms. Erykah Badu in New Jersey.WM: Stop it. You need to stop right now!JW: Me or my date?WM: Uh, the whole thing. I didn\u2019t get an invitation. I didn\u2019t even know she was in the vicinity.JW: You didn\u2019t feel the earth shake? You didn\u2019t feel the universal ripple? You didn\u2019t feel your energy shift? You know, we talk a lot on the show about how musicians age, how celebrities age, how art ages and what holds up, and I\u2019m happy to report that from Mama\u2019s Gun to Baduizm to her new EP to Amerykah One and Two, it all still holds up. Her voice is transcendent. She also performed the majority of the show in a giant oversized cowboy hat in like a laser pyramid. Let\u2019s play Hello off her 2015 mixtape, but you can\u2019t use my phone, because she opened with that and it just sounds so good live.HELLO, ERYKAH BADUJW: Well, Internet got her panties in a twist last week over a new little startup called Bodega. You probably heard about it.WM: Oh, I heard about it.JW: You heard all about it. A new startup out of California that\u2019s basically like, a DYI, buy what you want little pantry box that\u2019s...I mean, the name alone is insulting, but the founders took it a step further and acknowledged, like, yeah, we\u2019re trying to put bodegas out of business. We want this to replace the mom and pop corner store bodega. Of course, Twitter goes HAM, rightfully so to some degrees. But I can\u2019t help but think that that outrage is a little misplaced. It\u2019s extraordinarily valid. I mean, this is a pretty abhorrent principle and it\u2019s embarrassing that these guys are so blatantly and flagrantly like, yes, we want to put a ton of immigrants out of business. We don\u2019t care about them! Just to make our lives easier, so we can have the fancy sparkling water and whatever, whenever we want. But I also want to challenge the way we responded to that, because I think that\u2019s a very easy, that\u2019s a very easy company to take aim at, and they do deserve it, but I think it also allows us to ignore all the other things we\u2019re very complicit in about new technology and startups and the actual, real ways the companies we actually use every day are terror forming planet Earth. Not some little hypothetical thing that\u2019s going to end up in startups up and down the west coast and not actually be, you know, at the corner of Fulton and Flatbush any time soon.WM: Alright. I\u2019d like to talk about that with you. You\u2019re like the only person I want to talk about that with.JW: Well, I want to talk to you about It and horror movies in general and I know we both also saw Mother!, which I definitely want to talk about.WM: Yeah. I would pay more money to hear you talk about Mother! than I would to see Mother!, and I actually had a really good time at that movie, so I would love to talk about horror movies. I also want to talk about how horror is right now, for reasons that are really fascinating to me, a vehicle for several other ideas, and how you can be scared but you can also be thinking about what you\u2019re actually scared of. So, let\u2019s start with talking about Bodega, and the pros and cons of being mad at Bodega, and then the pros and cons of...JW: Indulging in all this existential horror.WM: Right. Well, we\u2019ll be right back.JW: Wesley. We need to talk about this new startup called Bodega.WM: Do we?JW: We do. We absolutely do, because there is the actual implementation of a startup that is meant to disrupt, meant to gentrify, meant to cater to a one percent, a growing one percent class that is not the Wall Street billionaires that we associate with the one percent but a newly minted class of wealthy developers and Silicon Valley, you know, acolytes who don\u2019t want to deal with the nitty gritty and the dirty and the reality of just living in a city. That\u2019s part of it.WM: Brown people.JW: Brown people. Well, some of them are brown.WM: Like, messy bodegas. It\u2019s a snobbery.JW: Sure. It\u2019s a snobbery. It\u2019s a snobbery and an interest in luxury above all else, right? But what we also really have to talk about, and actually what this entire episode is about is reality versus the perception of reality.WM: Yes, ma\u2019am.JW: So, the reality is that these two ex-Googlers launched a company called Bodega, very well funded by some well known VCs. The idea is that you get these little vending machines that are self sufficient, they can go in offices, they can go in Air BnBs, they can go wherever you might need a snack. So, this thing launches, there\u2019s a big splashy article in Fast Company that really does them no favors. And the logo of this company is a bodega cat. They really give them no cushion to make this sound acceptable whatsoever. They present it for what it appears to be: two gratuitous interlopers who are more than happy to put out a ton of immigrants and completely change a culture of cities like New York and San Francisco for the sake of improving and sanitizing and Wall-E-izing, really, American culture.WM: Wall-E. It saw the future, back in 2008.JW: It really did. So basically, Twitter goes HAM. And everyone is like, how dare you. You can\u2019t get a chopped cheese out of a vending machine, really just going in on this company. Which, to be fair, they deserved. Because they were incredibly ungenerous and incredibly callous about the impact on local communities that this startup might have. They didn\u2019t have the decency to lie. And actually, in a way, all they did was tell the truth, which is hilarious unto itself.WM: Well, and I think you know, I\u2019m a big fan of transparency. They were very honest about it. They were very clear about their goals. Business plan was right up front coming right out of this guy\u2019s mouth.JW: And yet, let\u2019s take a closer look at what they outlined their business imperative and rollout to be. They said, essentially they were B to B, so business to business, so, you know, not really going to be on street corners because people would probably smash them. But they were going to be in other businesses \u2014 yeah, you\u2019d smash them. I mean, the kiosks that people charge their phones in get knocked over, so a bodega vending machine is definitely going to get smashed as well. Realistically, though, it was a pretty modest roll out. It was pretty much business to business. They said 50 locations up and down the west coast, which to me just screams, startups. It says, this is not going to be on a boardwalk. This is not going to be at the corner of, you know, Hayes and Goff in San Francisco. Not 6th and Market in San Francisco. It\u2019s going to be in the new Twitter offices, if anything else, you know what I mean? So, basically not that big of a deal. But what I\u2019m interested in is why people got so upset, and why the pile on was so loud and so fun. Do you have any ideas?WM: Because it\u2019s easy.JW: You get a Snickers bar. Because that is the correct answer.WM: Can I get it out of a vending machine? I\u2019m going to pick up my bodega cat and walk to the register and get my Snickers with my own two feet, thank you very much.JW: But you know, I mean, I think it\u2019s worth looking at why mostly Twitter and new, newly entitled media gets extremely upset about something like this and yet has nothing to say about Nestle buying Blue Bottle. About Amazon working its way into Whole Foods. About Fresh Direct. About Instacart. About the proliferation of Uber and all the million Uber clones. All the things that we actually use on a day to day basis that are actually completely reshaping who is moving where and how things are being gentrified. Like, no one\u2019s going to use this Bodega. But people will actually start using Prime to get Whole Foods. And that is a bigger deal. And in some ways, I\u2019m excited \u2014 that is a much bigger threat to bodegas. But we don\u2019t want to talk about it because you know what? How many people in this room have Amazon Prime? I wanted to let my subscription lapse. It didn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to be real about it. I forgot to turn it off, and I still use it. And I like it! Okay? Because if I need a new iPhone case, guess what? It comes in one day. So, I\u2019m just like, look. You don\u2019t get points just because you\u2019re willing to call evil evil. You actually have to do something about it. What happened in New York a week ago? We had, what, primary elections? Did you vote?WM: Oh, I did.JW: Because you\u2019re good like that.WM: I had to turn around and vote, but yes.JW: How many people voted in New York, though?WM: Like 13 percent?JW: And what percent of New York Twitter do you think was complaining about Bodega?WM: 100?JW: Probably. I don\u2019t have the math. I don\u2019t have the stats. I\u2019m not Nate Silver. But I\u2019m saying, it probably was closer to 100 percent. So, listen up, guys. You want to be mad about some hypothetical startup coming into your hood?WM: You\u2019ve got a right to be mad.JW: And you\u2019ve got a right to be mad, but I\u2019ve got a right to be mad too that y\u2019all didn\u2019t vote for the people who are actually making these decisions.WM: No, it\u2019s true. Well, I actually think that the real problem with Bodega isn\u2019t the business. It\u2019s the name Bodega. That\u2019s the thing that we\u2019ve also seized upon with this, which is sort of another thing about this moment, right? It\u2019s that we are now in this identity politics phase of being upset about things and it\u2019s not what the business is actually going to do to bodegas. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s two guys from Silicon Valley yet again with no idea how the real world works, and they are doing something that is an actual affront to brown people. There is an identity politics issue with this name that you can easily seize upon because it\u2019s not the class problem, really. Everybody claims to love their bodega. Let me just say...JW: Nobody loves the $12 olive oil at your bodega that you have to buy because the next bodega is too far and you don\u2019t know if they have it and it\u2019s cold outside, and you gotta make dinner, so you\u2019re just going to fork over the $12. No one loves their bodega. We like the idea that we like our bodegas.WM: Right. The idea \u2014JW: I mean, I do kinda love \u2014 my bodega guy meows at me and I kinda love it. But I also, you know.WM: He also tells you you look fly, apparently.JW: And he zips up my dresses and he helps me out. But the idea that a bodega is necessarily going to be put out of business. I mean, the real issues facing bodegas are things like rent control, changing neighborhood demographics, issues with leases, issues with lots of different things. And I would be really sad if that went away. I would be really sad if I couldn\u2019t buy beer from a 12 year old anymore, and you know, there\u2019s always someone\u2019s child manning the register when they shouldn\u2019t be, and it\u2019s just like part of the fabric of New York and I love it. But the idea that screaming on Twitter about the name of a company \u2014 of a hypothetical company that\u2019s not coming to your city anytime soon, damn it \u2014 and not voting is somehow more effective...yelling on Twitter is more effective than not voting...blows the mind. And it is as indulgent and as privileged and as gentrified as the thing itself. Bodega is part of a larger trend of exorbitantly imagined and priced ideas that are being rolled out and people are adopting, so the idea that this is going to cause \u2014 it caused a backlash, but the idea that this is going to somehow put this company out of business I think is really farfetched because let us not forget, we just had the announcement of a $1,000 iPhone. There is a company called Peloton that\u2019s basically an individual SoulCycle and the bikes are thousands of dollars, and they\u2019re in every startup office, where you just bike \u2014 you don\u2019t have to go to SoulCycle, you can just hop on the bike and it\u2019s WiFi connected and you can like, pedal along like you\u2019re in a class. I mean, Uber valet \u2014 like we have all of these things already that are catering to those growing upper class of young people who basically are infantilized and just still want to feel like they\u2019re in college. It\u2019s already happening. But it\u2019s not the worst of our problems.WM: It gets worse. I was telling you about this company that wants to be a home mortgage company. And the deal with that is, you don\u2019t have enough money for a down payment? By all means, let us give you $50,000. Here\u2019s the catch. You have to pay us the money back, and one of the ways you\u2019re going to pay that money back is by making sure that for one to three years, one of the rooms in your house is going to be an Air BnB available room.JW: It\u2019s the new digital sharecropping. It\u2019s indentured servitude to some degree. That\u2019s crazy!WM: It\u2019s never going to work.JW: Honey, look. It might work. People might do it. These are the times we\u2019re living in. This is what I\u2019m saying about reality versus our perception of reality. Let\u2019s check back in six months and see.WM: Once again, I have been taken to school by Jenna Wortham. We\u2019re going to take a break, we\u2019ll be back to talk about some other happy news in the world of what\u2019s real and not real and depressing and not depressing. Horror movies!JW: We\u2019re going to shove more clowns in the clown car.WM: Yes. We are back.JW: We really have to talk about Mother!WM: We\u2019re going to talk about what happens in this movie. There will be some things that might spoil this experience for you.JW: We\u2019re going to do our best not to completely spoil it, but it\u2019s impossible to talk about this movie in totality without talking about a little bit about how it ends and sort of what some of the theories are behind it.WM: Right. Also, after you see it \u2014 and we both think you should see it \u2014 you can come back and listen to what you skipped.JW: So, you told me to go see Mother! and okay, alright. Wesley, I love you and I hate you, because I go to this movie, I don\u2019t know anything about it. You know I don\u2019t like suspense, number one. You know, you\u2019ve been to the movies with me. You know I don\u2019t like suspense. This is the most suspenseful thing. I\u2019m climbing out of the seat. I went with my friend Dodai, and she made me go to AMC 7 because they have the recliner seats. I\u2019m like, lying back, I\u2019m freaking out. There are no spoilers online. I tried to look on my phone, because it\u2019s so new...WM: I also think people don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.JW: People don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. I tried to read summaries of it.WM: It\u2019s unspoilerable.JW: You know, I just was extraordinarily stressed out. And then at some point, I was like, oh, you\u2019re brilliant, and this is why you wanted me to see this, and now I hate you even more because I loved it and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I never knew what was going to happen. It got crazier and crazier and crazier. It stars Jennifer Lawrence. Love to look at her face. Javier Bardem. Love to look at his face. Michelle Pfeiffer. What a queen. I mean, what a gift unto itself, and she looked amazing and she was so sexy and just, that was the role she was born to play/my future.WM: Drunk suburban mom who drops in?JW: Who refuses to do any housework and just rolls around and wears neon green underwear.WM: And loves Ed Harris.JW: Except for that part. Except for that part. But the neon green undies, boozy drinks during the day, makes fun of Jennifer Lawrence? Sign me up.WM: She was great. This movie, Mother!, is basically the story of a woman in a house, married to a poet, who has got something like writer\u2019s block. He\u2019s having some sort of trouble getting his next project going.JW: And she appears to be some sort of mystic. Like, it\u2019s unclear if she\u2019s communicating with this house that they\u2019re living in, she\u2019s like, every now and again making a little yellow tincture drink and knocking it back. I was just like, sign me up. I love everything about this.WM: Darren Aronofsky, of course, is the director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, and The Fountain and Noah, and his interest in freaking an audience out has everything to do with point of view. Like, he\u2019s a subjective filmmaker. He\u2019s very much more interested in the life of movies than he is in the life of actual human beings and the ways in which he can mine preexisting texts \u2014 in this case, the films of Stanley Kubrick or Luis Bu\u00f1uel or Gaspar Noe or Roman Polanski...it\u2019s really a Rosemary\u2019s Baby, what it turns into is a Rosemary\u2019s Baby-like movie. That\u2019s kind of the vibe of the movie is other people\u2019s movies, and the Bible. The Old Testament Bible. Anyway. Ed Harris shows up. He\u2019s the first guest. He thinks he is, he\u2019s been sent to the wrong house. He\u2019s looking for a bed and breakfast, he shows up at Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s giant Victorian home, the groaning Victorian home, and rather than send him to the place where he was supposed to be going, Javier Bardem\u2019s character is a narcissist of infinite proportions and says, please, by all means, come in. Do stay with us. Jennifer Lawrence is like, excuse me? What? And then there\u2019s a knock on the door the next day. Then, there\u2019s another, there\u2019s a woman at the door. Oh, that\u2019s my wife, says Ed Harris. And in comes Michelle Pfeiffer.JW: The luminous Michelle...my God.WM: The everything...we should maybe do a whole Michelle Pfeiffer episode.JW: We should. No, I love her to death, my God.WM: So, the two of them come with their \u2014JW: Like, hypersexualized libido and like invasiveness and they\u2019ve disrupted this idyllic environment that JLaw has like tried to create for them.WM: But there\u2019s some tension. There\u2019s tension between Javier Bardem and the Jennifer Lawrence character. And the tension has, in Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s character\u2019s eyes, to do with the fact that they don\u2019t seem to be, what\u2019s the love situation like between the two of you? We\u2019re so in love. We\u2019ve got these wonderful kids, and we have a lot of sex, which you can see, because you just walked in on us doing it. Then, there\u2019s another knock on the door. And basically, there\u2019s one knock after another, and what you begin to see once Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris\u2019 kids show up is that this is clearly an allegory for something. You probably knew that two shots into the movie, but this is clearly an allegory for something, and it\u2019s clearly based on a very specific \u2014 it\u2019s based on the Bible, okay. It starts with Genesis.JW: What I will say though is that I spent a lot of time on, you know, our/fan theories \u2014 Reddit is still good for something. I spent a lot of time reading about all the various theories, and it is probably Biblical knowing Darren\u2019s interests in that, but...we\u2019ll get into it in a second, but like, there are a lot of other theories too, we should say. It\u2019s not just based on Gensis.WM: No, no, no, there\u2019s a lot going on here, and I think once the rollercoaster of crazy really flies off the rails...it really does become more than a strictly Biblical allegory. And what winds up happening of course is Jennifer Lawrence...winds up pregnant, and the pregnancy becomes the focal point of the craziness in the movie. And where that goes...is...really entertaining and totally nuts.JW: Ridiculous to the point of absurdity. And that\u2019s when I started to have a really good time, because I was like, oh, we\u2019re like completely off the rails. But we should say that this movie has been very polarizing in terms of how people are reviewing it. Some people are like, zero out of four stars! Some people are like, this is a great comedy. Other people are like, WTF. Internet, basically, thinks that this is based on an allegory of the book of Genesis and that Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s characters are creating this Eden that gets ruined by man, and then all of mankind goes HAM. There was this great thread about how Jennifer Lawerence is actually Lucifer and competing with the poet, aka God, who keeps trying to create something and Lucifer just wants to tempt him away. Which I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. I don\u2019t know. There are other theories that it\u2019s an environmental film, like she\u2019s Mother Earth, and the house is being taken over by a greedy man, who just wants more and more and more, and keeps taking things from her. Like, physically taking things from her, ravaging things from her. I was really into those first two theories, and I was all on the Internet and talking about it with my friend Dodai, and then she was like, I think it\u2019s just about how men are really selfish and take from women, and I was like, is it just about like, the ego of an artist and maybe Darren is \u2014 because he and JLaw are dating, so maybe this is an allegory for their relationship? I mean, what the heck is going on in this movie?WM: First of all, apparently, I\u2019ve been living under a rock, and did not know that Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence were a couple.JW: They\u2019ve kept it hush hush, but I am up up on all the celeb goss, so I knew. But it\u2019s super, super, super on the DL.WM: Not anymore!JW: I mean, the cat\u2019s out of the bag.WM: Here\u2019s what I think. I think the movie is such a mess that it can be anything you want it to be. Because he\u2019s not strictly adhering to this Biblical allegory. And all of the sort of Christian and Old Testament thinking about creation, destruction, greed, sacrifice, all of those things are sort of messily dispersed throughout this movie. And his interest in freaking you out and in showing off what a strong visual director he is...keep upstaging the strength or the tightness of that story. I actually think the funniest metaphor in the movie is the kitchen sink that keeps almost falling off. People keep jumping on the sink and Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s character keeps saying...JW: It\u2019s not braced!WM: It\u2019s not braced!JW: Don\u2019t sit on it.WM: So, the kitchen sink, of course, being in critical complaint parlance, everything is in this movie, including the kitchen sink. This movie has everything in it, including a kitchen sink joke.JW: Yeah.WM: The real question is, is Darren Aronofsky funny? Is he a comedic director? And would it have been more fun if, I don\u2019t know, Luis Bu\u00f1uel or John Waters had directed it. I don\u2019t know. But I think what makes it extra funny is what is funny about it has gotten away from him. So, we are now laughing kind of with the movie, but mostly at it. And mostly at its like, high pitched, ultra keyed up insanity. And yet, I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy enough.JW: I think it could have been crazier.WM: I think it could have been so much crazier.JW: We also didn\u2019t say that like, one of the best cameos in the film is Kristen Wiig, which just comes at the height of the lunacy and like, it continues to evolve. It just...like, that\u2019s when you know that the joke\u2019s on us, the viewer. At least in my opinion. Because you don\u2019t cast Kristen Wiig in a movie that\u2019s supposed to be serious. Like, she is the epitome of just like, the inside joke.WM: Yes. And something happens to her in this movie that is, I mean, it\u2019s just funny. The effects team has a sense of humor too, because the thing that winds up happening to her is just funny. But anyway. One of the other things this movie is about is fame, and about stardom. And in the story about the making of this movie with Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence, they talk about this Kardashian room that Jennifer Lawerence had for herself to stay sort of sane when the violence that her character undergoes as the movie goes on...becomes very intense for her as an actress to have to endure. I actually think that there is something about this movie in terms of where it winds up going that is very much about what we as the consumers of culture want from people like Jennifer Lawerence, and what people like Darren Aronofsky think about what we want from people like Beyonce. I mean, the baby aspect of this movie is actually fascinating, right. Because think about the ways in which we have become newly obsessed and creepily and dangerously and unhealthily obsessed with the babies of famous people.JW: Right, physically, like literally, and also metaphorically, like whether it\u2019s Lemonade or Blue Ivy or the twins, like, we are...WM: The Kardashian Wests.JW: We just want to consume it all.WM: This movie feels like it\u2019s also whether intentionally or not speaking directly to the machine that has to keep this fame going, and these babies are...who knows what\u2019s going to end up happening to any of these babies? But there is something, there is something longevity or \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the term is, but...JW: Well, there\u2019s something self perpetuating about it, though, and it becomes this feedback loop in the film, and it\u2019s very, you know, the movie ends sort of the way it starts, and you get the sense that they\u2019re caught in this hamster wheel of, even though they know how things might end, they keep trying to see if there might be a different outcome, which is actually the definition of insanity, but you get the sense that the movie in some ways is really about the cyclical nature of wants and desires and not being able to resist the things that you know will perhaps eventually destroy you. So, if we look at it from that perspective, so maybe this is a very entertaining slapstick horror movie about the horrors of celebrity. And the dangers inside of it, which actually relates back to the presidency, the current administration.WM: It is definitely meeting up with this moment we\u2019re in where we don\u2019t actually know what is actually going on outside the movie theater with what\u2019s real and not real. Sunday night, at the Emmys, not 20 minutes into the show, Stephen Colbert is doing \u2014 I think he\u2019s still in his monologue, actually, and at some point, he throws it to Sean Spicer!JW: Not even just live Sean Spicer, but Sean Spicer wheeling the podium that Melissa McCarthy uses to make fun of him on Saturday Night Live. And look, as someone who, I was en route to Charlottesville for a panel on some reporting on Sunday night, I only caught glimpses of it through Instagram, and let me tell you. It was gross. Like, it was not, I was like, I\u2019m not cool with this. The funhouse, I\u2019ve gotten too deep in the funhouse and I can\u2019t find the exit. Like, I don\u2019t know what mirror is me and what mirror is play Jenna. I just...it was deeply disturbing, the degree to which people were willing to embrace this person that they\u2019d been denouncing weeks, hours, how many minutes before?WM: And the thing that I always wondered when he was doing his job and lying on behalf of this administration...I actually thought, well, clearly, this guy has nowhere to go when this is over. Like, this guy has almost no viable culture position to maintain. And he will be shunned, he will be the first person to be stoned or something.JW: But will he? Will he?WM: Well, apparently not, because the very people who claimed to have contempt for him...I mean, I just feel like I don\u2019t even know how much control Stephen Colbert had in the production of that show...JW: A lot!WM: But it seems to me that it\u2019s a real moral abdication to allow Sean Spicer to get the last laugh not of the administration, but on Melissa McCarthy, who is sitting in the audience...her job with that role is done. He\u2019s out of a job. She can\u2019t play him anymore. He gets to have the last word on the woman who made him interesting in the first place, and who got the most scathing satire performed on him too.JW: And in addition to making him interesting also offered us the first avenue for comedic relief about something that has been an ongoing horror movie, more or less. Like, reality is shape shifting, reality is ephemeral, reality right now is a chameleon. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s up. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s down. Things are spiraling and continuing to spiral out of control. And the one thing that we had was grounding was the ability to take a step back and laugh at it a little bit, and that was lost when the Emmys allowed Sean Spicer to be in on the joke that he created the need for.WM: Here is Stephen Colbert throwing it to Sean Spicer at the Emmys.CLIP FROM THE EMMYSWM: Well, basically, what he\u2019s doing is playing Melissa McCarthy playing him, in a way, and Melissa McCarthy is sitting there kind of...like, the camera is on her face, and she does not know what to do.JW: I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell her.WM: I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t...I mean, I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell her. If they didn\u2019t tell her...oh, God. That\u2019s crazy. Can you imagine? She looked shocked.JW: This is how you know we\u2019re in the Truman Show. I need a scene to happen where someone is rowing to the edge of set and can\u2019t leave. You know what I mean?WM: But I actually think that\u2019s why Mother! is a movie for right now, because we\u2019ve been talking a lot about Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s role as sort of a passive victim and vehicle for the insanity that winds up swallowing her up, but really, it\u2019s about Javier Bardem\u2019s character, and it\u2019s about how nothing can stop what a narcissistic evil a-hole he is. And he\u2019s got the crystal. He can always just put the crystal back in the thing, the world resets, and another woman just wakes up in the bed every single time. He\u2019s got all the control.JW: All the power.WM: And I feel like this administration is so much like that. Nothing is stopping them from enacting their craziest most insane desires. People leave that administration, and they go on and do whatever they want. I went and say It, based on Stephen King\u2019s 1986 novel about a clown that haunts the daylight and nightlife of a group of children in a small town in Maine, and I thought, what a Trump metaphor! But I actually think it\u2019s so obvious and easy, and I think really that it is about how we don\u2019t want to live with what we\u2019re currently living with, and how there is a nostalgia for living in what we think is a simpler time, but I also think that the great thing about Stephen King and the reason we keep going back to him is that he\u2019s kind of uncompromising in his vision of what is horrific and what is scary.JW: And also, our inability to acknowledge that the seemingly impossible is possible, and our inability to comprehend that the most bizarre juxtaposition, we can\u2019t understand that things can have a duality and there can actually be a lot of evil embedded in something we\u2019re conditioned to believe is good. In fact, that\u2019s actually where the most evil thing might live, and I think for me, as a child, I read It, which was, I don\u2019t know what my parents were doing or thinking, they let me read all of Stephen King when I was like nine years old. It was in the house, like everything else \u2014 Danielle Steel, Stephen King, I read it all. Terry McMillan. But you know, aside from \u2014 and I have a high tolerance for horror, horror doesn\u2019t mess me up. Suspense does. I don\u2019t like suspense, I love horror. But the thing I always took away from It was just, you know, we are...we are fallible if we do not acknowledge the thing that is most present and most likely to be a threat. That\u2019s our Achilles heel as a society. It feels like the reboot is tapping into that too.WM: Yes. Both these movies to me are speaking to this moment in ways that are sort of maybe even beyond their makers\u2019 understanding.JW: Well, sir, that\u2019s an extremely generous read on your part to both of those directors who...I can\u2019t say for sure, because I\u2019m not living inside their heads like a little John Malkovich character, but look. There\u2019s a way in which it could just be a super fun early Halloween, campy, trashy film that you go see because you\u2019re bored and you need something to do on date night. There is, you know, a way in which Mother! is also causing a lot of outrage. People are very annoyed that this movie was funded, that this movie was made, that it\u2019s getting as much attention as it is. We\u2019re in a climate where people feel like there aren\u2019t enough stories that are relevant and interesting, especially movies that speak to queer POC perspectives, you know. This movie feels gratuitous in terms of scope and scale and budget and attention, so just to acknowledge that they might have some actual meaningful role to play in our general existential society consciousness is really nice of you.WM: But I think they\u2019re doing that anyway. I don\u2019t know. I just feel like...JW: Well, that\u2019s probably not what they intended.WM: Well...I think sometimes, the best and most lasting movies sort of live beyond what whoever made them intended to do. We should say that the director of It is Andy Muschietti. And I think that...there is a competency at work in both of these movies. I think one, it is too loud and a bunch of other things, but I think they wind up managing to speak to this moment better than you could have hoped. All our consciously trash movies...JW: And society right now is consciously kind of a trash society, so...like attracts like.WM: Right. And for anybody who is misunderstanding what I\u2019m saying, trash, I think, is my favorite type of movie.JW: Ditto. It took me a while to learn that about you, and I\u2019m here for it. I\u2019m into it.WM: Darren Aronofsky makes one trashier piece after the next, and I just really support that. Anyway. That\u2019s it.JW: Okay, cool.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "After Marriott Breach, How to Protect Your Information Online", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementMarriott said Friday that it would begin alerting the 500 million customers it believed were affected by a breach of its Starwood hotels database. In the meantime, if you stayed at a Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Four Points, Aloft, Le M\u00e9ridien, Tribute, Design Hotels, Elements or Luxury Collection hotel in the last four years, you may want to assume that you were.Regardless of the type of breach or the company involved, it\u2019s always a safe bet to change passwords for sites that contain sensitive information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites, and do not use your Social Security number as a username or a password.And if you were not doing so already, you will have to treat everything you receive online with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick you out of even more information.These sites create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. Password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode.If you must create your own passwords, try creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters.My favorite number is Green4782#The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%Or, if you\u2019re extra paranoid, consider mimicking this setup. Take the sentence:\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\u201dAnd convert it into this:\u201cMni!m.YkMf.PtD!\u201dIn general, create the strongest passwords for the sites that contain the most sensitive information and do not reuse them anywhere.Passwords are not enough. If a site offers additional security features, like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text or a code through an authenticator app) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Many bank sites and major sites like Google, Facebook and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you are logging in from a new computer.If you get an email containing links or attachments, even if it appears to be from a familiar friend or colleague, do yourself a favor: Check the From Email Address. Often, attackers will tweak email addresses to be recognizable to their target. Only under closer examination does their target see that the domain is misspelled or the attacker has replaced an \"i\" with a 1. Other times, the email will contain obvious misspellings or strange syntax that was obviously created by a foreigner using Google translate or another translation service. If anything seems off, do not click.To help mitigate what malicious attachments can do to your machine, make sure to update your software regularly, particularly your operating system. Frequently, software companies will release updates that patch bugs and software vulnerabilities when they are discovered.Sites will often use common security questions to recover a user\u2019s account if the password is forgotten.These questions are problematic because the internet has made public record searches simple and the answers are usually easy to guess.In a study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat is your favorite food?\u201d (It was pizza.)With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat is your city of birth?\u201d and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.If you're required to answer security questions, lie and jot down your fake answers in pen or paper. (Q. \"Where were you born?\" A. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Q. \"What was your first pet\u2019s name?\" A. Peach.)Remember the old adage: Don\u2019t put anything in an email that you would not want to see on the front page of The New York Times. The same applies to your sensitive information. Never ever send sensitive data like passwords, Social Security numbers or PINs in an email. If you must share this information, do it over the phone or, worst-case scenario, through an encrypted messaging app like Signal, which allows you to scramble messages and time them to disappear.Never allow a retailer or merchant to store your credit card information unnecessarily. If it is offered, use PayPal or Apple Pay for online transactions. Both are safer than most online payment methods.Your phone is incredibly valuable to criminals and spies. Treat it accordingly. Don\u2019t bother with a four-digit passcode, which is easy to guess. Six-digit passcodes are harder to guess. Eight-digit-passcodes are better.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Start-Up Slump Is a Drag on the Economy. Big Business May Be to Blame.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment has fallen, and the stock market has soared. So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?Economists say the answer, to some degree, can be found in a start-up slump \u2014 a decline in the creation of new businesses \u2014 and a growing understanding of what\u2019s behind it.\u201cWe\u2019re still in a start-up funk,\u201d said Robert Litan, an economist and antitrust lawyer who has studied the issue. \u201cObviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you\u2019re left with the conundrum: Why hasn\u2019t there been any recovery?\u201dMany economists say the answer could lie in the rising power of the biggest corporations, which they argue is stifling entrepreneurship by making it easier for incumbent businesses to swat away challengers \u2014 or else to swallow them before they become a serious threat.\u201cYou\u2019ve got rising market power,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn general, that makes it hard for new businesses to compete with incumbents. Market power is the story that explains everything.\u201dThe start-up slump has far-reaching implications. Small businesses in general are often cited as an exemplar of economic dynamism. But it is start-ups \u2014 and particularly the small subset of companies that grow quickly \u2014 that are key drivers of job creation and innovation, and have historically been a ladder into the middle class for less-educated workers and immigrants.Perhaps most significant, start-ups play a critical role in making the economy as a whole more productive, as they invent new products and approaches, forcing existing businesses to compete or fall by the wayside.\u201cAcross the decades, young companies are really the heavy hitters and the consistent hitters in terms of job creation,\u201d said Arnobio Morelix, an economist at the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit in Kansas City, Mo., that studies and promotes entrepreneurship.The start-up decline might defy expectations in the age of Uber and \u201cShark Tank.\u201d But however counterintuitive, the trend is backed by multiple data sources and numerous economic studies.In 1980, according to the Census Bureau data, roughly one in eight companies had been founded in the past year; by 2015, that ratio had fallen to fewer than one in 12. The downward trend cuts across regions and industries and, at least since 2000, includes even the beating heart of American entrepreneurship, high tech.Although the overall slump dates back more than 30 years, economists are most concerned about a more recent trend. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entrepreneurial slowdown was concentrated in sectors such as retail, where corner stores and regional brands were being subsumed by national chains. That trend, though often painful for local communities, wasn\u2019t necessarily a drag on productivity more generally.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of pieces now that say dynamism has gone down a lot since 2000,\u201d said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist who has done much of the pioneering work in the field. \u201cStart-ups have gone down a lot since 2000, especially in the high-tech sectors, and there are increasingly strong links to productivity.\u201dWhat is behind the decline in entrepreneurship is less clear. Economists and other experts have pointed to a range of possible explanations: The aging of the baby-boom generation has left fewer Americans in their prime business-starting years. The decline of community banks and the collapse of the market for home-equity loans may have made it harder for would-be entrepreneurs to get access to capital. Increased regulation, at both the state and federal levels, may be particularly burdensome for new businesses that lack well-staffed compliance departments. Those and other factors could well play a role, but none can fully explain the decline.More recently, economists \u2014 especially but not exclusively on the left \u2014 have begun pointing the finger at big business, and in particular at the handful of companies that increasingly dominate many industries.The evidence is largely circumstantial: The slump in entrepreneurship has coincided with a period of increasing concentration in nearly every major industry. Research from Mr. Haltiwanger and several co-authors has found that the most productive companies are growing more slowly than in the past, a hint that competitive pressures aren\u2019t forcing companies to react as quickly to new innovations.\u201cIf we\u2019re in an era of excessive profits, in competitive markets we would see record firm entry, but we see the opposite,\u201d said Ian Hathaway, an economist who has studied the issue. That, Mr. Hathaway said, suggests that the market is not truly competitive \u2014 that existing companies have found ways to block competitors.Experts also point to anecdotal examples that suggest that the rise of big businesses could be squelching competition. YouTube, Instagram and hundreds of lower-profile start-ups chose to sell out to industry heavyweights like Google and Facebook rather than try to take them on directly. The tech giants have likewise been accused of using the power of their platforms to favor their own offerings over those of competitors.\u201cWe\u2019re saying that it\u2019s O.K. that they shape how a city charges taxes?\u201d Mr. Morelix said. \u201cAnd what kind of regulations they have? That should be terrifying to anyone that wants a free market.\u201d\u201cEverybody loves entrepreneurship, but they\u2019re not aware it\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Mr. Dearie said. \u201cIf new businesses are the engine of net new job creation, and if new businesses are the engine of innovation, and new business creation is at 30-year lows, that\u2019s a national emergency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twice Beaten, Thrice Shy? Not for Sal Albanese, Mayoral Hopeful. Again.", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe candidate sat in a dark suit and yellow monogrammed tie on an R train headed to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to campaign with an old friend. Little gave away that the man was nearly at the end of another quixotic campaign to become mayor of New York, except for a small navy button with his first name: Sal.A young man, in a T-shirt and shorts on the same orange seats, leaned over as the train rumbled under Brooklyn.\u201cI just looked you up on Google,\u201d said the man, Kyle McKenzie, 26, who introduced himself as gay and said he would not be supporting Mayor Bill de Blasio for re-election, despite voting for him four years ago. \u201cYou were for gays before it was cool.\u201dAnother rider, a student at New York University, extended a piece of paper with his phone number and email. \u201cI just picked up a volunteer,\u201d the candidate said, pocketing the paper as he stepped from the train.\u201cI have won elections,\u201d he added, ruefully.Just not for a while.Sal F. Albanese, a lawyer and former city councilman, is on his third run for City Hall, unbowed by defeat.Now Mr. Albanese, 68, who has made transit and political reform his signature issues, is looking at his most unencumbered shot yet at City Hall, if only because he is taking on an incumbent mayor when no established Democrat saw fit to do so.Alone on the stage with Mr. de Blasio during last month\u2019s primary debate, Mr. Albanese made his appeal to Democrats as the only viable alternative. But despite his long history in New York politics, familiar largely to older residents of Bay Ridge whom he represented from 1982 to 1997, he remains unknown to most voters.He has little time and even fewer resources to change that before the Sept. 12 primary. The Albanese campaign has no dedicated office or full-time staff apart from a pair of consultants, and little money in the bank after it furiously raised and spent the required $175,000 to qualify for last week\u2019s debate.Resources are so slim, in fact, that Mr. Albanese cannot take out a television commercial to introduce himself, or attack the mayor.Since the debate, some donations have come in, he said, but nothing approaching the $5 million that Mr. de Blasio has in his campaign coffers. Instead, Mr. Albanese has crisscrossed the city holding modest campaign events, recording videos to post on the internet and tapping a network of people whom he met long ago.\u201cI remember him from back when very few people were coming out to the blocks,\u201d said Richard Green, who founded the Crown Heights Youth Collective, a community group, in the 1980s and was showing Mr. Albanese around the neighborhood a day after the debate.A lot of Mr. Albanese\u2019s campaigning is like that, peppered with talk of the past.\u201cAre you Sal?\u201d a kindergarten teacher, Judy Coppola, asked as he walked in Bay Ridge. Mr. Albanese, who worked as a teacher in city schools before running for the Council, stopped to talk.\u201cI always said, \u2018What happened to him?\u2019\u201d Ms. Coppola said after he walked on.During his time in the City Council, Mr. Albanese got his law degree and was known as a reformer and political maverick, a liberal from a conservative district who wrested the seat from a Republican and held it for 15 years. He voted against the budgets negotiated by the Council speaker, and was rewarded, he said, with a cubbyhole office for his entire tenure.As a councilman, Mr. Albanese sponsored a living wage bill that survived a veto by Mayor Giuliani and stood up for gay rights at political and some personal risk in 1986. \u201cI had a bodyguard for two days when I voted for gay rights,\u201d recalled Mr. Albanese, who described himself as \u201cculturally Catholic\u201d but not a regular at church.But whereas many of his positions dovetail with those of the mayor, Mr. Albanese is a Democrat of an older style, political observers said. \u201cHe exemplifies, in some ways, a part of New York City that no longer exists: the angry, white, blue-collar Catholic,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who overlapped with Mr. Albanese when both were students at York College in Queens.After losing his bid for mayor in 1997, Mr. Albanese worked in finance at Invesco and Mesirow Financial, mostly focused on public pension plans. He became of counsel at a small law firm, Allegaert Berger & Vogel LLP, where he has represented union clients among others since his 2013 mayoral bid. His current campaign is based out of his bare-walled office at the firm.Mr. Albanese is opposed to President Trump \u2014 \u201cI find they guy abhorrent; it\u2019s surreal that he\u2019s president\u201d \u2014 but he said he would avoid the sort of \u201cpersonal grudge match\u201d that he said Mr. de Blasio has embraced. He said he would take a similar approach with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, seeking to work with the governor on areas of agreement like congestion pricing to fund the city\u2019s subways. Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have been in an open feud for years.It is a line of attack he used in the debate and with voters from Staten Island to Crown Heights.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen de Blasio over here,\u201d a man seated on a bench outside Jackie Robinson Park in Brooklyn told Mr. Albanese.Mr. Albanese said that, if elected, he would visit neighborhoods frequently, a notion that appealed to the man, Tony Shaw, 50, who conceded that he had not heard of Mr. Albanese before.\u201cI\u2019m not that well known,\u201d the candidate said.\u201cI\u2019m going to check you out,\u201d Mr. Shaw responded.Advertisement"}

Dealing with last minute airfare, pet-friendly accommodations and overwhelming lines for gas is par for the course.But as Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, barrels toward the mainland of the United States, some residents are evacuating more quickly than ever. Searches for \u201cwhere to evacuate from Irma\u201d and \u201cwhere to go for Hurricane Irma\u201d have been trending on Google.\u201cAs soon as I went outside, I realized how panicked people were,\u201d Sara Milrad said of the scene at the University of Miami in Coral Gables on Tuesday afternoon.

There was an urgency of \u2018if you can get out, you should get out.\u2019\u201dAs Floridians looked for safe evacuation routes, demand for flights out of Florida\u2019s main airports skyrocketed. On Twitter, many customers accused airlines of price-gouging as one-way tickets out of Florida were upward of $1,000.By Thursday afternoon, JetBlue, American Airlines, United and Delta had all capped their one-way ticket prices out of Florida ahead of Irma\u2019s arrival, although there were still reports of price fluctuations despite the caps.Some airlines and cruise lines have left travelers in limbo. While all cruises out of Florida set to leave Friday were canceled, some cruises scheduled to sail from Central and South Florida remain on course to depart over the weekend. Cruise companies are urging customers to check in daily as conditions evolve.As soon as Irma appeared on the radar, Dave Kartunen, a Savannah, Ga., resident, booked a hotel room 50 miles inland. \u201cHurricane planning has taken a certain level importance in my family,\u201d he said.

Where is California\u2019s?", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.It\u2019s just a matter of time.Some steps have been taken to prepare. After the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes, billions of dollars were spent to fortify structures across the state.But more than a decade after development began on an earthquake early warning system, the project is still years away from full implementation.Here\u2019s a look at the plan in California:How would the warning system work?A network of sensors placed near fault lines detect shaking and alert nearby communities through television, radio, phone and other channels.Modern telecommunications travel faster than seismic waves. So in essence, the warnings are able to outrun the shaking.People could get anywhere from a few seconds to more than a minute of warning, depending on the intensity of the quake and the distance from its epicenter.That poses a crucial caveat: If a big quake kicks off right near a city, the alerts might not do much good.Where does the project stand?Roughly 500 earthquake sensors are already in the ground.

{"Headline": "At $1,000, Apple\u2019s iPhone X Crosses a Pricing Threshold", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company will also enter new territory on price: The latest phone will start at about $1,000, compared with the $769 minimum for its current top phone, the iPhone 7 Plus.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new threshold,\u201d said Debby Ruth, a senior vice president at the tech consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates. I really do think it\u2019s going to make people pause.\u201dFrom the iPhone\u2019s introduction a decade ago, Apple has always priced it as a premium product \u2014 a more refined and polished alternative to the legions of cheaper smartphones available in the market.But this time, the company is pushing into luxury territory. The new phone will cost as much as the company\u2019s entry-level MacBook Air laptop. \u201cThey\u2019re doubling down on their strategy: They are going much more to the high end,\u201d Ms. Ruth said.Investors are betting that Apple\u2019s move up the price ladder will pay off with much higher profits, especially in mature markets like the United States and Western Europe, where many of the buyers will be people upgrading from older iPhones. The company\u2019s stock has risen by nearly 50 percent over the past year as anticipation has built about the 2017 models.Apple\u2019s strategy carries risks, however, especially in developing countries where smartphone sales are growing briskly but its market share is a blip compared with devices running Google\u2019s Android software.In Brazil, for example, Apple devices will account for just 8 percent of the 125 million active smartphone subscriptions this year, according to Forrester, a research firm.Steep taxes, higher retail profit margins, and added costs from a botched attempt at building iPhones in Brazil have pushed the price of an iPhone 6s, a two-year-old model, to more than $1,000 at Casa Bahia, a store in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. In late August, the retailer was selling Apple\u2019s most basic smartphone, the iPhone SE, for more than $600, while a Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini, which runs Android, was just $136.At another Rio store recently, Vanessa Perreira, 25, a university student, was browsing the 65 models on display, looking at the offerings from Samsung and LG but ignoring the six from Apple. She once owned an iPhone, she lamented, but could not afford to continue buying them. \u201cPrice is the most important factor for me,\u201d she said.Still, the iPhone is coveted by wealthier Brazilians, many of whom buy the phone while traveling abroad to avoid their country\u2019s high costs. \u201cThere will always be users in Brazil that will be interested in buying it,\u201d said Tina Lu, a senior analyst with Counterpoint Research.China\u2019s reception to the $1,000 iPhone will be even more crucial to Apple. The Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, contributed $8 billion to Apple\u2019s revenue last quarter, but sales have been sluggish.Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.Apple\u2019s market share has declined slightly in China over the past year, according to Counterpoint. High-end phones from Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo have gained ground, in part by undercutting Apple on price.The new iPhone has the potential to reverse that trend. More than any other tech product, the iPhone has long denoted status in China. If a new iPhone looks the same as the previous one \u2014 and won\u2019t be recognized by others as new \u2014 it often doesn\u2019t sell well.\u201cIf the phone\u2019s appearance changes, I think people are going to be crazy about it, because we\u2019ve seen the iPhone with a similar look for such a long time now,\u201d said He Peihuan, a Shanghai-based financial analyst.Apple has also faced pressure from the Chinese government. State-run media outlets have called attention to a feature that tracked a user\u2019s most commonly visited locations and also criticized the company\u2019s after-sales policies. And government employees and leaders at state-run companies try to avoid being seen using foreign technologies like the iPhone.For all that, Zhang Xiang, a phone reseller and repairman in Shanghai, said that he still expected strong demand for the new iPhone. \u201cI think when people can afford it and want a high-end phone with good features, they\u2019ll still choose to buy an iPhone,\u201d he said.One important factor offsetting the next iPhone\u2019s expected high price is the increasing prevalence of financing options for buyers around the globe. In the United States, most phone carriers allow customers to spread the cost of a new phone over two years, and the new phone would add less than $10 a month to the payments a customer would make on an iPhone 7 Plus.\u201cThere\u2019s not that much difference in the monthly fee you have to pay,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst at Gartner, a research firm.Similar installment purchase plans are emerging in China, Brazil and other countries, making Apple\u2019s products more affordable there.\u201cI\u2019ve seen some banks providing installment plans for the iPhone with very low, or even no interest, so ordinary people could get an iPhone that way,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.That would play into Satish Meena\u2019s theory of iPhone adoption in developing countries.Mr. Meena, a senior forecast analyst at Forrester who is based in New Delhi, said that in places like India and Brazil, where millions of new smartphone users are entering the market, the first phone that people buy is a cheap Android. The second tends to be a fancier Android.

{"Headline": "How Houston\u2019s Growth Created the Perfect Flood Conditions", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "Advertisement\nAs floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey recede in Houston, one thing that\u2019s been revealed is that some of the damage \u2014 financial, physical, emotional \u2014 could have been avoided.Flood hazard maps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, showing the 100-year floodplain, an area with a 1 percent risk for flooding in any given year, mark where homeowners are required to have federally sponsored flood insurance. This is one of the few early warning signals the United States has for flooding. For Houston, those maps were thoroughly inadequate. Early assessments show many homes were flooded even though they were located far from the designated floodplains. Many homes in what\u2019s known as the 500-year floodplain \u2014 with a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in a year \u2014 are also flooded.Areas surrounding the Katy Prairies, sprawling grasslands in western Harris County, provide one such example. The region has been heavily developed over the past 30 years, sometimes overlapping or abutting floodplains. Local officials did not do enough to preserve native grasses, set aside open spaces or improve drainage.Damage around Katy was not restricted to floodplains identified by FEMA.\u201cIt gives people a feeling of complacency if they are not required to buy insurance,\u201d said Howard Kunreuther, the co-director of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He would like to see FEMA provide people the \"gradation of their risk.\"Less understandable is how often these flood maps were ignored in Houston, where policies encouraged development in flood-prone areas while reducing the region\u2019s natural defenses to flooding.And while the region has its own unique history, geography, economy and approach to growth, the lessons it will be learning in the coming weeks would apply to many other areas of the country.FEMA flood risk zonesBuilding Damage100-year500-yearOUTSIDE floodPLAINSSpringHockleyHOUSTONJersey Village12HighlandsKatyPasadenaBaytownEast Houston21Damaged buildingsoutside floodplainsSource: FEMA (building damage); Beyond Floods (floodplains)FEMA flood risk zonesBuilding Damage100-year500-yearOUTSIDE floodPLAINSHARRIS COUNTYSpringHockleyHOUSTONJersey Village1HighlandsKaty2PasadenaEast HoustonBaytown12Damaged buildingsoutside floodplainsSources: FEMA (building damage, through Sept. 2, 2017); Beyond Floods (floodplains)FEMA flood risk zones100-year500-yearBuilding DamageOUTSIDE floodplainsHARRIS COUNTYHOUSTONJersey Village1HighlandsKaty2PasadenaEast Houston1Damaged buildingsoutside floodplainsBaytown2Sources: FEMA (building damage, through Sept. 2,2017); Beyond Floods (floodplains)With Houston\u2019s economy booming, thanks in large part to oil and gas industries, residential and business development spread. As developers carved out new neighborhoods, they sometimes overlapped or abutted the floodplain \u2014 zones highly susceptible to flooding. Elsewhere, roads, parking lots, homes and businesses covered over wetlands and prairies that absorb flood waters.An area east of Katy was submerged in floodwaters after rainfall breached the Addicks Reservoir. One neighborhood, Westlake Forest, was built in what the FEMA designated a floodplain.Westlake ForestNeighborhoodCivilians patrol for residents in need of evacuation in the Westlake Forest neighborhood of Katy, Texas.FLOODPLAINWestlake ForestNeighborhoodCivilians patrol for residents in need of evacuation in the Westlake Forest neighborhood of Katy, Texas.FLOODPLAINWestlake ForestNeighborhoodCivilians patrol for residents in need of evacuation in the Westlake Forest neighborhood of Katy, Texas.Alyssa Schukar for The New York TimesFLOODPLAINA newer development located on the south side of Kingwood, a community in northeast Houston, was constructed throughout the late 1990s and 2000s directly inside the floodplain. Satellite photos show the area overwhelmed by floodwaters after the storm.Other regions, like Cypress in northwest Harris County, or Willow and the Woodlands on the northern side of Houston, also show heavy development throughout the late 1990s and 2000s. Both areas experienced heavy flooding during the hurricane.FEMA maps are updated infrequently because Congress has not appropriated enough money for the work. The maps do not take into account the future impact of climate change or the impact of likely real estate development in the area. In addition, FEMA has not created flood maps for the entire country, leaving some home buyers unaware of flooding risks, said Larry Larson, a senior policy advisor at the Association of State Floodplain Managers.A more nuanced view of flood risk may be possible. Data by Syndeste and Beyond Floods considers factors like previous flood damage and land cover as part of a risk assessment, showing many properties in downtown Houston not in the floodplain are still at significant risk.FEMA flood risk zones100-year500-yearFlood outlook score per blockHIGH OR Very highLOWVERY LOWGreater HeightsHOUSTONRice MilitaryFourth WardSources: FEMA (floodplains); Beyond Floods (flood outlook)FEMA flood risk zonesFlood outlook score per block100-year500-yearHIGH OR Very highLOWVERY LOWNearNorthsideGreater HeightsHOUSTONRice MilitaryFourth WardDowntownHyde ParkSources: FEMA (floodplains); Beyond Floods (flood outlook)FEMA flood risk zones100-year500-yearFlood outlook score per blockHIGH OR Very highLOWVERY LOWGreater HeightsHOUSTONRice MilitaryFourth WardSources: FEMA (floodplains); Beyond Floods(flood outlook)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Office Meetings Leave the Office Behind", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersEntrepreneurs have a reputation for working long hours to get their businesses up and running, leading some of their employees to a quick burnout.But some business owners have instituted activities that may seem better suited to summer camp \u2014 outdoor planning sessions, meetings in a salt room, deal talks on a surfboard. They may sound fun and relaxing, but they are meant to be productive.Eric Tetuan has the kind of New York job where he could be in the office 100 hours a week and still think about work the rest of his waking \u2014 and probably some of his sleeping \u2014 hours.He loves what he does, running an event and production company called ProductionGlue in Midtown Manhattan. But a few years ago, he felt the effects of his staff\u2019s being overscheduled. He saw morale sinking and mistakes rising at his company. So he began forcing his workers to take walks, ride bikes or just sit by the Hudson River.There was just one twist: These were not solitary moments to recharge but activities to be done with colleagues as a way to discuss work outside the office. His goal was to increase creativity at ProductionGlue, a business that thrived on creating spectacles.\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t about more oversight on jobs,\u201d said Mr. Tetuan, a co-founder of the firm and its chief innovation officer. \u201cIt was about a holistic change to how we approached the job.\u201dAnd that meant leaving the office behind. \u201cThere are a lot of distractions when you go into a conference room,\u201d he said, adding that workers were focused half on the meeting and half on their devices. \u201cOn a walk, we spur more ideas.\u201d\u201cAbove some level of financial security, people care about being part of a community and belonging at work,\u201d said Jennifer Chatman, a professor of management at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley. \u201cThe key insight about these kinds of perks is that they bring people together and make work more fun. In this way, they effectively increase motivation and performance.\u201dMarco Schnabl, co-founder and co-chief executive of automotiveMastermind, a company that sells predictive data around car sales to dealerships, said his employee head count had tripled in a year. Despite the rapid growth, he needs his 230 employees working together, not just working remotely on projects.\u201cWe\u2019re in the financial center, and you have water all around,\u201d Mr. Schnabl said of working in New York, where the company is based. \u201cSo we say: This is going to be a walking meeting. For the next hour, we\u2019ll go on an extended walk with three or four people anywhere we can exercise our bodies a bit and think about topics that are relevant to the business.\u201d\u201cIf people are building bonds when you go to SoulCycle or to a manicure, it frames the relationship differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things you traditionally do with friends. It develops respect.\u201dEven delivering bad news, he said, \u201ccomes from a moment of empathy.\u201dMr. Heath said Bombas had revenue of $70 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 500 percent, and had donated four million pairs of socks to date. And retention of the company\u2019s 37 employees during a time of such tremendous growth has been a key to its success, Mr. Heath said.Mr. Heath said he was focused on \u201cscheduled spontaneity,\u201d which includes setting many of his monthly meetings in unusual places so his employees will do the same.\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll feel instead of doing it in the conference room, let\u2019s go sit outside or have breakfast,\u201d he said. \u201cAn 8:30 a.m. monthly meeting, that\u2019s early for some people in the start-up world. What if I can elevate that a bit and say we meet at 7:30 a.m. for yoga?\u201dJust as a meeting outside can help spur creativity, solve a problem or keep an employee happy, it can also serve to end an impasse. Larry Newman, chief operating officer of the Health Media Network, a wellness and health education company, credits surfing with helping him close several deals, including the sale of his first health care company.\u201cWe had spent countless hours in meetings and with lawyers,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cI said, \u2018I think we can get this done face to face.\u2019 We sat there in the water on our boards. We talked about the final points and pieces.\u201dFor the record, they were not surfing and talking at the same time: \u201cYou\u2019d probably get killed,\u201d he said.Mr. Newman said he had a negotiation planned for the surf off in Montauk, N.Y., in the fall. And he is hopeful that it, too, will help to wrap up a deal.\u201cYou\u2019re negotiating to a human level, not a business level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt excites people.\u201dThis approach is paying off for employees and owners alike, but there are clearly times and places it does not work.Mr. Tetuan said all of his company\u2019s initial creative meetings with clients take place in conference rooms to accommodate all the people who need to be involved.The salt floor is antifungal and antibacterial, and some people believe it can help with respiratory problems; for others, it can give them an energized feeling.But not everyone likes to leave a meeting with a dusting of salt on their suit. \u201cIf it\u2019s a chief executive who has no time and just wants to meet in his/her boardroom, then it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Ms. Stern said. \u201cOr if it\u2019s someone who\u2019s straight up, very conservative, this may not be the type of meeting you want to take.\u201dStill, she tries to do meetings there whenever she can. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there, having this meeting, but you\u2019re also getting these mental health benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re inhaling the dry salt. You\u2019re doing beneficial things for yourself and others.\u201dAnother potential drawback of these unconventional meeting spots is being out of touch with the very clients who are paying for the strolling, surfing and salty talks. So many entrepreneurs today are expected to be reachable.For Mr. Tetuan, taking a few hours away from the office \u2014 and a client \u2014 is a worthwhile trade-off.\u201cHaving that hour to think and not be distracted, I can get more done in a day,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone may be looking for us for two hours, but at the end of the week, they know they\u2019re getting more out of us than others.\u201dHis favorite meeting activity is mountain biking with his creative team, which is not conducive to texting.\u201cI can leave my phone and clear my head,\u201d Mr. Tetuan said. \u201cWe\u2019re not busy giving quick responses. That can be the difference between $100,000 and $1 million.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There was a lot to reflect on, as usual: Barcelona, Charlottesville, and, on a more cheerful note, the solar eclipse. Despite the plethora of options, I am writing about the Summer Reading Contest itself and how it has interested, and transformed, me over the past ten weeks.Prior to this summer, the only writing I did was for school assignments or Google searches. And if I did get around to it, I never reread what I wrote. That\u2019s why, as the weeks went on, I surprised myself when I began double and triple checking my comments for mistakes, of which there were far more than expected!Another transformation is my newfound interest in the news. I used to be the kind of person who opened a newspaper and went straight to the puzzles section, and though that may be unchanged, I now feel compelled to read a few articles that catch my eye too. In return, exposing myself to current affairs has fine-tuned my political opinions, and through consistent writing I learned to express them in a way that accentuates them.The result? I feel grounded in my views and understand what\u2019s going on in the world.

{"Headline": "36 Hours in Madrid", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementThere\u2019s arguably never been a better time to visit Madrid. Prices are still relatively low, but the economic and political turmoil of the past decade has helped spur an outpouring of creativity and enterprise in Spain\u2019s golden capital. Experimentally minded locals have enlivened the city\u2019s aging mercados and turned its derelict factories into thriving art centers. Young culture makers and party people continue to flock to established night life and shopping hubs like Malasa\u00f1a, even as they invigorate upwardly trending barrios like fashionably chill Conde Duque and multicultural Lavapi\u00e9s.\nExplore the map and find things to do in Madrid.\nSome things don\u2019t need updating, like La Venencia, a gorgeously musty, sepia-toned sherry bar frequented by Hemingway that has hardly changed in 70 years. Tipping and taking photos are still strictly forbidden \u2014 remnants of the bar\u2019s time as a Republican haunt during the Spanish Civil War \u2014 and the only drink on offer is sherry: exquisite, honey-hued and poured from hulking oakwood casks, same as it ever was. Another fetching Madrile\u00f1o relic, Bar Cock has been open since 1921 in a cavernous former brothel decked out like an English gentlemen\u2019s club. With its well-poured cocktails, pleasantly stagey interior, and whiff of debauchery, it\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s been a late-night spot for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Pedro Almod\u00f3var to Francis Bacon, who according to bar legend came here for his final martini.El Rastro, Spain\u2019s largest flea market, has been unfurling across La Latina neighborhood for half a millennium. Named for the trail of blood left by slaughtered cattle on the way to the tanneries, the teeming market offers everything from vintage furs and antiquaria to mismatched silverware, craft items, hand-me-down curios, synthetic flamenco frocks, and midcentury modern furniture. Equally engaging is the crowd, a motley cross-section of locals and visitors walking the great hill of La Ribera de Curtidores, browsing the stalls and clustering around busking gypsy-klezmer bands and sub-Saharan drummers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Sets Limits on Addiction Treatment Ads, Citing Safety", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut prosecutors and health advocates have warned that many online searches are leading addicts to click on ads for rehab centers that are unfit to help them or, in some cases, endangering their lives.This week, Google acknowledged the problem \u2014 and started restricting ads that come up when someone searches for addiction treatment on its site. \u201cWe found a number of misleading experiences among rehabilitation treatment centers that led to our decision,\u201d Google spokeswoman Elisa Greene said in a statement on Thursday.In this case, the restrictions will limit a popular marketing tool in the $35 billion addiction treatment business, affecting thousands of small-time operators.\u201cThis is a bold move by one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, saying people\u2019s lives are more important than profit,\u201d said Greg Williams, co-founder of Facing Addiction, a nonprofit group that is an advocate for people struggling with addiction.Many rehab centers, a large number of which are clustered in warm climates like Florida, Arizona and California, rely on Google searches to attract patients from across the country. Their strategy often included buying an ad that would come up when someone searched for phrases like \u201cdrug rehab\u201d or \u201calcohol treatment centers.\u201dAs of this week, Google has stopped selling ads related to those searches, although it may lift the restriction if it can find a way to weed out misleading advertisements.Search ads for addiction treatment are lucrative. Treatment providers, in some cases, have been willing to pay $70 per ad click, according to an analysis that Mr. Williams\u2019 group conducted and presented to Google executives.But the payoff for those clicks can be significant. Addicts who sign up for 30 days of residential treatment can bring in tens of thousands of dollars from private insurance.What constitutes treatment is also all over the map, from yoga and equine therapy to daily doses of medication. And unlike other serious illnesses, like cancer or heart disease, where a physician typically refers the patient for treatment, many addicts and their families look for help on the internet.That has made Google one of the largest referral sources for treating a disease that affects millions of Americans. And the companies willing to the pay the most for ads are the one that addicts are most likely to see on their search.But ad-driven searches, according to advocates and law enforcement officials, have not always led patients to the best care. In some cases, they have found that patients are being duped, a phenomenon Google on Thursday acknowledged.Last December, a Florida grand jury released a report detailing abuses in the state\u2019s addiction treatment industry, which is centered around Palm Beach County. Among the findings, the grand jury zeroed on the problems with how some of the shoddy programs were being marketed online.One witness, according to the grand jury report, described how \u201conline marketers use Google search terms to essentially hijack the good name and reputation of notable treatment providers only to route the caller to the highest bidder.\u201dAnother common trap: Addicts search Google for a rehab program close to their home, but they will click on an ad for a referral service pitching treatment in another state. The referral service then collects a fee, if they signed up.Google\u2019s restrictions were cheered by health officials, who have called for more medically based treatment. \u201cPeople don\u2019t always know what good treatment is,\u201d said Dr. Vivek Murthy, who was surgeon general in the Obama Administration and published a oft-cited report last year that warned of the nation\u2019s addiction crisis. \u201cI am glad Google took steps to prevent the spread of these false ads.\u201dIn targeting the ads for addiction treatment, Google consulted with experts including Mr. Williams, who himself has been in recovery for many years. He said he began discussions with Google executives around the time that Dr. Murthy released his report.Mr. Williams said that he had explained to Google that his own experience trying to buy ads from the company had illustrated how the process of finding information about addiction treatment online was providing people with unreliable information. Mr. Williams said he discovered this when his group received a grant from Google that would help him buy ads promoting a website providing information about community based treatment \u2014 and found he couldn\u2019t compete.Buying ads on Google involves bidding to place your ad at the top of the search results when a user types in words relevant to your product or service. But Mr. Williams found that the bid prices for words related to treatment had gotten so expensive that his group couldn\u2019t pay as much as the for-profit treatment providers. Some of those treatment providers, Mr. Williams told Google, were not only misleading, they had been charged with crimes.In a series of phone calls and a meeting in Washington, D.C., Mr. Williams presented the company his research. He highlighted that some of the biggest buyers of ad words related to treatment had been accused of misdeeds related to insurance fraud and sexual assault.\u201cWe stumbled upon this issue organically,\u201d said Mr. Williams. \u201cAnd they heard us out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Hard Could It Be to Combine Two Apartments?", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe FixToy creep had already begun to take hold in the two-bedroom, one-bath apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Dara and Mike Dierks shared with their toddler, Julian. And with plans to add another family member soon, space was becoming a growing concern.\u201cWe started to look around to see what a three-bedroom would cost,\u201d said Mrs. Dierks, 36, a communications executive. (Mr. Dierks, 40, is a vice president at an entertainment and sports management company.) But they quickly realized that a three-bedroom with the amenities they already had \u2014 including a parking spot in the basement and an outdoor deck \u2014 was well beyond their budget. \u201cIt would have been over $2.5 million,\u201d Mrs. Dierks said. So when the apartment directly above their own went on the market in 2014 for $799,000, the couple nabbed it.Mrs. Dierks also had an ulterior motive. \u201cMy husband wanted to move to the suburbs,\u201d she said, and expanding into the upstairs apartment was a way to \u201ckeep him in the city as long as possible.\u201dWhile the Department of Buildings does not track combination units specifically, permitted alteration jobs in apartment buildings that result in a decrease in the total number of housing units available indicate a combination. There were 767 permits citywide for such alterations last year, up from 592 the year before; so far this year, 508 of these permits have been issued.\u201cI was terrified at first,\u201d Mrs. Dierks said of her combination project, noting that she and her husband decided to rent the second unit out for a while, work with a design firm to customize the space and take some time to find a rental to move into during construction.\u201cFinding a place to live during the renovations was nerve-racking,\u201d said Mrs. Dierks, who ultimately worked out a deal with a real estate agent to lease an apartment that was proving hard to sell. \u201cHe negotiated a six-month lease for us with the contingency that we would need to allow showings on a pretty regular basis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a win-win for both of us as the apartment was staged with our furniture, making the space look way more livable. They got rent, we got a short-term lease and they were able to sell it within three months.\u201dAfter the necessary permits were secured and the couple had been through several iterations of the layout \u2014 about six months later \u2014 demolition finally began. Construction to turn their two separate two-bedroom, one-bath apartments into a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath duplex lasted six months and cost $500,000.A large kitchen took the place of a significantly smaller kitchen and living area. They now have an island that seats six, and a pantry \u2014 \u201csomething I always wanted,\u201d Mrs. Dierks said. Down the hall, a half bath and spacious living room and dining area replaced the original bedrooms and full bathroom. Two sets of French doors open to the deck. A traditional staircase leads to the upstairs unit, now configured as three bedrooms and two baths, with a balcony off one of the bedrooms.\u201cThere\u2019s something about having stairs in an apartment in New York that feels special,\u201d said Ms. Zames, the designer. \u201cIt feels like a house or a home.\u201dBut adding a staircase also eats up a lot of space. To maximize every inch, Ms. Zames added storage: a walk-in toy closet beneath the stairs, with shelves to the ceiling and space for a reading nook. \u201cIt ended up being really fun,\u201d she said. \u201cLike Julian\u2019s special place.\u201dAnother bonus, Mrs. Dierks noted, is that \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t know that kids lived in our apartment unless you opened those doors.\u201dOther custom features include a shoe-storage bench near the entrance and a built-in oak credenza.\u201cSince the building was so small, we did get a few noise complaints,\u201d said Mrs. Dierks, who regularly emailed her neighbors to make sure they knew when \u201cloud\u201d days would be and bought lunch for the community health center that rented space directly beneath their apartment on those days. \u201cWe also kept our building\u2019s super informed on what work was happening what days, so he could be on site to supervise,\u201d she said.The family members moved into their expanded space nearly a year and a half after beginning the project. Less than three months later, their daughter, Sloane, was born.\u201cI\u2019m really grateful that we hired a designer to help us through every single phase of the project,\u201d Mrs. Dierks said, particularly given some of the hiccups they had to navigate along the way, including \u201cchanges that we had to make due to new inspection rules\u201d \u2014 installing different protectors around the recessed lights, for example, and figuring out where to put electricity in the kitchen island after a change in code.When everything was done, \u201cWe had a big housewarming party where we only invited the neighbors,\u201d Mrs. Dierks said. \u201cThey came in for brunch and got to see what it looked like and ask us questions.\u201dThree neighbors are now renovating their apartments, she said, but no one else has been able to buy a neighboring unit since the Dierks bought the place upstairs: \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone is kicking themselves for not buying it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New America, a Google-Funded Think Tank, Faces Backlash for Firing a Google Critic", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of an influential think tank funded by Google is grappling with a mounting backlash \u2014 including from her own scholars and donors \u2014 over the firing of a leading critic of the tech giant.Anne-Marie Slaughter, the president of the New America Foundation, pledged to re-examine her group\u2019s policies for dealing with donors while defending the organization\u2019s intellectual integrity. She also told the think tank\u2019s employees that New America was \u201cunder attack from many quarters,\u201d and warned that they should expect heightened scrutiny.But a group of the left-leaning think tank\u2019s current and former fellows was collecting signatures on a letter to be delivered next week to Ms. Slaughter and New America\u2019s directors, asserting that Ms. Slaughter\u2019s handling of the situation has jeopardized the think tank\u2019s reputation. Other scholars affiliated with the think tank were quietly comparing notes on past instances in which they contend she placed donors\u2019 interests over ideology.At issue is New America\u2019s firing on Wednesday of a scholar named Barry Lynn, and its exiling of his entire 10-person initiative, called Open Markets, which had been pushing for more rigorous antitrust enforcement against Google and other tech giants.Google officials \u2014 including its parent company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt \u2014 had complained about Open Markets multiple times. Their grievances could not be easily ignored. The company, Mr. Schmidt and his family\u2019s foundation had donated more than $21 million to New America since the think tank\u2019s founding in 1999, according to voluntary disclosures and tax filings.About two dozen journalists and scholars who have participated in the organization\u2019s fellowship programs expressed interest in signing a letter that was circulating Friday warning that New America risks undermining itself if its work is influenced by donors\u2019 concerns.A draft of the letter reviewed by The Times faults New America\u2019s leadership for handling the situation in a secretive manner. It asserts that a more transparent accounting of the decision-making is necessary \u201cto assure us, and the outside world, that New America\u2019s work is truly independent, now and going forward. Nothing less than the integrity of the institution is at stake.\u201dShe also spoke by phone with the foundation\u2019s directors to explain what happened with Mr. Lynn and his initiative. Most members of the board either declined to comment or could not be reached.But some of New America\u2019s donors were unsettled by the news, according to an official at one foundation that donates to the think tank. \u201cWe were concerned because you want to let the grantees do their work without worrying about how it impacts the funders,\u201d said the foundation official.CAP\u2019s president, Neera Tanden, wrote to her staff on Wednesday afternoon that the episode serves as \u201ca good reminder that every institution\u2019s ability to impact the national debate is based on trust.\u201d Describing CAP\u2019s guidelines as dictating that \u201cthe financial interests of any donor shall have no influence over our policy work or the policy positions we support,\u201d Ms. Tanden wrote, \u201cWe never should come close to the line on these issues.\u201dMs. Slaughter, in an interview on Thursday night, said her conflict with Mr. Lynn had nothing to do with his ongoing tough criticism of Google. Rather, she said it stemmed from his repeated violations of the think tank\u2019s \u201cstrong implicit norms about providing a heads-up when you are doing something that could have an impact on the funding for your fellow directors.\u201dMr. Schmidt reached out to Ms. Slaughter to express displeasure with that statement, though Ms. Slaughter said \u201cGoogle did not at any point threaten our funding.\u201dAnd, while the statement was removed from the website and then reposted without explanation more than two hours later, Ms. Slaughter said that had nothing to do with Google. In fact, she said Mr. Schmidt didn\u2019t relay his displeasure to her until after the statement had been reposted.After the dust-up over the statement, Ms. Slaughter said she realized she had two options: try to keep the program, but replace Mr. Lynn as its director, or spin off the whole program.\u201cThere was no good way out of this,\u201d she said. She ultimately decided, with her board\u2019s signoff, to help establish Open Markets as a separate nonprofit. Those plans appeared to have buy-in from Mr. Lynn and were almost fully executed, Ms. Slaughter said.Ms. Slaughter said that Mr. Lynn violated that understanding by launching what she described in her Thursday night email to staff as \u201cdestructive attacks on us to advance his program\u2019s agenda.\u201dShe told the Times, \u201cBarry Lynn acted in bad faith, and you cannot have someone in your organization who you cannot trust.\u201d She fired Mr. Lynn on Wednesday after the Times article revealing the internal discord, in which Mr. Lynn accused Ms. Slaughter of caving to pressure from Google.In the wake of the Times article, others who have worked at New America highlighted different interactions in which they contended that Ms. Slaughter sided with donors \u2014 and prospective donors \u2014 over her own scholars and fellows.One such incident cited by several current and former New America staffers occurred in 2015, when Ann Marie Sastry, the president and chief executive officer of a Michigan-based advanced battery maker called Sakti3, reached out to Ms. Slaughter to suggest that she or Sakti3 might be interested in funding New America. But Ms. Sastry also expressed concern about an investigation of Sakti3 that was being pursued by Steve LeVine, a journalist who was then writing for Quartz and serving as a New America fellow.But the episode left some people who were aware of it feeling that Ms. Slaughter \u201cwas carrying the C.E.O.\u2019s water,\u201d according to one person familiar with it.Ms. Slaughter later apologized to Mr. LeVine for intervening. Representatives for Quartz and Sakti3 declined to comment on the episode.Ms. Slaughter told The Times on Thursday \u201cI got played and I learned my lesson.\u201dShe argued that the situation with Google and Mr. Lynn was not at all analogous. Still, she acknowledged that the pursuit of corporate funding can complicate things for think tanks that will sometimes take stances with which corporate donors may disagree.\u201cThere are unavoidable tensions the minute you take corporation funding or foreign government funding,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the fact is that it\u2019s very difficult to run a think tank these days with just foundation funding.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Everson was there to extol the potential of video advertising on Facebook site and its apps during the annual industry confab known as Advertising Week New York.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better example of what happens when you have power of community and the combination of scaled global platforms than what happened recently with the hurricane,\u201d Ms. Everson said.Absent from Ms. Everson\u2019s presentation \u2014 and others that Facebook executives used to urge advertisers to spend more on apps like Instagram and Facebook Messenger \u2014 was any discussion of the recent crises the social network has been grappling with: the misuse of its ad tools.\u201cSometimes our industry gets so enamored with new things that we lose sight of unintended consequences,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cData and personalization is one of those things. It can be used for phenomenal targeting of potential consumers to buy cookies, toys and book hotel rooms, but it also can be used to target hate groups and inspire nefarious outcomes.\u201dShe added, \u201cWhether they like it or not, media companies have a tremendous responsibility to protect the public from itself.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any clients question their investments in Facebook in response to the news, and I think the main reason for that is that no brands were directly or indirectly harmed by this activity,\u201d said Aaron Shapiro, chief executive of the digital ad agency Huge. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something the marketing community is monitoring very carefully, because certainly, if it becomes a big enough issue where public association with Facebook starts to become negative, that\u2019s a totally different story where advertisers would have to pay attention.\u201dRaja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer of Mastercard, said that although he was confident that digital platforms would do their best to fix their issues, their unparalleled size made the point essentially moot. \u201cI cannot block them off and say I don\u2019t want to deal with them anymore because they\u2019ve got a huge reach and that reach matters to me and it is very economical reach, too,\u201d he said of Facebook.Still, it is very likely that Facebook \u2014 and Google \u2014 will need to do more to show advertisers that they are policing abuse and that their ads actually deliver.\u201cThe burden of proof that they are effective rises with every misstep on the social or political spectrum,\u201d said Rob Norman, the chief digital officer of GroupM, the media-buying arm of the ad giant WPP.Google and Facebook are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly\u201d within the ad industry; the research firm eMarketer projects that the two companies will collectively take in 63 percent of all digital ad investments in the United States this year.Mr. Norman raised regulation as a possibility that could affect the dominance of the companies. He mused about the possibility of regulators saying \u201cthat targeted advertising of cohorts of let\u2019s say, less than a million people, is now illegal.\u201d A regulator could potentially argue that \u201cthe moment you can get it down to incredibly granular population groups, that\u2019s where the bad actions start to take place,\u201d he said.There are also questions around how Facebook will handle disclosure of ads, for political and nonpolitical causes, going forward.While advertising has \u201cperennially been misused in political campaigns,\u201d the anonymity associated with the Russian ads on Facebook makes it newly dangerous, said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and partner of the agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.\u201cWhat would stop any of our clients from going out and doing this now?\u201d Mr. Goodby said. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility to just go out there and flood social media with things that are anonymous, seemingly innocent expressions of opinion, which is what we\u2019re addicted to. But it\u2019s interesting to think about what happens if we\u2019re being manipulated by that \u2014 the very thing we\u2019re addicted to suddenly becomes like a heroin, it hurts us suddenly, people use it against us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She stressed that other projects were moving forward, but said, \u201cthis leaves a big hole for the park to fill and deals a blow to so many in the neighborhood and the city who were looking forward to enjoying the pier.\u201dLike Mr. Diller, Ms. Wils blamed a \u201csmall handful of people\u201d for their role in derailing \u201ca project with such broad community support.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo said it was \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that a project with the \u201cpotential to have a positive and lasting impact on the state is not moving forward at this time.\u201dHudson River Park, a series of piers and upland areas running from Chambers to West 59th Streets, was created in 1998 under Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both Republicans, in what was hailed as an innovative city-state partnership. The idea was to transform the largely derelict Hudson River waterfront into a continuous strip of green, with a bicycle path and piers for recreation. The city and the state would finance its construction, but the park would be maintained with revenue from commercial development within its borders.Building a park largely atop piers has proved complex and costly, however, with maintenance of existing structures a constant battle.One of the commercial piers intended to generate revenue for the park is Pier 40, a popular athletic complex with commercial parking for 1,800 cars at the foot of Houston Street. But instead of creating revenue Pier 40 has turned into a drain on the park\u2019s finances, with its 3,500 corroded steel pilings in need of $100 million in repairs.Diller Island promised to bring a dose of celebrity and sex appeal to the park. The idea was to replace the decaying Pier 54, which was closed after it started to collapse, with a high-profile, high-design project. (The shuttered 875-foot pier was where survivors of the Titanic were brought in 1912.)\u201cI always thought that it was a very generous offer,\u201d she said Thursday, referring to Mr. Diller\u2019s gift. But, she said, \u201cI thought that a new pier in a sensitive part of the estuary in days of climate change was very wrong headed. I was also concerned that large private money resulting in the control of design and programming was not a particularly democratic notion.\u201dElsewhere in the park, construction is scheduled to begin next year on Pier 26, between North Moore and Hubert Street in TriBeCa, with lawns, native plantings, a small soccer field and two-story walkway. The trust will also create a wetland tidal pool next to the pier in the river for educational purposes.Advertisement"}

This means I can sign up for alerts to let me know when a film is going to be playing in the most convenient theater for me. When the most desirable option turns up, I buy my ticket \u2014 not that these movies are likely to sell out on a Thursday night or Friday morning, but you never know. It certainly helps me keep organized. FandangoNow is also useful when I need to research a sequel or some such thing.Fandango was founded in 2000; it was a start-up, backed by a group of movie exhibitors. In the intervening years, it was bought by Comcast, which now also owns NBCUniversal; Warner Bros. Entertainment has a minority ownership of Fandango as well. The movie-review aggregating site Rotten Tomatoes is part of Fandango\u2019s corporate family, as is the movie information app Flixster.FandangoNow started in April 2016. Adam Rockmore, Fandango\u2019s marketing chief, said the service necessarily retains its independence in spite of its lineage. \u201cWe just moved into a new office at the end of May, and it\u2019s completely separate from the other companies,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. \u201cWe have to serve all the studios and all the exhibitors and so it\u2019s important we operate in a discrete way. Similarly, we leave Rotten Tomatoes to do what they do.\u201dStill, Rotten Tomatoes is a presence on the FandangoNow site. You don\u2019t have to scroll down too far on the site\u2019s home page to find \u201c200 Essential Movies to Watch Now,\u201d touting several movies that received Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 \u201ccertified fresh\u201d scores; the top row of the movies offered from $1.99 up features \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201cThe Third Man,\u201d \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d and \u201cAll About Eve.\u201d In what may strike some as slightly paradoxical, this \u00e0 la carte site is actually doing more to promote classic film than Netflix. (In fairness to Netflix, which is more and more often being castigated for its indifference to classic film, the site never sold itself as a portal for any such thing.)FandangoNow, in addition to being a stand-alone video-on-demand transaction site, also wants to be \u201ca full movie-life-cycle marketer,\u201d as Mr. Rockmore put it. The ticketing site has an editorial component; on Fandango, the managing editor Erik Davis, whose numerous television appearances present him as an amiably gruff friendly neighborhood movie lover, contributes blog posts; on FandangoNow, Alicia Malone, whose book on women working in film, \u201cBackwards & In Heels,\u201d was published earlier this year, contributes an energetic indie movie guide.Fandango does remarkably well in the ticket-selling business. Its sales accounted for more than 25% of the opening weekend box office of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Blockbuster seasons aren\u2019t the only good time for the operation. During the coming awards season, Fandango and FandangoNow can promote Golden Globe and Oscar contenders both in theaters and beyond.

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Big Media Set to Get Bigger, With Help From Lawmakers", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Most of Australia\u2019s newspapers, radio stations and television broadcasters are controlled by only a handful of owners, like Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, making it one of the most concentrated media markets in the developed world.Soon, even more Australian media properties could be in fewer hands.New legislation backed by Australia\u2019s governing Liberal party would eliminate restrictions separating broadcast media from print and would allow media companies to own more outlets in a city. The legislation, which has cleared Australia\u2019s Senate and could come before the lower house of Parliament as soon as next month, is widely expected to pass.Media owners say the rules are relics of a less digital era. Like media companies around the world, Australia\u2019s newspaper and television station owners are contending with the rise of internet companies like Facebook and Google, which are drawing away advertising dollars, eyeballs and eardrums.But in an echo of debates raging in other countries, opponents say the changes would lead to a less diverse media market, with Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company among those likely to benefit the most. They also contend the legislation\u2019s backers are simply helping their political allies.\u201cWhat will happen is there will be consolidation of media and a progressive diminution of voices in the Australian media market,\u201d said Tim Dwyer, a professor specializing in media and communications at the University of Sydney.Australia\u2019s current media rules draw some limits. They forbid an owner from controlling a television station, radio broadcaster and newspaper in a single market. They also prevent a television network from broadcasting to more than three-quarters of the country\u2019s population.The rules date to the 1980s, when they were pushed by Paul Keating, then Australia\u2019s treasurer and later the prime minister, who famously said that a media owner could be the prince of print or queen of the screen, but not both.Today, Australia\u2019s princes and queens enjoy strong holds on their respective platforms.Properties of News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company, account for nearly two-thirds of newspaper circulation here and include major names like The Daily Telegraph and The Australian. Fairfax Media, an Australian company that owns The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review, accounts for nearly a quarter.In broadcast, Australia\u2019s main television network owners include Nine Network, Ten Network Holdings and Seven West Media, as well as two publicly funded television networks, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and SBS.But the digital era has eaten away at their strengths.Global media companies are also presenting tougher competition. In a move that surprised many Australians, the CBS Corporation, the American broadcaster, reached an agreement this month to buy Ten. It beat out a group that included Lachlan Murdoch, co-chairman of News Corp. and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s son.Australia\u2019s media companies argue that easing ownership limits will give them greater heft to compete with bigger, better-funded internet companies from abroad. The rule against broadcasters\u2019 reaching more than three-quarters of the population, for example, makes little sense in an era of streaming videos and online movies on demand, some argue.\u201cThese reforms are important,\u201d said Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp.\u2019s Asian and Australian operations, in a statement. \u201cThis finally addresses the restrictions that have held back the competitiveness of media companies in Australia for far too long.\u201dThat argument has won support from Malcolm Turnbull, Australia\u2019s prime minister, and his Liberal party. After the legislation passed the Senate, Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said in a statement, \u201cAustralian media companies will now be better placed to compete with the big online media companies from overseas.\u201dA number of experts said the legislation would do little to help media companies compete with the likes of Google. Instead, they said, it would help homegrown companies winnow out other local competitors.\u201cIt will lead to a greater concentration of power,\u201d said Denis Muller, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Center for Advancing Journalism.Opponents of the bill, many of them in the opposition Labor Party, consider it a favor to media owners like Mr. Murdoch, widely considered sympathetic to the conservative Liberal party.News Corp. newspapers offered \u201cunrelenting support and uncritical support\u201d for the Liberal party in last year\u2019s elections, Mr. Muller said.The critics also point to the government\u2019s recent decision to grant 30 million Australian dollars (about $23.6 million) to Fox Sports, a cable broadcaster owned by News Corp. Government officials \u2014 who said the grant was tied to the effort to overhaul media rules \u2014 said the money was intended to support women\u2019s sports, like Australia\u2019s women\u2019s national soccer team, which broadcasts its matches on Fox Sports.Asked about helping News Corp, Mr. Turnbull\u2019s communications officials said in a statement that the pending legislation is \u201cunabashedly pro-Australian voices and pro-Australian jobs.\u201d It added, \u201cThe Labor Party was and remains completely indifferent to a strong Australian media.\u201dThe Liberal party struck a number of deals to get the legislation passed. One senator, Nick Xenophon, successfully demanded additional initiatives, including a package of 60 million Australian dollars, or $47.2 million, to help small and regional publishers, allowing them, he said, to \u201chave a fighting chance to flourish.\u201dThe package has been criticized by Labor politicians as merely providing smaller outlets with equipment and doing nothing to sustain jobs.At Mr. Xenophon\u2019s urging under an additional initiative, the government has pledged to conduct an inquiry into the impact of Facebook and Google on advertising revenue.The Liberal party also struck a deal with the One Nation Party, a right-leaning party led by Pauline Hanson, who has long criticized coverage by Australia\u2019s public broadcasters. Under that agreement, government officials will put the content and practices of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation under greater scrutiny.\u201cWe\u2019re looking after the public\u2019s interest,\u201d Ms. Hanson said, \u201cin ensuring that they get a fair deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senator Berates Twitter Over \u2018Inadequate\u2019 Inquiry Into Russian Meddling", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A key senator investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election sharply criticized Twitter on Thursday for failing to aggressively investigate the Russian misuse of its platform after the company said it had largely limited its own inquiry to accounts linked to fraudulent profiles already identified by Facebook.The senator, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Twitter\u2019s briefing for congressional investigators \u201cvery disappointing,\u201d and accused company officials of ignoring extensive evidence of nefarious Russian activity.The company\u2019s presentation \u201cshowed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered,\u201d Mr. Warner said, adding, \u201cTheir response was frankly inadequate on every level.\u201dThe creators of the Facebook pages posed as American activists to spread disinformation and sow discord during the election season.Twitter identified only 22 accounts on its platform that were directly tied to the Russian Facebook pages and then discovered another 179 accounts that were \u201crelated or linked\u201d to the Facebook accounts. None were registered on the site as advertisers, the company said.Twitter did not immediately respond to Mr. Warner\u2019s criticism.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was more diplomatic about Twitter\u2019s briefing for House investigators, calling it \u201cgood, but preliminary.\u201d\u201cI think there is a great deal more that we need to know, a great deal more that Twitter needs to find out,\u201d he said. Mr. Schiff said Twitter faced greater difficulty in tracing accounts because its users provide less information than Facebook users when they sign up.\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think we have more than scratched the surface of our understanding of how the Russians may have used that platform,\u201d he said.Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s Republican chairman, would not answer questions about the briefing on Thursday, and his spokeswoman declined to comment. Mr. Warner said that he and Mr. Burr would hold a news conference as soon as next week to update the public on their investigation and try to draw attention to the continuing threat by foreign entities to the American political system.The cybersecurity company FireEye found hundreds of automated accounts linked to Russian hacking groups, which sent out messages critical of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats last year.Nor did Twitter address a web \u201cdashboard\u201d set up last month by researchers to track and compile statistics on 600 Twitter accounts that the researchers believe to be linked to the Russian government or to have a longstanding pattern of repeating its propaganda. The company\u2019s statement said nothing about still-functioning Twitter accounts of DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, which American intelligence officials identified last year as created by Russian agents to distribute emails and documents obtained by hacking.Mr. Warner said he was \u201cmore than a bit surprised in light of all of the public interest in this subject over the last few weeks that anyone from the Twitter team would think that the presentation they made to Senate staff today even began to answer the kinds of questions that we\u2019d asked.\u201dHe said the company had much more work to do.\u201cThis raises at an even greater level the necessity that the American public has the ability to know when they are seeing a political ad, who\u2019s behind it \u2014 particularly if it is being sponsored by foreign agents,\u201d he said.In its briefings for congressional investigators and its public statement, Twitter did not identify any of the suspect accounts by name. The company said it had suspended accounts that violated its terms of service, suggesting that it had allowed some of the Russia-linked accounts to continue to function.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has tracked suspected Russian activity on Twitter for several years, said the platform had proved especially vulnerable to abuse, in part because the company demands little information from users. Twitter was used for years by the Islamic State for propaganda and recruiting, though much of that activity has now been shut down.\u201cBad people can do what they want on this platform,\u201d said Mr. Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. \u201cI think they have real problems trying to trace the Russian activity.\u201dFacebook briefed the two intelligence committees on Sept. 6 and revealed that it had connected 470 profiles and pages to a shadowy Russian company with Kremlin links called the Internet Research Agency. It said the pages had placed 3,000 ads on Facebook costing about $100,000. It found another $50,000 in ads that it believed might have a Russian source.Mr. Warner said on Thursday that the committee was still waiting for Facebook to deliver a set of ads that it had identified. He said he expected the material to be delivered by early next week.The Senate committee has asked Google officials to come for a private briefing in the coming weeks, according to a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The committee has invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify on Nov. 1.The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it intended to hold its own public hearing with tech companies next month, but it has yet to announce a date.Advertisement"}

Bannon helped shape President Trump\u2019s nationalistic rhetoric that blamed China for economic woes in the United States.Now, less than a month after leaving the government, Mr. Bannon, the former chief strategist to Mr. Trump, has come to Hong Kong, at the invitation of a company controlled by the Chinese government, where he called President Xi Jinping of China a wise leader.Mr. Bannon dined on Tuesday with a small group of hedge fund managers and investors, and later gave a keynote address at a major investor conference, where he spoke about the rise of populism in places like the United States and the Philippines.CLSA would not say whether it had paid Mr. Bannon for his appearance. \u201cCLSA does not discuss any agreements that we might have with speakers,\u201d said Simone Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the firm.Over lunch in a private room at the Grissini restaurant in the Grand Hyatt hotel, overlooking Victoria Harbour, Mr. Bannon shared his insights on a range of topics \u2014 including the United States electoral system, immigration and the escalating conflict over North Korea \u2014 with a small group of investors, according to two people who were in attendance.The event was organized by CLSA for important clients of its brokerage business.During the lunch, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Bannon told the group that Mr. Trump had great respect for Mr. Xi and felt that the two leaders could find a solution to the North Korea crisis, according to the two investors in attendance, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.In his keynote address, in a crowded Grand Hyatt ballroom, Mr. Bannon discussed economic nationalism in the United States and its spread across the globe, including in Britain. He called the U.K. Independence Party, which pushed successfully last year for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, a professional version of the Tea Party movement in the United States, according to one audience member. The address was closed to the news media.Some people in the audience left with the impression that Mr. Bannon, though no longer in the White House, still had direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. At one point, he joked that there were White House officials who felt, as he did, that Facebook and Google should be public utilities. Several attendees expressed surprise that Mr. Bannon was so articulate.Mr. Bannon has not been shy about his views on China. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that was broadcast on Sunday, Mr. Bannon said that the United States needed to take a tougher stance against Beijing. He said that China was \u201cat economic war with the U.S.\u201d and that it was Washington\u2019s turn to respond.During Tuesday\u2019s events, Mr. Bannon seemed more subdued about the purported Chinese threat, talking more broadly about global trade imbalance, according to people in attendance.While it was Mr. Bannon\u2019s first trip to Hong Kong since leaving the White House, it was not his first time in the city.A former Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Bannon in 2005 helped secure $60 million in funding for Internet Gaming Entertainment, a company based in Hong Kong, from investors including Goldman Sachs, according to a new book by Joshua Green, a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter.According to Mr. Green\u2019s book, the company got its start by hiring Chinese workers at low wages to play World of Warcraft, the online multiplayer fantasy game, earning points that could be traded for virtual goods, which would then be resold to players for real money.Advertisement"}

Corporations such as Amazon and Google are only among the latest in a long line of corporations that have tried to influence students via their teachers. They benefit from decades of policies that have systematically underfunded and inequitably funded schools and that have placed an almost religious faith in the role of technology in education.We have no doubt about the dedication of Kayla Delzer, a third-grade teacher profiled in your article, to her students. The fact that she spends time hustling for funds and products is a direct result of policy decisions made in Washington and in statehouses across the country that have driven countless schools to desperation.It seems clear to us that she and other corporate-sponsored \u201cteacher ambassadors\u201d have a conflict of interest. Sadly, it appears that it is their dedication to their students that leads them to do the corporations\u2019 bidding. Ms. Delzer\u2019s efforts may benefit her students, though that is by no means assured. What is clear is that Ms. Delzer is helping to reinforce a status quo that places corporate interests instead of students at the center of education reform.The writers are, respectively, a research associate and a research professor at the National Education Policy Center, University of Colorado Boulder. To the Editor:I don\u2019t question the motives of Kayla Delzer. I believe that she honestly believes in all the products she is using in her classroom. The majority of teachers I have worked with in my 14 years in education are sincerely interested in finding any resources that work for their students. But determining what works for your students can be a very subjective evaluation.For all the money being spent by school districts on technology for students, there is a shocking lack of data to prove that this spending is yielding any benefit over traditional methods, as your article points out. In spite of this lack of data, technology spending by school districts seems to grow every year. And teachers like Ms. Delzer are celebrated not just for the particular product they are using, and endorse, but just for using technology in general.President Eisenhower warned us of the emergence of the military-industrial complex. I fear that the information-technology-industrial complex has taken hold in public education.NOEL CHANG, HOUSTONThe writer is a high school teacher. To the Editor:Companies give freebies to teacher influencers with the expectation that their school districts will buy something. What happens, though, when other teachers want freebies or when schools need to upgrade these freebie technologies, and money is not available? Funding teaching materials in such a haphazard manner is not efficient, nor can it be easily replicated in other contexts.There\u2019s a better way. Classroom grant programs from foundations, public entities and even some corporations can provide teachers funding that is free of the kind of influence peddling described in the article. Teachers who write successful grants through such programs have the power to spend the money on items and activities they want, not what corporate sponsors would like them to buy. In addition, a key part of most grant applications is the plan for sustainability and replicability.

It turns out it probably altered yours, too.In the early days, it was the simple things that were magical.The internet in your pocket. Connectivity at all times \u2014 news, baseball scores, recipes. (How innocent we were.)These sound like little things. But the collective weight of these tiny conveniences added up to something I almost couldn\u2019t live without.Almost. I returned the first iPhone three weeks after buying it.Its camera wasn\u2019t great. It didn\u2019t have the App Store. It worked on just one carrier. It cost $599. It was slow \u2014 very, very slow.Still, in those long moments it took to load a web page, you could see the whole future laid out before you: If they could get this right, if they could turn this into a general-purpose everywhere computer, it could change everything.The speed of the internet was vastly improved in the second one. The connected-everywhere promise was becoming something of a reality.And, despite Steve Jobs\u2019 early objections, Apple created its App Store.And apps could do things no other gadgets could do. Before the App Store, a song could come on the radio and you\u2019d have no way of figuring out what it was. Now you Shazam\u2019d it.Today, a lot of what you use on the iPhone is made by other people.These phones also knew where you were in the world, thanks to GPS. You could use maps in real time to get around. But GPS would eventually lead to so much more: Uber, Tinder, a scrapbook of photos on a map.The price was also right.AT&T, the only carrier offering it at the time, sold the new phone with a subsidy.$199. Almost too good to pass up if you could afford it.It created a dynamic that would turn the iPhone into the world\u2019s most profitable product \u2014 a luxury device at a mainstream price.The iPhone 4 changed that. The first iPhone with a camera on its front, it let you take good-looking pictures of yourself.The phenomenon became agonizing to parents, and irresistible to everyone else.Snapchat was released a year later, in 2011. So was iCloud, Apple\u2019s backup storage service.The collection of these technologies \u2014 selfie cameras, photo chatting, hackable online backups \u2014 would rock people\u2019s lives.And remember Anthony Weiner?She didn\u2019t sound like Rosie from \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d She was personable, and even tried to make jokes.She was Siri, the first robotic assistant that most of us encountered.But she quickly disappointed. She didn\u2019t seem very smart. She wasn\u2019t very useful. She was slow and unreliable. She misheard you.In time, she was eclipsed. Now there\u2019s Alexa and Google Now. Siri has felt stuck in the past.The iPhone 5 carried a bigger screen stuffed into a brushed aluminum enclosure. There was often no purer joy than simply holding it in your hand.Design-wise, the iPhone has gone downhill ever since.But the iPhone 5 wasn\u2019t just about design. It\u2019s when the iPhone grew up.And the iPhone got fast. Really fast. Carriers began handling more and more data. Everyone underestimated how all this would change the world.Then we started to see it: Our social media feeds, which have become the main way we encountered news, filled up with photos, videos and live broadcasts snapped on phones.By the end of 2013, Apple had sold nearly 500 million iPhones. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the time that people were sending two billion messages a day on iPhones and other devices running its mobile operating system.A few years earlier, Samsung created a laughably huge phone, the Galaxy Note. It turned out to be a huge seller.So Apple did something radical, and obvious: It made bigger phones. They sold sold amazingly well, and Apple\u2019s stock shot up.But its decision to copy its rivals on size felt like a new turn in its history. It marked a stepping back from the vanguard.Apple\u2019s phones are still the best you can buy. They still pack some of the most innovative features on the market. But they\u2019re not all that much better. Which phone you buy now feels like a matter of personal taste, rather than a judgment on product quality alone.For the iPhone to continue to be the iPhone, the trend-setting device of a generation, Apple has to do something big.It does away with the Home button, it unlocks with facial recognition and it can animate your facial gestures onto piles of poo.But is it the next big thing? Check back in a decade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Prepares to Brief Congress on Its Role in Election", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google has become the latest Silicon Valley giant to become entangled in a widening investigation into how online social networks and technology products may have played a role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.On Friday evening, Google said it would cooperate with congressional inquiries into the election, days after Facebook and Twitter provided evidence to investigators of accounts on their networks that were linked to Russian groups. Google was called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Google has also begun an internal investigation into whether its advertising products and services were used as part of a Russia-linked influence campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the issue. Exactly when the inquiry began is not known, but it has been discussed inside Google over recent weeks, the person said.Google\u2019s search engine, with about a 90 percent market share, is an inescapable part of the internet, so it was no surprise that congressional investigators turned toward the company. Google is the only company that sells more digital advertising than Facebook, and its YouTube service is the go-to place for videos on the internet.On Thursday, Twitter said in a closed-door briefing for the Senate and House intelligence panels that it had found about 200 accounts \u2014 a fraction of the number of potentially compromised accounts found by outside researchers \u2014 that appeared to be linked to a Russian campaign to influence the election.What direction the congressional investigation into Google will take is not clear. Google is much larger than Facebook or Twitter, and it has a wide range of services that played a role in the dissemination of so-called fake news during the campaign.But it is not a social network like Facebook or Twitter, making it harder for blatantly untrue stories to catch on, or for public sentiment to be stirred up through carefully targeted posts.Google has, however, long dealt with people trying to game its search engine to highlight misleading information or use its AdSense advertising network to finance eye-catching but false news stories. YouTube is also fertile ground for offensive videos and misleading news stories.\u201cWe will of course cooperate with inquiries; we\u2019re looking into how we can help with any relevant information,\u201d Google said in a statement late Friday.Similar to the way content that receives more attention is often more heavily promoted on Facebook and Twitter, Google\u2019s search engine gives more weight to results that are more frequently clicked on. It is one of hundreds of factors that go into ranking links.The company has also been working on shutting access to AdSense for sites that spread misinformation. Google\u2019s ad network is widely used by other websites and is often their only source of revenue. AdSense allows marketers to target users by different criteria, but it does not offer the same detail as Facebook, which can slice and dice its audience by their interests, including political leanings.In late January, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from AdSense \u2014 a tiny number compared to the more than two million publishers registered on AdSense.At the time, Google said it reviewed 550 sites \u201csuspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations\u201d in November and December and took action against 340 of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Hack Your Brain (for $5,000)", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEDEN, Utah \u2014 One morning last month a group of roughly 60 people, including doctors, C.E.O.s and internet entrepreneurs, gathered under a big white dome to hear the mission statement of their host, a 45-year-old man named Jamie Wheal.Sinewy and tanned from a life of outdoor pursuits, Mr. Wheal was offering attendees the chance to \u201cupgrade\u201d their nervous systems to meet this incontrovertible information overload. How? With \u201cflow.\u201dBut what is flow?Mr. Wheal has taken a somewhat brisker, more commercial approach. He has advised members of the United States Navy Special Operations, top-ranked athletes and executives of technology companies on \u201coptimizing performance\u201d through flow, receiving six-figure fees for some of his consultations.Mr. Wheal, who said his father was a test pilot for the British royal navy, came to the United States from England at age 8 and speaks rapidly in a mash-up accent, dropping idiosyncratic phrases and erudite references to the Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky, to Cincinnatus and Aldous Huxley. At moments he is given to phrases that are not immediately comprehensible, like \u201cWe are broaching the possibility of midwifing humanity into the infinite game.\u201dBut his larger message came through clearly. In our digital age, loud with bottom-feeder commentary, the ping of incoming emails and bleating social media, the pursuit of flow is all the more urgent.\u201cHonestly, have we abdicated our purpose just because of these insistent micro asks?\u201d Mr. Wheal said. \u201cHave we just completely ceded our center, completely ceded clarity, and it was all just based on 20-something bro-grammers trying to crack our attention spans?\u201dTo fulfill his flow-finding mission, Mr. Wheal wants to bring what he calls his Dojo Domes to locations around the world. Next year, he and his partners hope to build a one-million-square-foot complex in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a medical emphasis, combining brain-imaging technology with simpler equipment.It was his book, \u201cStealing Fire,\u201d written with Mr. Kotler and published earlier this year, that attracted many of the flow campers to Utah. In it, Mr. Wheal and Mr. Kotler consider the question of peak human performance, describing how so many powerful companies and individuals are now trying to optimize their own brains, in ways both legal and illegal.They offer case studies from the Navy SEALs and Google, arguing that what the world today faces \u201cwicked problems,\u201d unprecedented and complex, that require creative solutions, the kinds that are most likely to come not from staid meetings in conference rooms but rather from \u201cnon-ordinary states.\u201d\u201cFlow,\u201d they write, is associated with six neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, norepinephrine, anandamide and endorphins. Knowing the neurochemical profile of flow means, in theory, people can devise ways of achieving it more often, more reliably and more quickly.The new generation of flowsters are excited, perhaps, that using the advances of neuroscience, they might not have to meditate every day for 10 years to gain access to these layers of their brains.\u201cThis was a significant investment of time and money for me \u2014 this tells you how compelled I was to come here,\u201d said Alexandre Lang-Willar. At 28, Mr. Lang-Willar is in some ways the embodiment of Mr. Wheal\u2019s target demographic: the high achiever who grasps the brass ring, only to discover he craves something more. Mr. Lang-Willar quit his job as a Goldman Sachs analyst and has created a dating app with his father called \u201cInvite and Meet,\u201d centered on live activities, that will be introduced later this year.Reading \u201cStealing Fire,\u201d Mr. Lang-Willar said, he became convinced that nothing less than a \u201ccultural awakening\u201d was underway.By 8 a.m. each morning, the flow campers lay prone and shoeless in the Dojo Dome, moving back and forth on brightly colored foam rollers. Other daily activities included balancing and bouncing on big yellow balls; acro-yoga, in which partners learn to lift each other in the air; and strapping into special contraptions, like Mr. Wheal\u2019s 360 Swing, which allows those courageous enough to propel themselves, standing up, all the way around the swing\u2019s axle in a complete loop.All of these undertakings were in the service of honing a crucial element in flow, what Mr. Wheal refers to as \u201cembodied cognition\u201d: integrating our whole minds and bodies through specific exercise, based on the science showing that physical movement directly affects how we think and feel.\u201cThey are tapping into spiritual intelligence that before now was only really talked about in a religious context,\u201d Kristen Ulmer said, sitting outside the Dojo Dome one morning. Ms. Ulmer, formerly the top ranked extreme skier in the world, has also written a book, \u201cThe Art of Fear.\u201dShe went on: \u201cA lot more people are saying they\u2019re spiritual but not religious \u2014 but what does that really mean? I would say sports and movement are the most oft way we access a spiritual experience and transcend our ego, but they\u2019re the least discussed and least understood.\u201dOn the third night of camp, attendees gathered in the Dojo Dome for a night of heavy breathing. On their backs, as the lights changed colors and music pulsed from the speakers, they practiced a technique developed by the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, involving intense hyperventilation for 15 minutes. People were transported into altered states, gyrating their pelvises, bursting into peals of unrestrained, almost feral laughter, even leaping to their feet to dance.The group had succeeded, Mr. Wheal announced afterward, in \u201cdefragging our nervous systems.\u201dIn addition to exercise, lectures and breathing, there were some fairly X-rated activities on the program. One evening after dinner, Mr. Wheal spoke about a set of sexual practices that he has found particularly effective for transporting oneself well outside of humdrum daily rhythms. (They are further detailed in a chapter of \u201cStealing Fire\u201d called \u201cTaking the Kink out of Kinky.\u201d)All of these are what Mr. Wheal calls, apologetically, \u201chacks\u201d: techniques for busting out of the overwhelmed modern condition into a place of creativity, passion, focus, tranquillity, vitality and self-refinement.\u201cThe genius of what we\u2019re doing here is we\u2019re combining ideas about how to get into flow with actually doing physical things to experience it,\u201d said Kora Kinard, 29, an orgasmic meditation practitioner from San Francisco who attended. \u201cThe flow state and the orgasm state are very connected.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Wheal, having wearied somewhat of the term \u201cflow,\u201d prefers \u201cecstasis,\u201d an ancient Greek term for \u201cstepping beyond oneself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a giant irony of my life that everyone wants to come and talk to me about flow and I have no interest in having that conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be hemmed in.\u201dThe neuro-chemicals that define flow or ecstasis are powerfully alluring, and Mr. Wheal warned they are not always used for good. He argues, for instance, that Donald J. Trump instinctively knew how to manipulate them in gathering support for his presidency.\u201cTrump hacked ecstasis,\u201d Mr. Wheal said. \u201cLight, sound, movement, repetition, scapegoating the other. People said if you haven\u2019t been to his rallies, you\u2019re missing what\u2019s actually happening in this movement. And what does Hillary say? \u2018I\u2019ve got a policy binder.\u2019 While Trump pulled all the strings.\u201dPolitics aside, Mr. Wheal suggests that we seek daily not a fleeting non-ordinary hour or two, but rather, a permanently altered mind-set. A trait, not a state, a means of incorporating these methods into our lives so that flow, or ecstasis, is threaded through all our months and years.Flow camp ended with a shoeless closing ceremony, with participants sitting cross-legged in a circle passing a tiny sculpture of Tara, the female Bodhisattva, from person to person and sharing memories of their experiences that week. The room was thick with emotion and warmth.But the last thing Mr. Wheal wants to produce, he said, are more \u201cbliss junkies and epiphany whores,\u201d for whom he reserves a particular antipathy. It\u2019s not enough, in other words, to eat magic mushrooms, experience oneness with nature and humanity, cuddle a Buddha statue and then go right back to how things were.Or, for that matter, to parachute into Burning Man \u2014 where many of the flow campers were heading next \u2014 melt down your ego on the playa, and then fail to integrate the experience into the rest of your life.\u201cEveryone lines up for the peak experience,\u201d Mr. Wheal said. \u201cBut no one does their push-ups on Monday morning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Sued by 3 Female Ex-Employees Who Say It Pays Women Less Than Men", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Three women who worked at Google are suing the company over its salary practices, accusing the search giant of discriminating against its female employees by systematically paying them less than men who do similar jobs.In the suit, which was filed Tuesday in California Superior Court in San Francisco, the plaintiffs say Google knew or should have known about the pay disparity between men and women at the company, but failed to take action to rectify it.\u201cWhile Google has been an industry-leading tech innovator, its treatment of female employees has not entered the 21st century,\u201d said Kelly M. Dermody of the law firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the suit. \u201cThis case seeks to ensure fairness for women at Google.\u201dCritics have argued that Google and other powerful technology companies have not done enough to level the playing field for women, especially in terms of elevating them to leadership and key engineering roles.Gina Scigliano, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company was reviewing the suit, but added that \u201cwe disagree with the central allegations.\u201d Job levels and promotions at Google, she said, are determined through a rigorous process that includes checks to ensure there that no gender bias figured in decisions.The suit comes after a contentious fight with the Labor Department over a routine audit of Google\u2019s pay practices. Google is subject to Labor Department oversight as a federal contractor that sells advertising and internet services to the government.At a hearing this year, a department official said the audit had found \u201csystemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire work force, \u201d although Google has not officially been accused of any wrongdoing.Google said the data painted an incomplete picture of how its workers are paid, because it did not take into account different roles at the company, job performance and where the employees are based. Based on its own January 2017 analysis, Google said that, accounting for factors like tenure, job role and performance, female employees earned 99.7 cents to every dollar earned by men.In the suit, Kelly Ellis, a former Google software engineer and one of the three plaintiffs, says that when the company hired her in 2010, she was brought in as a Level 3 employee \u2014 a term for entry-level software engineers who are new college graduates \u2014 despite having four years of work experience.Within a few weeks of her hiring, the suit says, Google hired a male engineer onto her team who, like Ms. Ellis, had graduated from college four years earlier. But, the suit says, he was hired as a Level 4 employee, meaning he was paid a higher salary and had more opportunities for bonuses, raises and stock compensation. The suit says that other men on Ms. Ellis\u2019s team whose qualifications were equal to or less than hers were also brought in at Level 4.Google also segregated by roles within its engineering ranks, the suit says. Ms. Ellis had experience as a back-end engineer \u2014 a job that involves managing large systems like servers and databases \u2014 but was assigned to a front-end engineering role dealing with parts of a service that users interact with.A second plaintiff, Holly Pease, who worked at Google for 11 years and left in 2016, says in the suit that she was denied opportunities to gain status as a \u201ctechnical\u201d employee. Such employees earn more than nontechnical employees. She did not gain that status, despite having more than 10 years of experience as a network engineer and managing a Google team made up mostly of technical staff members.The suit cites the Labor Department\u2019s review of compensation data for all 21,000 employees at Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters for 2015, which found that the pay disparity between men and women was significant enough that there was \u201ca one in 100 million chance\u201d that it was occurring by chance.Google and the Labor Department are battling in court over how much data the company needs to hand over as part of a review of its pay practices.Google said it had already handed over 1.7 million data points and 329,000 documents as part of the inquiry and that the Labor Department was overreaching in its requests for more information. An administrative law judge ruled in July that Google had to hand over some data, although not as much as the Labor Department sought.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brevity Is the Soul of Twit", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBack in Twitter\u2019s early days, there was a lot of parodying what would come next. My favorite was Flutter, 26 characters \u2014 one for each letter of the alphabet \u2014 marking the brave, new world of nanoblogging.Compared to other social media platforms, Twitter\u2019s flirtation with 280 characters is hardly indulgent. The character limit for a Facebook status is 63,206. That number was difficult to type, let alone fathom. It\u2019s no wonder that Facebook posts end up being fully unhinged rants, diatribes, soapboxes, pleas, meltdowns and valedictorian speeches. We all have those people in our newsfeed who can\u2019t express a thought without multiple paragraphs and a subtext, even if that subtext is just \u201cI don\u2019t care that much about keeping this administrative temp job.\u201dEven though Instagram chiefly trades in photos and videos, it allows for 2,200 characters on posts. Somewhere, the New Yorker cartoon caption contest just shuddered. Even the oft-mocked LinkedIn allows for a bounteous 600 characters to provide alluring professional updates that beckon like sirens to potential networking contacts.When you post a rant on Twitter, it\u2019s pre-masticated into pull quotes, and fed to you, the reader, baby bird-style. It\u2019s almost as if the person\u2019s argument is buffering, until you get to the next installment. The medium forces one to stick to the point.According to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey (@jack), the original 140-character-limit was arbitrary \u2014 a slight shortening of the 160-character SMS limit. But the reason so many of us loved the app was that it was, from its inception, a celebration of something people on the internet generally do very poorly: self-editing.Sure, it was met with derision at first by English professors and \u201cinfluencers.\u201d We were told it marked the demise of the written word, that in a generation we\u2019d all devolve into illiterate cave men. What are you even supposed to share in 140 characters? What you had for lunch? For some reason, this example frequently came up when people justified why they refused to join Twitter at first. \u201cOh, Twitter\u2019s not for me. I don\u2019t get it. What do I write? That I\u2019m eating a sandwich?\u201d Well, if that\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you decide what to share with the world, then yeah, sure, maybe hold off.At a fundamental level, humans love short bursts of repetition, at least going by the popularity of the GIF, and similarly, the hallmark of a solid tweet is something that can be read over and over, yet maintain the inherent gravity, beauty, or humor of its initial transmission.At the risk of comparing yet another thing to jazz, Twitter has always been the jazz of the internet. It\u2019s just as much about what you can\u2019t fit as what you can.In a world where people can\u2019t stop railing about free speech while simultaneously, indirectly undermining their own arguments, there is a certain value in enforcing limits. If anything, Twitter has erred on the side of giving abuse and vitriol an overly generous sounding board. Imagine if all those trolls had 280 characters.One-hundred-and-forty characters is all a person needs. Well, that and the mute button.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Push for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say It\u2019s Gone Too Far", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "After revelations of harassment and bias in Silicon Valley, a backlash is growing against the women in tech movement.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Their complaints flow on Reddit forums, on video game message boards, on private Facebook pages and across Twitter. They argue for everything from male separatism to an end to gender diversity efforts.Silicon Valley has for years accommodated a fringe element of men who say women are ruining the tech world.One of those who said there had been a change is James Altizer, an engineer at the chip maker Nvidia. Mr. Altizer, 52, said he had realized a few years ago that feminists in Silicon Valley had formed a cabal whose goal was to subjugate men. At the time, he said, he was one of the few with that view.Now Mr. Altizer said he was less alone. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few people going through that in Silicon Valley right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploding. It\u2019s mostly young men, younger than me.\u201dMr. Altizer said that a gathering he hosts in person and online to discuss men\u2019s issues had grown by a few dozen members this year to more than 200, that the private Facebook pages he frequents on men\u2019s rights were gaining new members and that a radical subculture calling for total male separatism was emerging.\u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d he said in a phone interview, contending men are being fired by \u201cdangerous\u201d human resources departments. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a soundproof booth right now because I\u2019m afraid someone will hear me. When you\u2019re discussing gender issues, it\u2019s almost religious, the response. It\u2019s almost zealotry.\u201dMr. Altizer is part of a backlash against the women in technology movement. While many in the tech industry had previously dismissed the fringe men\u2019s rights arguments, some investors, executives and engineers are now listening. Though studies and surveys show there is no denying the travails women face in the male-dominated industry, some said that the line for what counted as harassment had become too easy to cross and that the push for gender parity was too extreme a goal. Few were willing to talk openly about their thinking, for fear of standing out in largely progressive Silicon Valley.Even so, \u201cwitch hunt\u201d is the new whispered meme. Some in tech have started identifying as \u201ccontrarians,\u201d to indicate subtly that they do not follow the \u201cdiversity dogma.\u201d And self-described men\u2019s rights activists in Silicon Valley said their numbers at meetings were rising.Others are playing down the women-in-tech issue. Onstage at a recent event, the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said harassment in Silicon Valley was \u201crarer than in most other businesses.\u201dMany men now feel like \u201cthere\u2019s a gun to the head\u201d to be better about gender issues, said Rebecca Lynn, a venture capitalist at Canvas Ventures, and while \u201cthere\u2019s a high awareness right now, which is positive, at the same time there\u2019s a fear.\u201d\u201cIn just the last 48 hours, I\u2019ve spoken to a female tech executive who was grabbed by a male C.E.O. at a large event and another female executive who was asked to interview at a venture fund because they \u2018feel like they need to hire a woman,\u2019\u201d said Dick Costolo, the former chief of Twitter, who now runs the fitness start-up Chorus. \u201cWe should worry about whether the women-in-tech movement has gone too far sometime after a couple of these aren\u2019t regularly happening anymore.\u201dAfter months of apologizing by Silicon Valley for bad behavior, here was a young man whom some in tech\u2019s leadership could potentially get behind.Paul Graham, who founded an influential start-up incubator, Y Combinator, posted two articles about how the science behind Mr. Damore\u2019s memo was accurate. Another start-up investor, John Durant, wrote that \u201cCharles Darwin himself would be fired from Google for his views on the sexes.\u201dAnd the investor Peter Thiel\u2019s business partner, Eric Weinstein, tweeted, \u201cDear @Google, Stop teaching my girl that her path to financial freedom lies not in coding but in complaining to HR.\u201dMr. Durant declined to comment. Mr. Graham said in an email that there needed to be more distinction between fact and policy, and Mr. Weinstein said there was \u201ca sea of brilliant women\u201d and that more needed to be done to \u201cfigure out how to more fully empower them.\u201dNow men\u2019s rights advocates in Silicon Valley have galvanized.\u201cWhat Google did was wake up sectors of society that weren\u2019t into these issues before,\u201d said Paul Elam, who runs A Voice for Men, a men\u2019s rights group. He said his organization had seen more interest from people in Silicon Valley.Silicon Valley has always been a men\u2019s space, others said. Warren Farrell, who lives in Marin County, Calif., and whose 1993 book, \u201cThe Myth of Male Power,\u201d birthed the modern men\u2019s rights movement, said, \u201cThe less safe the environment is for men, the more they will seek little pods of safety like the tech world.\u201dThis turn in the gender conversation is good news for Mr. Damore. \u201cThe emperor is naked,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSince someone said it, now it\u2019s become sort of acceptable.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe whole idea that diversity improves workplace output, it\u2019s not scientifically decided that that\u2019s true.\u201dMr. Damore filed a labor complaint against Google in August and said more than 20 people had reached out about joining together for a class-action suit about systemic discrimination against men. He is represented by Harmeet Dhillon, a local firebrand lawyer.\u201cIt\u2019s become fashionable in Silicon Valley for people like James, a white man, to be put into a category of less desirable for promotion and advancement,\u201d Ms. Dhillon said. \u201cSome companies have hiring goals like \u2018We\u2019ll give you a bonus if you\u2019re a hiring manager and you hire 70 percent women to this organization.\u2019 That\u2019s illegal.\u201dGoogle declined to comment.\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a mission from God to set the world straight, it\u2019s easy to go too far,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cThere was no control over women hiring women.\u201dHe said that his clients, Greg Anderson and Scott Ard, had faced gender discrimination in Yahoo\u2019s media teams and that other teams like cars were headed by women, which to Mr. Parsons was a sign of problems.\u201cNo eyebrows are going to rise if a woman heads up fashion,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cBut we\u2019re talking about women staffing positions \u2014 things like autos \u2014 where it cannot be explained other than manipulation.\u201dThose leading Silicon Valley\u2019s gender equality push said they were astonished that just as the movement was having an impact, it opened up an even more radical men\u2019s rights perspective.\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Joelle Emerson, who runs Paradigm, a company that designs diversity strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s created divides that I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201dCassie Jaye, who lives in Marin County and made a documentary about the men\u2019s rights movement called \u201cThe Red Pill,\u201d said that the tech world and the men\u2019s rights community had \u201csnowballed\u201d together and that the rise in the number of people in Mgtow is new.On the Mgtow message boards, members discuss work (\u201cEver work for a woman? Roll up your sleeves and share your horror story\u201d), technology (\u201cThe stuff girlfriends and wives can\u2019t stand \u2014 computers, games, consoles\u201d) and dating (mostly best practices to avoid commitment).\u201cI think there are a lot of guys living this lifestyle without naming it, and then they find Mgtow,\u201d said Ms. Jaye, who calls herself a former feminist.Mr. Altizer leads Bay Area Fathers\u2019 Rights, a monthly support group for men to talk about the issues they uniquely face. He became interested in the community after a divorce and said his eyes were opened to how few rights men have. As for the numbers of women in tech, the effort for parity is absurd, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve been on the hiring side for years,\u201d Mr. Altizer said, adding that he is not currently hiring people. \u201cIt would be nice to have women, but you cannot find applicants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reflections on Our Summer Reading Contest and Our Final Week of Winners", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsHe summed up our own thoughts when he returned a batch of submissions he\u2019d judged with this note:I love essays from writers who talk about how the topics in an article, photograph, etc., intersect with their own lives. Those entries are often powerful and poignant \u2014 and typically come with a fluid writing style that gives the reader the sense that no one is manufacturing an idea just to finish an assignment.But he also pointed out something else:The essays I\u2019ve read have, to a noticeable extent, reflected extraordinary interest in social justice and transgender rights. Given the prominence of those issues in contemporary American life, it\u2019s not surprising. But the number of deeply reasoned, and deeply detailed, views about those issues struck me. Few answers on those subjects have appeared rushed or flippant; rather, the essays have suggested strong, sustained interest in those topics.In a lot of ways, the Summer Reading Contest has been a showcase of students\u2019 empathy for others on a wide range of subjects.As I read Kang\u2019s piece on the death of Michael Deng, I saw not only another tragic case of a hazing incident gone wrong, but an introspective story of an 18-year-old seeking identity and kinship in a world seldom welcoming to faces like his.Perhaps Kang\u2019s article resonated with me because Deng reminded me of my brother, who is about the same age as Deng was when he died. Or perhaps it was that for the first time, I heard mention of cases like the racially-charged murder of Vincent Chin, or Korematsu v. United States, which perpetuated the internment of thousands of Japanese-Americans \u2014 all stories that were absent in my U.S. history class.Kang\u2019s piece opened my eyes to the lack of Asian representation in our textbooks and the Anglocentric perspective that pervades our society. Kenny Kwan, one of the boys involved, said he was grateful that a writer would provide the story with an \u201cAsian perspective.\u201d With so few people of color represented in the journalism industry, having our stories told is often an exception rather than the norm. While Kang firmly remained an objective and impartial reporter, his writing was unique in that it depicted the boys as human beings, rather than branding them as the \u201cfrat rats\u201d that others had. He openly addressed the difficulty for young Asian-Americans in coming to terms with their identities, and the adversity they face in white-dictated society.Our country is beset with anger. We hate white supremacists and neo-Nazis; they hate blacks and Jews. We call each other horrible names, scream directed chants and raise stinging signs into the air. Our nation has been torn apart without any hope of recovery \u2026 or so it seems.But Chlo\u00e9 Valdary reveals that there are better ways to fight back. Valdary, a black woman, recounts times in her past when she was attacked for her ethnicity. Yet she doesn\u2019t blame the other side. Instead, Valdary feels an emotion that I, at first, could not understand: Pity. Valday opens our eyes to groups that are, yes, hate-filled and guilty, but are also driven by pain. As she explains it, \u201cPeople often hurt because they have hurt in them.\u201dThe actions of white supremacists and neo-Nazis are monstrous, and their beliefs are inhumane, but they have been spurred by a harrowing past. We can condemn neo-Nazis. We can disparage white supremacists. But Valdary tells us that nothing we do will ever be as effective as looking into the eyes of our enemies and trying to fix their hidden pain. In her view, the color of our skin is irrelevant; it is the color of our hearts, which reflect our pasts, that truly measure our value. Valdary tells her readers that it is how we choose to respond to our pain that makes us worthy. So let us be like her and cast away our anger so we can rise to a level above the attackers and glue the shards of this nation together._________Thank you to Our Summer Reading Contest Judges:Alan Blinder, Amanda Christy Brown, John Dorman, Shannon Doyne, Caroline Crosson Gilpin, Michael Gonchar, Annissa Hambouz, Melissa Hoppert, Gina Lamb, Kathleen Massara, Sue Mermelstein, Wadzanai Mhute, Ken Paul, Pia Peterson, Flora Peir, Ken Rosen, Charles Rubin, Catherine Saint Louis, Teresa Smith, Samantha Stark and Nancy WartikAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "High Tech and High Design, Cornell\u2019s Roosevelt Island Campus Opens", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoosevelt Island, the skinny, two-mile-long strip of land between Manhattan and Queens in the East River, has been home to a prison, a lunatic asylum, a smallpox hospital and a workhouse, among other institutions.\u201cHigh-tech companies and new, small companies that will be the next big companies, they tend to be created where the founders go to school,\u201d the former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in an interview. \u201cYou see that in Silicon Valley. Here was a chance to get a bunch of people educated and create the economy of the future for New York City.\u201dTo create that economy, Cornell Tech will offer about a dozen masters and Ph.D. programs in fields like information science and electrical and computer engineering. It has been operating out of the Google building in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan since 2012. This will be the first academic year the institution, which now has about 300 students and 30 faculty members, will have its own home.On the inside, the building looks in some ways like a contemporary office tower, with open seating plans for Ph.D. candidates and faculty. The rooms are dotted with soundproof enclosures that serve as 21st-century phone booths, a Cornell official said, in that they have no phones, but offer privacy, a place to sit down and little shelf for a laptop. A collection of small meeting rooms are dominated by large art installations, an idea that Cornell said was borrowed from Pixar.\u201cI was particularly pleased with the academic building, which I was able to name for my daughters,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cWhen we went over to take pictures, I was pleased that they were pleased,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou never know!\u201dThe final building, the Bridge, will host work spaces and classrooms for Cornell Tech in about 30 percent of the building, while the rest will be leased to companies by the building\u2019s owner, Forest City New York. The roof of the Bridge is speckled with solar panels and a planted area.\u201cAcademic excellence here is necessary, but not sufficient,\u201d Dr. Huttenlocher said. \u201cYou also need to be engaged with the commercial or societal aspect of your work.\u201dRoosevelt Island is a bit of an anomaly in New York City. It is home to just 14,000 people, and its isolation makes for very little car traffic and an unusually quiet atmosphere.\u201cMae West was in a show she wrote called \u2018Sex,\u2019 and for that she was sentenced to 10 days in the women\u2019s workhouse on the island,\u201d Judith Berdy, president of the Roosevelt Island Historical Society, said in an interview.\u201cThe site where Cornell Tech is was originally the Blackwell\u2019s Island Penitentiary,\u201d she said. \u201cI just did a tour for about 30 of their students. \u2018Yes, hi! Your site was a penitentiary!\u2019\u201d The penitentiary was so corrupt, Ms. Berdy said, that city officials decided the only way to fix it was to shut it down and start all over again, which they did by building on Rikers Island.The island\u2019s remove now offers Cornell Tech something unusual. It is in the city, but not of it. Though the campus is only about one-third built \u2014 two other major phases of construction are to follow by the year 2037, by agreement with the city \u2014 it has the nascent feel of its own little community, as well as a grassy green where students can sprawl, and impressive views.Beautiful as it is, being surrounded by water is taking on an increasingly ominous cast. Dr. Huttenlocher said that with potential flooding in mind, masonry from the Goldwater hospital building was ground up and the site was raised by almost seven feet, putting the height of the building entrances two feet above the 500-year flood level.\u201cNow, of course, with changing sea levels, those numbers are likely to change,\u201d Dr. Huttenlocher said. \u201cBut the other way to think about it is most of Manhattan south of 34th Street is actually lower than the entrances to these buildings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Leaders Urge Big Tech to Police Terrorist Content", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The establishment was challenging the disrupters: Get your algorithms to stop terrorists from using the internet.At an unusual session on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, leaders of one powerful government after another told the leaders of some of the most powerful internet companies to intensify their efforts to take down terrorist propaganda.Sometimes the government officials displayed na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how technology works. Other times, they sidestepped the more difficult questions, like how to distinguish between free expression and incitement to violence. They ignored the impassioned debates over what constitutes a terrorist. And they said little about how to address other kinds of hate speech \u2013 including posts that could incite racist or sexist violence. Both prevail on the internet.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, one of the hosts of the event late Wednesday afternoon, pressed internet companies to put their army of bots to work to take down terrorist content. \u201cIndustry needs to go further and faster in automating the detection and removal of terrorist content online, and developing technological solutions which prevent it being uploaded in the first place,\u201d she said.Mrs. May said \u201chomegrown perpetrators\u201d had been radicalized online. And she took aim at encrypted messaging apps, which she said terrorist groups had used to \u201cplan, direct and coordinate\u201d their attacks, including in Britain in recent months.A joint statement, endorsed by Britain, France and Italy, said international leaders had \u201cchallenged\u201d Silicon Valley to build technology aimed at ensuring that internet users \u201ctempted by violent extremism are not exposed to content that reinforces their extremist inclination \u2013 so-called algorithmic confinement.\u201dThe prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, urged big companies to help small companies, especially those that offer users ways to communicate anonymously.Julie Bishop, the foreign minister of Australia, said she valued free expression. But the internet, she said, \u201ccannot be an ungoverned space where terrorists operate.\u201dBut the success of terrorist groups in exploiting social media platforms to promote their agendas is now putting internet brands in an uncomfortable position, and the industry has been forced to address the problem.At Wednesday\u2019s event, called the Leaders Meeting on Preventing Terrorist Use of the Internet, representatives of the world\u2019s most prominent technology companies described how they have been responding. They rushed to demonstrate what they were doing to take down terrorist propaganda from their platforms and pledged to do more.Facebook said that it was using artificial intelligence to identify when \u201cterrorist imagery\u201d was uploaded to the site, and that it had established a special team to assist with law enforcement requests for information about terrorist attacks.Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook, said the company had 150 people, including engineers and language specialists, \u201cworking primarily to counter terrorism.\u201d\u201cWe maintain a specialized terrorist threat team that responds within minutes to emergency requests from law enforcement,\u201d said Ms. Bickert, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cAnd if we become aware of a credible threat of real world harm, we proactively reach out to authorities and inform them.\u201dTwitter\u2019s annual transparency report took pains to say that Twitter had taken down more than 935,000 accounts in roughly the last two years, and that most of those had been detected by the company\u2019s own tools, before anyone flagged them.Google said it was targeting messages intended to change the minds of those who searching for what the company identifiesas terrorist content.But the companies also cautioned that technology alone was insufficient for the task. Machines cannot always distinguish between what is dangerous and what has social value, they said. Videos uploaded to YouTube by human rights groups to show atrocities, for example, were once taken down mistakenly, said Kent Walker, general counsel at Google, which owns YouTube.\u201cMachines,\u201d he said, \u201care not yet at the stage where they can replace human judgment.\u201d And Mr. Walker offered a sobering note of caution. \u201cThere is no magic computer program,\u201d he told the room of foreign dignitaries, \u201cto eliminate terrorist content.\u201dThe joint statement by Britain, France and Italy implicitly acknowledged how vexing the problem is.\u201cNo individual nation state can respond to this threat alone,\u201d they said. \u201cThe response must be global, and it must be collaborative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By that time, he said, it had received about 200,000 hits.Fortunately for the people who clicked, Mr. Sweeting\u2019s website was upfront about what it was. The layout was the same as the real version, complete with an identical prompt at the top: \u201cTo enroll in complimentary identity theft protection and credit file monitoring, click here.\u201d But a headline in large text differed: \u201cCybersecurity Incident & Important Consumer Information Which is Totally Fake, Why Did Equifax Use A Domain That\u2019s So Easily Impersonated By Phishing Sites?\u201dIt would be just as easy for phishers to create their own versions of the Equifax page, and that would be bad news for anyone entering the information required to enroll in identity theft protection: their surname and the last six digits of their Social Security number. (In Mr. Sweeting\u2019s version, the form was disabled so that no information was saved.)\u201cTheir site is dangerously easy to impersonate,\u201d Mr. Sweeting said in an email, noting that he had created the site solely to draw attention to the weakness of Equifax\u2019s security. \u201cIt only took me 20 minutes to build my clone. I can guarantee there are real malicious phishing versions already out there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to get Equifax to change this site to a reputable domain,\u201d he added. \u201cI knew it would only cost me $10 to set up a site that would get people to notice, so I just did it.\u201dIn a short statement on Wednesday, Equifax said all posts containing the wrong link had been deleted.\u201cWe apologize for the confusion,\u201d the statement said. \u201cConsumers should be aware of fake websites purporting to be operated by Equifax.

Phishers cannot create a page on the equifax.com domain, so if the website were hosted there instead, it would be easy for users to tell that the page was legitimate.\u201cYou would think that would be the obvious place to start,\u201d said Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cCreate a subdomain so that if somebody tries to fake it, it becomes immediately obvious.\u201d\u201cEquifaxsecurity2017.com,\u201d on the other hand, looks so unofficial that Mr. Telang said even he had been unsure at first whether it was safe to enter his information.Mr. Sweeting explained in his email that a Linux command, \u201cwget,\u201d allows anyone to download the contents of a website, \u201cincluding all images, HTML, CSS, etc.\u201d\u201cIt was super easy to just suck their whole site down with wget and throw it on a $5 server,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt currently has the same type of SSL certificate as the real version, so from a trust perspective, there\u2019s no way for users to authenticate the real one vs. my server.\u201dMr. Telang said Equifax\u2019s actions suggested that the company had never anticipated or planned for a data breach.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a plan in place, you will find different ways to screw it up,\u201d he said. \u201cEquifax is just a perfect example of that.\u201dAll of the incorrect tweets ended with \u201c-Tim,\u201d indicating the name of the Equifax employee who wrote them. The Equifax spokeswoman did not say whether any disciplinary action had been taken, and Mr. Sweeting said he hoped the employee had not been fired.\u201cThey probably just Googled for the URL and ended up finding the fake one instead,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s a good start, but more is required \u2014 of Facebook, of social media giants generally and of Congress.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s concern about democracy is commendable, and some of the changes he announced could have a positive impact. But they apply only to his company and can be easily evaded. Disclosing the name of Facebook business accounts placing political ads, for instance, will be of little value if purchasers can disguise their real identity \u2014 calling themselves, say, Americans for Motherhood and Apple Pie. Further, even if Facebook succeeds in driving away foreign propaganda, the same material could pop up on Twitter or other social media sites.More comprehensive safeguards will need intervention from Congress, which could begin by passing a law requiring online political ads \u2014 those that mention candidates seeking office or that advocate for certain political outcomes \u2014 to disclose who paid for them. Congress should also require internet companies to preserve the ads, and data about the groups the ads were targeted against, to help investigators looking into illicit activities. Two Democratic senators \u2014 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia \u2014 are planning to introduce a bill with some of these ideas.Of course, legislation cannot completely protect American elections from outside interference. It was already illegal for foreigners to purchase political ads when Russian agents started their Facebook campaign. Stronger enforcement of those rules would help, but that would require broader reforms, like replacing the Federal Election Commission, a toothless watchdog often paralyzed by partisan gridlock, with a new agency that has an odd number of members, including a nonpartisan election law expert.An educational effort by government, schools, civil society groups and the media to help people distinguish facts from fakery might help. Regrettably, President Trump has elevated \u201calternative facts\u201d to a high political art, and many members of his party and its talking-head cheerleaders seem perfectly happy to follow his lead. The willingness of social media to serve as a theater for obvious propaganda doesn\u2019t help advance the cause of truth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Former Apple Engineers Working on New Eyes for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Soroush Salehian raised both arms and spun in circles as if celebrating a touchdown.Across the room, perched on a tripod, a small black device monitored this little dance and streamed it to a nearby laptop. Mr. Salehian appeared as a collection of tiny colored dots, some red, some blue, some green. Each dot showed the precise distance to a particular point on his body, while the colors showed the speed of his movements. As his right arm spun forward, it turned blue. His left arm, spinning away, turned red.\u201cSee how the arms are different?\u201d said his business partner, Mina Rezk, pointing at the laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s measuring different velocities.\u201dMessrs. Salehian and Rezk are the founders of a new Silicon Valley start-up called Aeva, and their small black device is designed for self-driving cars. The veterans of Apple\u2019s secretive Special Projects Group aim to give these autonomous vehicles a more complete, detailed and reliable view of the world around them \u2014 something that is essential to their evolution.Today\u2019s driverless cars under development at companies like General Motors, Toyota, Uber and the Google spinoff Waymo track their surroundings using a wide variety of sensors, including cameras, radar, GPS antennas and lidar (short for \u201clight detection and ranging\u201d) devices that measure distances using pulses of light.But there are gaps in the way these sensors operate, and combining their disparate streams of data is difficult. Aeva\u2019s prototype \u2014 a breed of lidar that measures distances more accurately and also captures speed \u2014 aims to fill several of these sizable holes.\u201cI don\u2019t even think of this as a new kind of lidar,\u201d said Tarin Ziyaee, co-founder and chief technology officer at the self-driving taxi start-up Voyage, who has seen the Aeva prototype. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different animal.\u201dThe company\u2019s name, Aeva, is a play on \u201cEve,\u201d the name of the robot in the Pixar movie \u201cWALL-E.\u201dThe recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne. These sensors gave cars a way of measuring distances to nearby vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment \u2014 something GPS cannot always provide.But these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings. They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel. Their measurements aren\u2019t always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.Other devices can pick up some of slack. Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances. That\u2019s why today\u2019s self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors. But despite this wide array of hardware \u2014 which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle \u2014 even the best autonomous vehicles still have trouble in so many situations that humans can navigate with ease.Where current lidar sensors send out individual pulses, Aeva\u2019s device sends out a continuous wave of light. By reading the way this far more complex signal bounces off surrounding objects, Mr. Rezk said, the device can capture a far more detailed image while also tracking velocity. You can think of it as a cross between lidar, which is so good at measuring depth, and radar, which is so good at measuring speed.Mr. Rezk also said the device\u2019s continuous wave would provide greater range and resolution than existing lidar devices, deal better with weather and highly reflective objects like bridge railings, and avoid interference with other optical sensors.Cars will continue to use multiple kinds of sensors, in part because redundancy helps ensure that these cars are safe. But Aeva aims to give these cars a better view of the world from a smaller and less expensive set of sensors.Ultimately, new sensors will allow cars to make better decisions. \u201cWith autonomous cars, 90 percent of the time, you are trying to infer what is happening,\u201d Mr. Ziyaee said. \u201cBut what if you can just measure it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also raised some $120 million, and attracted a mountain of attention.Started by a health fanatic with a checkered history as an entrepreneur, Juicero devised an elaborate scheme to deliver small glasses of expensive cold pressed juice to kitchens around the country. The machine scanned codes printed on pouches of chopped produce to help assess the freshness of the contents inside. Doug Evans, the founder, hired engineers, food scientists and fashionable industrial designers to work alongside him.The company was a particularly bold bid to capitalize on the hype around the so-called internet of things and interest in the juice business.

Blood was shed to protect the rights of these workers, and it is a contemplative day.It is also the unofficial end of summer and the beginning of the school year for most of the United States. Again, a contemplative day, although on an entirely different level altogether:How you commemorate it is entirely up to you, of course. Some people take advantage of sales (like I said, you do you); others, like Tracy Gray, have BBQs in their backyards.It\u2019s a good theme set, although SLIDERS didn\u2019t go down as well for me. A SLIDER is the entire burger, I believe, toppings, bun and all. The patty is what goes on the grill, unless you are on a low-carb diet and don\u2019t eat it that way. But I will take a double helping of those WINGS, because those are good eating.Overall, a typically easy Monday with no real BACKDOOR SLIDERS. There was only one real instance of wordplay at 55A, which we should mostly know by now: a three-letter entry for \u201cWelcome sight?\u201d refers to a welcome MAT.For most constructors, I imagine, some theme concepts never get their moment in the sun. They sit in constructors\u2019 idea books, waiting for the perfect revealer or maybe another theme entry to complete the set. The latter was the case with this puzzle; I had several phrases ending with WINGS, BRATS, and DOGS to choose from, but still needed one more fun food-themed entry to throw into and onto my \u201cBarbie\u201d crossword.And then it happened \u2026 I was watching Super Bowl LI in a bar, scanning the menu for some appetizers, when I saw SLIDERS. Knowing sliders was also a baseball term, I contacted fellow cruciverbalist and M.L.B. postgame highlights announcer, Mike Black, who suggested two phrases: BACKDOOR or HANGING SLIDERS. They both Googled well enough, but BACKDOOR made the cut to adhere to the rules of symmetry.I got the yes from Will and Joel in late July and am most thankful that they decided to run it so quickly and on Labor Day \u2014 the unofficial last day of summer \u2014 a perfect day to relax, fire up the grill, and spend time with family and friends.Hope you enjoy your holiday and my puzzle!It was delicious, Ms. Gray, thank you.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Is Buying HTC\u2019s Smartphone Expertise for $1.1 Billion", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHTC said many of its estimated 2,000 employees affected by the deal were already working with the search giant on smartphones. Google leaned on HTC to manufacture its first Pixel smartphone, which was released last year, and is working with the company to produce the next version of the phone, which is expected to be announced on Oct. 4.Bringing on the team from HTC is a sign that Google is doubling down on plans to produce its own hardware. Company executives have said it is important to tightly couple its artificial intelligence software, like the voice-controlled Google Assistant, with a range of devices.Apple has followed a similar strategy for years, and that has provided the iPhone maker with an easier path when adding new features, such as augmented reality functions, since it designs nearly all of the internal parts of its phone.Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of hardware, said in a blog post that the HTC deal was a continuation of \u201cour big bet on hardware.\u201d Google also offers a smart speaker, the Google Home, and the Chromecast streaming video device.The two sides did not disclose how many engineers and other key employees would head to Google as part of the deal. But Peter Shen, HTC\u2019s chief financial officer, said the remaining company would still have more than 2,000 research and design staffers, down from about 4,000.As part of the agreement, Google will also secure a nonexclusive licensing deal for some of HTC\u2019s intellectual property.HTC said it will continue to make its own smartphones \u2014 including a new premium model \u2014 although it plans to streamline its handset portfolio. By acquiring the HTC engineering group that had already been working with the company, Google secured hardware talent without taking on expensive assets, like manufacturing facilities.But Google, which makes the Android operating system for smartphones, retained many of Motorola\u2019s patents \u2014 an important asset to fend off potential intellectual property lawsuits from Apple.As the Android software world has become dominated by Samsung Electronics, Google has wanted more say in the manufacturing of the phones that use its operating system. Currently, most of Google\u2019s smartphone software runs on devices manufactured by companies like Samsung and LG Electronics, and Google has only a limited say in what those companies produce.With the introduction of the first Pixel smartphone last year, Google said it was creating the smartphone it had always intended to build. Google took control of the entire development process of the device, from the industrial design to the procurement of components. The Pixel received positive reviews, but it hasn\u2019t made much of a dent in the smartphone market.HTC was an early leader in smartphones. But it has struggled against more popular competitors while trying to fend off pressure from low-end Chinese manufacturers. Its decline is another indication of the challenges facing many smartphone manufacturers, who are struggling to make profits while competing against Apple and Samsung.Operating losses piled up at HTC in recent years, forcing it to slash research and marketing spending, exacerbating the challenge of keeping pace with the bigger companies. HTC said it will continue with its virtual-reality business centered around its Vive VR headsets.Google and HTC have a long history of working together. HTC sold the first smartphone to run Android software, in 2008, and it produced Google\u2019s first-generation Nexus smartphone \u2014 the predecessor to the Pixel.The transaction is scheduled to close, pending regulatory approval, in early 2018.Carolyn Zhang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "And This Year, the Emmy Goes to \u2026 Politics", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In any other year, big-hearted dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d or \u201cThis Is Us\u201d or a period drama like \u201cThe Crown\u201d would dominate the Emmys.But this was no normal year.This is a moment in which the partisan chasm has widened and political discourse has taken on a greater sense of urgency. Bright lines are dividing those supporting President Trump and those vilifying him, and Hollywood has never been shy about signaling where it stands.And so Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards, as much as they were a celebration of artistic accomplishment, were also a statement that, eight months into a Trump presidency, topical and decidedly progressive shows rule the day in television \u2014 at least among the industry insiders who dole out the accolades.\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which revived its fortunes last season with a weekly skewering of Mr. Trump, claimed the most awards of any show Sunday. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a dystopian drama that tapped into fears about authoritarianism in America, nabbed best drama and several other awards. And individual winners like Alec Baldwin, Donald Glover and John Oliver took the stage to spoof Mr. Trump and give voice to the liberal worldview that prevails in much of the entertainment industry.A few hours after the ceremony, the former Emmy winner Jon Hamm described it as \u201cthe most diverse, most different, most interesting Emmy show I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dWhen his former co-star on \u201cMad Men,\u201d Elisabeth Moss, was asked if she had seen an Emmys quite this political, she was emphatic.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, holding an Emmy in each hand, including the one she won for best actress for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve also never seen anything like where our country is right now.\u201dAll year, late night shows with an anti-Trump bent and left-leaning cable news shows like Rachel Maddow\u2019s on MSNBC have seen their ratings soar, and now that political posture has received the seal of approval from Emmys voters.But it also means that the Emmys, and all awards shows, for that matter, are part of a broader cultural divide. And to its critics, Hollywood may be proving yet again that it lives in an elite, self-congratulatory bubble, showering awards on shows that reflect its worldview while ignoring the millions of people who prefer \u201cNCIS\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\u201cRemember, it\u2019s California,\u201d said Margaret Atwood, the author of the novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d on which the Hulu show was based, as she glided into her first Emmys party at age 77. \u201cThis would not happen in a lot of other states. This would, in fact, be a lot different. This is its own world here.\u201dThe show did not draw a big audience. The ceremony, hosted by Stephen Colbert, attracted just 11.38 million viewers, Nielsen said, in line with last year\u2019s total, which was a record low.On Fox News on Monday morning, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said viewers were \u201ctuning out\u201d because of how politicized the Emmys have become, and suggested that Hollywood\u2019s anti-Trump posturing had become tiresome.\u201cThey got plucked and polished and waxed, and some of them didn\u2019t eat for two months, and all for what?\u201d she said. \u201cTo sound the same?\u201dStill, the heated political climate produced some startling changes for the Emmys.\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has never appealed much to Emmy voters, and they had not given it a top show award in more than two decades. But just two years removed from inviting Mr. Trump to host \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d the NBC late night show excoriated him this past season, and reaped the rewards: Mr. Baldwin won an Emmy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who portrayed both Ms. Conway and Hillary Clinton, won an Emmy as well.\u201c\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 had a career year,\u201d said Warren Littlefield, a longtime Emmy voter who is a former NBC executive and a producer of \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cYou had to watch \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 to get an appreciation of the world we\u2019re living in, and it helped us endure what we\u2019re all living with.\u201dOther shows benefited as well, including Mr. Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d which won the prize for best variety talk show for the second consecutive year. Mr. Oliver delights in using Mr. Trump as a punching bag on his show.Mr. Glover of \u201cAtlanta\u201d and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of \u201cVeep\u201d were among the many winners who mocked President Trump on stage. And after Mr. Baldwin won, he alluded to the fact that Mr. Trump had long coveted an Emmy but never won one. \u201cI suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,\u201d Mr. Baldwin quipped.What benefited those shows, however, appeared to have hurt dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d both of which were decidedly retro and unpolitical.\u201cStranger Things\u201d was a sci-fi homage to movies like \u201cStand by Me\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d was a heart-on-your-sleeve family drama that took inspiration from the 1983 tear-jerker \u201cTerms of Endearment.\u201dStill, Hulu\u2019s success was a shock in its own right. Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, Comcast, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, has a smaller programming budget compared with those of streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon.But \u201cHandmaid\u2019s,\u201d which was in development long before the Trump administration, struck a chord with viewers concerned about women\u2019s rights, and its creators proudly embraced the fact that some regarded their show as eerily timely.\u201cPolitics is at the front of everybody\u2019s head, not in the back of everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d said Bruce Miller, an executive producer for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI think all of the media, including the fictional and nonfictional media, are benefiting from taking that head-on. I have been told that you don\u2019t talk about religion and politics in kind company. Well, there\u2019s no company now where you don\u2019t talk about politics these days.\u201d\u201cPeople are talking about and thinking about some serious things and things that are uncomfortable,\u201d he added. \u201cShows that directly address difficult topics are having their day in the sun.\u201dEarly reviews for the series, which had its premiere three months after the inauguration, were positive, and it has been the show of the year for many TV critics.Hulu\u2019s marketing department took no chances. The streaming service bought its first-ever Super Bowl ad for an original series, even though the event was months before the premiere. And throughout the year, Hulu hired actresses to don red capes like characters in the show, and circulate in cities like Austin (during the South by Southwest Festival), New York, Los Angeles and Washington to create word-of-mouth buzz.Because Hulu does not release viewership data, it is impossible to know how popular \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d was, but it was far more successful than its previous iteration. In 1990, the novel was adapted into a feature film that was a flop at the box office and did not receive warm reviews.\u201cWe got a Trump bump!\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a producer behind both the movie and the TV show. \u201cTiming is everything. If we didn\u2019t have the president we have now, I don\u2019t know if it would have been this successful.\u201dMs. Atwood underscored that point as well.\u201cI wrote it in 1985,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some incredulity then: \u2018Margaret, you\u2019re way over the top! it could never happen here.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t hear any of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Work From Home", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHurricane Sandy hit the East Coast in October 2012 while I lived in New York and juggled three jobs. Along with working at a restaurant and a news agency on nights and weekends, I spent my weekdays commuting from Brooklyn to a media company in Manhattan. When the hurricane made landfall, it crippled the city\u2019s public transportation system for weeks, leaving me all but severed from office headquarters.More than 8.1 million people in the region were without electricity in the days that followed. Yet in my Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment we had power, internet, and plumbing. This fortune came with another price: Those of us who were able to work remotely.Then things soured. I began to loathe working remotely. I felt unkempt and dirty, lonely and disconnected, malnourished and unhealthy. Turns out in my hasty jump into remote work, I had fallen for the most common pitfalls. More than five years later, I\u2019m now a regular from-afar employee \u2014 whether it be from an apartment in Brooklyn, a cabin in upstate New York, or my tiny home in Maine \u2014 and I can comfortably and productively contribute a solid day\u2019s work from almost anywhere.There are many things that contribute to becoming a successful work-from-home employee. As more companies across nearly every industry accommodate an increasing number of employees wishing to forego the morning commute and office pantry footfall, remote work has become an increasingly easy and breathlessly viable option for many who seek it.Here is a modest guide to becoming a successful remote employee, a culmination of what I\u2019ve learned along the way.Don\u2019t wake up to the blue hue of your smartphone and immediately start working. Place it across the room, or better yet, in an adjacent one, and force yourself up and out of bed to turn off your alarm each morning. When the alarm does go off, get up and prepare for your day as you would for an office job: take a shower, and get dressed.Business attire is (obviously) not required, but act as though you will be interacting with colleagues in person. After all, you never know when they may want to video chat, and you don\u2019t want to beg off because you look unkempt or aren\u2019t wearing a shirt.Before divorcing completely from the office, check with your corporate IT department and your manager to see if you are equipped with the programs and applications necessary to work remotely. Security first: If you connect to your company\u2019s internal systems or email through a Virtual Private Network or other secure tunnel, make sure you\u2019ve tested it and that it functions from where you plan to work. Also, have a backup plan in the event your connection experiences disruptions.The same advice applies to internet connectivity. I make sure that if the wireless internet in my home office fails, I can still connect seamlessly through my smartphone, set up as a Wi-Fi hot spot. To do this, make sure you have the right wireless plan, especially if you handle large files. You don\u2019t want to get hit with hefty overage fees on your cell bill just because you worked from home. Similarly, your company may provide special equipment for remote employees or pay for their mobile phone or internet service. Check with your IT or human resources department to see how they can help.Find out which of those platforms are the most convenient for the people with whom you frequently communicate. If you\u2019re not working and are out on a walk or a lunch date, don\u2019t ignore that message from a co-worker seeking clarification or assistance. Follow up, and be sure that while you are on the clock, you remain as available as if you were seated right beside them, even if it\u2019s just to say \u201cI\u2019m away from my desk, but I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I\u2019m back.\u201dSet goals. Make a list of things that need to be tackled today, this week, and this month.Block out disturbances. Set (and enforce) boundaries if you\u2019re working at home by explaining to family members or children that your work area is off limits, and they should avoid interrupting unless it\u2019s important. Set aside time and breaks to spend with them, so they don\u2019t feel entitled to your working time.There are similar tools available for other web browsers and even mobile devices; just don\u2019t spend more time installing and updating apps to keep you focused than you spend on focused work.\u201cHave a regularly scheduled social meeting: pre-work coffee, lunch with a friend or group of friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps you feel like you have a regular schedule, gives you some outside inspiration, and if nothing else, it enforces the Wear Pants rule at least once or twice a week.\u201dIt\u2019s important to socialize to combat the inherent loneliness and isolation you\u2019ll feel while out of a traditional office setting. I\u2019ve found that chatting with the owner of my corner store or other local establishment gives my days a light, communal routine, similar to what I would get in an office environment.If you are more secluded, brisk bike rides or short hikes elevate endorphins and sharpen focus the same as a quick tour of your neighborhood. Worst case, make plans to get out of the house with family or friends when the workday is over.Separating your technology from the place where you come to recharge and disconnect at the end of the day is invaluable to the discipline needed for working remotely. Just as you should wake up in a room absent of technology, you should return to one once you\u2019ve completed a day\u2019s work. When you log off for the day, log off. Close your work chat programs and emails and consider yourself \u201cout for the day,\u201d and \u201chome now.\u201dPlay with your dog or cat or goldfish and relish the fact that you work from home! Not everyone can. After all, if you get tired of it or dislike it, you can always go back to the office.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s 10 P.M. Do You Know What Apps Your Children Are Using?", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut social media apps are appendages for tweens and teens. It\u2019s one way they earn social currency. Below, a guide to what parents will (or should) be anxiously monitoring during this busy back-to-school season.Marco Polo is a closed messaging platform, but friends can invite their friends. Which means, in theory, your kid can talk to strangers through the app\u2019s messaging system. Another potential issue: The videos are easily deleted. So if your teenager was sexually harassed or bullied through Marco Polo, chances are the user will delete the video and you won\u2019t have proof.\u201cIf for some reason someone was bullying someone,\u201d said Vlada Bortnik, the creator of Marco Polo, \u201cwe would take the steps to make sure our platform stays safe and probably remove them from the platform.\u201d (Blocking someone is also an option.)Flipping through Yellow is like watching an MTV beach party from the 1990s, with countless photos of shirtless teenagers looking to \u201cmake new friends.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to wreak havoc with a false profile using a real schoolmate\u2019s name.In an email, Marc-Antoine Durand, the head of community and safety at Yellow, wrote that the company is addressing parents\u2019 concerns by prioritizing emails that are sent through the settings feature of the app. Yellow also has a team of \u201chuman moderators\u201d who look at potentially fake content and impostor accounts. \u201cUsers who do create fake profiles or share inappropriate content are blocked and removed from Yellow,\u201d Mr. Durand wrote.The company deletes abusive content if reported, Hanna Talving, its chief executive, wrote in an email. \u201cWe also protect our site users from negative content by flagging it to them before they see it.\u201dIn early May, Dawn Dunscombe, who lives in a small New Jersey suburb, learned that an Instagram account with the handle \u201cI Have A Crush.1\u201d was devised to impersonate her 10-year-old daughter.Ms. Dunscombe\u2019s daughter does not have an Instagram account. Yet the fake account was filled with posts, including claims that her daughter had a crush on a boy in her class. It wasn\u2019t the outed crush that upset Ms. Dunscombe \u2014 the tormenting song that someone is \u201cSitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g,\u201d is playground standard \u2014 it was that the fake account was created in her daughter\u2019s name so easily and with the purpose of damaging her young daughter\u2019s reputation.Profanities and rudeness littered the account, which is what gave it away. \u201cA classmate told my daughter, \u2018I knew it couldn\u2019t be you because you don\u2019t curse and you don\u2019t talk rude like that to people,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dunscombe said.By the time Ms. Dunscombe tracked down the account, it had been shut down. The school investigated. No one confessed. Ms. Dunscombe contacted Instagram multiple times and got a generic message. The situation was handled. Account closed.Getting rid of an app is like playing whack-a-mole \u2014 particularly because many young people maintain multiple accounts with varying levels of secrecy.\u201cThis arena in social media that we\u2019re working in changes so quickly,\u201d said Robert Appleton, the New York State Internet Crimes Against Children task force commander. \u201cThe kids don\u2019t want the parents to discover what they\u2019re using, so every time a new app comes out, they\u2019re switching.\u201dAnd behavior, not apps that enable it, is the problem, said Elizabeth Englander a psychology professor at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center.\u201cI could give you a list of things that kids tell us they do to each other,\u201d Ms. Englander said. \u201cBut the more interesting question is: \u2018Why are we seeing misuse of apps and technology perhaps among teenagers who wouldn\u2019t engage in those behaviors in person?\u2019\u201d\u201cMonitoring and surveillance control aren\u2019t always the most effective way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really best to have a human way of monitoring the situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At the Apple Keynote, Selling Us a Better Vision of Ourselves", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookTalking about the new iPhone\u2019s augmented-reality features at Apple\u2019s announcement event Tuesday, Philip W. Schiller, the senior vice president for worldwide marketing, showed how an app could overlay an image of the constellations on a live camera picture of the sky. This got him excited. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some generic sky!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the sky around you!\u201dI don\u2019t know. It looked like a generic sky to me: clouds, blue, sunlight.I looked up through the skylight over my desk. Yep. That iPhone sky looked way better than the garbage regular sky that I could see through my garbage human eyes.This enhancement of reality is what each video-streamed Apple event sells, more than any particular iPhone or set-top box. If advertising once told us that \u201cThings go better with Coke,\u201d this event \u2014 a jewel box for Apple\u2019s products and the people who use them \u2014 says that \u201cThings look better with Apple.\u201dThis year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. It\u2019s also the 10th anniversary of the Apple keynote at which Steve Jobs announced the original device. The first one was a tour de force, Mr. Jobs leading a rapt audience as he asked them to imagine an iPod, a phone and a pocket internet device all in one.These online-streaming keynotes have become as important a production of Apple as the devices themselves. An Apple event is a distinct kind of TV special: an extended commercial \u2014 this one ran nearly two hours \u2014 that people watch willingly, to get a glimpse of the new products and an art-directed idea of their better selves.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.On the massive screen, attractive young people ran with a billowing red sheet across a golden desert. Caped figures soared through clouds like angels in a gorgeous video game preview. A promo video for the Apple Watch as a fitness tool was so heartwarming and inspirational I think the Apple Watch may be running for president.Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for retail, said new Apple stores would be rebranded Town Squares, places for community gathering, education \u2014 and buying the occasional thousand-dollar phone. (\u201cApple retail,\u201d Mr. Cook said, \u201chas always been about more than selling. It\u2019s about learning, inspiring and connecting with people.\u201d)You will do such fantastic things with this technology, the presentation said. You\u2019ll get healthy! You\u2019ll learn! You\u2019ll play ennobling games!Though Mr. Jobs is gone, his minimalist aesthetic lives on in Cupertino, in the products and on the stage. Everything was set off against a black screen, like diamond necklaces in a velvet case. The show opened with footage of the sun rising (or setting? Surely it was rising) over the curvilinear new Steve Jobs Theater, where the event took place.Mr. Cook is an amiable presenter, but he doesn\u2019t pretend to have Mr. Jobs\u2019s magnetism. Wearing a zippered fleece \u2014 rich-guy casualwear as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s aesthete\u2019s turtlenecks \u2014 he passed the spotlight around to associates. Among them was the designer Jonathan Ive, speaking from a white room in tandem with an animated monkey emoji.I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m immune to this allure. I watched the Apple keynote on my Apple iMac after getting a reminder on my Apple iPad and being unable to start a stream through the Apple events app on my Apple TV. A 1989 Mac Plus that I can\u2019t bear to part with still sits in my basement. I will almost certainly buy one of the new phones.What will I do with it? What does anyone? I will Instagram photos of my cooking that I think look more appetizing than they are. I will see another tweet from the president. I will Google song lyrics. I will read Facebook posts and get mad on the internet.And another year from now, I\u2019ll set another reminder to watch another Apple event, believing somewhere deep down that with one more upgrade, I might be perfected.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the Apple presentation Steve Jobs gave 10 years ago. He introduced the iPhone; it was not his first Apple keynote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ellen Pao: Has Anything Really Changed for Women in Tech?", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSan Francisco \u2014 Just five years ago, I sued Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm in Silicon Valley where I had worked since 2005, for bias and gender discrimination. The lawsuit, which I lost, led to the venture capital world closing ranks against me. I had trouble finding work. People were afraid to support me publicly. I was called a fraud, and greedy, and was accused of being in a fake marriage.Now, over the past year, at least a dozen women have publicly shared their stories of being discriminated against and harassed in tech by their managers, by investors or by board members. Privately, I have heard dozens more.What I also hear, over and over again, is the question, \u201cHas anything changed?\u201dBefore her post, others who spoke up publicly and privately about their experiences of harassment were at best ignored. Some of those people \u2014 whose names are unfortunately not well known \u2014 include Adria Richards, Am\u00e9lie Lamont, Gesche Haas, Julie Ann Horvath, Kathryn Minshew and Kelly Ellis. Most were disrespected and harassed online, and many found it hard, as I did, to find work after public shaming. We saw Gamergate attack female game developers and their supporters. But they all paved the way for Ms. Fowler to be heard and believed, and for subsequent stories about sexist tech culture to be accepted at face value.We\u2019re hearing about companies writing codes of conduct covering anti-harassment that they want their investors and board members to sign.On its face, it all sounds like meaningful change, right? Or at least it sounds a lot better than the very recent public shaming of women who came forward and the sweeping of bad behavior under the rug. But let\u2019s not be blinded by optimism or biased by what we want to see: Certain actions, and lack of action, could keep us in this unfair loop indefinitely. Public apologies and one-off actions are superficial ways to react to criticism or put on a happy face, but they often cover up company culture failures that are hard to fix, especially if no one is seriously trying.Many continue to describe Uber and the outed venture capitalists as a few bad apples, not indicative of the entire industry \u2014 forgetting that the whole saying is actually \u201cOne bad apple spoils the bunch.\u201d Their behavior is part of much broader and deeper culture problems that permeate all tech \u2014 which ignored, encouraged and sometimes rewarded bad behavior \u2014 at different levels. We see companies changing C.E.O.s, but the reasons are shrouded, and they install new leaders with similar backgrounds.I have heard from several women who spoke up in this newspaper and elsewhere this year that they continue to face harassment. They have been told that discussing their experiences has limited their careers.And most companies don\u2019t address the great underlying problems: the exclusion of and biases against people of color, older employees, disabled people, L.G.B.T.Q. people and many other underrepresented groups.They continue to pay only lip service to diversity and inclusion, favoring tepid diversity initiatives over real solutions. It\u2019s all superficial until we see leaders actually changing company cultures by making hard decisions, leading uncomfortable conversations \u2014 and firing those who are unwilling to include everyone.So how do we clear biases and power imbalances in tech so that everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed?We need C.E.O.s to hold themselves and their teams accountable for true diversity and inclusion. That means all people from all groups, not just women. That means understanding intersectionality \u2014 that employees can face multiple biases based on identity. That means all activities across the company, not just hiring.Practically, it means measuring progress, holding people accountable for results by setting goals and basing their compensation on hitting those goals.C.E.O.s lead the transformation from the top, and they need individual employees to focus efforts on change as well: Speak up, help others speak up, build bridges to those who are interested in changing and learning. I know that there is a real cost to speaking up. I have also seen that every voice can make a difference. Five years from now, if enough people speak up for others, the answer to \u201cHas anything changed?\u201d has the potential to be an unequivocal yes.Advertisement"}
