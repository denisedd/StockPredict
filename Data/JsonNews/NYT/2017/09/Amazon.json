{"Headline": "Trump Seriously Considering Ending DACA, With 6-Month Delay", "Date": "2017-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is strongly considering a plan that would end the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, but only after giving Congress six months to come up with a potential replacement for the popular initiative, according to three administration officials briefed on the discussions.Officials working on the plan stressed that Mr. Trump could still change his mind, and some key details had not yet been resolved. Among them: whether beneficiaries of the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would be allowed to renew their protected status during the six-month period.The compromise, which could lead to legislation superseding President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order, is intended to address a growing chorus of Republican lawmakers, led by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who have implored the White House to keep some form of the program.The temporary solution has been the subject of quiet negotiations between Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative staff and members of Mr. Ryan\u2019s staff, according to an administration official familiar with the talks.But administration aides concede that Congress may be unable to agree on a legislative fix, given the headwinds that previous legislation has run into for years. It is unclear exactly what would happen after six months if Congress does not act.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, had no response to questions about the negotiations, other than to say Mr. Trump still intended to make some kind of announcement after Labor Day.One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that Mr. Trump was sympathetic to the plight of the young immigrants, known as Dreamers \u2014 many have known life only in the United States and have few connections to the countries of their birth \u2014 but had been told by Justice Department lawyers that his predecessor\u2019s program would not survive a court challenge.Last week, John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, told associates that he did not see how the State of Texas, which has led the charge against the DACA policy, could proceed with a lawsuit while parts of the state are still underwater from Hurricane Harvey.Democrats and corporate leaders, as well as Republicans, have urged Mr. Trump to preserve the program, and public opinion polls have found overwhelming support for allowing the young immigrants to stay and work in the United States.But Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his former aide, Stephen Miller, who is now the president\u2019s top national policy adviser, have been pushing Mr. Trump to end the program. Both are immigration hard-liners who see ending DACA as a core campaign promise that the president must adhere to.The president has sent wildly divergent signals about the DACA program, publicly agonizing over the fate of the initiative for months. He has vowed to prevent deportations of minors in college while promising to crack down on all forms of immigration. Most of those in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House, including his own family, support lenience toward immigrants in the program.The president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who are both advisers to the president, back extending the DACA protections.The policy change would affect about 800,000 undocumented immigrants currently shielded under the DACA program, potentially rescinding their legal status and subjecting them to deportation.Immigration advocacy groups have said that ending the program would be a coldhearted step that would yield no benefit to the nation while endangering large numbers of young people raised in the United States who are seeking to work and pay taxes.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what anybody thinks we gain by taking away people\u2019s ability to work and subject them to deportation,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who helped create the program as the chief domestic policy adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cThe positive benefits of DACA are so abundantly clear.\u201dSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, told Republicans in a Twitter message that \u201cyour moment has come\u201d to preserve the program. \u201cEvery Democrat will join you,\u201d he said. \u201cShow the courage and grace to save these children, and our nation.\u201dEven as his supporters who favor curtailing illegal immigration have sought to hold him accountable to his campaign promise, Mr. Trump has publicly expressed reservations about ending DACA.In an April interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump said that those protected under the program should \u201crest easy\u201d about their status. He insisted that his administration was \u201cnot after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is our policy.\u201dBut Mr. Sessions has sought to enforce immigration laws as they exist now, and has balked at Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions in internal debates, administration officials said.Any move to end the DACA program will not improve Mr. Trump\u2019s already testy relations with Silicon Valley tech companies.On Thursday, a group of top tech chiefs \u2014 including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook \u2014 signed an open letter to the president and congressional leaders urging them to preserve the program.Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Courts Brand-Name Teachers, Raising Ethics Issues", "Date": "2017-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedMAPLETON, N.D. \u2014 One of the tech-savviest teachers in the United States teaches third grade here at Mapleton Elementary, a public school with about 100 students in the sparsely populated plains west of Fargo.\u201cI will embed it in my brand every day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said of Seesaw. \u201cI get to make it better.\u201dTheir ranks are growing as public schools increasingly adopt all manner of laptops, tablets, math teaching sites, quiz apps and parent-teacher messaging apps. The corporate courtship of these teachers brings with it profound new conflict-of-interest issues for the nation\u2019s public schools.Moreover, there is little rigorous research showing whether or not the new technologies significantly improve student outcomes.Teachers said that more established start-ups gave them pricier perks like travel expenses to industry-sponsored conferences attended by thousands of teachers. In exchange, teacher ambassadors often promote company products on social media or in their conference talks \u2014 sometimes without explicitly disclosing their relationships with their sponsors.Many public schools are facing tight budgets, and administrators, including the principal at Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, said they welcomed potentially valuable free technology and product training. Even so, some education experts warned that company incentives might influence teachers to adopt promoted digital tools over rival products or even traditional approaches, like textbooks.\u201cTeachers can\u2019t help but be seduced to make greater use of the technology, given these efforts by tech companies,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, director of the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.Public-school teachers who accept perks, meals or anything of value in exchange for using a company\u2019s products in their classrooms could also run afoul of school district ethics policies or state laws regulating government employees.Ms. Delzer and other educators forcefully argue that they\u2019re motivated by altruism, and not company-bestowed status or gifts. \u201cI am in this profession for kids,\u201d Ms. Delzer said, \u201cnot for notoriety or the money.\u201dAnother important draw for teachers, who already often feel underappreciated: Having tech companies, the icons of American society, seek their views provides welcome attention. \u201cTeachers have really responded well to feeling like they are being listened to,\u201d said Carl Sjogreen, a co-founder of Seesaw.The benefits to companies are substantial. Many start-ups enlist their ambassadors as product testers and de facto customer service representatives who can field other teachers\u2019 queries.Microsoft and Apple said they worked with schools to make sure any conference travel expenses they covered for teachers complied with district ethics rules. Google said it provided meals but not teachers\u2019 travel expenses.An Amazon representative, responding to a question about the gift cards that TenMarks offered to certain teachers last year, said that the company had not given that incentive recently and that it had procedures \u201cto ensure our compliance with applicable laws and to help facilitate teachers\u2019 obligations to their schools.\u201dSo far, no teacher has asked for the payment, said Melissa Davis, GoEnnounce\u2019s chief executive. Still, she said, teacher referrals accounted for 20 percent of GoEnnounce\u2019s first-year sales.\u201cThese champions are really essential in giving us a really powerful foot in the door to meet with districts and schools,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Unlike industry influence in medicine, however, the phenomenon of company-affiliated teachers has received little scrutiny. Twitter alone is rife with educators broadcasting their company-bestowed titles.\u201cIf medical experts started saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Google Certified Doctor\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a Pfizer Distinguished Nurse,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm.This is true for celebrities and teachers alike. And it applies equally to conferences, YouTube videos, personal blogs or Twitter posts.Some teachers and start-ups said they were not aware of those guidelines.\u201cIf you are receiving any sort of incentive to promote the company\u2019s product, that is what we call a material relationship,\u201d said Mary K. Engle, associate director of the trade commission\u2019s division of advertising practices, \u201cand that has to be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the endorsement message.\u201dFor some teachers, corporate relationships can be steppingstones to lucrative speaking or training engagements. Schools often hire company-connected educators to give training sessions to their teachers. And technology conferences for teachers often book influential teachers as speakers.Ms. Delzer said her fees for such events started at several thousand dollars a day. Some veteran education influencers charge much more.To do it all, Ms. Delzer negotiated a special contract with her district, allowing her to take 10 unpaid days off a year. She uses those days off to give speeches and run teacher workshops for other schools.\u201cIt\u2019s like two full-time jobs,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.Just before 8:30 a.m. on school days, Ms. Delzer, 32, stations herself at the classroom door. She greets each of her third graders by name, ushering them in one by one with a brief shoulder squeeze. \u201cI want them to feel love when they walk in,\u201d she said.If her classroom looks less like a traditional schoolroom and more like a den \u2014 with a colorful rug and inspirational signs exhorting children to \u201cDREAM\u201d and \u201cLAUGH\u201d \u2014 that is no accident. A few years ago, Ms. Delzer decided to remodel her classroom to foster the kind of independent work habits she thought her students would need in life.So she ditched the standard-issue desks and rearranged the room to look more like the place where she goes to work on her conference talks: her local Starbucks. Today, her third graders sit wherever they please \u2014 on cushions, rocking chairs, balance balls.\u201cIf I\u2019m just feeling like relaxing, I usually sit on the rockers or the ball chairs or the beanbag chairs,\u201d Jennings, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class last spring, explained. \u201cBut if I want to be really, really focused, then I usually feel like going on something a little harder so that I don\u2019t lose concentration.\u201dSitting in her local Starbucks in West Fargo, Ms. Delzer noted: \u201cIf you Google \u2018Starbucks Classroom,\u2019 it\u2019s a thing now.\u201dBut Ms. Delzer said she did not start out seeking to influence the practice of teaching. It was serendipity, she said, and an iPad experiment.In 2011, Ms. Delzer\u2019s school, in Thief River Falls, Minn., bought a few iPads and asked her to try using them in class. Two years later, her school\u2019s technology director suggested that they speak at an education conference about her experiment.That was when Ms. Delzer realized, she said, that by addressing her peers, she could reach vastly more students.\u201cI see the ripple effect on teachers who leave the conference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to know that those classrooms are better because of it.\u201dToday, so many teachers from other districts want to visit her classroom that Mapleton Elementary has set aside every Tuesday to host them. \u201cWe limit it to four teachers a day,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.One morning last spring, Ms. Delzer assigned her third graders a math problem to solve on their iPads using Seesaw. Developed by two former Facebook product managers, Seesaw lets students produce and share their schoolwork as written notes, diagrams, audio recordings or videos.Some children love the sharing aspect. \u201cThey can see what you are doing now that we have Seesaw,\u201d McCoy, a third grader in Ms. Delzer\u2019s class, said of his parents. \u201cOther years they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were only able to see on your papers.\u201dTeaching, by nature, is a helping profession. And educators have a long tradition of sharing ideas with colleagues.Ms. Delzer said she did not see a conflict between her teaching and other activities. She said she deliberately divided her work, devoting herself to her students during school hours while giving conference talks on days off and working with companies on some school nights.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep the two things separate,\u201d she said.She added that she worked only with companies whose products she personally believed in. Those relationships, she said, gave her valuable access to resources that could benefit her students, colleagues and teacher followers.\u201cIf I am going to put my name on it, it either has to make learning better for students or teaching better for teachers,\u201d Ms. Delzer said.But companies that tap public-school teachers to use or promote their products in exchange for perks are effectively engaging the educators as consultants \u2014 a situation that could conflict with teachers\u2019 obligations to their employer: schools.\u201cVendors offering free technology to teachers for their personal or professional use in exchange for teachers promoting it to students or other teachers is a very questionable activity,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Tim Jacobson, the principal of Mapleton Elementary School, where Ms. Delzer teaches, offered a different view. He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201dMr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201dOne evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.He had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.Now, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.Mr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.This teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.If the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.But there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.Mr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.He left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.Among other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.And Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.Linda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.The Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.Last year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.Kittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.It was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.An hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.After dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.Ms. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.If her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.Every fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201dLest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton, in Book, Regrets Not Striking Back at James Comey", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cMy first instinct was that my campaign should hit back and explain that Mr. Comey had badly overstepped his bounds,\u201d she wrote in the book, her attempt to make sense of her electoral defeat by Donald J. Trump. But, she said, her campaign advisers talked her out of it, convincing her that it was better \u201cto just let it go and try to move on.\u201d\u201cLooking back,\u201d she concluded, \u201cthat was a mistake.\u201dIt is one of a catalog of mistakes \u2014 large and small \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton lists in a post-mortem titled \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d The book, published by Simon & Schuster and scheduled to come out on Tuesday, has provoked a mix of anticipation and dread from Democrats, many of whom are loath to revisit the election that vaulted Mr. Trump into the White House.Still, even a week before its publication date, \u201cWhat Happened\u201d has zoomed to the top of the Amazon best-seller rankings, attesting to the public\u2019s enduring fascination with Mrs. Clinton. The New York Times obtained an advance copy.Unlike Mrs. Clinton\u2019s last book, which chronicled her years as secretary of state and was meant to be a launchpad for her candidacy in 2016, this book is the work of someone no longer running for anything. From failing to frame a message that matched the restive mood of the electorate to failing to go after Senator Bernie Sanders more aggressively during the Democratic primaries, Mrs. Clinton accepts her share of blame for Mr. Trump\u2019s astonishing upset.But Mr. Comey\u2019s repeated interventions on the subject of her emails, Mrs. Clinton wrote, sapped her momentum, allowed Mr. Trump to paint her as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and turned voters away in the crucial closing days of the campaign. In the dark months since her defeat, she said, she tried not to dwell on how Mr. Comey had \u201cshivved\u201d her.The painful episode resurfaced again when Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as F.B.I. director and ordered the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to write a memo justifying his dismissal on the grounds that he had mishandled the investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201cI read Rosenstein\u2019s memo in disbelief,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHere was Trump\u2019s number two man at the Justice Department putting in writing all the things I\u2019d been thinking for months.\u201dMrs. Clinton said Mr. Comey\u2019s actions did not justify his ouster by Mr. Trump, since he later admitted that he fired Mr. Comey because he would not drop the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. But Mr. Comey still emerges as the biggest villain in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account. Beyond the director himself, she asserts that the F.B.I. was a hotbed of anti-Clinton fervor, declining to confirm the existence of a Trump-Russia investigation even as it disclosed every twist and turn of the email probe.\u201cThis man is going to be the death of me,\u201d Ms. Abedin said, before dissolving in tears in front of her boss.The news media, and The New York Times in particular, come in for scathing criticism by Mrs. Clinton for covering the email saga obsessively, while playing down evidence of links between Mr. Trump and Russia. The Times, she said, perpetuated the narrative that the Clintons had a penchant for secrecy, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve always found that charge odd.\u201dMrs. Clinton characterized The Times\u2019s coverage of her as schizophrenic, with reliable endorsements of her campaigns on the editorial page offset by persistently negative news coverage. \u201cI suppose this mini-rant guarantees that my book will receive a rip-her-to-shreds review in The Times,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut history will agree that this coverage affected the outcome of the election. Besides, I had to get this off my chest!\u201dWith other targets, Mrs. Clinton was more judicious, if still stinging. She disparaged Mr. Sanders as disruptive and hopelessly unrealistic in his proposals. And she criticized President Barack Obama for urging her not to attack Mr. Sanders during the primaries (\u201cI felt like I was in a straitjacket\u201d). She also mused about what would have happened if he had spoken out earlier, and more harshly, about President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s meddling in the election.She made a connection between Mr. Obama and what she called her biggest gaffe of the campaign: telling voters in Ohio, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d Mrs. Clinton insisted that the line was taken out of context, but said Mr. Obama had fed the narrative of Democratic hostility toward coal miners by announcing a plan that set state-by-state targets for carbon emissions reductions, and a framework for meeting them, at the White House, next to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.While Mrs. Clinton defended the tactics of her campaign \u2014 there is scant criticism of campaign aides like Robby Mook or John Podesta \u2014 she acknowledged it never developed a message that resonated with voters like \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d She also admitted to an unsettling sense, as she campaigned, that her campaign lacked the passion of Bill Clinton\u2019s run for the White House in 1992.\u201cI was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions, while Trump was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans\u2019 anger and resentment,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was giving speeches laying out how to resolve the country\u2019s problems. He was ranting on Twitter.\u201dIn sorting through the reasons for her defeat, Mrs. Clinton returns over and over to a single explanation: her gender.\u201cThis has to be said,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSexism and misogyny played a role in the 2016 presidential election. Exhibit A is that the flagrantly sexist candidate won.\u201dBy her own admission, Mrs. Clinton has not come to terms with losing to Mr. Trump. At a few points, she interrupted her narrative with bitter tangents about the president. In a line that has already attracted attention, she wrote that she considered saying, \u201cBack up, you creep, get away from me,\u201d when he hovered behind her during one of their debates.But she also concluded that Mr. Trump had rare skills as a presidential candidate. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give it to Trump \u2014 he\u2019s hateful,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to look away from him.\u201dAnd in a passage that will sadden her supporters as much as it satisfies her critics, Mrs. Clinton grappled with her limitations as a candidate and the hatred she generated among Republicans.\u201cWhat makes me such a lightning rod for fury?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m really asking. I\u2019m at a loss.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coming Home to a Shipping Container", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "Eco-friendly and affordable, shipping containers are gaining popularity as an alternative to traditional houses.Supported byTim Steele stood outside a pair of orange shipping containers on a hillside about two hours northwest of New York City. The large metal cargo door swung wide to reveal a small mudroom inside the corrugated walls, and beyond that an expansive living room, kitchen and small bathroom. Several tall windows looked out on the Catskill Mountains, a vista that stretched for miles.The rooms inside these shipping containers might easily be mistaken for those inside any of the timber-framed homes in the hillside country here. In the kitchen, one wall exposed the bright orange corrugated surface of the Corten steel container, but elsewhere evidence of the structure\u2019s origins was scant.Building with shipping containers isn\u2019t exactly new, but until recently it hasn\u2019t been exactly mainstream either. Now, though, it is becoming a lot more popular, as eco-friendly practices begin to influence market trends. Containers are loved by the hip and the practical, artisans and DIY-ers, engineers and construction foremen, as they are both sustainable and affordable. And used 20- or 40-foot containers can be obtained for as little as several hundred dollars apiece, so it\u2019s not surprising that some industry professionals consider them the future of home building.\u201cMore of the population has been educated on sustainability and ecological principles,\u201d said Paul Galvin, the chairman, chief executive and a founder of SG Blocks, a publicly traded company that repurposes maritime-grade cargo shipping containers that can hold as much as 64,000 pounds. Mr. Galvin\u2019s biggest client is the military \u2014 which turns those containers into housing, mess halls, computer server storage and commissaries, among other structures \u2014 but he believes shipping containers work just as well on a small scale.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimately green option for the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to cost them more; this isn\u2019t a green solution that requires government subsidy.\u201d\u201cAnything that\u2019s seaworthy is construction-worthy,\u201d said Mr. Galvin, whose company gets its material from ConGlobal Industries, which sells shipping containers of varied age and quality. All containers are subject to strict international standards, he pointed out, but even so, his team carefully inspects each one before using it in a project: \u201cWe\u2019ve established that they perform as good as, or better than, code requires.\u201d15 PhotosMost containers are now a standard size: about eight feet wide, or two feet wider than a California king mattress; eight and a half feet high; and either 20 or 40 feet long. And containerization \u2014 also referred to as intermodal freight transportation \u2014 is seen as the innovation that has made services like next-day delivery and Amazon Prime possible.It might also be the innovation that makes construction easier and more affordable, as suggested by the growing number of shipping-container structures around the world.New York, alone, has many examples: In Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, for example, there is a townhouse on Irving Place bisected by shipping containers. In Williamsburg, 21 steel containers were used to create a three-container-high house on a 20-by-40-foot lot. In Manhattan, a container serves as a master bedroom for a penthouse with Empire State Building views. And upstate, there are many more such structures.Mr. Steele, who works in Manhattan but lives in the Catskills, has built four container homes in that area in the last seven years. Sims Foster, 41, and his wife, Kirsten Harlow Foster, 37, own one of them, in Youngsville. Made from two 40-foot containers set side-by-side, the 640-square-foot, one-bedroom house has a linear kitchen, a living-and-dining area with a fireplace and cedar facing on the exterior.Farther west, in Callicoon Center, is another of Mr. Steele\u2019s houses: a 1,760-square-foot home with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, built out of four containers lined up in a row.The house, which resembles a wood-framed barn, isn\u2019t any louder than a conventional home, said Terry Maxedon, 60, who shares it with his wife, Amy Fisch, 63. In fact, there is only one thing about it that reminds them they are living in a shipping container: Instead of hanging pictures on the wall with nails, they use magnets. \u201cI think that\u2019s a nice feature,\u201d Mr. Steele said.Of course, not all container homes are so elaborate.When Pamela Reed, 33, and Matthew Rader, 34, virtual reality directors in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, decided they needed to escape the city, they were content with the plain, unmodified container they put on seven acres they bought in Hobart, N.Y. \u201cWe always kind of liked the aesthetic \u2014 the raw, modern boxiness of it,\u201d Mr. Rader said.\u201cWe want to raise our kid in the city,\u201d said Mr. Rader, who has a newborn daughter. \u201cAnd the plan is to have it as a getaway place, a good small farm.\u201d Already, they are producing large quantities of tomatoes, corn, beans, peas, carrots and pumpkins, he said, and as far as the container goes, \u201cWe\u2019re not finished by any means.\u201dBack in Brooklyn, mobility is sometimes the biggest appeal.\u201cThat is the reason we preferred a modular design,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we can easily take it apart and relocate it to another location, with the possibility of expansion. The containers will be a retreat for myself, and I\u2019ll rent it out on Airbnb.\u201d\u201cWe just saw a possibility for a unique beach rental,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said. \u201cWe\u2019re also from a port city, so there were containers everywhere. It wasn\u2019t some obscure idea.\u201dEven so, their rentals were so controversial when they were being built, Ms. Godbold said, that a nearby community made it illegal to build container homes there. \u201cThe local newspaper would run a picture of them looking as horrible as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cFor six weeks straight.\u201dShe and Ms. Sinclair worked with Jeremy Hardison, senior planner with the town of Carolina Beach, to bring their idea to life. Mr. Hardison said he saw it as an exciting opportunity for something new in a place that favors unique design.And despite the initial resistance, he believes the area will see more container homes in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re open to the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like the idea of alternate and sustainable construction methods.\u201dFinally, there\u2019s the instant-gratification factor.Mr. Ligano and his partner, Ada Tolla, have been working with shipping containers since the early 1990s, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Chile, Australia, South Korea and South Africa, among other countries. Many of the designs, he said, have been \u201cvery high-end, in the direction of a contemporary, conceptual, gritty style.\u201dThe 5,000-square-foot building, slated for completion next year, will include a kayak-launching site and classroom space for the New York Harbor School. Equally notable, however, is that it will be built to withstand the effects of future storms like Hurricane Sandy.And if there\u2019s anything that can do that, it\u2019s a shipping container.The cover article last Sunday about the use of shipping containers in home building misstated the location of a home in Sullivan County, N.Y. It is two hours northwest of New York City, not two hours northeast. The article also misstated the occupation and birthplace of Malcom Purcell McLean, the man who came up with the idea of shipping containers. Mr. McLean was a trucker from North Carolina, not a longshoreman from New Jersey.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Amazon Pushes Forward With Robots, Workers Find New Roles", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLORENCE, N.J. \u2014 Nissa Scott started working at the cavernous Amazon warehouse in southern New Jersey late last year, stacking plastic bins the size of small ottomans. It was not, she says, the most stimulating activity. And lifting the bins, which often weigh 25 pounds each, was also tiring over 10-hour shifts.Now Ms. Scott, 21, watches her replacement \u2014 a giant, bright yellow mechanical arm \u2014 do the stacking.Her new job at Amazon is to babysit several robots at a time, troubleshooting them when necessary and making sure they have bins to load. On a recent afternoon, a claw at end of the arm grabbed a bin off a conveyor belt and stacked it on another bin, forming neat columns on wooden pallets surrounding the robot. It was the first time Amazon had shown the arm, the latest generation of robots in use at its warehouses, to a reporter.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most mentally challenging thing we have here,\u201d Ms. Scott said of her new job. \u201cIt\u2019s not repetitive.\u201dComplicating the equation even more, Amazon is also on the forefront of automation, finding new ways of getting robots to do the work once handled by employees. In 2014, the company began rolling out robots to its warehouses using machines originally developed by Kiva Systems, a company Amazon bought for $775 million two years earlier and renamed Amazon Robotics. Amazon now has more than 100,000 robots in action around the world, and it has plans to add many more to the mix.The robots make warehouse work less tedious and physically taxing, while also enabling the kinds of efficiency gains that let a customer order dental floss after breakfast and receive it before dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that Amazon would not be able to operate at the costs they have and the costs they provide customers without this automation,\u201d said Martin Ford, a futurist and author of \u201cRise of the Robots,\u201d a book about automation. \u201cMaybe we wouldn\u2019t be getting two-day shipping.\u201dThe dynamics between people and machines play out on a daily basis on the floor of Amazon warehouses in places like Florence, N.J., and Kent, Wash. In Kent, the robots vaguely resemble giant beetles and scurry around with vertical shelves loaded with merchandise weighing up to 3,000 pounds on their backs. Hundreds of them move autonomously inside a large caged area, tailgating each other but not colliding.On one edge of the cage, a group of human workers \u2014 the \u201cstowers\u201d \u2014 stuff products onto the shelves, replenishing their inventory. The robots whisk those shelves away and when a customer order arrives for products stored on their backs, they queue up at stations on another edge of the cage like cars waiting to go through a toll both.There, human \u201cpickers\u201d follow instructions on computer screens, grabbing items off the shelves and putting them in plastic bins, which then disappear on conveyor belts destined for \u201cpackers,\u201d people who put the products in cardboard boxes bound for customers.Dave Clark, the top executive in charge of operations at Amazon, said the company wanted the machines to perform the most monotonous tasks, leaving people to do jobs that engage them mentally.\"It\u2019s a new item each time,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cYou\u2019re finding something, you\u2019re inspecting things, you\u2019re engaging your mind in a way that I think is important.\"The robots also cut down on the walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less tired. The robots also allow Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic, because they no longer need aisle space for humans. The greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers.The Amazon warehouse in Florence shows the latest example of the kinds of jobs machines can do better than people. Eight mechanical arms are in operation at the facility, a warehouse where large quantities of merchandise are broken down into smaller units and distributed to Amazon fulfillment centers across the country.Amazon began installing them late last year, not long after it opened the warehouse in Florence. The robot arm is configured to pick up only bins of a standard size, not objects of other dimensions. In a demonstration of future possibilities, Amazon showed a virtual reality simulation used to prototype new robot concepts, including an arm with a forklift attachment that moved pallets.When Amazon installed the robots, some people who had stacked bins before, like Ms. Scott, took courses at the company to become robot operators. Many others moved to receiving stations, where they manually sort big boxes of merchandise into bins. No people were laid off when the robots were installed, and Amazon found new roles for the displaced workers, Mr. Clark said.\u201cThe people didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said.The question going forward is: What happens when the future generations of robots arrive?Mr. Ford, the author, believes it is just a matter of time before the employment picture in Amazon\u2019s warehouses changes.\u201cMy assumption is this technology will eventually displace a lot of people in those warehouses,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cI would not say that overnight huge numbers of jobs disappear. Maybe the first indication is they don\u2019t get rid of those people but the pace of job creation slows down.\u201dAmazon\u2019s Mr. Clark said history showed that automation increases productivity and, in some cases, demand from consumers, which ultimately creates more jobs. He said warehouse workers would continue to work in technologically rich environments.\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that automation destroys net job growth,\u201d he said.In the case of the Florence facility, it opened up the new opportunity for Ms. Scott.At one point, one of the arms knocked over a tote, sending a dozen or so cone-shaped plastic coffee filters skidding across the ground. Ms. Scott hit a button that froze the arm so she could safely pick up the mess.Then the arms started working again.\u201cThe robot will work the same all day long,\u201d said Edward Cohoon, who supervises Ms. Scott and other Amazon workers as they tend to individual robots. \u201cTheir stomachs don\u2019t grumble.\u201dEarlier versions of the captions for the pictures of a robotic arm in Florence, N.J., and human \u201cpickers\u201d were reversed.Follow Nick Wingfield on Twitter @nickwingfield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Overmonitored Nursery", "Date": "2017-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne evening a few days after we brought baby Ella home from the hospital, my husband, Dave, walked into the bedroom carrying what looked to be a tiny neon Grecian sandal.\u201cIt\u2019s a smart sock,\u201d he said, as our wee addition made pterodactyl sounds in her bassinet. \u201cIt\u2019ll link to our phones and alert us if her heart rate slows or her oxygen level plummets.\u201dDave is a tech entrepreneur who spends off hours trolling futurist websites, envisioning a world in which self-driving cars deliver you lab-grown meat while an earbud simultaneously translates a conversation between you and 14 far-flung individuals.Cut to: an hour later. A piercingly shrill electronic version of \u201cHush Little Baby\u201d blares through our room as a blue neon light strobes frantically. I leap out of bed in a panic. I check on Ella. She is in a deep sleep, breathing fine. Dave and I finally locate the source of the sound and light show \u2014 the \u201cbase station\u201d that communicates with the sock. Turns out it had lost connection to our shoddy Wi-Fi and was just letting us know, in its earsplitting, alarming way.That incident probably took years off my life. After another wee-hours-of-the-morning baby rave, I unplugged the thing and shoved it in the closet.After weeks of being notified at work when Ella was crying or moving around (read: being a baby) and hours sunk addictively scrolling in fast-forward to see her move around in her sleep, it dawned on me that all this technology, which purportedly calms agitated parents, actually agitates them more. This goes for the more cutting-edge gadgets that monitor vital signs, but is equally apparent in straight up video monitors, some of which will now sync up with Amazon\u2019s new video-enabled Echo Show.So, is all this info just noise? I called my pediatrician, Dr. Michael Yaker, a founding partner of Westside Pediatrics in Manhattan and a faculty member of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\u201cIn general, do the vital signs of healthy babies need to be monitored regularly? Absolutely not,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf it makes a parent more comfortable with a situation, fine, but I wouldn\u2019t make any actionable medical decisions based on it.\u201d And in the cases of unhealthy babies? Preemies who are leaving the neonatal intensive care unit, perhaps?\u201cIf your baby needs to be on a monitor regularly tracking vital signs, your baby is likely not ready to be discharged from the hospital,\u201d he said.So, when it comes to noise, a resounding yes.And yet: Most of the friends I called, all with healthy babies, admitted that monitoring their monitors had become a habit they couldn\u2019t break.\u201cThe French aren\u2019t against baby monitors, but they\u2019re suspicious of extremes \u2014 including extreme surveillance of otherwise healthy kids,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThey understand that, at the beginning of the baby\u2019s life, you\u2019re setting the tone for family life going forward.

{"Headline": "Internet Giants Face New Political Resistance in Washington", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.\u201cThere is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.\u201cWe are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\u201d said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview. \u201cThe growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\u201dPerhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\u201d Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement.Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook\u2019s discussions with the lawmakers were private.\u201cWe strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.\u201cSilicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \u201cBut selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\u201dOther issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.Even Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Begin Legal Assault on Trump\u2019s Move to End \u2018Dreamer\u2019 Program", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s immigration policies faced a renewed legal onslaught on Wednesday, as a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, nonprofit groups and private companies announced they would oppose his rollback of Obama-era protections for people who entered the country illegally as children.In an echo of the campaign against Mr. Trump\u2019s effort this year to ban travelers from parts of the Muslim world, a group of 16 attorneys general \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 filed suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, claiming that Mr. Trump had improperly upended the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA.Led by Attorneys General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Bob Ferguson of Washington, they alleged Mr. Trump\u2019s shift was driven by racial animus toward Mexican Americans and that the Trump administration failed to follow federal rules governing executive policy making.On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration would phase out DACA beginning next March. The decision came as a group of Republican attorneys general threatened to sue the administration if it did not end the program.Announcing the legal challenge Wednesday alongside a crowd of young immigrants and immigration advocates, Mr. Schneiderman accused the Trump administration of using the threat of lawsuits as a \u201cpretext\u201d that hid the president\u2019s true motives: bias against immigrants and Latinos.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s lawsuit said that \u201cending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President Trump\u2019s oft-stated commitments \u2014 whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof \u2014 to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\u201dIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cWe think the court will take a look at what\u2019s behind the change in policy and conclude that the rationales offered yesterday don\u2019t make any sense.\u201dAdditional lawsuits are expected: Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California, a Democrat, intends to file a separate challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, according to people briefed on his plans. Several major companies intend to join the lawsuits, and two, Microsoft and Amazon, have pledged to pay the legal expenses of any employees who become vulnerable to deportation.The loosely coordinated legal strategy faces uncertain prospects, and may represent a kind of precautionary measure for supporters of DACA, who are also engaged in a ferocious campaign aimed at spurring Congress to pass a law protecting people in the program from deportation. The litigation is likely to become a political rallying point for opponents of Mr. Trump, and should the legislative effort fizzle, a court challenge could become an alternative vehicle to derail or delay his policies.To some extent, the court battle could reproduce some of the arguments surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions, pitting the traditionally sweeping powers of the presidency against claims that this particular administration, on a specific matter of policy, had misused its authority.But presidents typically have broad discretion in matters related to national security and border control, and legal opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy are in the awkward position of arguing that while President Barack Obama had the presidential authority to create DACA, Mr. Trump does not have the authority to freely undo it. And the government can also assert that undercutting Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to rescind the program would impinge on his power to enforce immigration law.Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, said Mr. Obama\u2019s program was always going to be vulnerable to the whims of his successor.\u201cIt\u2019d be rather curious if President Trump could not use the same authority that President Obama used to create DACA,\u201d Mr. Turley said. Echoing conservative arguments that Mr. Obama had overstepped his power, he added: \u201cThis is a problem you have when you ignore the constitutional structure. This matter should\u2019ve always remained in Congress.\u201dBesides the argument that the Trump administration has violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution, the lawsuit filed Wednesday makes a more complex claim, saying that the administration failed to follow the right process, under the Administrative Procedure Act, for shutting down Mr. Obama\u2019s program.The states argue that DACA had become so entrenched in the immigration system that to abruptly end it was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and that such a U-turn demanded a better explanation than what administration officials offered on Tuesday.\u201cNumerous public officials from both political parties have reinforced the federal government\u2019s promise to provide continuity and fair treatment to DACA grantees, and have recognized that DACA grantees have relied on the government\u2019s representations in applying for DACA,\u201d the lawsuit said.Michael J. Wishnie, a professor at Yale Law School who is helping to sue the administration on behalf of a DACA recipient in a separate lawsuit, said officials were, of course, allowed to change a policy.\u201cBut when people have come to rely on it,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have to explain themselves.\u201dAndrew J. Pincus, a Washington-based lawyer who has argued frequently before the Supreme Court, suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to DACA might be vulnerable in court, in part because he had done relatively little to justify it as a matter of policy.The Trump administration has cast its withdrawal of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy largely as a matter of legal necessity, arguing that DACA would be unlikely to survive the expected challenge from Republican attorneys general. Devin O\u2019Malley, a spokesman for the Justice Department, defended the DACA announcement as a corrective to Obama administration overreach.\u201cWhile the plaintiffs in today\u2019s lawsuits may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this administration\u2019s position,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said.But Mr. Pincus said that if a court finds the underlying DACA policy is legal, it could unravel that rationale.\u201cThe whole basis for rescinding DACA is the conclusion that it\u2019s illegal,\u201d said Mr. Pincus, who is a supporter of the Obama administration policy. \u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, your decision is arbitrary and an abuse of discretion.\u201dIn the short term, the legal offensive may help galvanize further political opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, offering activists, businesses and other interest groups a way of magnifying their objections through court filings and placing additional pressure on lawmakers to act. A number of private companies, including Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, have filed or are expected to file briefs supporting the multistate lawsuit.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, indicated the company would use its considerable resources to oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s policy in other ways: He said in a blog post on Tuesday that Microsoft would pay for the legal costs of any employee the government threatens to deport, and the company said in a legal document that 39 DACA beneficiaries were \u201cemployees or current or recent interns.\u201dLike Microsoft, Amazon said it intended to pay for legal representation for its affected employees, and stated in a legal filing on Wednesday that it had identified nine employees who qualified.Several state attorneys general said they were taking steps to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy in other ways. Mr. Schneiderman said his most immediate concern was to protect the sensitive information immigrants had supplied to the government while applying for DACA status, including addresses and fingerprints.Immigration officials said on Tuesday that information would not be \u201cproactively\u201d used to arrest the immigrants after DACA expires but could be made available for criminal and national security investigations.Mr. Becerra said the forthcoming litigation from his office would be one part of a larger strategy to marshal resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in the court of law or in the court of public opinion, we\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Mr. Becerra said.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Keep on Top of Technology When You Write About It", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter based in Seattle, discussed the tech he is using.You cover Amazon and Microsoft. Do you use their technology?The one technology constant in my career as a journalist seems to be Microsoft Word. I take notes for all of my stories in it on a MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve tried Google Docs and OneNote, but can\u2019t stick with them for reasons I can\u2019t explain. I have a feeling I might be cremated with a copy of Microsoft Word.What do or don\u2019t you like about their tech products that you use?I find some of the things you can do on the Echo pretty silly and much easier on a smartphone app. I\u2019ll give you an example. A while back I was installing a sprinkler system in my garden that was connected to a wireless control unit. I found out I could use the control unit with Alexa to turn on the sprinklers with my voice.What are your favorite websites, apps or other tech tools for keeping on top of technology news?I get so much of my news diet, technology or otherwise, through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. I have configured my phone to send me a text message every time Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, tweets because he\u2019ll occasionally make news that way.What tech gadgets or apps are you or your family currently obsessed with and why?I am a contrarian on the Apple Watch, which I believe has been unfairly maligned by tech pundits. I love mine, and I get pretty frustrated by a lot of Apple products. I\u2019m a runner and cyclist and track all of my workouts with it. I use Siri on the watch to respond to text messages.Apple somehow managed to create a wearable device versatile enough that you can wear it on a run and with a suit. That\u2019s impressive.Are there technologies that you\u2019re not crazy about?I\u2019ve never cared for reading books on screens, even though I almost exclusively read newspapers and magazines on my phone and computer.I don\u2019t play video games. My son does. I\u2019m embarrassed to say he spent a decent chunk of the summer wasting bad guys in Call of Duty. He also read a big stack of books and is a sweet, sensitive kid, which is how he got away with it.What\u2019s your advice about how much or how little kids should be on their devices and on games? This is such a difficult issue. Most of my daughter\u2019s homework is on a computer so policing her screen time is really about limiting certain applications or websites. The other day I gave her a hard time when I heard her listening to YouTube. It was for her Spanish class.Overall, I try to encourage personal responsibility rather than hassle my kids all the time about their devices. It has worked so far.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Data Breach Victims Talk of Initial Terror, Then Vigilance", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne man said his name had been used to set up a fraudulent company that processed payments made with stolen credit cards. A woman said her bank had told her she was being sought by a collections agency \u2014 her Social Security number had been used to open a wireless account that was never paid off.In the wake of the disclosure on Thursday by Equifax that hackers had compromised its collection of private information, potentially affecting 143 million Americans, The New York Times asked readers to tell their own tales of being hacked. Some previous victims of data breaches have also taken to Twitter.David Anderson said his personal information had been stolen four times in four years.In 2015, an intrusion into computer systems for the government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management affected 21.5 million people. Mr. Anderson, a business school professor in New York, was one of them.And then there was the breach at Equifax, one of the country\u2019s three major credit monitoring agencies. Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers and other sensitive data for 143 million Americans were in the mix, the company said.But Mr. Anderson was lucky: The thieves have not used his information so far.But hackings often go unnoticed \u2014 at first.One man said the thieves had so ruined his credit, he was unable to secure a needed mortgage refinance.Janis Barbour said her Social Security number was used to fraudulently file taxes in Ohio. She and her husband live in Berkeley, Calif.They learned of the theft only when the Internal Revenue Service confronted them for not declaring a tax refund as income. And that was just one problem.Her credit card details were stolen in data breaches at Target and Home Depot, she said. A digital attack at her health insurance provider made more private information vulnerable.She said she had spent nine months trying to get the I.R.S. to agree that her identity was stolen. She had to report the intrusion to local police, then file an affidavit, then contact the credit bureaus and then the Ohio government.Ms. Barbour, a retired marketing researcher, said she has never had a physical credit card or Social Security card stolen. Several years ago, she and her husband locked their credit reports from activity from outside parties.Then on Friday, she learned she and her husband were included in the Equifax breach. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s nothing you can really do to protect yourself,\u201d she said.As a result, consumers like Kate Fairweather say they feel that they cannot prevent their information from leaking into the shadows of the internet.\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, here we go again\u2019,\u201d said Ms. Fairweather, an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who found out this week that the Equifax attack made her data vulnerable two years after it was stolen in the Office of Personnel Management hacking.Michael Harwood, an engineering manager in Melbourne, Fla., said his information was stolen two years ago.\u201cInitially, it\u2019s really terrifying, especially having your Social Security number taken,\u201d said Mr. Harwood, who noticed a mysterious attempt to transfer $1,000 from his bank account. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about the tremendous implications this could have and the possibility of it going on for years.\u201dHe said he had managed to trace the transaction through his PayPal account to his eBay profile, where he discovered an intrusion that laid bare a trove of personal information.He spent the next month trying to repair the breach. He went to the local police station, set up a program to screen for suspicious activity stemming from his Social Security number and financial data, changed his eBay password and created a new bank account.That meant a long wait for new credit and debt cards, a temporary freeze of his assets and a hold on withdrawals and transfers while the bank handled the move.\u201cThat was a major pain,\u201d Mr. Harwood said, adding that his original account and routing numbers had been linked to a slew of automated payments and shopping sites, including Amazon and travel booking sites. \u201cIt ends up being fairly far-reaching and inconvenient \u2014 you\u2019re still making discoveries months later that there\u2019s another account you have to correct.\u201dHe said he now watched his accounts closely and signed up for services from LifeLock, an identity theft protection company. He also counts his blessings.\u201cIt could\u2019ve been much worse.\u201dThere are more reasons than ever to protect your personal information, as major website breaches become ever more frequent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s $1.3 Billion Fine in Europe Requires Review, Court Says", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The highest court in the European Union ruled on Wednesday that Intel\u2019s $1.3 billion antitrust fine get a second look, a decision that could ease some of the legal pressure that American tech giants face in the region.The order, which will send the Intel case back to a lower court for review, is a blow to a sweeping regulatory crackdown in Europe that has ensnared American household names like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. It could also embolden these technology companies, which have long complained that officials in Europe target them unfairly, to challenge the rulings and investigations against them.The case, and its outcome, plays to the legal headaches for Silicon Valley in Europe. The European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has made technology companies a central focus, with investigations into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The companies all deny any wrongdoing.The commission said that such rebates, offered to manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC, were anticompetitive. That argument raised questions about whether some common practices in the digital world, such as the bundling of products or services, could violate antitrust rules.It did not strike down the original ruling, but experts said the decision to send the case back to a lower court was a good sign for businesses looking to offer rebates to customers in exchange for exclusivity deals.\u201cThis decision is the right one for business, consumers, and E.U. antitrust law and policy,\u201d said Dave Anderson, an antitrust partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. \u201cExclusivity rebates are no longer considered in the E.U. as inherently anticompetitive.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line for Intel,\u201d Mr. Anderson added, \u201cis that Intel lives to fight another day.\u201dThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up 2 percent, to $35.72, in midday trading in New York.\u201cWe welcome today\u2019s landmark ruling,\u201d Steven R. Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said. \u201cWhile this case concerns events that happened more than a decade ago, we have always believed that our actions were lawful and did not harm competition. We look forward to the next step in this process.\u201dStill, some critics, particularly in the United States, say Europe\u2019s antitrust officials have too much power to levy fines and to force companies to change business practices without prior court orders.The ruling on Wednesday will give businesses more confidence that they could win a case on appeal if they come under investigation, said Veronica Roberts, a London-based partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, a law firm.\u201cThis gives them more confidence that a defense that they put forward could be reviewed,\u201d she said.The European Commission gave a cautious response when asked what the latest ruling would mean for other technology companies under investigation in Europe, and whether it would give those firms confidence to pursue legal challenges rather than to reach financial settlements.\u201cI cannot comment how companies will proceed or assess the judgment,\u201d Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news conference. \u201cWe ourselves still have to look carefully into the details of the judgment.\u201dThe chip-making industry, including Intel, has changed markedly since the case was brought.Intel was being investigated for its actions from 2002 to 2007. At one point, the company controlled 70 percent of the market for microchips, according to the European Commission. Known for its \u201cIntel Inside\u201d advertising slogan, the company dominated the market for personal computers.But since then, Intel has seen demand for PCs deteriorate, as consumers have shifted to buying increasingly powerful smartphones and tablets, a sector in which chip makers like Qualcomm, ARM and Samsung are major suppliers.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Amie Tsang from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: A Deadly Outbreak Stalks San Diego", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In a typical year, San Diego County might see a few dozen cases of hepatitis A.So far this year? More than 400, with 15 people now killed by the liver disease.\u201cThis is an outbreak like none other that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region\u2019s public health officer.Dr. Wooten said the response has been complicated by the infection\u2019s nebulous spread. Whereas past outbreaks have commonly been traced to a single food source, allowing the threat to be swiftly contained, this one is passing person to person.San Diego\u2019s homeless population has been hit hardest by the virus, which stalks its victims more readily in areas of poor sanitation.But none on the scale of San Diego.Highly contagious, hepatitis A causes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and jaundice. It\u2019s treatable, but can knock a victim out for weeks.San Diego health workers have been trying to slow its spread since March, when an uptick in cases was detected. More than 19,000 people have gotten the first of two immunization shots, administered six months apart.Besides vaccination, temporary hand-washing stations help provide a defense against the virus\u2019s spread.\u201cIn hindsight you can always say, \u2018Could we do more?\u2019\u201d said Greg Cox, a San Diego County supervisor. \u201cI\u2019m not happy that it took so long to get the hand-washing stations out there. But the real key \u2014 the best prevention \u2014 is going to be the vaccinations.\u201dMr. Cox said the crisis represented a wake up call on the plight of San Diego\u2019s homeless.\u201cClearly there\u2019s a relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really need to get to the root cause of this hep A crisis in San Diego, which is really related to the homeless crisis.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Clara Foltz was not easily deterred.A divorced mother of five living in 19th-century San Jose, she resolved to practice law.But at the time, only white men were allowed to do so.So she drafted the \u201cWoman Lawyer\u2019s Bill\u201d and convinced a state lawmaker to introduce it. The measure prevailed over the warnings of opponents that a woman\u2019s \u201cseductive\u201d ways would sway juries.Later, Ms. Foltz was said to have charged uninvited into Gov. William Irwin\u2019s office and pleaded with him to sign the bill. He did.It was this week in 1878 that Ms. Foltz passed the bar exam, making her California\u2019s first female lawyer.\u201cSometimes she would be the only woman in the courtroom and talking to this all-male jury. It\u2019s a wonderful scene I think,\u201d she said.Every move Ms. Foltz made, it seemed, resulted in another milestone.She sued Hastings College of Law in San Francisco to compel it to allow women, and won.She pioneered the idea of the public defender.She became the first woman to serve as clerk of the state Assembly\u2019s judiciary committee, the first woman deputy district attorney in the United States and the first woman appointed to the state board of corrections.After practicing law for five decades, Ms. Foltz died in 1934 at the age of 85.In 2002, Los Angeles\u2019s Criminal Courts Building was renamed in her honor. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was there for the ceremony.The California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio and the Politics of iPhone City", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThe idea, which manages at once to be bloodless and blood-boiling, is to fill apartment buildings, gyms, dormitories and so on with app-accessed \u201cpantries,\u2019\u2019 known to previous generations as \u201cvending machines,\u201d and pack them with the sort of things typically found in corner stores but catered to the micro-demographics of particular environments \u2014 paper towels, seltzer, Pirate\u2019s Booty, condoms, cans of chick peas. The human element is conveniently expunged.It is easy to imagine what other politicians past and present would consider doing to two guys who believed that what New York or any city needed was the automation of a serendipitous neighborhood shopping experience \u2014 wrap them in drop cloth and duct tape and send them somewhere toward the Panama Canal. It is hard to think of Mr. de Blasio, who addresses New Yorkers as \u201cbrothers and sisters,\u201d a humorously distancing trope he deploys in his campaign emails as if he were unionizing graduate students at Cornell, getting similarly impassioned.For a long while now the commentariat has wondered how it is that four more years of Mr. de Blasio, who, despite clear successes, still grates on so many of his constituents, could be considered an inevitability. Part of the answer is certainly rooted in the mechanics of the system \u2014 term limits keep potentially serious challengers in the jobs they have until they no longer have them and can mount campaigns more easily. But at a deeper level of the city\u2019s neurology, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s supreme belief in his own way of doing things, his taste for patronizing lecture, his tendency to justify an absence of humility on the grounds that he is driven by virtue above all, seem well synchronized to the invasion of an equally righteous Silicon Valley ethos, and the culture of disconnection it choreographs.At the moment and timed to the mayoral election, Mr. de Blasio is the subject of a book called, \u201cThe Pragmatist.\u2019\u2019 Nine days after it landed, it ranked 74,762 on Amazon, which would only seem to further confirm Mr. de Blasio\u2019s limited prospects for becoming a face of the counterinsurgency in Trump America. Were Mr. de Blasio more popular, this might have been one of the rare occasions in which a local election involving an incumbent produced a vibrant turnout. This is, in part, because of the national conversation on the renewed importance of state and municipal elections, but also because of the depth of antipathy for the current president in New York and what it would mean to come out in a strong gesture of support for a progressive politician. Under the most amicable of circumstances, mayors have to do battle with the federal government to maintain and increase city funding.During Tuesday\u2019s primary in the city, Brooklyn voters were asked to elect five civil court judges out of a slate of 11 \u2014 women won all of the slots and not because they were, across the board, more liberal than their male contestants.

The largest conference room in the Tulsa, Okla., mayor\u2019s office has been converted to a war room, with 50 volunteers poring over videos of Mr. Bezos.In Philadelphia, hundreds of Wharton Business School students have a new fall semester assignment: Pitch the city to Amazon. And the mayor of Ottawa flew to Seattle last week to walk as close to Amazon\u2019s headquarters as is publicly accessible.\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018The Amazing Race,\u2019\u201d said Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this cast of characters running toward the Holy Grail.\u201dThat sometimes means going to extreme lengths to draw Mr. Bezos\u2019 eye. Is Mr. Bezos impressed?\u201cWe\u2019re energized by the response,\u201d said Adam Sedo, an Amazon spokesman. \u201cWe invited cities to think big, and we are starting to see their creativity.\u201dFor Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city of 160,000 about a half-hour drive from Dallas, the courtship includes offering to build his city around Amazon.\u201cOur city\u2019s only about 60 percent built out, so we\u2019ve got a lot of available land where we can build to suit,\u201d Mr. Cheney said. \u201cWe play to win. We\u2019re innovators. We\u2019re forward thinkers, and we\u2019re serious.\u201dCity applications are not due until Oct. 19, but Mr. Cheney has already sent a video letter to Amazon. The video opens on him holding an Amazon box and saying, \u201cAmazon, you\u2019re growing your business, and we want to grow with you.\u201d Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is seen talking about catching the \u201cFrisco Flu,\u201d which the mayor\u2019s office said was a phrase Mr. Jones came up with. Mr. Cheney also gets a Jamba Juice (Jamba Juice is based in Frisco).Mayoral letters to Amazon are actually becoming a YouTube subgenre.In Canada, the selling point is, well, Canada.\u201cAmazon has something like 9,000 engineering jobs they can\u2019t fill. Our immigration policy is much more liberal,\u201d said Mr. Watson, Ottawa\u2019s mayor. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have an advantage.\u201dAnother city offering access to Canadian immigration as part of its deal is, surprisingly, Detroit. Working with nearby Windsor, Ontario, which is an eight-minute drive away, Detroit is portraying itself as the best of both worlds.Mr. Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, has also built an Amazon war room, where more than 40 people are trying to analyze what the online retailer \u201clikes and doesn\u2019t like.\u201d They are also trying to read Mr. Bezos\u2019 psyche. \u201cHe\u2019s got hundreds of hours of videos on YouTube you can watch,\u201d Mr. Gilbert said.Mr. Gilbert is the largest private property owner in downtown Detroit, and he said he would move his tenants to temporary locations to make room for Amazon so the company did not have to wait for new offices to be built.Competitions for factories or stadiums are typically more private, but this one is playing out in the court of public opinion, said Lauren Hitt, who is managing the public side of the campaign for Philadelphia.\u201cThe competition started that Thursday morning when he announced it,\u201d Ms. Hitt said of Mr. Bezos. \u201cThe next weeks are basically going to be a sustained campaign.\u201dPhiladelphia\u2019s effort includes students from the Wharton School writing variations on the very same pitch: why Amazon should come to Philadelphia. This was the school\u2019s idea, said Ms. Hitt. Dozens of start-ups have also been asked to submit testimonials about the city\u2019s innovation economy and advice on how to approach Amazon.And Philadelphia, which sent a delegation to Seattle last week, is sending a larger delegation this week to \u201cget into the Jeff Bezos mind-set and ethos,\u201d Ms. Hitt said.The city would also consider overhauling its tax system for Amazon.\u201cHaving Amazon would mean global things for our tax system,\u201d Ms. Hitt said. \u201cWe do have business taxes, but that\u2019s something that could be looked at in the scope of Amazon coming here.\u201dG. T. Bynum, the mayor of Tulsa, which set up its own Amazon war room in his office, echoed Philadelphia\u2019s sentiment on taxes. He said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t worry at all\u201d about tax incentives going too far. \u201cThese are 50,000 jobs with the most innovative company in the world.\u201d\u201cWhatever it takes,\u201d he said.Tax policy experts are more skeptical of Amazon\u2019s bidding process and how much cities stand to benefit.\u201cWhy are they doing this whole dog and pony show? Amazon wants something for nothing,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cThey would like a package of tax incentives for something they were going to do anyway.\u201dArt Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, called Amazon\u2019s bidding process \u2014 and the broader practice of cities competing for stadiums and factories \u2014 \u201cblackmail.\u201d\u201cIf you look at it from a national perspective, it\u2019s zero returns. Minnesota might win one, Wisconsin wins the next one. The company wins each time,\u201d Mr. Rolnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s corporate welfare.\u201dBut Mr. Gardner acknowledged that many cities really had no other course than to try to win Amazon. \u201cIf you ask any mayor, they\u2019ll say their first job is to bring good jobs to the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Amazon is promising to bring a lot of jobs.\u201dJoe Snell, a business leader with an economic development group in Tucson, was behind the recent shipment to Mr. Bezos of the local saguaro cactus, which he said was symbolic of the region\u2019s people.\u201cIt\u2019s a hardy plant. It can grow up to 40 feet. And that\u2019s Tucson,\u201d Mr. Snell said. \u201cWe\u2019re a community that\u2019s growing. We\u2019re adaptive. And we\u2019re durable.\u201dStill, Mr. Snell had achieved his goal.\u201cWe wanted to cut through the noise, and they definitely noticed it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they choose Tucson, they can come out and experience a million saguaros.\u201dAn earlier version of an illustration with this article misspelled the name of one of the cities vying to be the home of Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.

{"Headline": "A New Type of Labor Law for a New Type of Worker", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsLabor Day was born in the late 19th century, during a time of raw fear about the path of economic development. Opportunities for decent, middle-class livelihoods seemed to be shrinking, and the \u201claboring classes\u201d confronted a grim future of what many called wage slavery. Conservatives held most of the seats of power, but reform-minded politicians, activists and policy mavens were thinking big about labor\u2019s rights and wrongs.Lately, driven by a sense that decent work is becoming a thing of the past, liberals and progressives have been thinking big about these things again: The Democratic congressional leadership has proposed a $15 minimum wage and a huge infrastructure investment, while the Center for American Progress has proposed a New Deal-style federal jobs guarantee. Those are good ideas. But good ideas about economic and social policy aren\u2019t enough.We can\u2019t hope to build a more equitable economy unless working people have strong organizations of their own. During and after the New Deal, unions were essential to forging a broad new middle class \u2014 not only because they raised wages and benefits, but also because they countered corporate and financial political power, which today is the greatest impediment to serious change. Without a rejuvenated labor movement, it\u2019s almost inconceivable that breakthrough reforms will come to pass.Democratic lawmakers know that their party was founded on the proposition that concentrated wealth seeks to convert its economic power into political power and that left to its own devices, it puts our democracy at risk. A new workers\u2019 movement would also be a bulwark against the old Jeffersonian nightmare of rule by a self-perpetuating economic oligarchy. For both reasons, progressive lawmakers and policy analysts need to promote a new generation of labor organizations.They can do that by putting labor-law reform at the top of their agenda. The National Labor Relations Act was written in the 1930s, when big factories and large industrial companies dominated our economy; its provisions are a terrible fit for today\u2019s economy in two basic ways.First, because it arose out of the struggles of factory workers with big corporate employers, our labor law encourages bargaining at the employer or work-site level. This made sense when most workers were in large factories. But today\u2019s workplaces are much smaller, even if they are owned or controlled by big corporations. Fast food workers are split among thousands of locations. Janitors labor in small groups, at night, out of the public eye. Warehouse workers in Wal-Mart and Target\u2019s supply chains are often employed by temporary agencies and hired by day or even hour to load trucks. Uber drivers and Amazon delivery drivers work alone.Second, our labor law holds businesses accountable only to the workers whom they \u201cemploy\u201d in an old-fashioned, contractual sense. That too made sense in the industrial era, when leading companies had millions of employees. But today, janitors, Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers are often employed by subcontractors who have little real power over their livelihoods. And Uber and Lyft drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. As a result, these workers don\u2019t have clear rights to bargain with the companies that actually set the rules. And these workers are subject to big restrictions on striking or picketing against such \u201cthird party\u201d companies.A few simple but bold legal reforms would make a world of difference. First, Congress could pass laws to promote multi-employer bargaining, or even bargaining among all companies in an industry. If all hotel brands, all fast-food brands, all grocers or all local delivery companies bargained together, none would be placed at a competitive disadvantage as a result of unionization, which is often the main reason employers resist it so fiercely. Second, Congress could ensure that organized workers can bargain with the companies that actually profit from their work by expanding the legal definition of employment to cover more categories of workers.Smart organizers are already working toward just this sort of labor relations model. Fast Food Forward, the group that has been organizing fast-food workers to demand $15 an hour and a union, is one. Rather than going store by store, they have been taking the fight to the streets and to social media, pushing major chains to take responsibility for working conditions both in their own stores and among franchisees. Strengthening bargaining rights as we\u2019ve suggested could make that vision a reality.As long as that isn\u2019t yet possible at the national level, progressive states like New York and California, or cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, could develop this sort of model within their own jurisdictions. That would require modest progressive reform out of Congress, making national labor protections a floor but not a ceiling, just as it has already done with wage, hour and anti-discrimination laws. But that way, as in the pre-New Deal era, states and even cities could experiment with how to empower new sorts of worker organizations.Ideas like these cut against the grain of mainstream debate, which assumes that rebuilding the industrial sector is the key to a broad middle-class economy. There is nothing wrong, and much right, with such efforts. Still, the reality is that a great majority of today\u2019s working class is no longer in factories, and will never be again. Organized and united under new labor laws that they had a hand in achieving, retail, hospitality, health care and other service workers could become a solid, multiracial working-class base for a progressive Democratic Party.William E.

I\u2019m your host, Stephen Colbert. Thank you very much. This is exciting, can you feel \u2014 this is TV\u2019s highest honors. Us, celebrating us.[LAUGHTER]Tonight we binge ourselves, can you feel it? This room is crackling with the collective energy of people who for the last 48 hours have consumed nothing but distilled water and Crest white strips.[LAUGHTER]All the nominees look so beautiful this evening. So happy. So hopeful. Just a reminder: If you do win, don\u2019t forget to thank everyone who helped you get up here, mainly \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for not being eligible this year. Now personally, I have to take a moment here to thank CBS chairman Leslie Moonves. I literally have to thank him, it\u2019s in my contract.[LAUGHTER]Unfortunately, Les cannot be here tonight to receive my gratitude, so I accept it on his behalf. We did it.[LAUGHTER]But while we\u2019re thanking people, nobody deserves more thanks right now than our first responders.[APPLAUSE]They have been working tirelessly following the disasters in Texas and Florida. And we have to thank also the friends who showed up with the food. The neighbors with boats, the nuns with chain saws, the complete strangers who stepped up to help rebuild. And if you haven\u2019t donated to hurricane relief yet, you still can by going to handinhand2017.com and giving generously. I believe Billy Eichner is still standing by to take your call.

Oh, they just hung up.::CAMERA PANS TO LOUIE ANDERSON SITTING JUST SEATS AWAY::COLBERT: I apologize to all of you. Well, what a year it has been for television. I mean the industry is booming. There were over 450 original scripted shows made this year. Of course, there is no way anyone could possibly watch that much TV other than the president, who seems to have a lot of time for that sort of thing. Hello, sir, thank you for joining us.[LAUGHTER]Looking forward to the tweets. And there have never been more platforms to get your TV than right now. You have broadcast. You have cable. You have Amazon. You have YouTube, Hulu, Voodoo, Netflix, Vitamix. You have Vimeo. You have Twitch, you have Crackle. Cruncho. Bumble. Twerk. Glorp. Flurp.Uber. Eyeball. and DintyMooreStew.com.

Rumor is Liev Schreiber is playing a brooding chunk of meat.Yes, just like that but with carrots and potatoes around him.[LAUGHTER]Of course, these days everybody loves streaming video. Just ask Ted Cruz.[LAUGHTER]But knock first. You don\u2019t want to just walk in.[LAUGHTER]Netflix alone raked in 92 Emmy nominations this year.[APPLAUSE]Yes, sure. Why not? And may I remind you, five years ago their hottest show was a scratched DVD of \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d?[LAUGHTER]Now we\u2019ve got amazing shows like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Millie Bobby Brown is here tonight.[APPLAUSE]She\u2019s amazing in that show, proving once and for all that there are roles in Hollywood for women over 12.[LAUGHTER]Of course, premium cable still has a ton of great shows. I am sure HBO will take home a lot of Emmys tonight, which they\u2019ll have to melt down to pay for next year\u2019s hacker ransom.[LAUGHTER]Too soon?[LAUGHTER]Broadcast TV also had its triumph this year. Remember broadcast? The TV O.G., where it started? Broadcast TV is breaking new ground. In fact, this season, CBS will have twice as many Sheldons as any other network in history.Many of this year\u2019s best TV shows are available to stream immediately. Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where.[LAUGHTER]All the broadcast networks have put out great shows this past year. Like \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d(applause)Incredible. But seriously, Milo, you are going to die this season, right? Just give us a hint. Do you slip in a bathtub? Is it bad clams? Are you mauled by a circus lion in a convenience store? What happens? I\u2019m just saying: Your fans want to see you dead.[LAUGHTER]It\u2019s a compliment. And this has been a great era for diversity in television. In fact, for the third year in a row this is the most diverse group of nominees in Emmy history.[APPLAUSE]That\u2019s impressive. I did not know you could applaud while patting yourself on the back at the same time. Well done. Lovely job. And there\u2019s so many talented African-American nominees. Jeffrey Wright. Viola Davis. Samira Wiley. Uzo Aduba. Anthony Anderson from ABC\u2019s \u201cblack-ish.\u201d[APPLAUSE]And of course Bill Maher.

Oprah, Oprah is in the front row right now.[APPLAUSE]Yeah. Oprah was snubbed this year. What is wrong with you people? What in \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\u201d is wrong with you people? I\u2019m so sorry, Oprah, I was really hoping this would be your breakout year.Hopefully next year you will have a better seat. I\u2019m sorry.[LAUGHTER]But if we\u2019re honest with ourselves \u2014 and as artists, I think we have to be honest with ourselves \u2014 we know that the biggest TV star of the last year is Donald Trump. Yeah. No, you may not like it but he\u2019s the biggest star. You know, and Alec Baldwin, obviously, you know.[APPLAUSE]You guys are neck and neck. And Alec, you\u2019re up against a lot of neck. And however you feel about the president, and you do feel about the president, you can\u2019t deny that every show was influenced by Donald Trump in some way. All the late-night shows, obviously.\u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the new season of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d and of course next year\u2019s Latin Grammys, hosted by Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Muy Caliente.[LAUGHTER]And we all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump. Because he was nominated multiple times for \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d but he never won. Why didn\u2019t you give him an Emmy? I tell you this. If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn\u2019t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You like Walter White. He\u2019s just Walter Much Whiter. And he never forgave you and he never will. The president has complained repeatedly that the Emmys are rigged. He even went after the host a few years back tweeting, \u201cThat Seth Meyers is hosting the Emmy Awards is a total joke. He is very awkward with almost no talent. Marbles in his mouth.\u201d Wow, marbles in his mouth. That\u2019s harsh.[LAUGHTER]That\u2019s quite an accusation, any response, Seth?::CUTS TO SETH MEYERS IN THE AUDIENCE WITH MARBLES FALLING OUT OF HIS MOUTH::[LAUGHTER]And even during the campaign, Trump would not let it go. This actually happened. This exchange actually happened in the debate.::CUTS TO VIDEO OF HILLARY CLINTON AND MR.

Because unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.[LAUGHTER]Where do I find the courage to tell that joke in this room?Of course, what really matters to Donald Trump is ratings. You\u2019ve got to have the big numbers. And I certainly hope we achieved that tonight. Unfortunately, at this point, we have no way of knowing how big our audience is. I mean is there anyone who can say how big the audience is? Sean, do you know?::SEAN SPICER ROLLS OUT ON A PODIUM::SEAN SPICER: This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period.

{"Headline": "In the Amazon, a Catastrophic Gold Rush Looms", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCONCORD, Calif. \u2014 Brazil\u2019s interim president, Michel Temer, is willing to sacrifice millions of acres of rain forest in pursuit of a 16th-century boondoggle: fortunes of gold in the Amazon.Today the reserve is a patchwork of conservation areas and indigenous lands. Its protected status has deterred the runaway development rampant elsewhere in the Amazon that has squelched biodiversity, destroyed indigenous communities and reduced millions of acres of rain forest to pastureland.Like his counterpart in the United States, Donald Trump, Mr. Temer treats environmental regulations like red tape. By opening roughly 30 percent of Renca to mining exploration, the decree sets a dangerous precedent by dissolving a longstanding federal barrier to development, leaving other protected areas within and beyond the reserve exposed to potential to research and exploration. Randolfe Rodrigues, an opposition senator from Amap\u00e1 State, called the decree \u201cthe biggest attack on the Amazon of the last 50 years.\u201dFor decades, Brazilian policy makers have looked at the rain forest as a source of future mineral, timber, oil and agricultural wealth, and little in the country\u2019s history suggests that the government can steward sustainable development in the planet\u2019s largest forest and watershed.In the years since Renca was established, ranchers throughout the Amazon have slashed and burned their way deeper into the forest with impunity. The Amazon frontier has become a South American Wild West where land barons feud over property, extort judges and politicians with threats of violence, and abuse workers in conditions akin to slavery. Over time, a powerful lobby of ranchers, loggers, land speculators and mining companies has consolidated its political power, forming a pivotal congressional bloc \u2014 the ruralistas \u2014 who recently intervened to shield Mr. Temer from a federal corruption investigation.According to Mr. Temer, though, \u201cIt\u2019s no paradise.\u201d His administration is quick to point to the presence of illegal loggers and miners in the reserve who are \u201cplundering the nation\u2019s wealth\u201d and polluting the water supply with mercury. They claim that legal operations will push out prospectors, but history shows that prospectors will be drawn like mosquitoes to the allure of fresh veins.The Amazon is a natural wonder enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution as part of the national patrimony. Its future is critical to Brazil, South America and the planet. It is also a region in chaos where local, state and federal governments struggle to deliver basic health and sanitation services, let alone regulate international mining operations.If Mr. Temer wants to stimulate economic development in the region, he should solicit foreign investors to repair and expand its public infrastructure so that the Amazon and its people can live up to their remarkable potential in fields like biotechnology, health care and sustainable fishing and agriculture. To accelerate mining in the Amazon in 2017 would only refresh the cycle of pillage, boom and bust that has plagued the world\u2019s largest forest since the first marauders arrived in search of El Dorado.Chris Feliciano Arnold is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Third Bank of the River: Power and Survival in the 21-Century Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The younger Wenner has already aggressively pared down the company\u2019s assets: The publisher recently sold Us Weekly and Men\u2019s Journal.The buyer of those titles, American Media, could also be a possible suitor for Rolling Stone.The main thing is that Jann Wenner wants a buyer that understands Rolling Stone\u2019s mission. Perhaps more important, any suitor would have to have \u201clots of money,\u201d he said.Orbital, which makes space rocket motors and satellites, has a market value of $6.3 billion. It would add to the heft of Northrop, which has a market capitalization of more than $45 billion.The fund-raising round came after Slack began exploring financing options earlier this year. It also follows yet more growth in the service\u2019s business:Last week it reported that it had hit $200 million in annual recurring revenue.Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s chief executive, conceded that with revenue at that level, tech companies would usually have held an initial public offering by now. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange world.

{"Headline": "How to Regulate Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI believe the answer is yes. But shouldn\u2019t we take steps to at least slow down progress on A.I., in the interest of caution? The problem is that if we do so, then nations like China will overtake us. The A.I. horse has left the barn, and our best bet is to attempt to steer it. A.I. should not be weaponized, and any A.I. must have an impregnable \u201coff switch.\u201d Beyond that, we should regulate the tangible impact of A.I. systems (for example, the safety of autonomous vehicles) rather than trying to define and rein in the amorphous and rapidly developing field of A.I.I propose three rules for artificial intelligence systems that are inspired by, yet develop further, the \u201cthree laws of robotics\u201d that the writer Isaac Asimov introduced in 1942: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except when such orders would conflict with the previous law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the previous two laws.These three laws are elegant but ambiguous: What, exactly, constitutes harm when it comes to A.I.? I suggest a more concrete basis for avoiding A.I. harm, based on three rules of my own.First, an A.I. system must be subject to the full gamut of laws that apply to its human operator. This rule would cover private, corporate and government systems. We don\u2019t want A.I. to engage in cyberbullying, stock manipulation or terrorist threats; we don\u2019t want the F.B.I. to release A.I. systems that entrap people into committing crimes. We don\u2019t want autonomous vehicles that drive through red lights, or worse, A.I. weapons that violate international treaties.Our common law should be amended so that we can\u2019t claim that our A.I. system did something that we couldn\u2019t understand or anticipate. Simply put, \u201cMy A.I. did it\u201d should not excuse illegal behavior.My rule would ensure that people know when a bot is impersonating someone. We have already seen, for example, @DeepDrumpf \u2014 a bot that humorously impersonated Donald Trump on Twitter. A.I. systems don\u2019t just produce fake tweets; they also produce fake news videos. Researchers at the University of Washington recently released a fake video of former President Barack Obama in which he convincingly appeared to be speaking words that had been grafted onto video of him talking about something entirely different.My third rule is that an A.I. system cannot retain or disclose confidential information without explicit approval from the source of that information. Because of their exceptional ability to automatically elicit, record and analyze information, A.I. systems are in a prime position to acquire confidential information. Think of all the conversations that Amazon Echo \u2014 a \u201csmart speaker\u201d present in an increasing number of homes \u2014 is privy to, or the information that your child may inadvertently divulge to a toy such as an A.I. Barbie. Even seemingly innocuous housecleaning robots create maps of your home. That is information you want to make sure you control.My three A.I. rules are, I believe, sound but far from complete. I introduce them here as a starting point for discussion. Whether or not you agree with Mr. Musk\u2019s view about A.I.\u2019s rate of progress and its ultimate impact on humanity (I don\u2019t), it is clear that A.I. is coming.

{"Headline": "The Best Investment Since 1926? Apple", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe iPhone helped to catapult Apple into its position as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. But now Apple has another and, arguably, more exalted stock market distinction.In the history of the markets since 1926, Apple has generated more profit for investors than any other American company.But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found. A mere 30 stocks account for 30 percent of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40 percent of the net wealth.In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, don\u2019t capture the sharp movements of this calendar year. In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201dExxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.If only it were that easy.How do you find those companies? Not here.\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201dThis list is worth studying for understanding the past. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not a guide to the future, except for this: \u201cIn a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said, \u201cit makes a lot of sense to diversify your position \u2014 to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Road With the Casualties of the Great Recession", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesAs far as human inventions go, retirement is shockingly recent, and proving fragile. A fringe idea until the 20th century \u2014 and one that outraged many \u2014 it took tenuous hold in the United States in the 1930s, during the Great Depression. Today, only 17 percent of Americans imagine they will be able to afford to stop working someday.Tens of thousands have traded in their homes for \u201cwheel estate.\u201d They are \u201cthe Okies of the Great Recession\u201d: grandparents living in school buses and vans seeking seasonal work cleaning toilets at campgrounds, picking blueberries in Kentucky, sometimes for wages, sometimes for just a parking spot \u2014 \u201cnot necessarily paved but hopefully level.\u201dThey\u2019re in for chronic illness, divorce, bad investments \u2014 ordinary life. Bruder meets a software executive who lost everything in the market crash of 2008; accomplished women in their 50s who have already aged out of the job market; a former community college teacher in his 70s who has worked at a Christmas tree lot, cutting and carrying 9-foot-tall trees up to 10 hours a day, six days a week.Bruder\u2019s main subject is Linda May, a 64-year-old former cocktail waitress, trucker and insurance executive who has taken to the open road with a tiny lemon-colored trailer, which she calls the Squeeze Inn. (\u201cYeah, there\u2019s room, squeeze in\u201d is the joke.) Terrible puns for vehicles abound; it\u2019s a tradition among the \u201cworkampers,\u201d as they call themselves. Bruder comes across Vansion, Van Go and Vanna White. She names her own Halen.May is a resourceful and hard worker \u2014 and incorrigibly cheerful (she actually wears glasses with rose-colored frames). Nothing brings her down, not running low on food, not getting locked out of the Squeeze Inn. It\u2019s a steely positivity Bruder finds alarming and deeply American, and one that she encounters repeatedly. In a Facebook group for Amazon warehouse workers, a member enthuses, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose weight by walking a half marathon every day. Bonus: you\u2019re too tired to eat!\u201dThere\u2019s always less romance by daylight, though. Amazon is one of the largest employers of the workampers \u2014 and the most notorious. Incentivized by federal tax credits for employing elderly workers (25 to 40 percent of wages), the company aggressively recruits them, especially during the holiday season. Jeff Bezos has predicted that a quarter of all workampers will pass through his warehouses, working 10 hours or more a day, sorting packages.It\u2019s crippling work. The workampers\u2019 RVs look like \u201cmobile apothecaries,\u201d Bruder writes. Amazon\u2019s warehouses feature wall-mounted dispensers of free painkillers. America runs on ibuprofen; it\u2019s the performance drug of the new economy.Bruder is a poised and graceful writer. But her book is plagued by odd evasions. Take race, the major one. She writes that \u201cthere is hope on the road\u201d \u2014 a blinkered view in 2017, after the passage of Arizona SB 1070, which required law enforcement to request the immigration papers of anyone suspected of being in the country illegally (portions of the bill have since been overturned). Not to mention that in the light of the death of Philando Castile, among others, and the beating of Sureshbhai Patel, the open road seems romantic only to some. Only toward the end of the book does Bruder reckon, and then perfunctorily, with the fact that the workamper phenomenon she describes is limited almost exclusively to white people. (\u201cPerhaps the problem was racism?\u201d) It\u2019s all over in a page and a half. It\u2019s a shoulder shrug.And while there are more than a few references to the Okies, there is no acknowledgment of the more than three million migrant workers in this country, who perhaps pick the same fruit and work the same backbreaking jobs as Bruder\u2019s white would-be retirees.These omissions don\u2019t doom the book; but they do mark it. You ache for the Gulf War veteran who tells Bruder, \u201cI survived the Army. I can survive Amazon.\u201d But you also ache for the ones without even this option, who don\u2019t even merit a mention.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Suburb of the Future, Almost Here", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe suburbanization of America marches on. That movement includes millennials, who, as it turns out, are not a monolithic generation of suburb-hating city dwellers.Most of that generation represents a powerful global trend. They may like the city, but they love the suburbs even more.They are continuing to migrate to suburbs. According to the latest Census Bureau statistics, 25- to 29-year-olds are about a quarter more likely to move from the city to the suburbs as vice versa; older millennials are more than twice as likely.Their future \u2014 and that of the planet \u2014 lies on the urban peripheries. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made clear that, especially in suburbs, the United States desperately needs better drainage systems to handle the enormous amounts of rainfall expected from climate change.They also made clear that new, sustainable suburbs can offer an advantage by expanding landscapes that can absorb water.Housing affordability is a major driver of the appeal of suburbia, which has historically been, and still is, more affordable, especially for first-time home buyers.Yet millennial suburbanites want a new kind of landscape. They want breathing room but disdain the energy wastefulness, visual monotony and social conformity of postwar manufactured neighborhoods. If new suburbs can hit the sweet spot that accommodates the priorities of that generation, millennial habitats will redefine everyday life for all suburbanites, which is 70 percent of Americans.How can technology, revolutionary design and planning transform suburban living?Climate will determine how environmental goals can be achieved in a given place: solar in the Sunbelt, say, or advanced water management in the rainy regions like the Pacific Northwest. Suburbs of the same age or size don\u2019t share the same potential benefits or needs. Here are some ideas to shape future suburbs into smart, efficient and more sustainable places to live.Existing suburbs were developed to maximize house and lot sizes, and some are often locked into aesthetic compliance, like mowed lawns. These communities were also built around cars. Many residential developments offer small parks or playgrounds within walking distance, but require cars to get to bigger recreation areas.In sustainable new suburbs, house and lot sizes are smaller \u2014 in part because driveways and garages are eliminated \u2014 paving is reduced up to 50 percent and landscapes are more flexible. The plant-to-pavement ratio of today\u2019s suburb is much higher than that of cities, but the next generation of suburbs can be even better at absorbing water.House and open community spaces are set among teardrop-shaped one-way roads, which encourage predictable, safe separation of pedestrians and moving vehicles. New suburban developments will utilize technology like autonomous electric cars (parked at solar-powered remote lots) and smart street lighting, which minimize energy use and harmful environmental impact.Communities will share neighborhood amenities like public access areas, drone ports for deliveries, car pull overs (a wider shoulder in the road for pickup and drop-off) rather than private driveways and open common spaces.Businesses also like locations on urban peripheries. That dynamic is helping to reshape suburbia\u2019s traffic patterns, since many cars avoid urban centers. As cars move to renewable energy, emissions and road noise will diminish. In the near term, we should hope to see more efficient cars and on ride sharing.The use of drones will reduce the need for many car errands \u2014 and their emissions: With their unrestricted air space, suburban communities are likely to be first to receive package deliveries from the drones being tested by Amazon. They would be either hub-based, at Amazon warehouses, within 15 to 20 miles of customers, or truck-based, as with U.P.S. or Workhorse, in which a truck stops and a drone deploys. Small to medium packages \u2014 86 percent of Amazon deliveries are under five pounds \u2014 can be handled by current drones and deliver to covered areas at doorways or at shared car pull-offs.In a future suburban development, a homeowner will order an autonomous car, via an app, from a remote solar-charging lot. As a car approaches, it will \u201ctalk\u201d to a home: Lights and other utilities are activated or shut off for greater energy efficiency. Because these suburban homes will not have driveways or garages, front yards can be bigger, devoted to ecological functions or recreational activities.The neighborhoods will be friendlier for pedestrians, with sidewalks and paths that connect to open spaces and communal areas. Before we had fenced-off backyards. In the future we\u2019ll have common recreation spaces or vegetable gardens. Or they can be designed for shared landscape features like forest, vernal ponds or wetlands that help manage storm runoff and control flooding.Climate change has resulted in heavier rainfall when storms do come, and there\u2019s a need to store all of this water to prevent catastrophic urban flooding. Less pavement in suburbia means the ground absorbs more rain and snow and less storm water pours into heavily paved urban areas nearby.Planners need to view cities, suburbs and exurbs not as discrete units but as regions, with one integrated environmental and technological system.It\u2019s rare that such a profound change of vision for the future is so close to being achievable. And the millennial generation, with their there\u2019s-an-app-for-that outlook, is the one that will adopt it.They find beauty in the utilitarian, and they know just how quickly radical technologies can change everything \u2014 including the suburb they want to call home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Future, Warehouse Robots Will Learn on Their Own", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 The robot was perched over a bin filled with random objects, from a box of instant oatmeal to a small toy shark. This two-armed automaton did not recognize any of this stuff, but that did not matter. It reached into the pile and started picking things up, one after another after another.\u201cIt figures out the best way to grab each object, right from the middle of the clutter,\u201d said Jeff Mahler, one of the researchers developing the robot inside a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.For the typical human, that is an easy task. For a robot, it is a remarkable talent \u2014 something that could drive significant changes inside some of the world\u2019s biggest businesses and further shift the market for human labor.Today, robots play important roles inside retail giants like Amazon and manufacturing companies like Foxconn. But these machines are programmed for very specific tasks, like moving a particular type of container across a warehouse or placing a particular chip on a circuit board. They can\u2019t sort through a big pile of stuff, or accomplish more complex tasks. Inside Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers \u2014 where sorting through stuff is the primary task \u2014 armies of humans still do most of the work.The Berkeley robot was all the more remarkable because it could grab stuff it had never seen before. Mr. Mahler and the rest of the Berkeley team trained the machine by showing it hundreds of purely digital objects, and after that training, it could pick up items that weren\u2019t represented in its digital data set.\u201cWe\u2019re learning from simulated models and then applying that to real work,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, the Berkeley professor who oversees the university\u2019s automation lab.The robot was far from perfect, and it could be several years before it is seen outside research labs. Though it was equipped with a suction cup or a parallel gripper \u2014 a kind of two-fingered hand \u2014 it could reliably handle only so many items. And it could not switch between the cup and the gripper on the fly. But the techniques used to train it represented a fundamental shift in robotics research, a shift that could overhaul not just Amazon\u2019s warehouses but entire industries.\u201cThis can extend to tasks of assembly and more complex operations,\u201d said Juan Aparicio, head of advanced manufacturing automation at the German industrial giant Siemens, which is helping to fund the research at Berkeley. \u201cThat is the road map.\u201dPhysically, the Berkeley robot was nothing new. Mr. Mahler and his team were using existing hardware, including two robotic arms from the Swiss multinational ABB and a camera that captured depth.The Berkeley team began by scouring the internet for CAD models, short for computer-aided design. These are digital representations of physical objects. Engineers, physicists and designers build them when running experiments or creating new products. Using these models, Mr. Mahler and his team generated many more digital objects, eventually building a database of more than seven million items. Then they simulated the physics of each item, showing the precise point where a robotic arm should pick it up.That was a large task, but the process was mostly automated. When the team fed these models into a neural network, it learned to identify a similar point on potentially any digital object with any shape. And when the team plugged this neural network into the two-armed robot, it could do the same with physical objects.When facing a single everyday object with cylindrical or at least partly planar surfaces \u2014 like a spatula, a stapler, a cylindrical container of Froot Loops or even a tube of toothpaste \u2014 it could typically pick it up, with success rates often above 90 percent. But percentages dropped with more complex shapes, like the toy shark.What\u2019s more, when the team built simulated piles of random objects and fed those into the neural network, it could learn to lift items from physical piles, too. Researchers at Brown University and Northeastern are exploring similar research, and the hope is that this kind of work can be combined with other methods.\u201cPicking an object up is the first thing you want a manipulator robot to do,\u201d said Stefanie Tellex, a professor at Brown. \u201cA lot of more sophisticated behavior begins with that. If you can\u2019t pick it up, game over.\u201dThe research demonstrated how a task learned in the digital world can be transferred to the physical. Since the camera on Berkeley\u2019s robot could see depth, it captured three-dimensional images that were not unlike the CAD models the team uses to train its neural network.For this reason, some organizations are hoping to train robots using complex virtual worlds \u2014 digital recreations of our physical environment. If a system can train itself to navigate a car racing game like Grand Theft Auto, the thinking goes, it can navigate real roads.This is still largely theory. But at places like Berkeley and Northeastern, researchers are showing that digital learning can indeed make the leap into the real world.\u201cThis is a challenge,\u201d said Rob Platt, a professor at Northeastern. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenge we\u2019re dealing with.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murdoch Bid for Sky Control Hits New Bump as U.K. Official Hints at Inquiry", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s culture minister said on Tuesday that she was inclined to ask the country\u2019s competition regulator to carry out a detailed review of a bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky.In an address to Parliament, the minister, Karen Bradley, said she was \u201cminded\u201d to refer the $15 billion deal to the Competition and Markets Authority for a more intensive inquiry into concerns about whether Fox would uphold broadcast standards in Britain and whether owning all of Sky would give it too much control of the British media.Sky and Fox have 10 days to respond before Ms. Bradley makes a decision about whether to refer the matter for further inquiry.That Ms. Bradley would say she was leaning toward seeking a fuller inquiry was expected: She had previously indicated that concerns about how much control the Murdoch family would have over the country\u2019s media merited a further review. What was unexpected was the potential for additional scrutiny of whether Fox would uphold broadcasting standards in Britain.On Tuesday, Ms. Bradley said that concerns about public interest and corporate governance issues warranted further investigation.An in-depth inquiry could take up to six months and would further delay the proposed transaction. That would be a setback for Mr. Murdoch, who founded the satellite broadcaster in the early 1990s and has long sought total ownership of it.An acquisition of Sky would give 21st Century Fox control of a Pan-European satellite network and rights to additional content, including broadcasts of English Premier League and other soccer leagues in parts of Europe.In a statement on Tuesday, 21st Century Fox expressed disappointment with the decision and the drawn-out regulatory review process.\u201cWe are surprised that after independent regulatory scrutiny and advice, and over four months to examine the case, the Secretary of State is still unable to form an opinion,\u201d the company said, referring to Ms. Bradley. \u201cWe urge the Secretary of State to take a final decision quickly.\u201dThe company noted that Ofcom had already undertaken \u201ca robust and rigorous review\u201d before concluding that 21st Century Fox was committed to the country\u2019s broadcasting standards.\u201cWe are therefore disappointed that the Secretary of State has chosen not to follow the unequivocal advice of the independent regulator, which is the expert body tasked with enforcing the Broadcast Code,\u201d 21st Century Fox said in a statement.The company said it anticipated that the deal would close by June 30, 2018, absent further delays.But the merger has drawn significant scrutiny in Britain, where Mr. Murdoch remains a divisive figure.A previous bid for Sky was withdrawn in 2011 after a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain, which engulfed Mr. Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper division.Fox said at the time that it had made concessions to address those concerns, but the British government said the remedies did not go far enough.Analysts had long anticipated a move by 21st Century Fox to gain full control of Sky as media companies seek to grow, control more content and distribute that content directly to customers in hopes of keeping pace with companies like Netflix and Amazon. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201dBut 21st Century Fox has struggled to move past the sexual harassment scandal.Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for several current and former Fox News employees who made sexual and racial harassment complaints against the network, has alerted British regulators about the details of those cases in the past several months. He said he was pleased that Ms. Bradley was leaning toward calling for a more thorough review.\u201cThere is a lot that they still can find out, especially with respect to people who are bound by confidentiality,\u201d Mr. Wigdor said. \u201cHopefully, they will take steps to get Fox to waive those so that other people can speak and that the government can make a determination as to whether they meet broadcasting standards with a full set of facts.\u201dEmily Steel contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Plans Second Headquarters, Opening a Bidding War Among Cities", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply.Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon \u2014 and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town \u2014 using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners.By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company\u2019s attention.\u201cThis is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. \u201cWhat governor or mayor doesn\u2019t want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?\u201dBut Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company\u2019s hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.Those considerations and more are laid out in Amazon\u2019s detailed wish list for its new project, which it is calling HQ2. In addition to a metropolitan area with more than one million residents, Amazon insists that its new project have on-site access to mass transit, a commute of 45 minutes or less to an international airport and easy access to a major highway or arterial road \u2014 no more than two miles.It also asked for evidence of fiber optic internet connections and a coverage map showing strong cellular phone service at the location. Amazon also wants traffic congestion figures, lists of universities and statistics on the qualifications of local workers.The company is also requesting that the new location have a diverse population and recreational opportunities. In other words, it does not want to stray too far from the lifestyle of Seattle, the home of Starbucks and Nordstrom, sandwiched between mountains and water. The headquarters in Seattle has 24 cafes.Already, Amazon is one of the largest tech employers in the world. But the company said the total number of new employees at its second headquarters outside Seattle could reach 50,000.The announcement of its hiring plan comes at a time when President Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon on Twitter, accusing the company of hurting retailers and killing jobs.The local antipathy toward the company was summed up in graffiti that recently appeared on the wall of a busy downtown traffic tunnel: an expletive before the last name of Mr. Bezos.Amazon itself seemed to suggest that it was looking for a more welcoming atmosphere than in Seattle, emphasizing that it is looking for a \u201cstable and business-friendly environment\u201d for its new headquarters.\u201cWhen big corporations say \u2018business-friendly\u2019 climate, it\u2019s code for corporate giveaways and vicious policies seeking to make the biggest possible profits on the backs of working people,\u201d Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said in an email.Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, said he had heard concerns from executives at Amazon about the climate for businesses in Seattle.\u201cI recognize there are many factors that went in to Amazon\u2019s decision, but the Seattle City Council\u2019s focus on dividing the pie of economic opportunity rather than growing the pie for the city and the region is undoubtedly among them,\u201d he said.Maud Daudon, the chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said she has heard similar concerns from Amazon executives and called the company\u2019s announcement of its plan a \u201cwake-up call for the region.\u201d\u201cWe have not said thank you enough\u201d to Amazon, Ms. Daudon said.Amazon has no plans to leave Seattle, where it employs 40,000 of its 380,000 total workers. It has an additional 6,000 open jobs in Seattle, a sprawling network of buildings downtown, with millions more square feet of office space under construction. Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment about the plan for the company\u2019s new headquarters.Political leaders elsewhere wasted no time saying how badly they want Amazon to join them.\u201cWe will aggressively demonstrate that Dallas and our surrounding area would be the perfect spot for their expansive business needs,\u201d Mike Rawlings, the city\u2019s mayor, said in a statement. Dallas representatives were already in touch with Amazon about next steps, he said.Amazon has been a beneficiary of generous public subsidies as part of its expansion of its warehouse network. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group, published a report last year saying that Amazon had received forms of public subsidies totaling at least $613 million for 40 of the 77 warehouses it built from 2005 to 2014. Additional subsidies for Amazon data centers were about $147 million, the institute said.Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that the average incentive package from a state usually adds up to 2 to 3 percent of wages, although recently there have been a spate of megadeals, like the $3 billion in state tax credits that Wisconsin offered Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants.Such outsize offers could end up being a \u201cwinner\u2019s curse,\u201d where the costs outweigh the benefits. He added that such gifts may not even be what is crucial.\u201cEither you have the things they want or you don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Bartik said, things like, reasonable housing costs, a pool of skilled talent, an international airport or the kind of amenities that would attract the kind of workers that Amazon wants to hire.When General Electric announced last year that it was moving its headquarters to Boston, G.E. executive said that some of city\u2019s most important selling points included the number and quality of its colleges and universities, a technically fluent work force, an atmosphere of innovation and entrepreneurial start-ups, and a quality of life that would attract current and future employees. Tax incentives were a factor, but not the most significant one by far, they said.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was not bothered by Amazon\u2019s decision, which he said would give another city a chance to become a significant tech hub.\u201cI think there\u2019s no way to accommodate another 50,000 engineers and executives in Seattle,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t think it would be healthy for Seattle to have that. As much as I love Amazon, to have that great a density of a single company, it means you\u2019re a one-horse town.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Patricia Cohen from New York.

My unemployment benefits were running out and I was pretty close to broke. I knew I wanted to make a difference, but I wasn\u2019t sure how that was going to happen. I even thought of getting out of the business and trying something new.Then I got a call from my agents to be an understudy on \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d for a day. I never did go on camera, but the producers asked me to come back and audition for the actual role itself, of Karen Wolek. I got it. And despite my earlier protestations, I took the job, thinking it would give me some time and a cushion of money to think about what I really wanted to do.I remember that awards day so distinctly. Sammy Davis Jr. had appeared on the show and we had done several scenes together. Just before they announced my category, he came up behind me and whispered in my ear, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get this.\u201dHowever, most important, was that on \u201cOne Life to Live,\u201d I met the man who would become my husband.Robert Desiderio played Steve Piermont, one of the gangsters from my character\u2019s underworld. The producers and writers saw real chemistry between us, and they started writing for it. Robert was only on the show for a short time before leaving to work in Los Angeles, but our relationship had already been cemented on screen and off.So as my five-year anniversary on the soap approached, Robert said he thought it was a good time for me to leave, that I should move to Los Angeles too.\u201cWhat!\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d I exclaimed, frantic and filled with fear at the thought. He simply said, \u201cI think you will work out there.\u201dSo on a gorgeous fall day in September, my hand was shaking as I sat in the producer\u2019s office, terrified that by signing an exit contract I was jumping off a cliff. Voices in my head were saying, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d \u201cThis is a huge, stupid mistake!\u201dAfter all, I was doing exciting creative work and living in New York, my favorite city in the world. The writers and directors were fabulous, the cast had become my family and the fans were incredibly supportive.The idea of leaving what was a success on so many levels was anathema to me. My agents and managers agreed with my husband that leaving for Los Angeles was a good, ambitious idea.Somewhere deep in my heart, I knew they were all correct; I had to take the chance. And beneath all the terror, I could feel a tiny glimmer of excitement. I moved.The first work I got there was a movie-of-the-week about herpes.Then, after a guest spot on \u201cSt. Elsewhere,\u201d I didn\u2019t work again for almost seven months.The voices returned with a vengeance: \u201cWe told you this was a bad idea!\u201d \u201cHow could you be so foolish?\u201dWhat followed was a fulfilling theater, television and film career, and a life that I could never have imagined that day I left \u201cOne Life to Live.\u201dI still have to remind myself sometimes that fear never needs to control my choices.

Half of all schools in the country with students in kindergarten through 12th grade, where the money announced on Tuesday is to go, offer computer science education. In rural areas, the percentage is even smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the public and private sectors work together to ensure all American students have the opportunity to learn computer science and take part in the fastest growing sector of our economy,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that announced the new donations, said in a statement.The money will be disbursed over a five-year period, with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce contributing $50 million each. Lockheed Martin said it would donate $25 million and Accenture, General Motors and Pluralsight, an online education company, said they would give $10 million apiece.Some companies will also donate software and other technology as part of the initiative. Salesforce.org, Salesforce\u2019s philanthropy arm, said it would give 10 software subscriptions to every school in the country.Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, began organizing the effort about two months ago. She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills. And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York,\u201d Ms. Trump said in an interview, \u201cbut the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.\u201dMs. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.Mr. Trump\u2019s memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education. In a news release, the Education Department said it had a \u201cgoal of devoting\u201d that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education. On Monday, Ms. Trump called 20 state governors and dozens of school superintendents to encourage them to submit grant applications.Advertisement"}

A slightly filtered version of the conversation is below.You don\u2019t break a sweat anymore?Oh, I break a sweat six weeks before, when I think. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Or when the clothes finally get finished, and I think \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look the way I thought it was going to look, what am I going to do?\u201d Then when you\u2019re looking on looks, something turns and you have a day where you think, \u201cYes, that\u2019s it!\u201d And then the next day, \u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Then, by the time you get to this stage, the clothes are done, they\u2019re on the girls, you\u2019ve made the decisions, the hair\u2019s done, the makeup\u2019s done, it is what it is, you love it, you feel good. It\u2019s always exciting to see the girls totally dressed, everything you\u2019ve done comes together. I\u2019ve always been relaxed. But remember, I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. I used to do 16 collections a year.So one per fashion week isn\u2019t bad.I don\u2019t mean to make it sound glib. I love it, and I have a lot of fun with it.Does it look like you imagined? I won\u2019t know until I see the video or the pictures. Because I\u2019m backstage with the girls.You\u2019re zhushing and pinning.I don\u2019t zhush. Hopefully I\u2019m not pinning, but something did fall apart, and we had to sew it in the middle of the show, to sew Gigi into her dress. I feel good about it, because I loved it, I loved the collection, I was very happy with the energy, was happy with the music, was happy with the lighting, happy with the set, happy with the girls, happy with the casting, happy with the hair, happy with the clothes. Now I have to go away and look at it and think, \u201cYeah, O.K. That was good.\u201dTell me about the decision to come to New York Fashion Week. We\u2019ve had a lot of hand-wringing about people leaving New York, and here you are, riding in to take it over?I\u2019ve shown in Paris a lot. I lived there for 10 years. I\u2019ve shown in Milan a lot. I\u2019ve lived in London for the last 20 years. Shown there. I\u2019ve only shown in New York a few times, but I\u2019ve based my women\u2019s design studio in Los Angeles, and it only made sense to show in New York. As a brand, I\u2019ve tried a lot of things, and I have the luxury to do that. And it\u2019s been great \u2014 I\u2019m glad I did. But at this point, what I want to do is establish a consistency. This is our look, this is what I do, this is when I show, this is the city I show in. In a way, if you want to succeed at the game, you have to be in it. So I decided to come to New York Fashion Week.So we\u2019ll see you here from here on out?You\u2019ll see me here for a quite a while. I have no plans to leave. Ten years, who knows. Next season, I\u2019ll be showing here.And the look will remain consistent?You mean the clothes? The spirit, yes. I mean, you have to change the clothes. It\u2019s a new season. The spirit. Which is very similar, I hope, to the sort of spirit I had in the \u201990s, really, at Gucci.Do you feel we\u2019ve taken a break from that spirit and we\u2019re returning to it?I\u2019ve taken a break from it. I\u2019ve done a lot of different things. But I think in fashion right now there\u2019s a feeling of the \u201990s. And there\u2019s also been a lot of more is more is more is more is more. I wanted to take all that away, go back to something cleaner, sharper. That\u2019s what I did.If the \u201990s are going to be back, who better to do them than you?Well, thank you.Tell me about [Expletive] Fabulous.What\u2019s to tell?Was the name a eureka moment?I actually said in a meeting, \u201cThis is [expletive] fabulous.\u201d I thought, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just call it that?\u201d [Mr. Ford gasps, imitating his audience.] \u201cWe can\u2019t say that, how would we do that, how will we advertise, we can\u2019t put it on Instagram, what are we going to do?\u201d It\u2019s great.In a recent interview, you said we were all getting very prudish. Was this a way of calling attention back to what really matters?I think we have become quite prudish. Or maybe not \u201cwe,\u201d but corporations are afraid of offending a certain segment of the market. It\u2019s very interesting. We have more personal freedom, and people are so concerned with being politically correct, that sometimes it actually restricts them.So is this an opportunity to put the expletive front and center, where you feel it belongs? Oh, it\u2019s not even that big of a statement. If you\u2019re offended by that word \u2026 it\u2019s not for sale any place a little kid is going to wander in and say, \u201cMom, what\u2019s that word?\u201d It\u2019s only available in my stores. And, by the way, it\u2019s almost sold out, and our waiting list is, like, crazy. I don\u2019t know how many millions of impressions we\u2019ve had.I\u2019m sorry to be the voice of prudery, but I can\u2019t publish the name in The New York Times. Is there an alternate name we should use?I think you can publish the name in The New York Times, I\u2019ve seen it.slide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "These Are Not the Robots We Were Promised", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFrom the moment we humans first imagined having mechanical servants at our beck and call, we\u2019ve assumed they would be constructed in our own image. Outfitted with arms and legs, heads and torsos, they would perform everyday tasks that we\u2019d otherwise have to do ourselves. Like the indefatigable maid Rosie on \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d the officious droid C-3PO in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the tortured \u201chost\u201d Dolores Abernathy in \u201cWestworld,\u201d the robotic helpmates of popular culture have been humanoid in form and function.It\u2019s time to rethink our assumptions. A robot invasion of our homes is underway, but the machines \u2014 so-called smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home and the forthcoming Apple HomePod \u2014 look nothing like what we expected. Small, squat and stationary, they resemble vases or cat food tins more than they do people.Echo and its ilk do, however, share a crucial trait with their imaginary forebears: They illuminate the times. Whatever their shape, robots tell us something important about our technologies and ourselves.Although smart speakers have been around just three years, they already have a hold on us. The devices, powered by \u201cchatbots\u201d like Siri and Alexa, are in the midst of a sales boom. Some 35 million Americans now use the diminutive, talking computers \u2014 more than twice the number of just a year ago, according to estimates by eMarketer \u2014 and analysts predict that three-quarters of United States households will own at least one of the gadgets by 2020.It\u2019s not hard to understand the attraction. Smart speakers are oracles of the countertop. They may not be able to speak for the gods, but they can deliver reports on news, traffic and weather. And they have other talents that their Delphic ancestor couldn\u2019t even dream of: They can serve as D.J. They can diagnose ailments and soothe anxieties. They can read bedtime stories.They can even bark like a watchdog to scare off burglars. And they promise to be the major-domos of home automation, adjusting lights, controlling appliances and issuing orders to specialized robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.Still, if you were looking forward to having a Rosie scurrying around your abode, feather duster in hand, an Echo feels like a letdown. It just sits there.There are good reasons that the domestic robot has taken such an uninspiring form. Some are technical. Visualizing a nimble, sure-footed android is easy, but building one is hard. As the Carnegie Mellon professor Illah Nourbakhsh explains in his book \u201cRobot Futures,\u201d it requires advances not only in artificial intelligence but also in the complex hardware systems required for movement, perception and dexterity.The human nervous system is a marvel of physical control, able to sense and respond fluidly to an ever-changing environment. Achieving such agility with silicon and steel lies well beyond the reach of today\u2019s engineers. Even the most advanced of our current automatons still get flustered by mundane tasks like loading a dishwasher or dusting knickknacks.Meanwhile, thanks to gains in networking, language processing and miniaturization, it has become simple to manufacture small, cheap computers that can understand basic questions and commands, gather and synthesize information from online databanks and control other electronics. The technology industry has enormous incentives to promote such gadgets. Now that many of the biggest tech companies operate like media businesses, trafficking in information, they\u2019re in a race to create new products to charm and track consumers.Smart speakers provide a powerful complement to smartphones in this regard. Equipped with sensitive microphones, they serve as in-home listening devices \u2014 benign-seeming bugs \u2014 that greatly extend the companies\u2019 ability to monitor people\u2019s habits. Whenever you chat with a smart speaker, you\u2019re disclosing valuable information about your routines and proclivities.Beyond the technical challenges, there\u2019s a daunting psychological barrier to constructing and selling anthropomorphic machines. No one has figured out how to bridge what computer scientists term the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d \u2014 the wide gap we sense between ourselves and imitations of ourselves. Because we\u2019re such social beings, our minds are exquisitely sensitive to the expressions, gestures and manners of others. Any whiff of artificiality triggers revulsion. Humanoid robots seem creepy to us, and the more closely they\u2019re designed to mimic us, the creepier they are. That puts roboticists in a bind: The more perfect their creations, the less likely we\u2019ll want them in our homes. Lacking human characteristics, smart speakers avoid the uncanny valley altogether.Although they may not look like the robots we envisioned, smart speakers do have antecedents in our cultural fantasy life. The robot they most recall at the moment is HAL, the chattering eyeball in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d But their current form \u2014 that of a stand-alone gadget \u2014 is not likely to be their ultimate form. They seem fated to shed their physical housing and turn into a sort of ambient digital companion. Alexa will come to resemble Samantha, the \u201cartificially intelligent operating system\u201d that beguiles the Joaquin Phoenix character in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Through a network of speakers, microphones and sensors scattered around our homes, we\u2019ll be able to converse with our solicitous A.I. assistants wherever and whenever we like.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook C.E.O., spent much of last year programming a prototype of such a virtual agent. In a video released in December, he gave a demo of the system. Walking around his Silicon Valley home, he conducted a running dialogue with his omnipresent chatbot, calling on it to supply him with a clean T-shirt and toast bread for his breakfast, play movies and music, and entertain his infant daughter. Hooked up to cameras with facial-recognition software, the digitized Jeeves also acted as a sentry for the Zuckerberg compound, screening visitors and unlocking the gate.Whether real or fictional, robots hold a mirror up to society. If Rosie and her kin embodied a 20th-century yearning for domestic order and familial bliss, smart speakers symbolize our own, more self-absorbed time.It seems apt that as we come to live more of our lives virtually, through social networks and other simulations, our robots should take the form of disembodied avatars dedicated to keeping us comfortable in our media cocoons. Even as they spy on us, the devices offer sanctuary from the unruliness of reality, with all its frictions and strains. They place us in a virtual world meticulously arranged to suit our bents and biases, a world that understands us and shapes itself to our desires. Amazon\u2019s decision to draw on classical mythology in naming its smart speaker was a masterstroke. Every Narcissus deserves an Echo.Nicholas Carr is the author of \u201cThe Shallows\u201d and \u201cUtopia Is Creepy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Texas Is No Longer Feeling Miraculous", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Call it the season of Texas\u2019 discontent. Of course there was Hurricane Harvey, which blasted the coastline, leaving cities flooded and an estimated $180 billion in damage. But Harvey is just the headline.There\u2019s also the dysfunctional, ideologically driven State Legislature, which spent the last weeks of this year\u2019s session debating, of all things, who gets to use which bathroom. Then there\u2019s the oil and gas sector, which, as it has so many times before, expanded into a bubble and then, as global energy prices sank, popped, taking thousands of jobs with it.Texas\u2019 woes are interconnected. Rising energy prices allow politicians to take their hands off the legislative wheel. Less attention to smart, controlled growth at the state and local level allowed unchecked sprawl along the coast. And now declining revenues will make it harder for the state to address its very real needs, assuming the Legislature can get its act together. The silver lining to this tale? It finally seems to be dawning on people that low taxes, less regulation and more oil are no substitute for actually governing.If this doesn\u2019t sound like the Tall Tale of the Texas Miracle of just a few years ago, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. Way, way back \u2014 in early 2015 \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry rode out of office with his head held high: The boom years had created over 1.4 million jobs since the end of 2007. We had escaped the housing bust, oil and gas prices were rising and the state\u2019s economy had diversified and profited mightily from free trade. Texas was the promised land, reminiscent of Davy Crockett\u2019s observation that our state \u201cis the garden spot of the world.\u201d At the height of this latest Texas miracle, the cost of living was so low and there were so many jobs that 1,000 people flocked here every single day.Times, however, have changed. Two years ago Texas had one of the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rates; today it is in 28th place. Though it is now at 4.4 percent, it was as high as 5 percent a few months ago, and there\u2019s a good bet it will bounce back up, and likely higher, soon.The reason: the oil patch. When oil fetched $100 per barrel, we fracked away, even in our own suburbs. Roughnecks rented trailer spots in front yards and showered towns from Odessa to Victoria with money. A drive across West Texas\u2019s vast, oil-rich Permian Basin in late 2015 revealed equipment crowding roads. Now much of that equipment is idle, and energy companies are planning on $40 a barrel as far as they can forecast.The Lone Star State also slipped in the business rankings. For the first time in years, Texas tumbled out of the top two most desirable states for business in CNBC\u2019s annual survey of executives. No. 1? Washington State. The reason, executives said, was a stalled state economy \u2014 because of the oil slump. Governing magazine ranked the Texas economy 21st; in 2013, it was third. WalletHub has Texas in 20th place.It\u2019s not just the oil slump. Even though we don\u2019t have a state income tax, we have high sales and property taxes. WalletHub ranks our effective tax burden 30th in the country, basically tied with Massachusetts. And the state isn\u2019t about to help: The Legislature can\u2019t even figure out how to fund public schools.Will business turn up its nose at Texas? It already has. Yes, Toyota\u2019s new North American headquarters is in Plano, outside Dallas. But General Electric was looking to move its headquarters from Connecticut to North Texas, too. Instead, 800 G.E. employees are going to Boston. The reason? Massachusetts may be home to high taxes and high regulations, but it\u2019s also a pro-trade and pro-smart growth. Texas, meanwhile, is home to Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an ardent opponent of the Export-Import Bank, on which G.E. and many other companies depend for export assistance.And what are the chances that Amazon, now in the hunt for a second headquarters site, will choose Dallas, which has thrown its 10-gallon hat in the ring? Whatever the city can offer, the state taketh away in the form of do-nothing legislators and governor who sport, as their recent crowning achievement, an Arizona-style law that allows the police to question people\u2019s citizenship and immigration status. The law immediately stalled in the courts.The governor, Greg Abbott, also called the legislature back into a special session in part to pass a North Carolina-style bill regulating which public bathroom transgender people could use. It lost, but not before it had pitted Republicans against AT&T, American Airlines, Dell, Google, the major oil companies, Southwest Airlines and the Texas Association of Business.Texas Republicans, somehow, have become the anti-business party. \u201cMost of the threats to the future of Texas are self-imposed: Inadequate education and infrastructure funding can stifle growth,\u201d said M. Ray Perryman, an economist who describes himself as a fiscal conservative. \u201cDiscriminatory social legislation can irreparably damage the business climate, and hard-line immigration posturing is counterproductive.\u201dMr. Abbott hasn\u2019t shown much interest in toiling in the garden of economics, anyway; where Mr. Perry doled out some $500 million in incentives to companies to move, stay or grow in the state, Mr. Abbott has parsimoniously offered enticements often measured in the several hundred thousand dollars (except for Toyota, which got $40 million in incentives from the state to move to Plano).And then came Harvey. In addition to the immense human suffering, applications for unemployment benefits have spiked to Great Recession levels. If the federal government comes through with all the money, then those costs would eventually be zeroed out as money pours into rebuilding. But that\u2019s a huge if, given the politics of Washington, the highly politicized history of recent hurricane relief and the fact that only $15 billion has been approved. Of that, only $1 billion has been disbursed; almost a third of that will be needed just to clean up trash.The tale of the Texas Miracle was a big fat lie: Plentiful oil, low regulation and even lower taxes are not a panacea. Sure, they don\u2019t hurt. But they don\u2019t help, not without consistent, well-considered state policy to attract and build businesses.Still, there is hope. Harvey is forcing Texans to rethink our political dogma of small government at any cost. Harris County, which surrounds Democratic Houston and includes bedrock Republican suburbs, has placed everything on the table to prevent disasters in the future: from radical rezoning to land conservation and a giant Dutch-style engineering project to protect the region from another direct hit. That will take at least tens of billions of taxpayer dollars.Even the state\u2019s right-wing lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has found religion, singing the praises of expensive engineering. Mr. Abbott is being too clever by half so far, refusing to tap the state\u2019s $10 billion rainy day fund while asking for the federal government to pick up the entire tab for the hurricane. Though as a politician he has done nothing but oppose the federal government, his re-election may end up hinging on how effective he is at bringing home the federal bacon. The same is true of the state\u2019s junior senator, Ted Cruz, notorious for opposing aid to areas hit by Superstorm Sandy.Yes, Harvey has flooded the garden of the Texas economy. But the garden was already unkempt. And fall, in Texas, is a good time to start over with honest perspiration.

And \u201cVeep\u201d won for best comedy, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus winning best actress in a comedy.LOS ANGELES \u2014 It was inevitable that a streaming service would win an Emmy for best drama at some point. But no one expected Hulu to get there first.As the producers and cast gathered onstage to accept the award, they were joined by Ms. Atwood, who received a rousing ovation.The show\u2019s feature players swept the supporting comedy acting awards, with acting wins from Alec Baldwin, for his portrayal of President Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who played Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Jeff Sessions (among other characters).60 PhotosThe win by \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d is a blow to Netflix, which spent millions marketing its shows before Emmy voters, and once again fell short of winning best drama despite the fact it claimed nearly half of the nominated shows in the category.Here are the highlights from Sunday\u2019s ceremony:After pummeling President Trump nearly every week and scoring some of its highest ratings in years, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d took home several prestigious awards, including for best variety sketch show.Accepting that Emmy, the longtime executive producer of \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d Lorne Michaels, said that he thought the show would never have a season as \u201ccrazy, as unpredictable, as frightening, as exhausting or as exhilarating\u201c as the show\u2019s first in the mid-70s.\u201cTurns out I was wrong,\u201d he said.Mr. Baldwin, as expected, won as best supporting actor in a comedy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump. \u201cI suppose I should just say, at long last Mr. President, here\u2019s your Emmy,\u201d he quipped.Ms. McKinnon repeated as best supporting actress in a comedy. This NBC late-night show had already swept the two best guest actor categories at the Creative Arts Emmys (one for Melissa McCarthy and another for Dave Chappelle).Don Roy King added another award for \u201cS.N.L.\u201d later in the show, winning for best direction of a variety series.Mr. Colbert had been riding an anti-Trump wave all year to unanticipated ratings gold, and it was no different for his opening monologue Sunday. He spent a good chunk of his monologue talking about the president, declaring Mr. Trump the biggest story in TV last year, and spoofing Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to win an Emmy during his years as host of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u2019\u2019\u201cUnlike the presidency,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Colbert said, \u201cEmmys go to the winner of the popular vote.\u2019\u2019Of course, there is a risk in going political at an event that\u2019s supposed to celebrate television. The Emmys have set ratings lows for two consecutive years, and there are plenty of viewers out there who do not want to be lectured by Mr. Colbert or anyone from Hollywood about President Trump. And, from the opposite side of the political spectrum, there were many on social media who expressed anger Sunday night at what they saw as an attempted redemption of Mr. Spicer.Julia Louis-Dreyfus coming to the Emmys stage and collecting yet another trophy? Show us something we haven\u2019t seen.But this year, she made history.With Ms. Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s win for best actress in a comedy for her performance as Selina Meyer in \u201cVeep,\u201d she tied Cloris Leachman\u2019s record for eight prime-time acting Emmys. She also set the record for the number of wins by an actor playing one character, breaking a tie with Candice Bergen (\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d) and Don Knotts (\u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d).Holding a sheet of paper, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus declared her character (who has gone from vice president, to president, to ex-president over the last six seasons) as the \u201crole of a lifetime and an adventure of utter joy.\u201dContinuing the political comedy, Ms. Dreyfus added: \u201cWe did have a whole story line about impeachment but we abandoned it because we were worried that someone else might get to that first.\u201d\u201cVeep\u201d also won best comedy for a third year in a row, holding off significant competition from \u201cAtlanta.\u201d Mr. Glover, the star and creator of the \u201cAtlanta,\u201d won the Emmys for best actor and best director in the category.The good news for the competition? \u201cVeep\u201d will wrap up next year.As movie stars and audiences gravitate to limited series, this category has gone from a wasteland to arguably the most intriguing.Nicole Kidman won her first Emmy, for best actress in a limited series for her portrayal of an abused wife in \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d and she had some intense competition. Four Oscar winners were nominated in the category, including Ms. Kidman, Reese Witherspoon (\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d) and Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange (\u201cFeud\u201d).\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible year for women in television,\u201d said Ms. Witherspoon, an executive producer of \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d Ms. Kidman called for \u201cmore great roles for women.\u201d Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard won supporting acting awards, and Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e won for best director in a limited series, rounding out a dominant showing from \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201dRiz Ahmed won best actor in a movie or limited series for his breakout role in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of.\u201d And Netflix won best TV movie for \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201dHBO took home the most Emmys for the 16th straight year, winning 29, compared with Netflix\u2019s 20.HBO\u2019s triumph capped a year when TV networks took Emmys campaigning to a new level, spending millions to market shows before nominations were handed out.But there was no player more ostentatious than Netflix. The streaming service opened up its own 24,000-square-foot event space this spring, holding nearly daily parties to put potential Emmy voters in front of talent, free dinners and an open bar.Nevertheless, the result was the same: The streaming service went home empty-handed in the major acting awards and for best drama and comedy.An earlier version of a mobile summary for this article misspelled the given name of the actress who won the Emmy for best lead actress in a drama. As the article correctly notes, she is Elisabeth Moss, not Elizabeth.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For These Immigrants, Dollar Stores Provide More Than Bargains", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJoe Lin\u2019s father toiled in a Chinese restaurant and his mother in a garment factory. They never wanted that life for him.So the Lins scraped together enough money to open a dollar store in Flushing, Queens. Nearly two years ago, they opened a second store in nearby Jackson Heights. Now Joe Lin, 32, and his wife and younger brother help run the stores. \u201cIf the family stays together at least you\u2019re happy,\u201d he said.As dollar stores have proliferated across New York City, they have provided not only bargains for shoppers, but also jobs and livelihoods for a new generation of immigrants like the Lins. These immigrants say the dollar stores are a step up from the restaurants and factories that have long sustained the city\u2019s newcomers, but offered grueling schedules that left workers little time to spend with their families. Their dollar stores are often stocked with reminders of their own homelands as well as of their friends and neighbors, from guava juice and curry pastes to hot peppers and Goya canned beans.At the Mega 99c store in the Bronx, where framed pictures of Arabic writing and tea sets sit among soap and cleaning supplies, Abu Baker, the manager, said about 200 customers a day came through the doors. In Brooklyn, on a stretch of Manhattan Avenue known for its line of discount stores, Dollar Up\u2019s stock of Polish specialties draws regulars like Natalia Niklova, who likes \u201cthese brands.\u201dMamadou Tidjani, the manager of 187 Discount Store and Variety in the Bronx, said that sales have fallen to between $1,200 and $1,300 a day from $2,000 when he started in 2009. \u201cThe customers, they\u2019re not coming out like before and they buy less,\u201d said Mr. Tidjani, 52. \u201cWe haven\u2019t sold $2,000 worth of products in a long time.\u201dAcross New York, there were 1,247 variety and dollar stores in 2015, up from 1,002 stores in 2005, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College. Brooklyn had the most, 469 , followed by Queens, with 355, and the Bronx, with 224.Ocean Zhang and his wife, Jian, opened their store, Lucky Bird 99 Cents and Up in Queens six years ago when there was only one other dollar store nearby. Now there are four. \u201cHow can we survive?\u201d asked Ms. Zhang, 40, speaking in Mandarin as she arranged items in an empty store. \u201cThere are two bowls of rice, two people are full. Now if four people eat from two bowls, everyone goes hungry!\u201dMr. Zhang said they would hold on as long as they could. An immigrant from Wenzhou, a port and industrial city in southeastern China, he started out in a garment factory nearly two decades ago and later made a living selling at flea markets around the country on weekends. But after the Zhangs had children, they saved enough money to rent a storefront so they could stay close to home.Throughout Queens and Brooklyn, the Zhangs\u2019 experience is shared by many Chinese immigrants from Wenzhou and another city about 200 miles to the south, Fuzhou, both of which are known for an entrepreneurial spirit among residents who have moved abroad to start businesses. In New York, many of these immigrants said they invested in dollar stores because their relatives and friends did.\u201cWhen some people see a store doing well then they think they can do well, too,\u201d said Xu Tingyong, a managing partner of Best Sale NYC, a wholesale company in Brooklyn that supplies dollar stores. \u201cI want to open a store, my brother wants to open a store, and then a cousin wants to open one. Another introduces another, and there you have it.\u201dAt 88 Import, another wholesale company in Brooklyn, several employees have gone on to open dollar stores of their own, said Phoebe Wang, 34, who was taking store orders on a recent weekend afternoon. She added that low margins were just part of doing business in the Chinese culture, citing a saying \u201cBoli duoxiao\u201d that translates to \u201cthin margins, high volume.\u201dOn a stretch of Queens Boulevard, Youtube 99 Cents & Up is surrounded by dollar stores, including one that opened just steps away in the spring. \u201cMargins are already so thin and every year the rent here goes up,\u201d said Lily Zhang, the store owner, who followed her friends and family into the dollar store business after a decade of working in a garment factory. \u201cNow with yet even another store next door, there\u2019s even more pressure.\u201dHer competition, Queens Mart 99 Cents and Up, is owned by Lin Jian, 45, an immigrant from Fuzhou whose last business was a Chinese restaurant in Tennessee that he sold to open the dollar store in a 2,000-square-foot storefront that was previously a kosher grocery. The other day, his wife, Lisa, and their daughter, Feng, 10, took turns ringing up customers.He conceded that Ms. Zhang would not be happy about the competition, of course.\u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t opened here,\u201d he added. \u201cSomeone else would have.\u201dEmily Palmer contributed reporting, and Susan C.

{"Headline": "Resolutions for the Big (and Small) Screens", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech TipIf you are watching the movie on a small tablet, phone or other screen, SD video quality is usually just fine. Standard-definition videos are less expensive to buy, often by about $5, and $1 or $2 less to rent in some online stores. Certain devices cannot fully display HD video anyway because the screens lack the needed resolution or the hardware is not compatible. (Some files may automatically download in standard definition anyway depending on the device you are using.)Because they contain more data, downloaded HD videos need more bandwidth to stream and, when downloaded, take up more space on your device. For example, the 720p HD version of \u201cThe Martian\u201d in Apple\u2019s iTunes Store is a 5.36-gigabyte file, while the SD edition weighs in at 2.54 gigabytes. If you are downloading a movie to a mobile device to watch offline, the SD edition is a space saver. If you plan to watch the movie on a high-definition television or high-resolution computer monitor, though, SD video can look flatter and less vibrant than the HD version.Advertisement"}

Competitors have complained that this forces them to pay money to what they say is a search monopoly, thus violating the spirit of competitive markets. The fix offered by Google appears to address the complaint that it was unfairly promoting its own services.Alphabet will proceed with its appeal. That is important, as the idea that a dominant company cannot favor its own services at the expense of rivals is contentious and could lead to future cases against Amazon, Facebook and others.But the real action is over Android.Most of the smartphones in the world are powered by Google\u2019s operating system. The company does not charge manufacturers for it, but consumers value these phones because they can download apps.The European Commission asserts that Alphabet is acting abusively by giving financial incentives to manufacturers to exclusively use Google search and forcing them to set it as the default if they want access to Android\u2019s app store.Nearly 90 percent of Alphabet\u2019s top line comes from advertising. And mobile will probably account for about two-thirds of its net digital advertising revenue this year, according to estimates from the research firm eMarketer.Considering the existential threat to Alphabet if the company were to lose its grip on mobile search, it\u2019s little wonder that the tech giant wants as few distractions as possible to focus on this fight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Best Buy\u2019s Secrets for Thriving in the Amazon Age", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftWhile running errands the other day, I ducked into a local Best Buy to pick up a pair of new headphones. What I saw inside was shocking.Happy-looking people were huddled around tables filled with the latest gadgets from Microsoft and Apple. The video game aisle was bustling. Blue-shirted employees were helping a customer pick from a glowing wall of flat-screen TVs. There was a line \u2014 a line! \u2014 at the checkout counter.But Best Buy\u2019s rebound has been surprisingly durable. Revenue figures have beaten Wall Street\u2019s expectations in six of the last seven quarters. The company\u2019s stock price has risen more than 50 percent in the past year. Workers are happy. And judging from several other visits I paid to Best Buy stores, the chain appears to have avoided the bleak fate of other big-box retailers.How do they do it?To find out, I called Hubert Joly, Best Buy\u2019s chief executive.An upbeat Frenchman who spent more than a decade at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Mr. Joly, 58, explained that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround was years in the making, and that it involved reshaping nearly every piece of the business. It\u2019s a fascinating playbook for companies hoping to survive in the Amazon age.Here are the keys to Best Buy\u2019s turnaround, according to Mr. Joly:The most worrisome trend in big-box retail was \u201cshowrooming\u201d \u2014 customers were testing new products in stores before buying them for less money online from another retailer. To combat showrooming and persuade customers to complete their purchases at Best Buy, Mr. Joly announced a price-matching guarantee.\u201cUntil I match Amazon\u2019s prices, the customers are ours to lose,\u201d Mr. Joly said.Price-matching costs Best Buy real money, but it also gives customers a reason to stay in the store, and avoids handing business to competitors.Mr. Joly also realized that if Best Buy was going to compete with Amazon, which has spent billions building a speedy delivery system and plans to use drones to become even more efficient, it needed to get better at things that robots can\u2019t do well \u2014 namely, customer service.In his first months on the job, Mr. Joly visited Best Buy stores near the company\u2019s Minnesota headquarters to ask rank-and-file employees about the struggles they encountered. (Among their gripes: an internal search engine that was returning bad data about which items were in stock.)Best Buy fixed the search engine. It also restored a much-loved employee discount that had been suspended and embarked on an ambitious program to retrain its employees so they could answer questions about entirely new categories of electronics, such as virtual reality headsets and smart home appliances.\u201cThe associates in our stores are much more engaged now, much more proficient,\u201d Mr. Joly said.Customers had always loved Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad, its army of specially trained tech support experts who could be hired to mount TVs and install other appliances at a customer\u2019s home. But sometimes, people needed help before they bought big and expensive gadgets. So it started an adviser program that allows customers to get free in-home consultations about what product they should buy, and how it should be installed. The service started as a pilot program last year and is now being rolled out nationwide.Best Buy has \u201creally come through the valley by making investments around the customer experience,\u201d said Peter Keith, a retail analyst with Piper Jaffray.When Mr. Joly arrived at Best Buy, the company\u2019s online ordering system was completely divorced from its stores. If a customer placed an order on the website, it would ship from a central warehouse. If that warehouse didn\u2019t have the item in stock, the customer was out of luck.Mr. Joly realized that with some minor changes, each of Best Buy\u2019s 1,000-plus big-box stores could ship packages to customers, serving as a mini warehouse for its surrounding area. Now, when a customer orders a product on Best Buy\u2019s website, the item is sent from the location that can deliver it the fastest \u2014 a store down the street, perhaps, or a warehouse five states away. It was a small, subtle change, but it allowed Best Buy to improve its shipping times, and made immediate gratification possible for customers. Now, roughly 40 percent of Best Buy\u2019s online orders are either shipped or picked up from a store.Best Buy also struck deals with large electronics companies like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft to feature their products in branded areas within the store. Now, rather than jamming these companies\u2019 products next to one another on shelves, Best Buy allows them to set up their own dedicated kiosks. (Apple\u2019s area inside a Best Buy, for example, has the same sleek wooden tables and minimalist design as an Apple Store.) It\u2019s a concept borrowed from department stores, and it\u2019s created a lucrative new revenue stream. Even Amazon has set up kiosks in Best Buy stores to show off its voice-activated Alexa gadgets.Granted, Best Buy has a last-man-standing advantage in these partnership deals. Many of its big-box rivals (Circuit City, Radio Shack, HH Gregg) have gone bankrupt or shut down completely. Which means that if Samsung wants to show off its newest line of tablets in a big-box electronics store, it has basically one choice.Best Buy has also found more creative penny-pinching methods. Once, the company noticed that an unusually high number of flat-screen TVs were being dropped in its warehouses. It revamped the handling process, reducing the number of times TVs were picked up by a clamp lift and adding new carts to prevent TV boxes from falling over. The changes resulted in less broken inventory and bigger profits.Mr. Joly didn\u2019t explicitly tell me this, but it is obvious: Best Buy has benefited from some serious good fortune.It\u2019s lucky that the products it specializes in selling, like big-screen TVs and high-end audio equipment, are big-ticket items that many customers still feel uncomfortable buying sight unseen from a website. It\u2019s lucky that several large competitors have gone out of business, shrinking its list of rivals. And it\u2019s lucky that the vendors who make the products it sells, like Apple and Samsung, have kept churning out expensive blockbuster gadgets.\u201cThey\u2019re at the mercy of the product cycles,\u201d said Stephen Baker, a tech industry analyst at NPD Group. \u201cIf people stop buying PCs or they don\u2019t care about big-screen TVs anymore, they have a challenge.\u201dMr. Joly is optimistic about Best Buy\u2019s chances against these Goliaths, but he\u2019s not ready to celebrate yet.\u201cOnce you\u2019ve had a near-death experience,\u201d he said, \u201carrogance, if you had it in your bones, has disappeared forever.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to how Best Buy selects locations for shipping online orders. The company chooses the location that can deliver the item the fastest, not always the location that is closest to the person who ordered it.Follow Kevin Roose on Twitter @kevinroose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Library Cards Unlock Film Vaults", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingA few years ago, back when video rental stores were still around but clearly an endangered species (Tower Records had shut down, Blockbuster was in trouble and Netflix was still dealing in DVDs), I was chatting with a friend, a fellow cinephile experiencing an economic downturn. (As it happened, he had worked for Tower.) It was difficult to keep up with classic releases on home video, particularly stuff from the Criterion Collection, he said, but fortunately for him titles would eventually turn up at his local public library. And he didn\u2019t have to wait long for them either, since few people in his New Jersey town (which had once been mine) were keen on art or foreign films.People lucky enough to have a good amount of disposable income (or bad enough at managing money) don\u2019t often think of the library as a home entertainment option. Yet I know a lot of people who have Netflix, Amazon Prime or cable with a lot of premium channels, who will balk at shelling out an extra six or seven or eight bucks a month for a more curated movie streaming service. For them, there is a solution, and all they need is their library card.The service is also free if you are affiliated with a college or university, either as a professor or a student. Kanopy, which is accessible as an app on Roku and Android and iOS devices, and as a website, is available to 477 public libraries and 1,424 learning institutions across the United States.Kanopy\u2019s offerings vary depending on where you live. Some collections and some titles may not be available at all; some may be available to an education-affiliated account but not to a public library-affiliated account. The New York Public Library version of the service offers 420 movies from the Criterion Collection\u2019s deep library of international classics (from directors including Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin) and contemporary art house films.Kanopy works like a standard paid streaming service, with limitations. Just as when you take a book out from the library and have a circumscribed amount of time to keep it, so it is with the movies here. Once you press \u201cplay\u201d on a given movie, you have three days to watch it, as many times as you like, which uses up one play credit. The number of play credits for each user is determined by the library to which the membership is attached, not by the service. The New York Public Library offers Kanopy users 10 play credits a month. (Members affiliated with educational institutions get unlimited plays.)Scrolling down the home page of the app version is awe-inspiring. In horizontal rows, 18 categories are presented, beginning with Criterion films. The others include \u201cPopular Documentaries,\u201d \u201cIndependent Films,\u201d \u201cWorld Cinema,\u201d \u201cStaff Picks,\u201d \u201cAudience Picks,\u201d \u201cNew York Times Critics\u2019 Picks\u201d and my favorite, \u201cFilms Starring Actors From \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s a fair amount of cross-categorization \u2014 you have to scroll far into \u201cClassic Cinema\u201d before you find a non-Criterion title. I was struck, and not in a bad way, by the occasional randomness of the selection. The unsophisticated but often laugh-out-loud funny 1977 anthology comedy \u201cKentucky Fried Movie\u201d is here. As is the underrated 2000 prison drama \u201cAnimal Factory,\u201d directed by Steve Buscemi and starring Willem Dafoe. As is \u201cBoondock Saints,\u201d an elaborate 1999 boondoggle of a crime picture that has somehow managed to attract a cult, also starring Mr. Dafoe.In a phone interview, I asked Olivia Humphrey, Kanopy\u2019s founder and chief executive, about such results. Many of the titles on the site are added via a \u201csearch and find\u201d feature. College professors who need particular movies to assign to their students request titles, and Kanopy looks for them and tries to secure licensing rights.Licensing movies is a byzantine business. I know of an independent DVD label owner whose inquiries into various obscure and hard-to-find titles in studio vaults was met with the response that the films were of such low priority that it wasn\u2019t even worth it to do the paperwork to create an agreement. Ms. Humphrey told me that Kanopy had about 40 percent success with its searches, which is impressive, all things considered. \u201cAnd yes, the challenge is usually not in finding the movie but in acquiring the rights,\u201d she said. (I inferred from our chat that the presence of the two wildly disparate Dafoe films might have been because of some American academic researching the actor\u2019s work.)The site is a library vendor, not a nonprofit, and it splits revenues 50-50 with its licensees. This encourages the licensee to keep the movie on Kanopy for a long time, as it can yield a steady revenue stream. \u201cWe like to have full transparency with our licensees,\u201d Ms. Humphrey said. \u201cThey are able to log on at any time and see how their titles are doing.\u201dShe began the company in her native Australia in 2008. \u201cMy background was in film studios there,\u201d she explained. \u201cI became aware that universities that wanted to add film to their core curriculum had very little available in terms of resources. I saw college libraries with dusty DVDs and 16-millimeter cans on their shelves, so I wanted to create a way to address that.\u201d She moved the company\u2019s headquarters to the United States about four years ago, \u201cmainly because the interest we were getting was largely from American institutions.\u201dMs. Humphrey is gratified by how the site has been growing, and she sees Kanopy\u2019s role in the academic world as going substantially beyond providing course resources: \u201cAt this time in their lives young people are challenging assumptions, and we try to stay relevant by offering material related to that.\u201d She cites issues of identity as crucial to students, and points out \u201cwe have a lot of movies that address that.\u201d As a cinephile herself, she is fervent about spreading the love. \u201cI like to think of a whole world of other students, not enrolled in film school, watching Criterion titles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopefully encouraging them to press \u2018play\u2019 on movies they have never heard of.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Far Right Came to Love Hippie Food", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome time ago, I found myself in a buffet line around piles of inedible looking grains, greens and grassy-smelling gratins at an alternative food cooperative\u2019s Sunday dinner. No part of this meal, I was assured, had been touched by the corporate food chain, the Big Ag puppeteers with their taxpayer-subsidized toxins.The evening was all very yeasty and dreadlocky, as you would expect. The food was \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 wretched. I didn\u2019t see it then, but I understand now that many social movements start on the fringe frontier, where earnestness ultimately wins out over the skepticism of people like me.It\u2019s no secret that Whole Foods, the $13.7 billion dollar acquisition of Amazon, took the \u201cbusiness\u201d model I found in a leaky old loft in Port Townsend, Wash., long ago, and gave it a profitable corporate sheen.But what\u2019s less well known and somewhat surprising is how that same food ethic drifted over into the paranoid world of the far right, where no truth is self-evident and the apocalypse is always imminent. At the dark confluence of hippie and Hitler, you can buy a year\u2019s supply of earth-friendly quinoa.What\u2019s sad, and indicative of the wretched Trump era, is how something that started in a wave of hope and optimism migrated to closed-minded, mercenary quarters.You can trace a bit of this transition to John Mackey, the Texas co-founder of Whole Foods. A libertarian and admirer of Ayn Rand, he once lived in a vegetarian collective. \u201cI thought I\u2019d meet a lot of interesting women,\u201d he told The New Yorker. \u201cAnd I did.\u201dBy the time Whole Foods had purchased Wild Oats, the communal ethic had been overtaken by imperial ambition. But that was nothing compared with some of the current peddlers of alt-foods.So, in between rants about how Ku Klux Klan members are \u201cjust Jewish actors,\u201d the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones sells an exhaustive line of strange food. His market is \u201cpreppers,\u201d people who\u2019ve been preparing for the End, for some time.Jones\u2019s website urges fellow knuckle-draggers to \u201csecure your food independence\u201d with his organic-sounding Patriot Pantry. From \u201cfluoride-free mouthwash\u201d \u2014 the better to secure precious bodily fluids, one assumes \u2014 to \u201cstrawberry fields cream of wheat,\u201d he assures his followers that his \u201cnon-GMO meals have a 25-year shelf life.\u201d Plus, no added MSG!Over at The Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s soft-rock version of the hard right, a targeted demographic is the grumpy Trump supporter who wants to Grow Your Own. The site\u2019s story diet is heavy on the threat of transgender kindergartners. But with food, Beck is closer to that co-op I visited.One of Beck\u2019s sponsors promotes \u201cbetter ideas for off-the-grid living.\u201d Another offers \u201cnext level gardening with a geodesic green house.\u201d These items would have fit, years ago, into the Whole Earth Catalog, a must-read for the no-deodorant set.One side, now, is heavily armed, and the other seems friendlier, the products named for Burt and Annie, Ben and Jerry. A consistent thread through the years is distrust of institutions, of the Man. Another shared belief is self-sufficiency.The 1969 Whole Earth Catalog heralded the \u201cpower of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment and share his adventure with whoever is interested.\u201dThere was a brief, shining point when we seemed to have reached a national consensus in the politics of natural food: Michelle Obama\u2019s vegetable garden. It was simple, instructive and Jeffersonian, backing the notion that there\u2019s an easy alternative to all the awful additives at the American table.But even something as wholesome as a healthy diet message got dragged through the right-wing swamp, prompting a defiant Sarah Palin to offer sugar cookies to students living through an obesity epidemic.One of the first acts of President Trump\u2019s administration was to reverse an Obama era proposed ban of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide shown to cause brain damage in children. Trump has also rolled back new food rules designed to reduce sodium levels in schools and give consumers more nutritional information.And while Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters in the hard right are preparing for End Times with chemical-free freeze-dried and other pseudo organics, their man gorges himself on Big Macs and slabs of well-done steaks and tries to keep the rest of us in the dark.

They have the logistical network and the balance sheet to be able to compete on the price side with all of these players.\u201dMatt Maloney, the founder and chief executive of Grubhub, said his company\u2019s focus on food orders set it apart.\u201cUber has built a great company focused on black car service and human transportation, but succeeding in food delivery is a different game,\u201d Mr. Maloney said in a statement. \u201cWe are known for one thing only \u2014 takeout ordering \u2014 and we have engineered our entire product around this purpose.\u201dBoth Amazon and Postmates declined to comment on UberEats.Uber first dabbled in food delivery in Los Angeles in 2014 under the name UberFresh, offering prepackaged lunches and dinners from restaurants. Uber also tried other experiments, like UberEssentials, a way to deliver pantry and drugstore items quickly.\u201cIf you can hit a button and get a car in a few minutes, what else can you get in a few minutes?\u201d Mr. Droege said.But the situation wasn\u2019t ideal, with drivers usually carting food around in a safe storage container in their car trunks. That led to issues with food quality, and customers were unhappy when their food arrived cold. People also wanted a greater selection of restaurants, something that competitors like Postmates provided.In December 2015, Mr. Droege\u2019s division introduced a separate app, UberEats, in Toronto, working with restaurants to provide freshly cooked meals that could be ordered with a few touches of a smartphone button. The service took off, and over the next 18 months UberEats expanded its sales force to bring more restaurants on board and to open in new cities.Uber has also spent the better part of a decade mapping cities and finding the most efficient routes, which the company said may help improve delivery times. And since the problems with UberFresh, it has invested in better technology and added more drivers in participating cities. The ideal UberEats delivery has the driver arrive at the restaurant just as the food has finished cooking, and has it delivered to the customer while still warm.\u201cWhat Uber has are the last-mile logistics, and that\u2019s crucial,\u201d Mr. Cakmak said.Uber said it had invested in increasing its UberEats sales force, as well as hiring data scientists to analyze daily information on customer orders and preferences to help restaurants improve their service or promote their more popular menu items.For Mr. Gordon, the owner of Footprints Cafe, Uber\u2019s investments have been a boon for business. He said the delivery service had helped his restaurant reach new customers outside its loyal Caribbean community, without spending on advertising or promotion on Facebook or Groupon, as he did in the past.\u201cWe\u2019ve employed people who just work on Uber deliveries, and have a counter just for Uber driver pickup,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cIt has definitely been worth it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attacked by Rotten Tomatoes", "Date": "2017-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood had a horrible summer.Between the first weekend in May and Labor Day, a sequel-stuffed period that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales, box office revenue in North America totaled $3.8 billion, a 15 percent decline from the same span last year. To find a slower summer, you would have to go back 20 years. Business has been so bad that America\u2019s three biggest theater chains have lost roughly $4 billion in market value since May.Ready for the truly alarming part? Hollywood is blaming a website: Rotten Tomatoes.\u201cI think it\u2019s the destruction of our business,\u201d Brett Ratner, the director, producer and film financier, said at a film festival this year.Some studio executives privately concede that a few recent movies \u2014 just a few \u2014 were simply bad. Flawed marketing may have played a role in a couple of other instances, they acknowledged, along with competition from Netflix and Amazon.But most studio fingers point toward Rotten Tomatoes, which boils down hundreds of reviews to give films \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201crotten\u201d scores on its Tomatometer. The site has surged in popularity, attracting 13.6 million unique visitors in May, a 32 percent increase above last year\u2019s total for the month, according to the analytics firm comScore.Studio executives\u2019 complaints about Rotten Tomatoes include the way its Tomatometer hacks off critical nuance, the site\u2019s seemingly loose definition of who qualifies as a critic and the spread of Tomatometer scores across the web. Last year, scores started appearing on Fandango, the online movie ticket-selling site, leading to grousing that a rotten score next to the purchase button was the same as posting this message: You are an idiot if you pay to see this movie.Mr. Ratner\u2019s sentiment was echoed almost daily in studio dining rooms all summer, although not for attribution, for fear of giving Rotten Tomatoes more credibility. Over lunch last month, the chief executive of a major movie company looked me in the eye and declared flatly that his mission was to destroy the review-aggregation site.How did a clunky website that has been around for 19 years amass such power?The 36 people who work for Rotten Tomatoes hardly seem like industry killers. The site\u2019s staff occupies a relatively ordinary Beverly Hills office complex \u2014 albeit one with conference rooms named \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cOz\u201d \u2014 and includes people like Jeff Voris, an easygoing former Disney executive with graying hair who oversees operations, and Timothy Ryan, a former newspaper reporter who is a Rotten Tomatoes senior editor and lists \u201cLeonard Maltin\u2019s Movie Guide\u201d as favorite reading.The employee with the pink mohawk is Grae Drake, senior movie editor. She does a lot of video interviews and lately has been helping to fill a void created when Matt Atchity left as editor in chief in July for a bigger job at TYT Network, an online video company.Jeff Giles, a 12-year Rotten Tomatoes veteran and the author of books like \u201cLlanview in the Afternoon: An Oral History of \u2018One Life to Live\u2019,\u201d writes what the site calls Critics Consensus, a one-sentence summary of the response to each film. (Disney\u2019s latest \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie was summarized as proving \u201cthat neither a change in directors nor an undead Javier Bardem is enough to drain this sinking franchise\u2019s murky bilge.\u201d)\u201cEveryone here sweats the details every day,\u201d said Paul Yanover, the president of Fandango, which owns Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cBecause we are serious movie fans ourselves, our priority \u2014 our entire focus \u2014 is being as useful to fans as we absolutely can be.\u201dHold on a minute. Fandango?Mr. Yanover said it was silly for studios to make Rotten Tomatoes a box office scapegoat.\u201cThere is no question that there is some correlation to box office performance \u2014 critics matter \u2014 but I don\u2019t think Rotten Tomatoes can definitively make or break a movie in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who says otherwise is cherry-picking examples to create a hypothesis.\u201dHe cited \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d which was the No. 1 movie of the summer, with $410 million in ticket sales. It was undoubtedly helped by a strong Tomatometer score of 92. \u201cDunkirk,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d all received high scores and drew huge crowds. Other films did not do well on the Tomatometer (\u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard,\u201d \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d) but still managed to find audiences.Some filmmakers complain bitterly that Rotten Tomatoes casts too wide a critical net. The site says it works with some 3,000 critics worldwide, including bloggers and YouTube-based pundits. But should reviewers from Screen Junkies and Punch Drunk Critics really be treated as the equals of those from The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker?For the studios, the question of how individual reviews get classified as fresh or rotten is also a point of contention. Only about half of critics self-submit reviews and classifications to the site. Rotten Tomatoes staffers comb the web and pull the other half themselves. They then assign positive or negative grades.\u201cWe have a well-defined process,\u201d said Mr. Voris, the vice president of Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cOur curators audit each other\u2019s work. If there is any question about how a review should be classified, we have three curators separate and do independent reads. If there still isn\u2019t agreement, we call the journalist.\u201dStaff members also fact-check what critics have self-submitted. In one recent instance, a review of \u201cAlien: Covenant\u201d that was submitted as fresh seemed rotten. The site reversed the categorization after contacting the critic for clarification.Mr. Voris brushed aside the studios\u2019 protests \u2014 shared by many critics \u2014 that the Tomatometer ratings damage films because they reduce nuanced reviews to blunt scores.Still, it is the Tomatometer scores that have become ubiquitous across the web. Rotten Tomatoes makes money through partnerships with companies like Apple, which lists the scores next to iTunes movie rentals and purchases. And to the dismay of movie marketers, Google has started to prominently display the scores even when users do not specifically search for them: Enter the name of a film into the search bar and the Tomatometer results pop up on the top right side of the results page, directly under the film\u2019s poster.\u201cRotten Tomatoes isn\u2019t new, but its omnipresence is,\u201d said Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s president of theatrical marketing. \u201cThe scores are even part of the local TV news on Friday going into the weekend.\u201dIn past years, studio publicists would occasionally lobby Rotten Tomatoes to include positive reviews from far-flung publications as a way of improving scores, especially for films with a 59 \u2014 on the line between receiving a red, plump fruit label (fresh) or the dreaded splotch of green goo (rotten). But Hollywood more or less lived with it.Four things changed.There was Fandango\u2019s integration of Tomatometer scores with its ticketing platforms, which service about 28,000 movie screens in North America. Now, when Fandango customers buy tickets to a movie in the days leading up to its release, they are confronted by the film\u2019s Tomatometer score. After the movie is released, a different Rotten Tomatoes rating \u2014 one based on audience response, which is invariably positive \u2014 begins to pop up on Fandango next to the Tomatometer score.Then there is Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 growth into a very popular hub. In 2009, the site, which sells advertising, attracted about 1.8 million unique visitors per month. It now attracts as many as 14 million unique visitors a month. The broader Fandango portfolio of sites reaches 60 million unique visitors a month.Consumer behavior is also changing. People increasingly rely on review aggregation sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor to make all kinds of spending decisions. The trend is especially visible among young people, who make up Hollywood\u2019s most important audience. According to National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm, 34 percent of American teenagers now check Rotten Tomatoes before buying a ticket, up from 23 percent in 2014.Most importantly, studios are panicking because moviegoing is no longer a habit for most Americans. Because of climbing prices and competition from other forms of entertainment, a trip to the multiplex has become a special event. In particular, more movie fans are ignoring low- and mid-budget films when they are in theaters: Ehh, let\u2019s wait until they show up on Netflix.Studios are trying to battle Rotten Tomatoes on multiple fronts.Another way to undercut Rotten Tomatoes involves restricting reviews until the last possible minute. Sony set a review embargo of opening day for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which left the Tomatometer blank until after many advance tickets had been sold and families had made weekend plans. \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which ultimately received a Tomatometer score of 8, squeezed out decent opening-weekend ticket sales of $24.5 million.If Rotten Tomatoes is a monster, the studios helped create it. As much as they fear and loathe low scores, they love high ones. Sony recently ended its trailer for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d a heist thriller, by flashing the Rotten Tomatoes logo and \u201c100 percent,\u201d the film\u2019s Tomatometer score at the time. (It later slipped to 94.) Annapurna did the same thing for \u201cDetroit\u201d in television ads. (Not that it helped; that drama flopped.)And Rotten Tomatoes is getting stronger. The site is working to build its Tomatometer scores for TV shows into a more formidable force. Also in development are a half-dozen video series, including one built around a cheeky event created by Ms. Drake, the senior movie editor, called Your Opinion Sucks.At that event, which started at the Comic-Con International fan convention in San Diego a few years ago, movie fans debate critics. The hourlong sessions can get heated.\u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s not an accident that I chose a costume that needs a whip,\u201d Ms. Drake said as she prepared to co-host one of three sessions at Comic-Con in July. (She was dressed as Catwoman.)Snarky wisecracks from the critics and hosts started to fly. The stars have as much chemistry as \u201ca mop and a bucket,\u201d one said. Ms. Drake\u2019s co-host, the comedian Scott Aukerman, said that \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth movie in the action series, should have been called \u201cNo one wants to act with Vin Diesel anymore\u201d because the actor had a separate storyline for much of the film.It was time for the audience to vote. Most of the 200 or so people assembled raised green paddles, and so the movie was pronounced rotten.With an intestinal gurgle sound effect.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Louis C.K. and Tig Notaro, Sparring on the Battlefield of Art", "Date": "2017-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the new season of Tig Notaro\u2019s Amazon series, \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d a progressive radio station programmer dogged by rumors of sexual misconduct invites a female employee to his office for a meeting, where he masturbates behind the desk while she talks.\u201cOne Mississippi\u201d went online on Friday; the next day \u201cI Love You, Daddy,\u201d a new movie starring and directed by Louis C.K., had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Reportedly a comedy that digs into the question of how to approach gossip about the sexual transgressions of star artists (Woody Allen, say), the film suggests the lane that Louis C.K. prefers. In the past week, a debate about rumors has moved to the battlefield of art, pitting two of the greatest stand-up comedians working today against each other.\u201cOne Mississippi\u201d is a nuanced, romantic and charmingly drawn series, a moseying six-episode slice of life that occasionally detours down dark alleys. It\u2019s a marvelously layered show centering on a series of unlikely relationships, in which the laughs come from character details more than punch lines.Ms. Notaro is no polemicist, but in the second season, she has married her deadpan sensibility to a work that expresses a strong point of view on sexual assault: The justice system is stacked against victims, and our culture more broadly has become too blas\u00e9 about widespread harassment. The feat of the show is the effortless way it blends the dark and the light, persuading you that narratives with comedy and tragedy side by side are the best reflection of the real world.Ms. Notaro, who plays a character named Tig, is often at odds with her love interest, Kate (her real-life wife, Stephanie Allynne), on how to think about sexual misconduct. After Kate\u2019s experience with the radio programmer, she recalls, with mild disapproval, the inappropriate behavior of a coach in her high school days, and Ms. Notaro corrects her: \u201cBy the way, you were molested.\u201d Kate disagrees: \u201cBut that happens to me all the time.\u201dThe show is most pointed when the two women try to find redress for the behavior of the radio programmer, Jack (Timm Sharp). In an echo of the way Louis C.K. championed Ms. Notaro after her seminal confessional set with its famous opening joke \u2014 \u201cHello. Good evening. Hello. I have cancer. How are you?\u201d \u2014 the programmer tells Tig that he became obsessed with her work when she began doing \u201cdeeper, darker more personal material.\u201dThis scene provides a contrast to a stunning episode of \u201cGirls\u201d last season, a portrait of sexual assault by a powerful man. After Hannah (Lena Dunham) writes about a novelist\u2019s sexual encounters with young women, the novelist, a divorced father played by Matthew Rhys, invites her to his apartment. He is seductive and argumentative and Hannah has already written about him, so their dynamic is complex and shifting.What Ms. Notaro portrays pointedly is not. In her show, the facts of the assault are simple, but the system for handling it is not. In a time when polarized debate over sexual assault often breaks down between those who say society needs to do more to protect victims and others who insist it must do better at respecting the due process of the accused, \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d doesn\u2019t just take a side, it also skewers the weak spots of the opposing one.When he portrayed sexual assault on his FX series, \u201cLouie,\u201d he often seemed to be testing how far he could keep an audience\u2019s sympathies on the side of a sexual abuser. In a 2012 episode, a character played by Melissa Leo delivers a passionate attack on male double standards about sex before she rapes Louie, his sad-sack alter ego. In an episode last year, Louie drags his babysitter across the apartment trying to kiss her. It was an uncomfortable scene to watch.This speaks to an often ignored fact about stand-up comics who make art about characters named after themselves: Their work may draw on real life but can be as fictional as any other art form.In the same interview, Louis C.K. said he wouldn\u2019t respond to the allegations, explaining, \u201cIf you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real.\u201d When asked if the rumor wasn\u2019t real, he responded, \u201cNo. They\u2019re rumors, that\u2019s all that is.\u201dYet Louis C.K.\u2019s slightly evasive response stands out precisely because he has long won fans over by being so open about his private side, in his work and in interviews. (On Marc Maron\u2019s podcast, he talked bluntly about dealing with sexually compulsive behavior and using masturbation to handle anxiety.)Being open about his flaws, sexual and otherwise, earned him sympathy and perhaps even set expectations. Now he says he wants to just speak about the work, even as his new film will inevitably invite discussion about his life. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, especially when Ms. Notaro says she hopes her show inspires victims to speak out.Part of what makes the comedy of Louis C.K. and Ms. Notaro exciting is that they both often suggest they are giving us a peek at an actual life. But once you blur the lines between what\u2019s real and what is not, it can be difficult to bring the distinction between the two back into focus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coming War on Business", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe only time I saw Sam Francis face-to-face \u2014 in the Washington Times cafeteria sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s \u2014 I thought he was a crank, but it\u2019s clear now that he was at that moment becoming one of the most prescient writers of the past 50 years. There\u2019s very little Donald Trump has done or said that Francis didn\u2019t champion a quarter century ago.In a series of essays for conservative magazines like Chronicles, Francis hammered home three key insights. The first was that globalization was screwing Middle America. The Cold War had just ended, capitalism seemed triumphant and the Clinton years seemed to be an era of broad prosperity. But Francis stressed that the service economy was ruining small farms and taking jobs from the working class.His second insight was that the Republican and conservative establishment did not understand what was happening. He railed against the pro-business \u201cEconomic Men\u201d who thought G.D.P. growth could solve the nation\u2019s problems, and the Washington Republicans, who he thought were infected with the values of the educated elites.In 1991, when his political mentor, Pat Buchanan, was contemplating a presidential bid, Francis told him to break with the conservative movement. \u201cThese people are defunct,\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cGo to New Hampshire and call yourself a patriot, a nationalist, an America Firster, but don\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.\u201dHis third insight was that politics was no longer about left versus right. Instead, a series of smaller conflicts \u2014 religious versus secular, nationalist versus globalist, white versus nonwhite \u2014 were all merging into a larger polarity, ruling class versus Middle America.\u201cMiddle American groups are more and more coming to perceive their exploitation at the hands of the dominant elites. The exploitation works on several fronts \u2014 economically, by hypertaxation and the design of a globalized economy dependent on exports and services in place of manufacturing; culturally, by the managed destruction of Middle American norms and institutions; and politically, by the regimentation of Middle Americans under the federal leviathan.\u201dMiddle American voters, he wrote, were stuck without a party, appalled by pro-corporate Republican economic policies on the one hand and liberal cultural radicalism on the other. They swung to whichever party seemed most likely to resist the ruling class, but neither party really provided a solution. \u201cA nationalist reaction is almost inevitable and will probably assume populist form when it arrives. The sooner it comes the better.\u201dFrancis urged Buchanan to run an unorthodox campaign (of the sort Trump ended up running), and was ignored. \u201cIf Buchanan loses the nomination, it will be because his time has not yet come,\u201d Francis wrote. The moment would end up coming in 2016, 11 years after Francis\u2019 death.Francis\u2019 thought was infected by the same cancer that may destroy Trumpism. Francis was a racist. His friends and allies counseled him not to express his racist views openly, but people like that always go there, sooner or later.The Civil War was an open wound for many in his circle, and in 1994 Francis told a conference, \u201cThe civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.\u201dHe was fired by The Washington Times and cast out of the conservative movement by William F. Buckley and others.When you look at today\u2019s world through the prism of Francis\u2019 work, a few things seem clear: Trump is not a one-time phenomenon; the populist tide has been rising for years. His base sticks with him through scandal because it\u2019s not just about him; it\u2019s a movement defined against the so-called ruling class. Congressional Republicans get all tangled on health care and other issues because they don\u2019t understand their voters. Finally, Trump may not be the culmination, but merely a way station toward an even purer populism.Trump is nominally pro-business. The next populism will probably take his ethnic nationalism and add an anti-corporate, anti-tech layer. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple stand for everything Francis hated \u2014 economically, culturally, demographically and nationalistically.As the tech behemoths intrude more deeply into daily life and our very minds, they will become a defining issue in American politics. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a new demagogue emerged, one that is even more pure Francis.Advertisement"}

It is as confusing as the United States Tax Code and daunting for even the most savvy of families with resources and past experience applying.It seems the mystifying process serves colleges because it allows them latitude without scrutiny.

While the faculty at these schools are accomplished scholars, their institutions emphasize teaching as well as availability to students outside the classroom. This enables faculty to devote more time to the needs of educationally disadvantaged students.While I agree that increasing the minority population at top colleges is a worthy goal, we should also measure changes in diversity at the much larger number of institutions that can provide a path to success for many more such students.The writer is associate professor emerita of psychology at Purchase College, SUNY.To the Editor:This is discouraging news and points out that work still needs to be done pre-college in terms of leveling the playing field for blacks and Hispanics. In addition to continuing to work on the pipeline from high school to college, we also need to increase the effectiveness of colleges and universities in graduating those black and Hispanic students who are enrolled.My research related to black undergraduates in 1984 indicated that historically black colleges and private colleges and universities in the Northeast were the most effective institutions in producing black graduates.We need an updated analysis of institutional effectiveness for both black and Hispanic undergraduates to fully understand what needs to be done to strengthen the pipeline from high school to college to degree completion.PHILIP S.

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Stop Government Giveaways to Corporations", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAmazon\u2019s public encouragement of a bidding war highlights a competition that state and local governments engage in every day. I became very familiar with this process: A big business promises thousands, hundreds or even dozens of jobs and waits for offers from mayors and governors eager to demonstrate to voters that they are bringing them jobs. In Delaware, our economic development office, with my full approval, was busy calculating direct subsidies to corporations through grants and tax breaks.I was as guilty as any elected official at playing this game. But it\u2019s a game that should stop. There\u2019s a better way to compete for business.In Delaware, despite some notable failed investments (especially trying to save a closed General Motors factory), government incentives during my tenure resulted in the reopening of a refinery, the near doubling of employment in the state by one of the world\u2019s largest banks and keeping two of the three spinoffs from the Dow/Dupont merger in Delaware. I don\u2019t regret making those investments to keep jobs from going to other states. But it would be better for taxpayers if these kinds of cash incentives could be invested instead in such things as schools and infrastructure.I don\u2019t blame companies like Amazon for playing the incentives game. They have a responsibility to do their best by their shareholders and workers in a climate where competitors are benefiting from similar payouts. Interestingly, though, the chief executives I worked with as governor were less interested in short-term incentives and more focused on long-term partnerships that would help ensure their success. They viewed these incentives as evidence that state and local officials were committed to their company\u2019s future.And I don\u2019t blame public officials, either, for their efforts to attract businesses with enticements, since they otherwise would risk losing out on new jobs, the transfer of old ones elsewhere and the bad publicity that could come with abandoning efforts to entice or retain companies. That would be the equivalent of competing with other cities and states with one arm tied behind your back, and like other leaders, I wasn\u2019t going to do that as governor.The result is a market failure in which neither side is motivated to fix the problem. State and local policy makers can\u2019t unilaterally opt out without potentially negative consequences for their constituents, while businesses have a fiduciary obligation to pursue these short-term direct incentives. Competition for jobs should not be seen to hinge on which government can write the biggest check to an employer but on the kinds of things that officials in Delaware and other states spend so much time on to make their communities places worth living in: the quality of schools, work force development programs, the transportation grid and other infrastructure, and the overall quality of life.The solution is straightforward: Congress should institute a federal tax of 100 percent on every dollar a business receives in state or local incentives that are directed specifically to that company. This would not include investments in public infrastructure, work force development or other investments that can attract employers while also providing a significant long-term benefit to taxpayers.This tax would, however, end payouts that go directly to a company\u2019s bottom line and would eliminate the pressure these companies are under to pursue such enticements. I\u2019m talking about incentives like direct grants to a company in exchange for the creation of a specific number of jobs (something we did in Delaware while I was governor) or free or reduced land or the passage of a tax policy tailored specifically to one company.States would still compete for these jobs \u2014 but they would do so in a way that better aligns with the long-term interests of taxpayers and the businesses themselves.States and municipalities would also retain the ability to institute tax-friendly policies for certain sectors \u2014 like small businesses or high-tech firms (Delaware, for example, has instituted one of the most attractive research and development tax credits in the country).This approach would provide a significant victory for taxpayers. Instead of making direct payments to businesses, states and municipalities would invest in and compete solely based on factors that make the most difference for an area\u2019s economic potential and for a company\u2019s ultimate success, like the abilities of the work force, the excellence of their schools and the quality of life for residents. That is a competition worth having.Jack Markell, a Democrat, was the governor of Delaware from 2009 until January.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Politics: Liberal, With One Big Exception", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley has long preferred to remain aloof from national politics, but the Trump era has altered that stance.A politically awakened Silicon Valley, buttressed by the tech industry\u2019s growing economic power, could potentially alter politics long after President Trump has left the scene. But if the tech industry becomes a political force, what sort of policies will it push?The survey suggests a novel but paradoxical vision of the future of American politics: Technologists could help push lawmakers, especially Democrats, further to the left on many social and economic issues. But they may also undermine the influence of some of the Democrats\u2019 most stalwart supporters, including labor unions. And they may strive to push Democrats away from regulation on business \u2014 including the growing calls for greater rules around the tech industry.Over all, the study showed that tech entrepreneurs are very liberal \u2014 among some of the most left-leaning Democrats you can find. They are overwhelmingly in favor of economic policies that redistribute wealth, including higher taxes on rich people and lots of social services for the poor, including universal health care. Their outlook is cosmopolitan and globalist \u2014 they support free trade and more open immigration, and they score low on measures of \u201cracial resentment.\u201dOn most culture-war issues, they are unrepentantly liberal. They oppose restrictions on abortion, favor gay rights, support gun control and oppose the death penalty.Now for the twist. The study found one area where tech entrepreneurs strongly deviate from Democratic orthodoxy and are closer to most Republicans: They are deeply suspicious of the government\u2019s efforts to regulate business, especially when it comes to labor. They said that it was too difficult for companies to fire people, and that the government should make it easier to do so. They also hope to see the influence of both private and public-sector unions decline.\u201cYou would think that people with enough money to influence the political system would obviously use that influence to increase social and economic inequality in ways that benefit them,\u201d said David Broockman, an assistant professor of political economy at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business and a co-author of the study.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising to us,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that you could find this group that says, \u2018Actually, our taxes should go up and more money should go to things like universal health care, or that we should do more to protect the environment\u2019 \u2014 but at the same time believes that regulations and labor unions are a problem.\u201dThe researchers deliberately chose to examine what they call the tech industry\u2019s \u201celites\u201d \u2014 not rank-and-file workers, but the millionaire and billionaire founders and executives who are best positioned to influence politics. The study is based on a detailed survey of more than 600 such elites around the country (only about a third are in the Bay Area) conducted in February. The researchers also surveyed Republican and Democratic donors and voters for comparisons.The researchers were interested in the tech elite because the politics of Silicon Valley have always been something of a mystery. Many of Silicon Valley\u2019s pioneers initially thought of themselves more as freewheeling revolutionaries than as capitalists bent on global economic domination. They were hippies and draft resisters, as enthusiastic about LSD as about microprocessors, and they brought to their work the tenets of the counterculture.The Stanford study thoroughly debunks the idea that tech is lousy with libertarians. The researchers asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: \u201cI would like to live in a society where government does nothing except provide national defense and police protection, so that people could be left alone to earn whatever they could.\u201dFewer than a quarter of the tech elite agreed with that view. Democrats were almost twice as likely to agree, and Republicans agreed by huge margins.But if they\u2019re not libertarians, what accounts for techies\u2019 opposition to regulation? One idea might be that it\u2019s driven by self-interest. A large fraction said they opposed regulating car-sharing services as if they were taxis, for instance; to the extent that the tech elite have a lot of money riding on the sharing economy, they may worry that regulation of such companies could hurt their wallets.Yet the survey also shows that tech elites are generally willing to support other policies that go against their interest. Huge majorities supported increasing spending on programs that only benefit the poorest Americans, as well as increasing taxes on people who earn more than $250,000 per year.To tease out whether self-interest was at play in their views on regulation, surveyors asked a question about Uber\u2019s surge-pricing policy, which increases prices during periods of peak demand. But the researchers disguised it with a business unrelated to tech: \u201cOn a holiday, when there is a great demand for flowers, sellers usually increase their prices. Do you think it is fair for them to raise their prices like this?\u201dA majority of Democrats and Republicans said it would be unfair for a florist to do that. But 96 percent of the tech elite thought it would be fair.\u201cMy guess is there\u2019s an underlying principle to their views,\u201d Dr. Broockman said. \u201cThey see an entrepreneur trying to do what they want in the marketplace, and they see nothing unfair about that.\u201dThe tech elite\u2019s mix of views is unique; no other group in the survey favored both greater wealth redistribution and laxer regulation. It is genuinely difficult to think of any politician who aligns with that mix.But Mr. Khanna is no opponent of regulation. He has favored greater enforcement of antitrust laws, and recently said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods. When I asked him about the survey\u2019s findings on techie views of labor unions, he was adamant that he didn\u2019t share them.\u201cI\u2019ve always been a very strong supporter of labor,\u201d he said.But the Stanford researchers suggest that over time, given technologists\u2019 money and influence over media, they may have the power to subtly alter Democratic lawmakers\u2019 views. Indeed, that may already be happening \u2014 already, the researchers said, the Democratic Party looks far less interested in curbing the tech industry\u2019s reach than it once did.Consider that President Bill Clinton\u2019s Department of Justice waged a major war against Microsoft\u2019s market power. Just a decade later, the next Democratic president, Barack Obama, took little interest in stemming tech giants\u2019 growing clout.\u201cThere\u2019s one obvious difference between those time periods,\u201d Dr. Malhotra said. \u201cThat difference is the rising influence of the technology industry in politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Wants You to Wake Up With Alexa, and That\u2019s Just the Start", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon released the first Echo smart speaker three years ago, not long after the company\u2019s attempt at a smartphone proved to be a humiliating failure.So far, the results for the Echo have been anything but humiliating. Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities.On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks.Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick \u2014 aggressive pricing \u2014 and by finding ways to embed Alexa\u2019s hooks more deeply into customers\u2019 lives.If the strategy works, Amazon could gain an edge in a new wave of computing. Most big technology companies are convinced that voice commands and intelligent assistants will be primary ways that people interact with technology, perhaps more vital than touch screens and keyboards.David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said Wednesday that the company had about 5,000 employees working on Alexa projects. The company held its event on the 30th floor of one of its high-rise buildings in Seattle, where it had created a living room and kitchen to test how the Alexa devices worked in a homelike setting.The company has identified music, communications and controlling smart home appliances as the most popular uses of Alexa. Although Amazon has not released specific sales figures for Alexa devices, Mr. Limp said tens of millions had been sold.\u201cThey\u2019re literally scattering them around the house, putting them in hallways, workshops and garages,\u201d he said.Echo Spot, a $129.99 spherical device with a 2.5-inch touch screen, is Amazon\u2019s version of an alarm clock. In addition to displaying the time and weather, its microphones will allow people to make phone calls, turn lights on and off and ask how long a morning commute will take. A tiny camera makes videoconferencing possible.The device, and its camera, could also provide a test for Amazon. Whether customers feel comfortable having a camera aimed at their beds will depend partially on whether they trust Amazon to protect their privacy.Also introduced Wednesday was an updated version of the original, cylinder-shaped Echo. The new iteration is shorter, with sleeves made of fabric, wood veneer and other materials that allow it to blend in better with the rest of a home\u2019s d\u00e9cor. The company said it had improved the device\u2019s speakers as well. The biggest change is the price: $99.99 instead of the original Echo\u2019s $179.99.Another new device, Echo Plus, resembles the original Echo, but comes with technology that helps control certain household devices like light bulbs that are automated. Echo Plus, priced at $149.99, is designed to find many of those automated devices with little configuration required.A new version of Fire TV, the company\u2019s device for streaming internet video to televisions, is small enough to dangle from the back of a television\u2019s video port. Amazon said that media companies including Bravo, Netflix and Showtime planned to use a new Alexa capability that lets people use voice commands to control Fire TV video apps.Amazon also said that BMW Group had agreed to embed Alexa in its BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles starting next year, the latest in a series of relationships that Amazon has entered with carmakers to spread the use of Alexa outside the home.Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research said he believed Amazon\u2019s goal was to strengthen the loyalty of its customers, especially those enrolled in its Prime membership program.\u201cOverall, today\u2019s announcements felt like Amazon doubling down on its Echo and Alexa strategy,\u201d he said, adding that the company was \u201creminding all of us that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make money on Echo hardware for the strategy to be successful.\u201dMr. Dawson said the strategy created \u201cinteresting competitive challenges for others like Google and Apple who don\u2019t have such obvious non-hardware revenue streams associated with their smart voice speakers.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the devices introduced by Amazon on Wednesday. Is the updated version of the original Echo, not the Echo Plus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Allure of Black-Colored Food", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWE KNOW ONLY a few grim details of the Hell Banquet, which took place in the first century A.D. The host: the glowering, paranoid Roman emperor Domitian, never happier than when executing opponents in the senate. The setting: a room black from floor to ceiling, lit by low-burning lamps, with each guest\u2019s name engraved on a \u00adtombstone-like stela. The food: of the kind normally offered to the dead, and entirely black.The emperor spoke of mortality as his guests, the city\u2019s leading lights, ate in silence, convinced they were supping at their own funeral. They hurried home, only to soon receive word that a messenger from the emperor was at the door \u2014 surely an assassin. Instead, each was presented with his personal gravestone from the table, which turned out to be made of silver: a gift and a sign of honor.Was there a lesson, beyond the power of rule by dread? That to truly enjoy a meal, we must approach it as our last? That earthly pleasures are heightened when we remember that everything will one day fade to black?Today, such a feast would be a photo op. For the past few years, Instagram has been haunted by fetchingly shot black-hued foods. Not foods so pedestrian as to occur in the wild, like lentils or raisins, but, rather, engineered creations: a dome of ice cream, black like the dark side of the moon; a black bagel like a whorl of raccoon eyeliner; a black foot-long hot dog like a skinny balloon filled with ashes.Of all the senses, sight commands the largest labor force in the brain, demanding the fealty of hundreds of millions of neurons. No wonder taste is under its thrall. Studies have shown that our perception of a food\u2019s flavor can be altered by even the color of the plate it\u2019s served on. In a 1936 experiment by the chemist H.\u2009C. Moir, subjects were confounded when presented with orange jellies dyed green and vanilla cakes that resembled chocolate. Most could not reliably identify the foods\u2019 true flavors. (In another experiment, dishes at a dinner party were misleadingly colored to the point that some guests felt ill.) The midcentury psychologist and marketing trailblazer Louis Cheskin, who wrote \u2018\u2018Color for Profit,\u2019\u2019 called this phenomenon \u2018\u2018sensation transference.\u2019\u2019 Among his firm\u2019s findings: that people shunned margarine, which was naturally white, until it was artificially colored to match butter, and that when an extra tinge of yellow was added to the green 7Up can, customers insisted that the soda contained more lemon.SO WHAT DOES the color black \u2014 or, if you insist, the lack of color \u2014 taste like? More precisely, what do our brains tell us it should taste like? From experience, we might expect the tartness of blackberries or the brininess of black olives or the near-bitterness of charred meat and blistered pizza crusts. Black is the menthol buzz of licorice or the density of rough bread from countries near the Arctic Circle, where the winter months see only a few hours of daylight. It\u2019s marine, like rice blackened by cuttlefish ink in Valencia, Spain, or turfy, like rice blackened by long-soaked djon-djon mushrooms in Haiti. It\u2019s the mineral tang of British blood pudding, Ecuadorian morcilla, Tibetan gyuma, French boudin noir. It\u2019s the funk of huitlacoche, a fungus borne of rotting corn, blossoming like a nuclear cloud out of the dying cob, a delicacy in Mexico. It\u2019s the subtle presence of vanilla, announced by sootlike black spots, scraped from the hard furrowed pod. But even given these associations, when I see a food that\u2019s not naturally black turned that dramatic shade, it strikes me as so discordant that I expect it to taste like nothing I\u2019ve tried before.And yet: The early 20th-century Japanese writer Junichiro Tanizaki, in his tract on aesthetics, \u2018\u2018In Praise of Shadows,\u2019\u2019 noted of soy sauce, \u2018\u2018how rich in shadows is the viscous sheen of the liquid, how beautifully it blends with the darkness.\u2019\u2019 Westerners, he argued, were too quick to banish darkness with bright lights. \u2018\u2018Were it not for shadows, there would be no beauty,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. Consider how Westerners coo over the Silkie chicken\u2019s cuddly feathers, while chefs in the East prize it because beneath the fluff, it\u2019s black from skin to bones, with an almost gamy flavor (although some say it tastes just like chicken). Maybe the role of unexpectedly black foods is to disrupt the everyday, to remind us that not everything is sweetness and light. Maybe this makes the sweetness sweeter.I couldn\u2019t detect any of it. For a moment, like one of Dr. Moir\u2019s bewildered subjects, I couldn\u2019t place the flavor anywhere in the known world. But when I closed my eyes, I recognized it. It tasted like vanilla.At top, model: Molly Tellekson at MSA Models. Digi tech: Stephanie Levy. Photo assistant: Katie Tucker.

{"Headline": "Dear Amazon, We Picked Your New Headquarters for You", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nThe company announced in September that it was looking for a metropolitan area in North America with at least a million people, so we\u2019ve started with the map above. (With apologies to Canada, we\u2019ve set aside Toronto and several other large cities because they\u2019re not included in most of the data sets we\u2019ve used to determine which places meet Amazon\u2019s needs.)Here we\u2019ve cut the contenders by half, keeping those metropolitan areas that have had the best job growth over the last decade, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Metro areas that have actually lost jobs (Tucson; Birmingham, Ala.) and those that have grown more sluggishly are out of the running.Sentimental picks like Detroit fail this first test. Amazon\u2019s request for proposals doesn\u2019t suggest that it will prioritize places it could help revitalize, but the company would certainly have that effect if it chose such an underdog.Amazon is also clear that it needs a lot of skilled tech labor. Remember, it could ultimately hire 50,000 employees. And we\u2019re not primarily talking about warehouse workers, but executives, software engineers, and legal and accounting experts.Amazon wants the kind of place that would lure and keep those workers. That means, in short, a metro area with the features that young, skilled workers like, and where they think they can afford to live.This next criterion narrows the field significantly:Amazon also wants easy access to an international airport with direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York and Washington, which these four finalists provide. At this point, though, we\u2019re going to eliminate Portland, because it makes little sense for the company to put a second headquarters so close to Seattle. So we\u2019re down to three: Boston, Washington and Denver.Amazon could easily sort through all the criteria above by itself (the company knows data, after all). But there are two questions it can\u2019t answer without information from potential host cities: What are they willing to give the company in incentives and tax breaks? And what real estate is on the table? This leads us to our winner:The company has asked for very specific information on all the state, regional and local incentives communities are willing to offer, and the timelines for how long it would take to approve them. Amazon concludes its proposal by stressing that this a \u201ccompetitive project.\u201d So let the competition among cities begin!Advertisement"}

As a result, about a dozen shopping sites from companies besides Google could become more visible and accessible.\u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping,\u201d Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said.The fine against Google in June was among the most aggressive moves against an American technology company taken anywhere in the world. It immediately confirmed Europe\u2019s role as the Western world\u2019s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany\u2019s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.\u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,\u201d said Mr. Verney.The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.Google would like the measure it\u2019s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google\u2019s formidable search platform.Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.Any decision to separate traditional web search from other search-related functions, such as shopping for products, looking for travel bookings or seeking restaurant reviews, could reverse a profitable evolution of the company\u2019s moneymaker.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a Vending Machine Replace a Bodega? A Start-Up\u2019s Plans Draw Fire", "Date": "2017-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDon\u2019t mess with the beloved bodega.That was the overriding sentiment online on Wednesday when a start-up suggested its internet-connected vending machines would upend traditional big-city corner stores, and not-so-gracefully borrowed a name for these stores.When word got out, \u201cbodega\u201d started trending on Twitter. And not in a good way.Frank Garcia, chairman of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told Fast Company that \u201cto compete with bodegas and also use the \u2018bodega\u2019 name is unbelievably disrespectful.\u201d\u201cDespite our best intentions and our admiration for traditional bodegas, we clearly hit a nerve this morning, we apologize,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLike NYC\u2019s bodegas, we want to build a shopping experience that stands for convenience and ubiquity for people who don\u2019t have easy access to a corner store.\u201dThe company declined to comment further.Saiful Islam, who has been working at the Corner News Grocery Store in Midtown Manhattan for about 14 years, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cMachines can\u2019t be the brain,\u201d he said.In most corner stores, customers are not necessarily looking for home goods or groceries. Bodegas are a place, often featuring a friendly neighborhood cat, to order breakfast sandwiches and coffee. A place to buy lottery tickets, cigarettes and foreign language newspapers.Day by day, tech creates a world in which fewer people are needed to do jobs, Mr. Islam said. But at the store where he works, where many lottery tickets are sold, \u201cyou need a person to handle things.\u201dBut Michael L. Kasavana, a former professor at Michigan State University and a researcher on automated merchandising systems, thinks vending machines could replace stores in the future.\u201cAmericans have shown that they\u2019re not afraid to do self-service, whether it be at the gas pump, replacing banking or online purchases,\u201d he said.Ying Luo, who has worked at the 39 & 9th Grocery in Midtown Manhattan for about a year, said that he\u2019d happily be a customer of a ramen-dispensing vending machine in the United States. But without the ability to serve hot or cold items, he thought the Bodega machines were a \u201cstrange idea.\u201dThere\u2019s \u201cno way that could replace bodegas,\u201d he said.She added that the United States was decades behind other countries. Tokyo and Seoul \u201care way, way more advanced technologically in terms of payment,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is digital.\u201dThere might be evidence, though, that bodegas and Bodegas can mutually exist. In Japan, despite its high concentration of sophisticated vending machines, there are about 40,000 convenience stores, according to Foresight Valuation Group.Whether a proliferation of vending machines would prompt a drop in mom-and-pop stores in the United States is hard to determine, according to Foresight: \u201cThe blame would likely be better directed at Walmart, Amazon and Google Express.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Secret Hitler, a Game That Simulates Fascism\u2019s Rise, Becomes a Hit", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI was house-sitting for my brother this summer when I saw something suspicious: a box in his living room emblazoned with the words \u201cSecret Hitler.\u201dOn his return, I confronted him. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is that?\u201d I asked, pointing at the box.\u201cIt\u2019s a board game,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes.More specifically, Secret Hitler is a social deduction game, one that has caught on quickly since it began to ship to players last summer. It\u2019s like Mafia, or Werewolf, or other games in which players try to identify a traitor in their midst.The makers of the game have raised close to $1.5 million since announcing it on Kickstarter in November 2015. It briefly become the top-selling item in the toy and game category on Amazon when it launched, and it recently sold out its second print run. (The company does not publish sales data, but the money they have raised suggests that they have sold tens of thousands of copies.)Independent games in particular have grown in popularity, Euromonitor data showed, as Kickstarter has become a hub for creators with ideas that may be too risky or too strange for traditional publishers. On the crowdfunding platform, creators can raise money while also finding an audience for idiosyncratic titles and getting feedback from potential buyers as games are still in development.The secret ingredient in Secret Hitler\u2019s development was a round of binge-watching. Sometime in late February or early March of 2015, one of its creators, Mike Boxleiter, 32, spent a weekend with the Steven Spielberg-produced World War II mini-series \u201cBand of Brothers.\u201dMr. Boxleiter, Mr. Temkin and a third creator, Tommy Maranges, had been obsessing over the intricacies of deception games. When Mr. Boxleiter returned to their shared office on Monday after having watched 705 minutes of Americans battling Germans, he had an idea for a new game, based on Hitler\u2019s rise to power. The group had a playable prototype of Secret Hitler 48 hours later.\u201cIt was a month before even Hillary announced,\u201d Mr. Maranges, 27, said. \u201cIt truly was like, what if we made a game about the past, and not about any other time in history.\u201dThough it is easier for edgy games to find support at Kickstarter, even people at the crowdfunding site were unpersuaded by the name at first.\u201cI advised them not to call it that,\u201d said Luke Crane, Kickstarter\u2019s head of games. \u201cI said don\u2019t call it that. My exact words were perhaps a bit more colorful.\u201dHe said that even with the success of the game, he still knew some people who would not play it because of its name. But he added that it was clear that the game\u2019s creators had tapped into a topic of discussion in a way that was difficult to achieve, even among the subset that reach to do so.Secret Hitler\u2019s creators are aware that some consumers will not find any humor in the game\u2019s title, either because Nazis are not a laughing matter or because of fears about the growing visibility of white supremacists and other extremists since the election of President Trump.None of the game\u2019s creators, who are based in Chicago, voted for Mr. Trump. Mr. Temkin, who has worked on Democratic campaigns, said he did not think he knew anyone who did \u2014 and his victory took the gamemakers by surprise. He said they even felt a twinge of regret about their timing.\u201cOh, it\u2019s too bad that when this game comes out, Donald Trump won\u2019t be relevant to American politics anymore because it would be great marketing for us,\u201d Mr. Temkin remembered thinking.Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Doesn\u2019t Want to Answer", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFilmed quietly in New York in June, the movie tells of a successful, emotionally lost television writer, played by Louis C.K., who is dealing \u2014 except he\u2019s not dealing \u2014 with the seduction of his 17-year-old daughter by an esteemed filmmaker, and rumored pedophile, who is four times her age.\u201cThere are these people in the world that we all talk about, and we want to know that they\u2019re all good or they\u2019re all bad,\u201d Louis C.K. said during an interview Sunday morning at a cafe in downtown Toronto. \u201cThe uncomfortable truth is, you never really know. You don\u2019t know anybody. To me, if there was one thing this movie is about, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t know anybody.\u201dIt\u2019s an observation that raises the question of how well do audiences know Louis C.K., a man who has built his career out of relentlessly, albeit thoughtfully, mining collective discomforts and taboos.So it\u2019s not real? \u201cNo.\u201d he responded. \u201cThey\u2019re rumors, that\u2019s all that is.\u201dAs he spoke about \u201cthat stuff,\u201d Louis C.K., who turns 50 on Tuesday, did not come off as defensive, but he did speak forcefully. He conceded that making a movie that toys with did-he-or-didn\u2019t-he questions could strike some as a little flagrant.\u201cI made a movie that totally walks all over that electric fence,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s weird.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t weigh these things and go, \u2018I hope everybody\u2019s O.K. with this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s boring to do that, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. I don\u2019t think that everybody has to come to a consensus that it\u2019s O.K. for everybody.\u201dShot in 35 millimeter in glamorous black and white, and accompanied by a sweeping score, the movie is deeply evocative of \u201cManhattan,\u201d making it feel like a Woody Allen movie about Woody Allen. (Louis C.K. said other real-life figures, among them Roman Polanski, fed into the Allen-esque character, too.) He wrote \u201cI Love You, Daddy\u201d with Vernon Chatman, and began working on it two years ago, ending up with this story line out of the many he was considering. The tale folds in the agonizing that goes into parenting, a theme that has been a through line in the comedian\u2019s work (in stand-up as well as in series like \u201cLouie\u201d on FX). He said he saw \u201cI Love You, Daddy\u201d as a tragic tale.\u201cIt\u2019s about a guy who found out too late that he didn\u2019t do his job as a dad, and he couldn\u2019t use the information that he found, and the girl had no choice but to raise herself,\u201d he said. He added later that after seeing the film on the big screen, he felt that it was also \u201cjust kind of a sweet movie about the twilight of childhood and parenthood.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s never afraid to do something polarizing,\u201d Ms. Adlon said, and Ms. Falco concurred. \u201cI am so in awe of that bravery, \u201d Ms. Falco said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s so not who I am.\u201dAnd that willingness to play it unsafe, Mr. Day said, was what set Louis C.K. apart.\u201cThere\u2019s always a little bit of blood in the water with what he makes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to find that in Hollywood, because everyone wants to tread lightly. In a society that\u2019s becoming ultimately far more saccharine, it\u2019s harder to find anybody willing to fly close to the sun.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Citizens of Gucci-land, Unite!", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewMILAN \u2014 On a giant industrial campus in the far reaches of Milan, past the room with the giant chinoiserie swans painted on the walls and the plush velvet chairs, past the garden with its crawling ivy and purple blooms, in a cavernous space traced by a river of winding blue, a mummy lay.Nearby was the Sphinx; diagonally across the room, an enormous Buddha; somewhere in close vicinity, an Aztec arch. Greek statuary was mounted on plinths, ditto Egyptian gods, and flanking it all on one wall were the arches of the Roman Forum. Then the strobe lights came on.So did Milan Fashion Week begin.It\u2019s where, in any case, the designer Alessandro Michele is attempting to build his own brave new world. One without borders or even boundaries; one where everyone is free to be you and me, as Marlo Thomas once sang. Or perhaps more pertinently, to let their freak fly. To pledge allegiance to \u201cResist the mantra of speed.\u201d And \u201cResist the illusion of something new at any cost.\u201d(Those appeals from the rallying cry/show manifesto entitled \u201cThe Act of Creation is an Act of Resistance,\u201d handed to attendees entering the spring show.)If nowhere else at least on his runway, surrounded by the souvenir stand relics of civilizations past. Lots of civilizations past.107 PhotosMr. Michele\u2019s omnivorous imagination is like the Blob, indiscriminately absorbing any adjective, philosopher and decorative detail in its path.Or at least that\u2019s how it looked under the strobes. They were there to make everyone focus on the \u201cexperience\u201d instead of the clothes, or so said Mr. Michele (blue-jeaned, bejeweled, purple aviators covering his eyes and rock star-worthy shaggy brown hair covering his face) before the show.The problem is it just underscored the fact that if everyone embraces the same wild idiosyncrasy, then they all start to look the same. Even reduced to a constituent part, you can spot a denizen of Gucci-land from across a crowded room. Unrelenting nonconformity bears an ironic resemblance to conformity \u2014 which once upon a time was called fashion victimhood.It\u2019s possible that\u2019s what people want now: citizenship in a community defined by a brand, be it the phone they carry or the clothes they wear. After all, more traditional communities are breaking down. Certainly it\u2019s become a working premise for fashion.In the hills of Umbria, Brunello Cucinelli has a campus of his own (more like a feudal town, actually, but perhaps these days that\u2019s semantics), which the designer transplants to his Milan headquarters , the better to model the slow life and his deeply seductive vision of high luxury athleisure: cashmere hoodies with glinting gold stripes down the arm; dark denim evening vests atop feather and sequined playsuits; T-shirts made from stiff pleated tiers of tulle.You can see the appeal when faced with the head-scratching about-face of Alberta Ferretti, who abandoned her signature frothy, fragile femininity in search of what she called renewal. Which began with bathing suits and ended with some metallic sorbet-shaded trousers and shirts knotted above the waist by way of Halston-lite jersey gowns and sparkly baby-doll dresses.Where was she going with this? It was hard to tell, because she never actually arrived.(By contrast, Fausto Puglisi\u2019s decision to detour from his recent trash-\u2019n\u2019-vaudeville version of Siciliana to produce a collection of relatively simple white and black lace and linen slip dresses, shirtdresses and ballerina frocks was a good one.)And you can, perhaps, begin to understand the impetus for the unexpected return of logomania, not just at Gucci (yes, Mr. Michele did that, too) but at Max Mara, where a rococo rendering of the brand\u2019s name was revived as a print on beige pencil skirts paired with matching jean jackets and matching shoulder bags, and at Fendi.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s like our personal monogram,\u201d Silvia Fendi said of the double F, before a show with its own unforced energy that layered \u2014 literally \u2014 the geometries of Italian Futurism with the leaves and lightness of the tropics.Shoulders and waists did double duty as erogenous zones, and stripes \u2014 \u201canother one of our codes,\u201d according to Ms. Fendi \u2014 soared diagonally, horizontally and every other which way, mixed in and over logos old and new (\u201cI refreshed it,\u201d the designer Karl Lagerfeld said of the single gold F in a pink circle that created a punctuation mark at the end of the runway).The letter appeared on belts and buckles, bags, mink bombers, socks and sheer nylon mesh skirts. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for everyone to be part of our family,\u201d Ms. Fendi said. To signal, perhaps, their membership in a social network of a different kind.slide showslide showslide showslide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "DowDuPont Revises Breakup Plan Opposed by Activist Investors", "Date": "2017-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDowDuPont, the chemicals giant, said on Tuesday that it would shift the focus of its reorganization plan after shareholders opposed a proposal to break up the company.The decision is the latest response by a big company to activist shareholders who have taken on ever-larger targets in recent years, demanding changes to corporate strategies. Household names like Procter & Gamble, Nestl\u00e9 and Samsung have all found themselves in the sights of such investors.But as part of the reorganization announced on Tuesday, DowDuPont would shift several units that had been destined for the materials science company, which makes plastics and materials, into the specialty products business instead. As a result, the material science company would be smaller than originally planned and the specialty products business bigger.The new specialty products division will add several businesses that are expected to account for more than $8 billion in combined sales this year. The change is expected to ease concerns by some investors that the materials science company would have too broad a product range, dividing its focus.After the realignment, the new materials science company, which is expected to be called Dow, is expected to have about $40 billion in annual revenue. The specialty products business would have about $21 billion in annual sales and the agriculture business would have about $14 billion in annual revenue.Andrew N. Liveris, the DowDuPont executive chairman, said in an interview that the reorganization created a \u201cmore focused material company, an exciting specialty products company that will have four distinct, independent businesses that will have growth because they\u2019re best in breed in each of their market verticals.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the work we\u2019ve done,\u201d Mr. Liveris said. \u201cIf you study any other chemical company out there, they\u2019re still in 30 or 40 markets. There\u2019s been no corporate restructuring of this type, of this value creation, in any sector, let alone the chemicals sector.\u201dAt the time they announced the transaction, the two companies made clear that they intended to separate the merged company into three. But that plan met opposition from activist investors like the hedge funds Trian Partners and Third Point, which argued that the new companies would each be too large and unfocused.DowDuPont had been working with the consulting firm McKinsey & Company for several months on the reorganization plan \u2014 as part of the merger, a review of the combined company\u2019s operations had been long planned for after regulatory review.\u201cWe have better penetration in certain industries, a broader breadth of product for given customers in an industry,\u201d Edward D. Breen, the DowDuPont chief executive, said in an interview.The company\u2019s shares rose 1.9 percent in early trading to $68.13.Trian Partners, the hedge fund run by the billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, welcomed the announcement on Tuesday, saying it \u201cfully supports the portfolio adjustments announced today by DowDuPont.\u201dThird Point said it was \u201cpleased to be part of a dialogue that created such a positive outcome for all of DowDuPont\u2019s shareholders.\u201dActivist investors have gone after some of the world\u2019s biggest companies in recent years as their influence has increased.The same month, General Electric announced that Jeffrey R. Immelt, its longtime chief executive, would retire this year. The industrial giant, which has been planning his succession for several years, has been the subject of calls from Mr. Peltz to cut costs and improve its returns.An earlier version of this article erroneously included a middle initial for Nelson Peltz.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018American Horror Story: Cult\u2019 Feeds Off Trump-Era Fears", "Date": "2017-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was as if life were offering a unsubtle metaphor for a unsubtle political season. The clown \u2014 the funny-haired figure from the entertainment world\u2014 had become angry and powerful, conjuring malicious minions from the shadows.This is the comic-macabre idea that \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult,\u201d beginning Tuesday on FX, grabs hold of, shakes up and sprays like bloody seltzer all over its audience. As a first draft of political-cultural history, it\u2019s a cartoonish mess. But in its feverish way, it captures the feeling of living inside a joke that\u2019s gone out of control.As it begins, Ally (Sarah Paulson) is watching the election returns on MSNBC. When the presidency is called for Donald J. Trump, she howls as if she\u2019s seen a monster. \u201cMerrick Garland,\u201d she wails. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen with Merrick Garland?\u201dAcross town, Kai (Evan Peters), a lank-haired, intense young man watching the returns on Fox News, thrusts his pelvis against his TV with joy: \u201cRevolution has begun,\u201d he says. Like Ally, Kai believes the world is falling apart. Only he wants to help it along.The emotions at Ally\u2019s viewing party will be familiar to half or so of America. There\u2019s fear, in particular about what a conservative backlash will mean for her and her wife, Ivy (Alison Pill). There\u2019s recrimination \u2014 starting with Ivy toward Ally, who, it turns out, voted for Jill Stein. (In this electoral creature feature, this is the equivalent of inviting the vampire into your house.)The trauma reawakens Ally\u2019s debilitating phobias \u2014 fear of confined spaces, holes and above all, clowns, which she begins imagining everywhere.But just because she\u2019s paranoid doesn\u2019t mean no one\u2019s out to get her. She and Ivy have acquired a creepy babysitter (Billie Lourd) and new neighbors (Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman) who keep bees and a massive stash of guns. There\u2019s a rash of murders, the crime scenes marked with crimson happy faces.Meanwhile, Kai is at work organizing a secret, sinister movement \u2014 and he has a thing for face paint. Send in the clowns.This is not the first time this anthology series, from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, has visited the big top for scares. A murderous clown (John Carroll Lynch) figured into the fourth season, \u201cFreak Show,\u201d and he reappears in \u201cCult.\u201d (The film remake of Stephen King\u2019s clown chiller \u201cIt\u201d crams itself into the pop-culture Volkswagen the same week.)\u201cCult\u201d is more satirical than past seasons, maybe to complicate the idea that it\u2019s simply one more Hollywood product earnestly beating up on Mr. Trump. And while Ms. Paulson and Mr. Peters commit to their characters\u2019 belief in their own derangements, \u201cCult\u201d ends up rendering all political sides as caricatures.The liberals are stereotyped as privileged, self-dramatizing and pretentious. When Ally has a panic attack in her car, that car is naturally a Prius. Another character complains that CNN didn\u2019t precede the election results with a trigger warning.Kai, meanwhile, is all volatile rage, a fan of chaos as much as of Mr. Trump. (His disciples are not exclusively Trump supporters.) He rants at city council meetings and nurses frustrated ambitions. \u201cThere is nothing in this world more dangerous than a humiliated man,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s so purely, obviously menacing that he\u2019s not interesting, and therefore not especially scary.Still there\u2019s something in the core premise \u2014 a woman\u2019s fear that her town is full of hidden enemies and terrors \u2014 that captures something unsettling about the election\u2019s aftermath.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.The sense that the election unleashed a national mania has only grown as we\u2019ve seen neo-Nazis and open racists march, chant and kill in Charlottesville. They don\u2019t represent all Trump voters. But that doesn\u2019t stop Americans from looking at other Americans \u2014 neighbors, strangers, the grocery-store clerk \u2014 and thinking: What\u2019s inside them? What are they OK with? Who are they, really?\u201cCult\u201d is likely just one of the first series to ask these questions directly, now that the TV production calendar has caught up to Mr. Trump\u2019s election. (Mr. Murphy has said \u201cCult\u201d would have had the same theme if Hillary Clinton had won, but it\u2019s hard to imagine it playing with the same urgency.)In the coming season of Amazon\u2019s \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d a Vietnamese-American woman playing a nurse at a Civil War re-enactment is ethnically insulted by one of the participants and attributes it to his \u201chaving permission now to be racist.\u201d In Hulu\u2019s comedy \u201cDifficult People,\u201d Billy (also played by Mr. Eichner), who is gay, receives a \u201cconversion therapy kit\u201d from Mike Pence.Social issues have long been a subtext of horror, from \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d to \u201cGet Out.\u201d A big problem with \u201cCult\u201d is that its subtext is also text \u2014 it\u2019s about today\u2019s politics metaphorically and literally \u2014 and the way it deploys a barrage of hot-button topics, from immigration to stand-your-ground laws, is scattershot and glib.Ally\u2019s phobias are feeding her fake news, which is indistinguishable from the actual danger around her. Sometimes she\u2019s seeing things; other times she\u2019s being manipulated to believe she\u2019s seeing things. Overwhelmed with anxious stimuli from her subconscious and from the news cycle, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s real.Is she going crazy, or has the world? \u201cCult,\u201d in its messy way, suggests that two things can be true at once.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mass Psychology Supports the Pricey Stock Market", "Date": "2017-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThat was the observation of John Maynard Keynes, who suggested that investors do not actually make money by picking the best companies, but by picking stocks that waves of other traders will want to buy.Investing, in other words, is an exercise in mass psychology.I\u2019ve spent decades studying it, and believe that one way to predict future market moves is to sort through the narratives that sweep through the population and influence decisions on whether to buy or sell. Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.The current number is troubling. After the ratio\u2019s peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market\u2019s history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.The notion that investors were laboring under \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: \u201cSTOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED.\u201dIn early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with \u201c.com\u201d in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing \u201cdot-bombs,\u201d articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.So where are we today?That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else. I don\u2019t really know.That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no danger of a crash. But at the moment, the psychological preconditions for a spiraling downturn don\u2019t appear to be in place.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces a New World as Officials Rein In a Wild Web", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a muggy, late spring evening, Tuan Pham awoke to the police storming his house in Hanoi, Vietnam.They marched him to a police station and made their demand: Hand over your Facebook password. Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called \u201cMother\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d which criticized how the communist country was run.One line read, \u201cOne century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?\u201dThe diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world\u2019s largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them \u2014 are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.And it\u2019s not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cGovernments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.\u201dFacebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet\u2019s fragmentation \u2014 and increasingly, its consequences.The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people \u2014 about a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.The Silicon Valley giant\u2019s tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users \u2014 including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya \u2014 may involve more government roadblocks.\u201cWe understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone\u2019s,\u201d said Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and public policy. \u201cBut when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it\u2019s clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.\u201dBy mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest internet market \u2014 appeared to be sputtering.At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child \u2014 usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook\u2019s attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.\u201cThere\u2019s an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. \u201cBut what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.\u201dOne factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies \u2014 and the government\u2019s own propaganda organs \u2014 spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government\u2019s use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing\u2019s understanding of Facebook\u2019s power to mold public opinion.Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook \u201clikes\u201d than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness and China\u2019s reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook\u2019s global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook\u2019s other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.By late October, all 28 of Europe\u2019s national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people\u2019s information elsewhere, including the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness that people\u2019s data is controlled by large American actors,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France\u2019s privacy regulator. \u201cThese actors now know that times have changed.\u201dFacebook\u2019s retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations \u2014 including tough privacy rules \u2014 to control how parts of the internet are run.The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer. \u201cIt reflects the importance they\u2019ve attached to the privacy agenda.\u201dIn interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users\u2019 online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe\u2019s position has been effective in protecting individuals\u2019 privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,\u201d said Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. \u201cWe find their directness pretty helpful.\u201dEurope has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook\u2019s non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland\u2019s privacy regulator because the company\u2019s international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 after Ireland\u2019s data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company\u2019s operations there.And on Sept. 12, Spain\u2019s privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.\u201cFacebook simply can\u2019t stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe\u2019s view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook\u2019s growth, have incorporated many of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules into their legislation.\u201cWe regard the European directives as best practice,\u201d said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa\u2019s Information Regulator, the country\u2019s data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe\u2019s rule book.Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become \u201cthe internet\u201d in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.\u201cI gave it up because people just didn\u2019t come anymore,\u201d said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. \u201cI prefer using Facebook because that\u2019s where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.\u201dAs Facebook hunts for more users, the company\u2019s aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa\u2019s population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services \u2014 centered on those offered by Facebook \u2014 for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.\u201cWe want to bring connectivity to the world,\u201d said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company\u2019s plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.In Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s most connected countries, there has been less pushback.Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook\u2019s Free Basics \u2014 a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.Still, Facebook\u2019s plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.\u201cFree Basics? I don\u2019t really use it that often,\u201d said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. \u201cNo one wants to be seen as someone who can\u2019t afford to get online.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect on Facebook and other technology companies of government efforts around the world to regulate online activity misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Allen.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Nairobi, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Letter: The Land Where Trade Talks Make Headlines", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week the roadshow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement made its way to Ottawa. Although the city was suffering through an exceptional September heat wave, the Canadian government offered school buses that lacked air conditioning to shuttle government officials and reporters to and from the site hosting the talks.Among those reporters, although she avoided the overheated buses, was Ana Swanson who joined The Times\u2019s Washington bureau as its trade reporter earlier this month. Here are some of her thoughts about the trip:Oh, to be a trade reporter in Canada. I crossed over the border this week to a place where the renegotiation of Nafta is front-page news, and people appear to understand \u2013 and to be interested in \u2014 countervailing duties. In the United States, which initiated this vast shuffling of bureaucrats from North American capital to North American capital, trade tends to take a back seat to other policy and political issues.Chrystia Freeland, the foreign affairs minister, said this week that all Canadians are becoming trade experts. Chad Bown, a trade expert I often talk to at the Peterson Institution for International Economics, retweeted that comment with an amendment: \u201cMy only disagreement is on her verb tense. In my experience, all Canadians a good time ago somehow became amazing trade experts.\u201dThe somehow, of course, is having an economy that is so dependent on trade, and being on the receiving end of many United States trade actions. Another came Tuesday as the United States ruled in favor of a trade complaint by Boeing and imposed large duties on Bombardier\u2019s new CSeries jet.The Bombardier ruling added tension to Nafta talks, and while discussions were cordial, you could feel the frustration beginning to bubble under the surface. One of the main irritants is that while the United States has discussed President Trump\u2019s more ambitious proposals for renegotiating Nafta, it hasn\u2019t yet put forth concrete text detailing them.\u201cWithout a formal position tabled, we can\u2019t respond to it,\u201d Ms. Freeland said at the end of the session. Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, blamed the delays an especially lengthy review process in Washington.There is a long road ahead for negotiators, who were already looking a bit rumpled and weary. At least there should be plenty of work for trade reporters.Nearly 30 years after it made Julia Roberts a star, the film \u201cPretty Woman\u201d is making its way to a stage on Broadway. The stage version of the rich guy, poor girl romance has a Canadian connection: Bryan Adams is co-writing its music.Mr. Adams was born in Kingston, Ontario, but is most closely associated with Vancouver, British Columbia, where his career in soft rock began.Nellie Bowles spoke with Jim Watson, Ottawa\u2019s mayor, for an article looking at the sometimes peculiar methods that cities are using to get Mr. Bezos\u2019 attention. Mr. Watson also makes an appearance, strumming a guitar and with a rose clenched between his teeth, in an illustration for the piece.Ottawa is not the only Canadian contestant highlighted. Detroit is using its neighbor and my hometown, Windsor, Ontario, as part of its bid. Detroit\u2019s boosters are proposing that Amazon\u2019s second headquarters could span the Detroit River to take advantage of Canadian immigration rules that make it easier to hire tech talent.To address some emails I expect to receive: We\u2019re very aware that our events have been concentrated on Toronto, and we\u2019re actively working to bring them to other parts of the country soon.Advertisement"}

He is a rich man who often behaves like the caricature of a rich man \u2014 a brash, big-talking native New Yorker who flaunts his cars (\u201cI have all the Teslas\u201d), humblebrags about a popular podcast he hosts (he guesses it makes about $1 million in annual revenue, \u201cbut it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s brand-building\u201d), and even promotes his own branded paper coffee cups.\u201cHave you seen my new cups?\u201d he asked by way of greeting during an interview last month. \u201cI love my cups. They\u2019ve got my tagline: \u2018Do The Work.\u2019 \u201dMr. Calacanis, 46, admits his personality is not for everyone. \u201cMost folks think I\u2019m lucky, some say I\u2019m a complete fraud, and a handful think I\u2019m a brilliant hype man, and I don\u2019t agree with any of them \u2014 I agree with all of them,\u201d he writes in his new book, published in July, whose full title is a mouthful: \u201cAngel: How to Invest in Technology Startups \u2014 Timeless Advice From An Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000.\u201dYet there is something refreshing and clarifying about Mr. Calacanis\u2019s frankness regarding his tech-fueled riches. He states plainly what many in Silicon Valley believe but are too politic to say \u2014 and which has lately been dawning on the rest of the world: that the tech industry is decimating the rest of the planet\u2019s wealth and stability.Still, Mr. Calacanis is offering a much more dismal view of the disruptions caused by tech \u2014 and a more radical, if also self-serving, plan for dealing with it. To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future \u2014 and you need to learn Silicon Valley\u2019s ways rather than expect to defeat it.\u201cMost of you are screwed,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel,\u201d arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America. \u201cThe world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which you\u2019re reading this.\u201dMr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead. \u201cIn my mind, candidly, we\u2019ve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dBe warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as \u201cangel investing.\u201d Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing \u2014 he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.\u201cI want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors,\u201d he says.Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice. They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks. Invest in start-ups with your \u201cfun money\u201d but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.Even other tech investors aren\u2019t sold on Mr. Calacanis\u2019s movement. Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms. \u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to lose all your money, you shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Walk said.Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups. His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacanis\u2019s isn\u2019t without its apparent grifts. Mr. Calacanis runs a \u201csyndicate,\u201d a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets. The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate \u2014 and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors\u2019 returns.Not that he\u2019s shy about any of this. \u201cOf course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions,\u201d he writes in \u201cAngel.\u201dYou could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades. He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, \u201cWhat would it be like to be rich?\u201dHe got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York. Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million. Along the way, he made dozens of connections \u2014 he casually name-drops every big name in tech \u2014 and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into \u201cdeal flow,\u201d getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.One charge against Mr. Calacanis\u2019s advice is that his wins aren\u2019t widely replicable \u2014 not everyone can make a fortune off their friends\u2019 billion-dollar ideas, after all.But Mr. Calacanis isn\u2019t suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to wind up being the GOAT,\u201d he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.\u201dInstead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business. He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his. Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals. He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort \u2014 people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.And he is frank about the risks. The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, \u201cDON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.\u201dBut to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking. The world seems to have lost its moorings; it\u2019s changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.So shouldn\u2019t you do something big? As Mr. Calacanis argues: \u201cNo gamble, no future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Renews Offensive on Silicon Valley With Tax Reforms", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s offensive against Silicon Valley looks as though it is likely to resume, as officials in Brussels consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by digital titans like Facebook and Amazon.The new proposals, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times on Wednesday, broadly aim to tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.But the plans will give ammunition to critics who argue the European Union unfairly targets the United States technology sector. Though the bloc\u2019s leaders deny that they single out American firms, opponents point to an array of investigations against household names for suspected violations ranging from how they handle user data to antitrust complaints.But it was not clear whether the latest effort by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, would gain sufficient traction. Any such reform would require the unanimous approval of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states. While several major countries like France have pushed for a crackdown, others do not want to change a system in which some of them can attract corporations with tax incentives and other inducements.In seeking to tax revenue rather than profit \u2014 one of the options being considered \u2014 European regulators want to ensure that major internet companies pay taxes to national treasuries where they do business. For example, Amazon, a target of the commission in the past, operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000, and so can take advantage of its low taxes.\u201cThe main challenge is to reform the international tax framework, which was first designed at the start of the 20th century and is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d the report said. It will be published by the commission on Thursday.The existing system \u201chas worked well for traditional \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 companies but as business activities have become more globalized and digitalized the old rules work less well,\u201d it continued.It found that companies that did their business online were paying an effective tax rate of 8.5 percent, or less than half that paid by more traditional businesses.The European Union stepped up its efforts to curb tax avoidance, by companies as well as wealthy individuals, after the financial crisis, which forced many of its member states to adopt belt-tightening measures, slashing public services and raising taxes.The commission said in its latest proposals that it wants to agree to a long-term solution with other countries around the world. But that could take a long time to negotiate, and may not close enough loopholes, so it put forward several shorter-term plans that could wind up meaning companies like Amazon, Facebook and Netflix pay larger tax bills in Europe much sooner.\u201cIn the absence of adequate global progress, E.U. solutions should be advanced,\u201d the commission said, adding that it could make more formal proposals on taxation in the coming months.The potential reforms it outlined include taxing companies based on their revenue rather than their profits, allowing national authorities to tax payments made by consumers to digital businesses, and allowing individual countries to tax revenue generated from advertising by internet companies.France has thrown its weight behind the first of those reforms, in particular. But questions have been raised over whether taxing revenue is a viable plan. Businesses that turn a hefty profit could effectively pay the same as a company of a similar size that has narrower margins, or even loses money.\u201cThe fundamental question is where is the business really being conducted,\u201d said J. Scott Marcus, an analyst at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe devil is in the details with a digital service across borders \u2014 the service can be made anywhere.\u201d\u201cThe question is who gets the tax,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine challenge.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Simple Investing for Nonprofits", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe boards of small nonprofit organizations must make major investment decisions, but they are often flying in the dark.There is a simple answer, which works for many small institutions as well as for individuals saving for retirement. It is to put money into low-cost stock and bond funds, allocate the money appropriately and rebalance periodically. But the boards of nonprofits don\u2019t always find this straightforward approach appealing for a variety of reasons, many of them psychological.For one thing, not every nonprofit has board members who want to take responsibility for decisions that could affect their institution\u2019s financial health. Even members with financial expertise may feel ill equipped to make an investment decision in a stressful market.Hiring outside money managers to handle these burdens comes at a price and with no guarantee of success. Assembling a team of superb money managers, as Yale, Princeton and other universities have tried to do, may not be realistic for nonprofits that don\u2019t have an enormous endowment.That\u2019s why Larry Kochard, who oversees the University of Virginia\u2019s $8.6 billion endowment and sits on the board of the $18 million Virginia Environmental Endowment, says the simple solution, equity and bond index funds, makes sense for smaller institutions.Finding good outside advisers is possible for institutions without deep pockets, he said, but it is very difficult. \u201cThe odds of a small endowment finding the right managers are very slim,\u201d Mr. Kochard said.For the most part, he advocated modest goals, saying: \u201cIf we are watching our allocations and spending and rebalancing, we are meeting our obligations.\u201dMs. Shuman also favors index funds for nonprofits, but warns that the success of index funds over the past several years has largely been driven by companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\u201cThey drove a disproportionate return,\u201d she said, and if these stocks decline, the indexes will fall, too. She recommends Vanguard\u2019s managed equity and international funds for low-cost but actively managed alternatives.When considering whether to hold hedge funds, which often do not allow immediate liquidation of investments, many nonprofits may need to examine whether they can afford to forgo access to their money for long periods.That\u2019s not always an issue, however. Before Patti Birch died in 2007, for example, she directed that her Patti and Everett B. Birch Foundation spend down all of its funds in the years ahead. The foundation\u2019s president, Vartan Gregorian, said it still gave money to \u201cthe arts, women\u2019s rights, religious and ethnic tolerance, freedom of speech and strengthening American democracy,\u201d all causes that were important to Ms. Birch. Mr. Gregorian is also president of the Carnegie Corporation.The foundation\u2019s remaining funds are all being held in low-risk short-term bonds, said Mark Imowitz, whose firm, Imowitz Koenig and Company, handles the finances.\u201cPatti was not worried about having great appreciation in her investment assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was natural to keep them in low-return funds since the money was being spent down.\u201dMany nonprofits have to think much longer term, however, and don\u2019t have the luxury of holding all of their assets in a single low-risk asset class.Roughly 80 percent of it is allocated to Commonfund\u2019s multistrategy equity fund, which includes a smattering of hedge funds, and it underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by 2.5 percentage points in the three years through April, Mr. Kempner said. The fund has improved lately, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a manager underperforms their benchmarks, you should not just immediately trade managers. You have to understand what is wrong and how can they plan to fix it \u201cFees vary widely and are not always transparent. Commonfund, which manages about $24 billion in nonprofit money for about 1,400 clients, charges an average fee of 0.3 percent directly, according to Keith Luke, Commonfund\u2019s president. But because the managers selected by Commonfund for nonprofit portfolios also charge fees and because there are additional expenses, the overall fee paid by nonprofits is about 1 percent on average, he said.Commonfund \u201cis like an institutional mutual fund,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cWe create a commingled investment vehicle of managers who pick stocks across all strategies.\u201d\u201cThere is scaled pricing,\u201d he said, \u201cand the larger the portfolio, the smaller the fee.\u201d For sizable portfolios \u2014 about $20 million \u2014 the overall fee would be less than 0.14 percent with Vanguard, he said.Geraldine Fabrikant is a member of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Rich Said No to Getting Richer", "Date": "2017-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA half-century ago, a top automobile executive named George Romney \u2014 yes, Mitt\u2019s father \u2014 turned down several big annual bonuses. He did so, he told his company\u2019s board, because he believed that no executive should make more than $225,000 a year (which translates into almost $2 million today).The old culture of restraint had multiple causes, but one of them was the tax code. When Romney was saying no to bonuses, the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent. Even if he had accepted the bonuses, he would have kept only a sliver of them.The high tax rates, in other words, didn\u2019t affect only the post-tax incomes of the wealthy. The tax code also affected pretax incomes. As the economist Gabriel Zucman says, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to try to earn $50 million in income when 90 cents out of an extra dollar goes to the I.R.S.\u201dThe tax rates helped create a culture in which Americans found gargantuan incomes to be bizarre.The theory behind all those high-end tax cuts \u2014 a theory that I once found persuasive, I admit \u2014 was that it would unleash entrepreneurial energy: The lure of great wealth would inspire business leaders to work harder and smarter, and the economy would flourish.The first half of that theory may well have come true. Many of the world\u2019s most successful companies are American \u2014 not only Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but also Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and JPMorgan Chase. The second half of the theory, however, has been a bust. Most Americans have not flourished in the era of a reduced top-end tax rate.Across society, the most powerful members of organizations have fought to keep more money for themselves. They have usually won that fight, which has left less money for everyone else.What would be the right top tax rate today? I don\u2019t know the precise answer. A top rate of 90 percent clearly has the potential to drive away entrepreneurs. But I am convinced that the current top tax rate, 39.6 percent, is too low.This week, President Trump and Congress will turn their attention to tax policy. After the failure of their health care bill, they are desperate for a legislative win and hope to pass a bill by year\u2019s end. Of course, they are not considering a higher top tax rate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Latest \u2018Killing\u2019 Book Climb the Charts?", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook NewsEvery fall for the last six years, Bill O\u2019Reilly, the former Fox News host, published a new book in his blockbuster \u201cKilling\u201d series. And every year without fail, the books shot to the top of the nonfiction best-seller list.This year could prove the exception, and might spell the end to Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s run as the author of one of the industry\u2019s most popular and lucrative nonfiction franchises.The e-book version of \u201cKilling England\u201d was even more obscure, appearing at No. 864 on Amazon\u2019s Kindle best-seller list. With lackluster Amazon rankings, Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s latest release seems unlikely to gain enough momentum in its first week on sale to become an instant No. 1 best-seller like his earlier works.But Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s publishing career isn\u2019t over by any stretch. His publisher, Henry Holt, stood by him after Fox fired him. Major book retailers like Amazon and Barnes & Noble continue to carry his books. A spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble said that the chain would display \u201cKilling England\u201d prominently in its stores, and that the company was \u201ctreating it like all best-selling books.\u201d A spokeswoman for Holt said the company had a national media and advertising strategy for the title.\u201cWe are just as excited and supportive of Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s newest book, \u2018Killing England,\u2019 as we have been about the other best-selling titles we\u2019ve published by him,\u201d the spokeswoman, Patricia Eisemann, the director of publicity for Henry Holt, said in an email.But Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201cKilling\u201d books, which he writes with Mr. Dugard, succeeded in large part because they were a piece of his larger media empire. The books have typically sold more than a million hardcover copies in the first few months \u2014 a staggering figure for nonfiction.Previous books in the series, all instant No. 1 New York Times best sellers, were \u201cKilling Lincoln,\u201d \u201cKilling Kennedy,\u201d \u201cKilling Jesus,\u201d \u201cKilling Patton,\u201d \u201cKilling Reagan\u201d and \u201cKilling the Rising Sun.\u201d Collectively, more than 17 million copies of those titles are in circulation in all formats, including digital books, audiobooks and young readers\u2019 editions.In its first week on sale last year, \u201cKilling the Rising Sun\u201d sold more than 250,000 copies, according to a news release from Holt. The book went on to be the best-selling adult book of 2016, selling 1,104,389 copies, according to Publishers Weekly.Even though Holt has remained committed to Mr. O\u2019Reilly since the scandal, other partnerships have frayed. Not long after Fox fired Mr. O\u2019Reilly, National Geographic canceled its planned adaptation of \u201cKilling Patton,\u201d which explores the death of Gen. George S. Patton. Four of the earlier \u201cKilling\u201d books were adapted into documentaries for National Geographic. According to Variety, the documentaries drew in an average of 3.1 million viewers in Nielsen live-plus-same-day numbers, giving the books another wave of exposure.Other creative alliances seem to have ended quietly. Last year, Mr. O\u2019Reilly published \u201cGive Please a Chance,\u201d a children\u2019s picture book promoting good manners, with another best-selling author, James Patterson. The book, for 2- to 5-year-olds, was published by Mr. Patterson\u2019s children\u2019s book imprint, Jimmy Patterson. This fall, Mr. Patterson is releasing a sequel, \u201cGive Thank You a Try,\u201d without Mr. O\u2019Reilly. (Through a publicist, Mr. Patterson declined to comment.)It\u2019s still unclear how severely Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sales will be affected by the fallout from the harassment scandal. Sales for his 2016 best seller, \u201cKilling the Rising Sun,\u201d fell off after his firing, but sales of previous books in the series often dipped in the spring and summer. An analysis by NPD BookScan of the first 52 weeks of sales in his \u201cKilling\u201d series found the recent drop to be consistent with previous years.\u201cGiven the polarization of the cultural climate and the dogmatic tendencies of the far right in the current moment, it\u2019s possible that his fans will support him no matter what, and he has a significant social media following,\u201d said Kristen McLean, executive director of business development at NPD BookScan.Mr. O\u2019Reilly has been promoting \u201cKilling England\u201d on Twitter, where he has more than two million followers. In a tweet last week, he urged followers to become a \u201cPremium Member\u201d of his website to get a free copy of the book.Advertisement"}

But instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state \u2014 think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham. Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative to the obvious Acelaland options \u2014 not Boston but Hartford, not D.C. but Baltimore, not New York but Bridgeport.

It was worrying that this kind of passage was out there,\u201d he said in an interview.Usborne Children\u2019s Books, the book\u2019s United Kingdom-based publisher, quickly apologized for the passage and announced on Aug. 31 that it would destroy its remaining stock of \u201cGrowing Up for Boys.\u201d\u201cWe recognize that we have made a mistake. For this we apologize and reiterate that the material will be revised. Our remaining stock will be removed from the warehouse and pulped,\u201d the publisher said.Despite Usborne\u2019s quick response, Mr. Ragoonanan\u2019s post was shared throughout the internet, with Mr. Frith and Usborne coming in for heavy criticism.According to Usborne, \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d has sold over 26,000 copies, mostly in the United Kingdom, and was in its seventh edition. It appears to be available still on Amazon\u2019s British site.When asked about the passage in question, Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the president of New York\u2019s Child Mind Institute, agreed with critics that it crossed a line.\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate statement for a few reasons. One, the audience the book is written for by and large won\u2019t make that shift between scientific fact and humor and, two, if they read it concretely it reinforces the stereotypes we have about boys and girls.\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s a rare pre-pubertal young man who can read a book that is on advice or science and be able to shift from memorizing scientific fact to recognizing something that is tongue in cheek,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do know that young kids are particularly concrete.\u201dMr. Frith and the series editor, Felicity Brooks \u2014 who are both parents themselves expressed dismay that their book might create negative impressions of women in the minds of young men.\u201cOf course a parent is right to be concerned about their child, and I welcome any feedback on my book so that I can make it better! If any parent read the entire book and felt concerned that young boys would grow up thinking they had a biological right to objectify women, then I am horrified,\u201d Mr. Frith said by email.Ms. Brooks echoed her author\u2019s sentiments. \u201cWe wrote these books out of parental concern too,\u201d she said. \u201cI came up with the idea of \u201cGrowing Up for Girls\u201d and \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d when my own daughter was approaching puberty, and I wanted to be well prepared with up-to-date and well researched information to help her and her friends, along with many thousands of others, navigate the minefield.\u201dAs is so often the case these days, the outrage about \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d has largely been expressed in cyberspace. In response to Mr. Ragoonanan\u2019s post, reviewers took to Amazon to register their disapproval. \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d was inundated with one-star reviews and critical messages about its content. One review, from Aug. 28, called the book a \u201cSexist piece of garbage.\u201d Twitter users also took aim at the book, questioning the judgment of its author and publisher.On Amazon\u2019s British page, however, \u201cGrowing Up for Boys\u201d has 3.3 out of 5 stars and is listed as a best-seller in \u201cGeneral Health for Young Adults.\u201d One review, titled \u201cgood guide for tweenagers,\u201d commends its \u201csensible, age appropriate, honest, respectful and reassuring presentation of information.\u201dThis incident is yet another sign of how much the publishing environment has changed in the last few years, with parents and critics calling for greater diversity and attention paid to hidden sexism in children\u2019s books. Something that may have barely drawn attention previously, can now be fatal to a book. And, as Tricia Lowther from Let Books Be Books said, \u201csocial media in particular has been a huge catalyst for change.\u201d It\u2019s also allowed publishers to interact with and understand the concerns of their customers in a new way, she added.Mr. Frith made it clear that he recognizes the section should have been written differently, but added that trying to avoid controversy completely might have created another set of problems.\u201cTo be honest there are a handful of possibly controversial passages in the book \u2013 for example about drugs, pornography and sexuality \u2013 but we felt it was vital to include all of these as they are relevant and important for many of the teenagers who would read it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It New York Fashion Week? Or Is It Rihanna Inc.?", "Date": "2017-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs New York Fashion Week, which officially begins Thursday but actually begins Wednesday (thank you, Tom Ford), a dead duck? Is it a sinking ship, in the soup, up the creek? Is it \u2014 gasp! \u2014 over?Not \u201cover\u201d in the literal sense, of course. There are more than 130 shows on the schedule. But \u201cover\u201d in the substantive sense. Over as a power player in a global system that puts a premium on showcasing clothes that redefine how women present themselves. Over as we know it. Forget whether or not suits are back; this is the existential question underpinning the fashion season.According to the laws of fashion (hemlines that go up must come down; minimalism will have an equal and opposite maximalist reaction), one example of anything is a fluke, two is a coincidence, and three is a trend. This is way past trend.The basic issue is simple: Despite all the allotted catwalk time, there are a handful of names that matter in terms of broad influence and renown.In the beginning there were three \u2014 Ralph, Calvin, Donna \u2014 the brands that became synonymous with upwardly mobile, female-first sportswear.They were joined by Carolina (Herrera) and Oscar (de la Renta). Later came Marc (Jacobs) and Michael (Kors) and Narciso (Rodriguez), the three Americans chosen in the 1990s to help revive major French houses (Louis Vuitton, C\u00e9line and Loewe) and hence crowned the Next Big Things. After them came another generation championed by the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund in the post-9/11 world: Proenza Schouler, Rag & Bone, Rodarte, Altuzarra, Thom Browne \u2014 all newer names with international magnetism.Yet it is exactly that latter group of success stories who are decamping for alternate shores. When the exodus began, I talked to Steven Kolb, chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, about whether he was concerned, and the message was: absolutely not. It was a personal step for each brand based on its business needs, not a vote against New York.And besides, to have the Paris seal of approval \u2014 to have American brands be good enough to show in Paris \u2014 should be seen as a badge of honor for New York.It is true that all the designers who left New York Fashion Week have done so for individual reasons: because it\u2019s better for deliveries to show in July; because they need to reach international buyers; because their parent company is French.But it should be pointed out that no one who shows in Paris, London or Milan seems to feel a need to experiment in quite the same way. Indeed, the Paris schedule is exploding, even without that impulse. And to a certain extent, that simply underscores the stereotype that Paris is a more fertile place for aesthetic growth than New York, one that focuses on creativity as opposed to \u2014 sniff! \u2014 mere clothes.There will be a pop-up store featuring designer-made New York Fashion Week T-shirts, masterminded by WME/IMG, the sports and entertainment behemoth that administers the largest group of shows. Which has also introduced, for its corporate clients and high-net-worth consumers, the option to buy NYFW: The Experience, a behind-the-scenes opportunity to \u2026 well, experience the collections.As a result, the balance of power seems to be shifting from aesthetic influencers to Instagram influencers. From fashion to fashertainment.If you measure success during shows simply by viewership, by clicks and buzz, that\u2019s probably absolutely fine. More people may be watching more catwalks. But if you measure success by the ability to bring decision makers to the city because they have to see \u2014 for themselves, not through a screen \u2014 the way a garment moves on the body, how it can resonate in the memory and change the way an individual may dress so that consumers look to this country for leadership, it might not be.No one is questioning whether American fashion is O.K. It\u2019s doing just fine, retail worries notwithstanding. New brands are born seemingly every F.I.T. and Parsons graduation month. But this particular expression of fashion, the one that represents the soul of American fashion in the global imagination, is a different story.But Sebastian Manes, the buying director of Selfridges in London, told me earlier this summer that Thom Browne was one of the main reasons he came to New York. Now that reason has gone. Alix Morabito, fashion editor of Galeries Lafayette, which will be sending a smaller team to New York this season, said that between the brands that had left the schedule and the rise of see now/buy now, the city had become \u201cless attractive from the buyer side.\u201dFashion is a global business, divided more by psychographics than by geography. And in the map of the mind that is the fashion system, New York has lost its identity.Brian Phillips, president of the creative agency Black Frame, said that the moves create an opening for smaller brands to make a bigger impact, and it is possible that one extraordinary brand could break through and change it all. (The fashion hive mind can turn on a dime.) The street wear scene is still bopping along, though it is unclear whether street wear needs to be seen in person or if the small screen will suffice.More interesting, the CFDA has teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union (along with Planned Parenthood, which it worked with last year) to create runway events demonstrating support of the nonprofits\u2019 causes; and WME/IMG is giving part of the profits from its shop to Unicef, and encouraging models to wear T-shirts between shows designed by Prabal Gurung that read: \u201cModel Citizen.\u201d\u201cWe want to be on the front line, not the sidelines, to boldly fight to protect our precious rights and freedoms,\u201d Mr. Kolb said in a news release. Fashion is at its essence about identity politics, but brands have traditionally shied away from overt positioning. New York could assume that mantle of leadership, with every brand interpreting it in its own way.But out of the cacophony needs to come a core of consensus. Otherwise it risks the worst look of all: irrelevance. Accessorized by parochialism.New York may be in the hot seat, but that does not mean there isn\u2019t action in the other three fashion month cities. Here\u2019s what you need to know.LondonAlso jumping to Europe is Tommy Hilfiger, who will take his #TommyNow interactive party to London (along with Gigi Hadid). Emporio Armani is moving to London as well; ditto Nicopanda, the brand started by Nicola Formichetti, Lady Gaga\u2019s former stylist and the artistic director of Diesel.

{"Headline": "Lena Waithe Made History, and She Gave an Emmys Speech for Right Now", "Date": "2017-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a speech that felt thoroughly, almost preternaturally, attuned to its moment.Her remarks tugged at the heartstrings of a sympathetic audience in Los Angeles (Anna Chlumsky looked unraveled) and many more who toasted the milestone on social media.Ms. Waithe, 33, may have been topical, but her speech took its cues, in part, from a vintage award-show encomium delivered more than 15 years ago. In a telephone interview Monday evening, Ms. Waithe connected her remarks to Halle Berry\u2019s famous, misty-eyed acceptance speech at the 2002 Oscars, when she became the first African-American woman to win the best actress award, for \u201cMonster\u2019s Ball.\u201d Like Ms. Berry, Ms. Waithe connected her win to the multigenerational struggle of African-American women for representational parity onscreen.Her award \u201cchanged me,\u201d she said of Ms. Berry, who dedicated her Oscar to \u201cevery nameless, faceless woman of color\u201d in Hollywood. \u201cIt made me know that we as a community were really embraced by Hollywood in a real way.\u201dIf that message has gone stale in intervening years (Ms. Berry remains the only African-American best actress winner), Ms. Waithe said she hoped to revive and expand it for a new era.The winning episode of \u201cMaster of None,\u201d she said, was \u201cabout what it means to be queer, what it means to be a woman, and what it means to be a person of color. So for me, when I went up there, I wanted to make sure that all of those people knew that I shared that moment with them.\u201dThe episode, \u201cThanksgiving,\u201d has been a fan favorite since it was first released by Netflix in May. Tracing the childhood roots of the friendship between Ms. Waithe\u2019s character, Denise, and Mr. Ansari\u2019s, Dev, it follows the two over annual Thanksgiving dinners, as they navigate Denise\u2019s first efforts to articulate her sexuality. Denise\u2019s mother, like Ms. Waithe\u2019s, is socially conservative and worries that her daughter will face obstacles beyond the ones familiar from her own experiences as a straight black woman.Ms. Waithe said Mr. Ansari heard her story and immediately felt it should appear on \u201cMaster of None.\u201d His instinct has paid dividends.\u201cThe tremendous reception to that episode proves what I\u2019ve continually found to be true,\u201d Mr. Ansari wrote in an email. Personal stories, he continued, no matter how \u201cspecific they may seem, when told with honesty and heart, can connect universally with everyone.\u201dBoth Ms. Waithe and Mr. Ansari belong to a generation of young filmmakers of color who have challenged historical (more precisely: \u201cwhite\u201d) notions of what a television protagonist should look like \u2014 the fruit, they say, of penetrating structural barriers in Hollywood that had long held them back.\u201cMaster of None,\u201d like Donald Glover\u2019s \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d and Justin Simien\u2019s \u201cDear White People,\u201d is the beneficiary of pitched demand over the past few years for distinctive and demographically inclusive television programming brought on by the arrival of aggressive competition from Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.\u201cWhenever a new network starts, they look for the novel, they look for the new, they look for the unheard voices,\u201d said Mr. Simien, who is a longtime friend of Ms. Waithe\u2019s. \u201cAnd when Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and all these places opened up, we were just really ready for that moment.\u201dMs. Waithe\u2019s triumph on Sunday \u2014 and that of Mr. Glover, who became the first African-American to win a directing Emmy for a comedy series for his work on \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 is a sign that these shows are making an impact.\u201cA lot of times, when we tell our stories, they are regarded as niche or for a specific audience, even if they\u2019re well reviewed or well loved,\u201d Mr. Simien said. \u201cI think because of the fact that there are so many spaces for black stories on TV now, there\u2019s more black content, and at a certain point you can\u2019t deny it anymore.\u201dFor Ms. Waithe, who began her career by assisting an earlier generation of black female auteurs (including Mara Brock Akil, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Ava DuVernay), the Emmy win adds fuel to an already skyward trajectory. Next year, she\u2019ll make her debut as the creator of her own television show with \u201cThe Chi,\u201d a Showtime series about young black men living in inner-city Chicago.She\u2019s also working on a feature film and a TV series about \u201cqueer women in their 20s\u201d and has a supporting role in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One.\u201d (He \u201csent a lovely note,\u201d Ms. Waithe said of Mr. Spielberg\u2019s response to the Emmy.)\u201cSo many other people could have won, but I think that, for whatever reason, there\u2019s a person that is the vessel,\u201d Ms. Waithe said, paraphrasing Ms. Berry\u2019s 2002 speech. \u201cI hope to leave a path for others to follow, and to break down doors for others to walk through.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are the Regency romances (descended from the superb Georgette Heyer, whose first one, \u201cRegency Buck,\u201d appeared in 1935). And there are the contemporary young-woman-finding-her-way stories that are the successors to the working-girl novels that for decades provided comfort and (mild) titillation to millions of young women who dreamed of marrying the boss. This formula reached its apogee in 1958 with Rona Jaffe\u2019s \u201cThe Best of Everything,\u201d whose publishing-house heroines find either (a) business success at the price of stunted love, (b) true love and wifey bliss, (c) death. But almost 60 years have gone by since the virgins of \u201cThe Best of Everything\u201d hit the Big Apple, and real life has had its impact not only on modern romance but \u2014 as we shall see \u2014 on modern Romance.The empowerment of women, abundant sexuality steamily reported, female bonding rule the current roost, yet the biggest phenomenon in recent romance is atypical. Originally published privately in Australia, the E. L. James \u201cFifty Shades\u201d trilogy, with its saga of a nice college girl giving herself over to the S &M predilections of a tormented (but gorgeous) zillionaire, has sold over 125 million copies in half a dozen years. James has been derided for her less-than-sterling prose, but mostly by readers \u2014 Salman Rushdie is one \u2014 who I doubt are familiar with the standard romance literature: E. L. James is no better or worse a writer than most of her compeers. What\u2019s made her so astoundingly successful is the trope of spanking, give or take the odd whip and manacle.Does this mean that what vast numbers of women are really looking for is bondage, not bonding? Or is this just a daring momentary flirtation with one extreme possibility of romantic relationship? If this season\u2019s crop of romances is anything to go by, there\u2019s no general rush to the whip: E. L. James and a few other spankers may have both stirred up a vast market and satisfied it. We shall see. Not unexpectedly, her books, while breaking the rules in some areas, hew slavishly to others. Yet again we have the girl of modest circumstances winning today\u2019s equivalent of the duke, the multimillionaire \u2014 the Lizzie Bennet syndrome. And yet again we have the girl of empathy and generosity curing the tormented man: Jane Eyre redux. Spanking apart, it\u2019s the same old song.Exquisite Ang\u00e9lique is the 18-year-old daughter of the Duke of Westerfield (cousin of George IV) and Marie-Isabelle, \u201ca Bourbon on one side of her family and Orl\u00e9ans on the other, with royals on both sides.\u201d It was a love match, despite a big disparity in age, and Marie-Isabelle loved Belgrave Castle as much as the duke himself did, \u201chelping him to add beautiful decorative pieces to his existing heirlooms.\u201d Unfortunately, she dies giving birth to Ang\u00e9lique, who is raised in happy seclusion by her doting father, adored by all. But Daddy dies, and her wicked half brother, the new duke, who hates her, exiles her from Belgrave to work as a nursery maid somewhere far away. She can inherit nothing, because of the entail, except for some jewelry of her mother\u2019s. But providentially, as her father is dying, he hands her a pouch containing \u00a325,000 that he has squirreled away.Bravely Ang\u00e9lique accepts her fate, and settles in to her new life of service. But when she rejects the advances of a salacious young master, she\u2019s fired \u2014 without a reference! Therefore no domestic work for her in England, and when she tries France, she has no better luck there. Down and out in Paris and London, knowing no one and with nothing but her pouch between her and destitution, what does this pure, delicate flower of the aristocracy do? Just what you or I would do: Practically overnight, she opens what rapidly becomes the most elegant, successful bordello in Paris (preserving her own virtue, needless to say). Then on to America, marriage to a hugely rich lawyer who dies (of plot), leaving her with a dear little boy and a fortune. Meanwhile, her wicked half brother has overspent, so has to sell Belgrave Castle, which she secretly buys \u2026 and so forth.This retro venture, flatly written like all Steel\u2019s books, is just further evidence of how romance can swing any which way. Regency, psychopaths, wedding planners, ranchers, sadists, grandmas, bordellos, dukes (of course); whips, fish tacos, entails, Down syndrome, recipes, orgasms \u2014 romance can absorb them all, which suggests it\u2019s a healthy genre, not trapped in inflexibility. Its readership is vast, its satisfactions apparently limitless, its profitability incontestable. And its effect? Harmless, I would imagine. Why shouldn\u2019t women dream? After all, guys have their James Bonds as role models. Are fantasies of violence and danger really more respectable than fantasies of courtship and female self-empowerment? Or to put it another way, are Jonathan\u2019s Bolognese and Cam\u2019s cucumber salsa any sillier than \u201cOctopussy\u2019s\u201d Alfa Romeo and Bond\u2019s unstirred martinis?Robert Gottlieb\u2019s most recent book is \u201cAvid Reader,\u201d a memoir.

{"Headline": "Student Charged in Bronx School Stabbing Felt Bullied, Police Say", "Date": "2017-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week into his senior year, the 18-year-old student logged onto Amazon and bought a knife: a spring-loaded switchblade, slim enough to stay hidden in his pocket but sturdy enough, at a price of $30, that it could be lethal.The student, Abel Cedeno, told a friend he felt trapped. Classmates were mocking him with racist and homophobic slurs, he said. Under a Facebook video on Sept. 16 in which he popped the knife open, he asked why people thought he was soft. Detectives believe he started taking the knife to school, a five-story brick building on Mohegan Avenue in the Bronx where some parents worried their children were so unprotected that they had, in the past, taken to patrolling the hallways themselves.During a history class, two classmates started pelting Mr. Cedeno from behind with pencil bits and balled-up paper, the police said. It was the first time the three of them had tangled, but two police officials stressed that it may not have seemed that way to Mr. Cedeno, who told detectives that other classmates had been harassing him since the start of school.He got up and went to the bathroom, but when he returned, the tormenting continued, one of the police officials said. So he stood up, turned around and said something. A teacher, an aide and two dozen other students watched.\u201cWhat\u2019d you call me?\u201d one of the classmates, Matthew McCree, 15, answered. He strode up to Mr. Cedeno and punched him, according to one of the police officials.Mr. Cedeno then pulled out his knife and, with two swings to Mr. McCree\u2019s chest and one to his back, killed him, the police official said. Both police officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. The other classmate, Ariane Laboy, who told detectives he did not yet realize his friend was being stabbed, stepped into the fracas, and Mr. Cedeno sliced him in the biceps, drawing so much blood that Mr. Laboy fainted.Investigators are still building a picture of Mr. Cedeno\u2019s life before the fatal confrontation: steady bullying by students he resisted naming in a police interview room; a mother who has been stranded in Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria; enough difficulties in school that he was older than most of his classmates.But the killing also seems to have taken place amid currents of homophobia, escalating fear and chaotic classrooms, which some parents and students said had been converging for weeks without the school gaining control.Mr. Cedeno identified as bisexual to a small circle of people, a longtime family friend, Savannah Hornback, said. He also struggled with mental health issues, she said, though she declined to go into details.She said he was a homebody who liked playing video games and keeping to himself. Neighbors described him as an \u201cin-house kid\u201d who held the door open for them, and said his mother went to Puerto Rico to visit family about a month ago. Ms. Hornback said being Hispanic and being bisexual made Mr. Cedeno a target of nasty slurs from classmates.\u201cHe was constantly taunted at school,\u201d Ms. Hornback said. \u201cI guess he felt his only way out of it was to resort to what he did.\u201dMs. Hornback said Mr. Cedeno\u2019s family was not trying to diminish what he did. But she said Mr. Cedeno\u2019s mother had pleaded with staff members at the school for help protecting her son and had met with a guidance counselor there.\u201cThere was no action from the school,\u201d Ms. Hornback said.At a news conference on Thursday morning, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, Robert K. Boyce, said Mr. Cedeno did not specifically cite his perceived sexual orientation as a reason he was being bullied or make clear why exactly he had bought the knife.Chief Boyce told reporters that there was no indication Mr. Cedeno himself had complained to school officials about the abuse.Toya Holness, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, cited a federal student privacy law in declining to comment on whether the school was aware that Mr. Cedeno was being bullied, but she said the department was conducting an investigation.A student who said he witnessed the stabbing, Frankie Santiago, 16, a junior who was friends with Mr. McCree, said, \u201cThe two teachers standing there did absolutely nothing.\u201d He said Mr. McCree had not been bullying Mr. Cedeno and the encounter only grew violent when Mr. Cedeno challenged Mr. McCree to fight. He said Mr. Cedeno overreacted and appeared intent on hurting his two classmates.Ms. Holness declined to discuss the teachers\u2019 actions. She said there were no signs of \u201cstaff misconduct\u201d in the episode. In a statement, the city\u2019s schools chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a, said, \u201cWe have additional safety measures and grief counselors in place and will continue to support the school community.\u201dAt a court appearance on Thursday morning in which Mr. Cedeno was formally charged with murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, his lawyer, Deborah Rush, asked that her client be placed on suicide watch and receive a psychological evaluation. Mr. Cedeno signed an order of protection agreeing to avoid contact with Mr. Laboy, 16, who remained hospitalized. Mr. Cedeno was ordered jailed without bail.A prosecutor, Nancy Borko, said at the hearing that Mr. Cedeno had confessed to the attack and to buying the knife.City officials, facing an outcry from parents for not having had metal detectors at the school before, scrambled to put them in place on Thursday. But parents still kept their children home in droves: Less than a third of students at Mr. Cedeno\u2019s school, the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, and just under half of students at the elementary school that shares the building, Public School 67, attended school on Thursday.Parents said their fears stemmed from a failure by school officials to deal with complaints of bullying. They described students cursing openly in hallways, taunting teachers and leaving condoms and marijuana blunts in the hallways.Kayesha McIntosh, 32, said she once told school officials that students were pulling her daughter\u2019s hair. They suggested she put her daughter\u2019s hair in a bun.\u201cLike that was going to stop her from being bullied,\u201d Ms. McIntosh said. \u201cThey knew she was getting bullied and they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dFeeling abandoned by teachers, she said she visited the parents of one of the offending students herself.Another mother, Jovana Russell, a former PTA president at P.S. 67, said she pulled her daughter from the elementary school after a high school student exposed himself to her in the stairwell several years ago. After parents\u2019 requests for more security were turned down, she said, they started patrolling the hallways themselves.Students described feeling as though they had to defend themselves. Some parents said that led to cycles of bullying and violence in which students who were bullied became angry at a lack of action by the school and started threatening other students.There is little indication that the Wildlife Conservation school is one of the most dangerous in the city. But so routine was the trouble that another mother, Uneek Valentin, 37, said that she was having a meeting with the principal about bullying only to have the principal dash out of the office because a fight had broken out in the school.Ms. Valentin\u2019s son, Dwhy Hoyt, a senior, said bullies curse at teachers, skip class and slap books out of students\u2019 hands, ruining the learning environment.Mr. Hoyt, 17, said he had learned to defend himself, only to be chided by school officials for fighting, and had stopped reporting some incidents.\u201cI had to fight my own battles and make people into my friend,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Elizabeth A. Harris, Jeffery C. Mays, James C. McKinley Jr., Sean Piccoli and Ashley Southall. Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Still Processing: Outrage Over \u2018Bodega\u2019 and Horror at the Movies", "Date": "2017-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStill ProcessingLast week, a Silicon Valley startup called Bodega instigated an internet meltdown after a Fast Company profile made the company\u2019s intentions clear. \u201cEventually, centralized shopping locations won\u2019t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,\u201d said Paul McDonald, a co-founder, who used to work at Google. The outrage made moral sense. \u201cBodega\u201d is name that\u2019s asking for trouble, especially with people who frequent them. The outrage is also easy. Where\u2019s the upset over the effect other, bigger companies \u2013 like Amazon, whose latest major acquisition, Whole Foods, has slashed prices \u2013 might actually have on bodegas? Being mad at Amazon is harder when it\u2019s mixed up in so much of your life. We discuss the dilemma.We also get into the horror at the movies (\u201cIt,\u201d \u201cMother!\u201d) and on TV (\u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d), and how it meets up with our times in surprising and hilarious ways \u2014 especially Darren Aronofsky\u2019s \u201cMother!\u201d with Jennifer Lawerence and Javier Bardem. It\u2019s a mess and a half. But it\u2019s a really fun mess.From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your iPhone or iPad:On your Android phone or tablet:This unedited transcription from the podcast may contain errors. Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it.JW: I\u2019m Jenna Wortham.WM: I\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology.WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture relates to humans.JW: This is...Still Processing. And we\u2019re back.WM: Hi.JW: Hi.WM: What\u2019s going on?JW: Nothing.WM: You\u2019re rocking whatever\u2019s going on over here.JW: Sports bra?WM: Ivy Park sports bra!JW: Look, it only took until September for summer to finally get here, so I\u2019m working with it.WM: I got told today \u2014 by you! \u2014 that I look like a substitute teacher who is trying to be cool at a different school.JW: You\u2019re literally Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed. Good job. So...what\u2019s topping your personal pop chart this week?WM: So, the Emmys happened on Sunday. There was a lot of good news. One extremely infuriating thing that had nothing to do with anybody winning or losing, except America. But there were two good speeches! The first was Ann Dowd\u2019s speech, your favorite, Ann Dowd from The Leftovers and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. She won supporting actress in a drama for Handmaid\u2019s Tale. And she just gave this really strange, peculiar speech. I just want to play a little bit from it.AD: Well, I think this is a dream, you know. Um...I know it\u2019s an actor\u2019s dream, and I\u2019m deeply grateful to you. I\u2019ve been acting for um, a long time, and that this should happen now, I don\u2019t have the words, so I thank you.WM: And then...the other great speech from that night was Lena Waithe winning for writing the best episode of Master of None, with Aziz Ansari. The Thanksgiving episode.LW: And last, but certainly not least, my LGBTQIA family. I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers. Every day, when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world, because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it. And for everybody out there that showed us so much love for this episode, thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the South Side of Chicago. We appreciate it more than you could ever know.WM: I like how she said it. She \u2014JW: L-G-B-T-Q-I-A.WM: At some point, Trump was trying to do it that way during the campaign. He was trying to like...to all my LGBTQIA brothers and sisters \u2014 I see you. I see you. Anyway, listen. I saw It over the weekend. It\u2019s really not, I mean, it\u2019s not ugh.JW: It looks scary!WM: For me, I mean, it takes a lot for me at this point because my tolerance is so high. There\u2019s one thing in this movie that really freaked me out. There\u2019s a really great surprise playing around with dimensionality, you know, big and small, and it\u2019s so effective and so unexpected and so scary. I actually don\u2019t think the reason that move is popular is because it\u2019s a horror movie. Or even because of Stephen King necessarily. I think the movie is popular because we\u2019re going through some weird nostalgia thing right now where it\u2019s so much more fun to be in 1988 than it is to be in 2017.JW: That\u2019s super real.WM: I have a real world problem that we have to talk about. Last week, it was announced that Nestle is buying Blue Bottle Coffee.JW: I can\u2019t believe I missed that. It\u2019s gross. I mean, good for them, but also, that\u2019s gross.WM: I didn\u2019t know anything about how bad Nestle was, and I open up our newspaper on Sunday and there\u2019s a story about how Nestle is one of these companies that is responsible for the obesity epidemic in countries that aren\u2019t ours! In Brazil, for instance, the obesity rates have gone up because of the influx of processed food from places like Nestle. The reason I\u2019m upset about this is because I\u2019ve been drinking Blue Bottle Coffee since Blue Bottle Coffee started. It was just a cute little thing that I did in California, and it was one of many coffee purveyors, but I preferred this one. It\u2019s like one of the only products that I feel a very personal affinity for and connection to. You know what I mean? It\u2019s one of those things where like, I\u2019ve been there from the beginning, and then you know, I have no say in what their business thinking is. If they want to, you know, I\u2019m not a shareholder. If they want to let Nestle buy them, what should I do?JW: Find another coffee place to support, or just keeping Blue Bottle. What are you going to do?WM: I don\u2019t know. I feel like this is probably what we\u2019re going to wind up talking about today, which is like, wherever you look...JW: The milk is never clean.WM: I know. I know, we talk about this so much. Such a quandary. What\u2019s going on with you?JW: I\u2019ll start with a little spot of good news. Ever since I witnessed Rihanna/Robin Fenty at the launch of Fenty beauty, resplendent in yellow top to bottom, head to toe, looking like the reboot of Beauty from Beauty and the Beast that I would watch, that I would pay $10 to watch \u2014WM: Oh, yeah. It was very Beauty and the Beast. I didn\u2019t even appreciate that.JW: Our Belle of the ball. I just have had a renewed appreciation for yellow, the color yellow, which I never wear because I have a yellow undertone and I just feel like it will make me look ill or not be flattering, so I\u2019ve been conditioned out of wearing yellow. But I started wearing yellow, and I get so many compliments.WM: It\u2019s a good color for you.JW: Everyone on the street knows it\u2019s in reference to Rihanna, which makes it even more delightful. A guy in a bodega was like, Fenty, head to toe. And I was like, yes, boo! And then that was it, and I got my sandwich and left. So, as usual, I like to know more about why colors resonate and what is speaking to what universe, and so, I did a little research on Google and I found that the color yellow correlates to the third chakra in the body, which is the solar plexis. It refers to something known as the lustrous gem of the body. So, your solar plexis is a source of personal power. It governs the self esteem, warrior energy, and the power of transformation, so thank you, Rihanna, for yet another gift into my life.WM: Oh my God. She just keeps giving.JW: She never stops giving.WM: What else?JW: Last week, I had the privilege of being taken on a date to see Ms. Erykah Badu in New Jersey.WM: Stop it. You need to stop right now!JW: Me or my date?WM: Uh, the whole thing. I didn\u2019t get an invitation. I didn\u2019t even know she was in the vicinity.JW: You didn\u2019t feel the earth shake? You didn\u2019t feel the universal ripple? You didn\u2019t feel your energy shift? You know, we talk a lot on the show about how musicians age, how celebrities age, how art ages and what holds up, and I\u2019m happy to report that from Mama\u2019s Gun to Baduizm to her new EP to Amerykah One and Two, it all still holds up. Her voice is transcendent. She also performed the majority of the show in a giant oversized cowboy hat in like a laser pyramid. Let\u2019s play Hello off her 2015 mixtape, but you can\u2019t use my phone, because she opened with that and it just sounds so good live.HELLO, ERYKAH BADUJW: Well, Internet got her panties in a twist last week over a new little startup called Bodega. You probably heard about it.WM: Oh, I heard about it.JW: You heard all about it. A new startup out of California that\u2019s basically like, a DYI, buy what you want little pantry box that\u2019s...I mean, the name alone is insulting, but the founders took it a step further and acknowledged, like, yeah, we\u2019re trying to put bodegas out of business. We want this to replace the mom and pop corner store bodega. Of course, Twitter goes HAM, rightfully so to some degrees. But I can\u2019t help but think that that outrage is a little misplaced. It\u2019s extraordinarily valid. I mean, this is a pretty abhorrent principle and it\u2019s embarrassing that these guys are so blatantly and flagrantly like, yes, we want to put a ton of immigrants out of business. We don\u2019t care about them! Just to make our lives easier, so we can have the fancy sparkling water and whatever, whenever we want. But I also want to challenge the way we responded to that, because I think that\u2019s a very easy, that\u2019s a very easy company to take aim at, and they do deserve it, but I think it also allows us to ignore all the other things we\u2019re very complicit in about new technology and startups and the actual, real ways the companies we actually use every day are terror forming planet Earth. Not some little hypothetical thing that\u2019s going to end up in startups up and down the west coast and not actually be, you know, at the corner of Fulton and Flatbush any time soon.WM: Alright. I\u2019d like to talk about that with you. You\u2019re like the only person I want to talk about that with.JW: Well, I want to talk to you about It and horror movies in general and I know we both also saw Mother!, which I definitely want to talk about.WM: Yeah. I would pay more money to hear you talk about Mother! than I would to see Mother!, and I actually had a really good time at that movie, so I would love to talk about horror movies. I also want to talk about how horror is right now, for reasons that are really fascinating to me, a vehicle for several other ideas, and how you can be scared but you can also be thinking about what you\u2019re actually scared of. So, let\u2019s start with talking about Bodega, and the pros and cons of being mad at Bodega, and then the pros and cons of...JW: Indulging in all this existential horror.WM: Right. Well, we\u2019ll be right back.JW: Wesley. We need to talk about this new startup called Bodega.WM: Do we?JW: We do. We absolutely do, because there is the actual implementation of a startup that is meant to disrupt, meant to gentrify, meant to cater to a one percent, a growing one percent class that is not the Wall Street billionaires that we associate with the one percent but a newly minted class of wealthy developers and Silicon Valley, you know, acolytes who don\u2019t want to deal with the nitty gritty and the dirty and the reality of just living in a city. That\u2019s part of it.WM: Brown people.JW: Brown people. Well, some of them are brown.WM: Like, messy bodegas. It\u2019s a snobbery.JW: Sure. It\u2019s a snobbery. It\u2019s a snobbery and an interest in luxury above all else, right? But what we also really have to talk about, and actually what this entire episode is about is reality versus the perception of reality.WM: Yes, ma\u2019am.JW: So, the reality is that these two ex-Googlers launched a company called Bodega, very well funded by some well known VCs. The idea is that you get these little vending machines that are self sufficient, they can go in offices, they can go in Air BnBs, they can go wherever you might need a snack. So, this thing launches, there\u2019s a big splashy article in Fast Company that really does them no favors. And the logo of this company is a bodega cat. They really give them no cushion to make this sound acceptable whatsoever. They present it for what it appears to be: two gratuitous interlopers who are more than happy to put out a ton of immigrants and completely change a culture of cities like New York and San Francisco for the sake of improving and sanitizing and Wall-E-izing, really, American culture.WM: Wall-E. It saw the future, back in 2008.JW: It really did. So basically, Twitter goes HAM. And everyone is like, how dare you. You can\u2019t get a chopped cheese out of a vending machine, really just going in on this company. Which, to be fair, they deserved. Because they were incredibly ungenerous and incredibly callous about the impact on local communities that this startup might have. They didn\u2019t have the decency to lie. And actually, in a way, all they did was tell the truth, which is hilarious unto itself.WM: Well, and I think you know, I\u2019m a big fan of transparency. They were very honest about it. They were very clear about their goals. Business plan was right up front coming right out of this guy\u2019s mouth.JW: And yet, let\u2019s take a closer look at what they outlined their business imperative and rollout to be. They said, essentially they were B to B, so business to business, so, you know, not really going to be on street corners because people would probably smash them. But they were going to be in other businesses \u2014 yeah, you\u2019d smash them. I mean, the kiosks that people charge their phones in get knocked over, so a bodega vending machine is definitely going to get smashed as well. Realistically, though, it was a pretty modest roll out. It was pretty much business to business. They said 50 locations up and down the west coast, which to me just screams, startups. It says, this is not going to be on a boardwalk. This is not going to be at the corner of, you know, Hayes and Goff in San Francisco. Not 6th and Market in San Francisco. It\u2019s going to be in the new Twitter offices, if anything else, you know what I mean? So, basically not that big of a deal. But what I\u2019m interested in is why people got so upset, and why the pile on was so loud and so fun. Do you have any ideas?WM: Because it\u2019s easy.JW: You get a Snickers bar. Because that is the correct answer.WM: Can I get it out of a vending machine? I\u2019m going to pick up my bodega cat and walk to the register and get my Snickers with my own two feet, thank you very much.JW: But you know, I mean, I think it\u2019s worth looking at why mostly Twitter and new, newly entitled media gets extremely upset about something like this and yet has nothing to say about Nestle buying Blue Bottle. About Amazon working its way into Whole Foods. About Fresh Direct. About Instacart. About the proliferation of Uber and all the million Uber clones. All the things that we actually use on a day to day basis that are actually completely reshaping who is moving where and how things are being gentrified. Like, no one\u2019s going to use this Bodega. But people will actually start using Prime to get Whole Foods. And that is a bigger deal. And in some ways, I\u2019m excited \u2014 that is a much bigger threat to bodegas. But we don\u2019t want to talk about it because you know what? How many people in this room have Amazon Prime? I wanted to let my subscription lapse. It didn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to be real about it. I forgot to turn it off, and I still use it. And I like it! Okay? Because if I need a new iPhone case, guess what? It comes in one day. So, I\u2019m just like, look. You don\u2019t get points just because you\u2019re willing to call evil evil. You actually have to do something about it. What happened in New York a week ago? We had, what, primary elections? Did you vote?WM: Oh, I did.JW: Because you\u2019re good like that.WM: I had to turn around and vote, but yes.JW: How many people voted in New York, though?WM: Like 13 percent?JW: And what percent of New York Twitter do you think was complaining about Bodega?WM: 100?JW: Probably. I don\u2019t have the math. I don\u2019t have the stats. I\u2019m not Nate Silver. But I\u2019m saying, it probably was closer to 100 percent. So, listen up, guys. You want to be mad about some hypothetical startup coming into your hood?WM: You\u2019ve got a right to be mad.JW: And you\u2019ve got a right to be mad, but I\u2019ve got a right to be mad too that y\u2019all didn\u2019t vote for the people who are actually making these decisions.WM: No, it\u2019s true. Well, I actually think that the real problem with Bodega isn\u2019t the business. It\u2019s the name Bodega. That\u2019s the thing that we\u2019ve also seized upon with this, which is sort of another thing about this moment, right? It\u2019s that we are now in this identity politics phase of being upset about things and it\u2019s not what the business is actually going to do to bodegas. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s two guys from Silicon Valley yet again with no idea how the real world works, and they are doing something that is an actual affront to brown people. There is an identity politics issue with this name that you can easily seize upon because it\u2019s not the class problem, really. Everybody claims to love their bodega. Let me just say...JW: Nobody loves the $12 olive oil at your bodega that you have to buy because the next bodega is too far and you don\u2019t know if they have it and it\u2019s cold outside, and you gotta make dinner, so you\u2019re just going to fork over the $12. No one loves their bodega. We like the idea that we like our bodegas.WM: Right. The idea \u2014JW: I mean, I do kinda love \u2014 my bodega guy meows at me and I kinda love it. But I also, you know.WM: He also tells you you look fly, apparently.JW: And he zips up my dresses and he helps me out. But the idea that a bodega is necessarily going to be put out of business. I mean, the real issues facing bodegas are things like rent control, changing neighborhood demographics, issues with leases, issues with lots of different things. And I would be really sad if that went away. I would be really sad if I couldn\u2019t buy beer from a 12 year old anymore, and you know, there\u2019s always someone\u2019s child manning the register when they shouldn\u2019t be, and it\u2019s just like part of the fabric of New York and I love it. But the idea that screaming on Twitter about the name of a company \u2014 of a hypothetical company that\u2019s not coming to your city anytime soon, damn it \u2014 and not voting is somehow more effective...yelling on Twitter is more effective than not voting...blows the mind. And it is as indulgent and as privileged and as gentrified as the thing itself. Bodega is part of a larger trend of exorbitantly imagined and priced ideas that are being rolled out and people are adopting, so the idea that this is going to cause \u2014 it caused a backlash, but the idea that this is going to somehow put this company out of business I think is really farfetched because let us not forget, we just had the announcement of a $1,000 iPhone. There is a company called Peloton that\u2019s basically an individual SoulCycle and the bikes are thousands of dollars, and they\u2019re in every startup office, where you just bike \u2014 you don\u2019t have to go to SoulCycle, you can just hop on the bike and it\u2019s WiFi connected and you can like, pedal along like you\u2019re in a class. I mean, Uber valet \u2014 like we have all of these things already that are catering to those growing upper class of young people who basically are infantilized and just still want to feel like they\u2019re in college. It\u2019s already happening. But it\u2019s not the worst of our problems.WM: It gets worse. I was telling you about this company that wants to be a home mortgage company. And the deal with that is, you don\u2019t have enough money for a down payment? By all means, let us give you $50,000. Here\u2019s the catch. You have to pay us the money back, and one of the ways you\u2019re going to pay that money back is by making sure that for one to three years, one of the rooms in your house is going to be an Air BnB available room.JW: It\u2019s the new digital sharecropping. It\u2019s indentured servitude to some degree. That\u2019s crazy!WM: It\u2019s never going to work.JW: Honey, look. It might work. People might do it. These are the times we\u2019re living in. This is what I\u2019m saying about reality versus our perception of reality. Let\u2019s check back in six months and see.WM: Once again, I have been taken to school by Jenna Wortham. We\u2019re going to take a break, we\u2019ll be back to talk about some other happy news in the world of what\u2019s real and not real and depressing and not depressing. Horror movies!JW: We\u2019re going to shove more clowns in the clown car.WM: Yes. We are back.JW: We really have to talk about Mother!WM: We\u2019re going to talk about what happens in this movie. There will be some things that might spoil this experience for you.JW: We\u2019re going to do our best not to completely spoil it, but it\u2019s impossible to talk about this movie in totality without talking about a little bit about how it ends and sort of what some of the theories are behind it.WM: Right. Also, after you see it \u2014 and we both think you should see it \u2014 you can come back and listen to what you skipped.JW: So, you told me to go see Mother! and okay, alright. Wesley, I love you and I hate you, because I go to this movie, I don\u2019t know anything about it. You know I don\u2019t like suspense, number one. You know, you\u2019ve been to the movies with me. You know I don\u2019t like suspense. This is the most suspenseful thing. I\u2019m climbing out of the seat. I went with my friend Dodai, and she made me go to AMC 7 because they have the recliner seats. I\u2019m like, lying back, I\u2019m freaking out. There are no spoilers online. I tried to look on my phone, because it\u2019s so new...WM: I also think people don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.JW: People don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. I tried to read summaries of it.WM: It\u2019s unspoilerable.JW: You know, I just was extraordinarily stressed out. And then at some point, I was like, oh, you\u2019re brilliant, and this is why you wanted me to see this, and now I hate you even more because I loved it and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I never knew what was going to happen. It got crazier and crazier and crazier. It stars Jennifer Lawrence. Love to look at her face. Javier Bardem. Love to look at his face. Michelle Pfeiffer. What a queen. I mean, what a gift unto itself, and she looked amazing and she was so sexy and just, that was the role she was born to play/my future.WM: Drunk suburban mom who drops in?JW: Who refuses to do any housework and just rolls around and wears neon green underwear.WM: And loves Ed Harris.JW: Except for that part. Except for that part. But the neon green undies, boozy drinks during the day, makes fun of Jennifer Lawrence? Sign me up.WM: She was great. This movie, Mother!, is basically the story of a woman in a house, married to a poet, who has got something like writer\u2019s block. He\u2019s having some sort of trouble getting his next project going.JW: And she appears to be some sort of mystic. Like, it\u2019s unclear if she\u2019s communicating with this house that they\u2019re living in, she\u2019s like, every now and again making a little yellow tincture drink and knocking it back. I was just like, sign me up. I love everything about this.WM: Darren Aronofsky, of course, is the director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, and The Fountain and Noah, and his interest in freaking an audience out has everything to do with point of view. Like, he\u2019s a subjective filmmaker. He\u2019s very much more interested in the life of movies than he is in the life of actual human beings and the ways in which he can mine preexisting texts \u2014 in this case, the films of Stanley Kubrick or Luis Bu\u00f1uel or Gaspar Noe or Roman Polanski...it\u2019s really a Rosemary\u2019s Baby, what it turns into is a Rosemary\u2019s Baby-like movie. That\u2019s kind of the vibe of the movie is other people\u2019s movies, and the Bible. The Old Testament Bible. Anyway. Ed Harris shows up. He\u2019s the first guest. He thinks he is, he\u2019s been sent to the wrong house. He\u2019s looking for a bed and breakfast, he shows up at Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s giant Victorian home, the groaning Victorian home, and rather than send him to the place where he was supposed to be going, Javier Bardem\u2019s character is a narcissist of infinite proportions and says, please, by all means, come in. Do stay with us. Jennifer Lawrence is like, excuse me? What? And then there\u2019s a knock on the door the next day. Then, there\u2019s another, there\u2019s a woman at the door. Oh, that\u2019s my wife, says Ed Harris. And in comes Michelle Pfeiffer.JW: The luminous Michelle...my God.WM: The everything...we should maybe do a whole Michelle Pfeiffer episode.JW: We should. No, I love her to death, my God.WM: So, the two of them come with their \u2014JW: Like, hypersexualized libido and like invasiveness and they\u2019ve disrupted this idyllic environment that JLaw has like tried to create for them.WM: But there\u2019s some tension. There\u2019s tension between Javier Bardem and the Jennifer Lawrence character. And the tension has, in Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s character\u2019s eyes, to do with the fact that they don\u2019t seem to be, what\u2019s the love situation like between the two of you? We\u2019re so in love. We\u2019ve got these wonderful kids, and we have a lot of sex, which you can see, because you just walked in on us doing it. Then, there\u2019s another knock on the door. And basically, there\u2019s one knock after another, and what you begin to see once Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris\u2019 kids show up is that this is clearly an allegory for something. You probably knew that two shots into the movie, but this is clearly an allegory for something, and it\u2019s clearly based on a very specific \u2014 it\u2019s based on the Bible, okay. It starts with Genesis.JW: What I will say though is that I spent a lot of time on, you know, our/fan theories \u2014 Reddit is still good for something. I spent a lot of time reading about all the various theories, and it is probably Biblical knowing Darren\u2019s interests in that, but...we\u2019ll get into it in a second, but like, there are a lot of other theories too, we should say. It\u2019s not just based on Gensis.WM: No, no, no, there\u2019s a lot going on here, and I think once the rollercoaster of crazy really flies off the rails...it really does become more than a strictly Biblical allegory. And what winds up happening of course is Jennifer Lawrence...winds up pregnant, and the pregnancy becomes the focal point of the craziness in the movie. And where that goes...is...really entertaining and totally nuts.JW: Ridiculous to the point of absurdity. And that\u2019s when I started to have a really good time, because I was like, oh, we\u2019re like completely off the rails. But we should say that this movie has been very polarizing in terms of how people are reviewing it. Some people are like, zero out of four stars! Some people are like, this is a great comedy. Other people are like, WTF. Internet, basically, thinks that this is based on an allegory of the book of Genesis and that Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s characters are creating this Eden that gets ruined by man, and then all of mankind goes HAM. There was this great thread about how Jennifer Lawerence is actually Lucifer and competing with the poet, aka God, who keeps trying to create something and Lucifer just wants to tempt him away. Which I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. I don\u2019t know. There are other theories that it\u2019s an environmental film, like she\u2019s Mother Earth, and the house is being taken over by a greedy man, who just wants more and more and more, and keeps taking things from her. Like, physically taking things from her, ravaging things from her. I was really into those first two theories, and I was all on the Internet and talking about it with my friend Dodai, and then she was like, I think it\u2019s just about how men are really selfish and take from women, and I was like, is it just about like, the ego of an artist and maybe Darren is \u2014 because he and JLaw are dating, so maybe this is an allegory for their relationship? I mean, what the heck is going on in this movie?WM: First of all, apparently, I\u2019ve been living under a rock, and did not know that Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence were a couple.JW: They\u2019ve kept it hush hush, but I am up up on all the celeb goss, so I knew. But it\u2019s super, super, super on the DL.WM: Not anymore!JW: I mean, the cat\u2019s out of the bag.WM: Here\u2019s what I think. I think the movie is such a mess that it can be anything you want it to be. Because he\u2019s not strictly adhering to this Biblical allegory. And all of the sort of Christian and Old Testament thinking about creation, destruction, greed, sacrifice, all of those things are sort of messily dispersed throughout this movie. And his interest in freaking you out and in showing off what a strong visual director he is...keep upstaging the strength or the tightness of that story. I actually think the funniest metaphor in the movie is the kitchen sink that keeps almost falling off. People keep jumping on the sink and Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s character keeps saying...JW: It\u2019s not braced!WM: It\u2019s not braced!JW: Don\u2019t sit on it.WM: So, the kitchen sink, of course, being in critical complaint parlance, everything is in this movie, including the kitchen sink. This movie has everything in it, including a kitchen sink joke.JW: Yeah.WM: The real question is, is Darren Aronofsky funny? Is he a comedic director? And would it have been more fun if, I don\u2019t know, Luis Bu\u00f1uel or John Waters had directed it. I don\u2019t know. But I think what makes it extra funny is what is funny about it has gotten away from him. So, we are now laughing kind of with the movie, but mostly at it. And mostly at its like, high pitched, ultra keyed up insanity. And yet, I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy enough.JW: I think it could have been crazier.WM: I think it could have been so much crazier.JW: We also didn\u2019t say that like, one of the best cameos in the film is Kristen Wiig, which just comes at the height of the lunacy and like, it continues to evolve. It just...like, that\u2019s when you know that the joke\u2019s on us, the viewer. At least in my opinion. Because you don\u2019t cast Kristen Wiig in a movie that\u2019s supposed to be serious. Like, she is the epitome of just like, the inside joke.WM: Yes. And something happens to her in this movie that is, I mean, it\u2019s just funny. The effects team has a sense of humor too, because the thing that winds up happening to her is just funny. But anyway. One of the other things this movie is about is fame, and about stardom. And in the story about the making of this movie with Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence, they talk about this Kardashian room that Jennifer Lawerence had for herself to stay sort of sane when the violence that her character undergoes as the movie goes on...becomes very intense for her as an actress to have to endure. I actually think that there is something about this movie in terms of where it winds up going that is very much about what we as the consumers of culture want from people like Jennifer Lawerence, and what people like Darren Aronofsky think about what we want from people like Beyonce. I mean, the baby aspect of this movie is actually fascinating, right. Because think about the ways in which we have become newly obsessed and creepily and dangerously and unhealthily obsessed with the babies of famous people.JW: Right, physically, like literally, and also metaphorically, like whether it\u2019s Lemonade or Blue Ivy or the twins, like, we are...WM: The Kardashian Wests.JW: We just want to consume it all.WM: This movie feels like it\u2019s also whether intentionally or not speaking directly to the machine that has to keep this fame going, and these babies are...who knows what\u2019s going to end up happening to any of these babies? But there is something, there is something longevity or \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the term is, but...JW: Well, there\u2019s something self perpetuating about it, though, and it becomes this feedback loop in the film, and it\u2019s very, you know, the movie ends sort of the way it starts, and you get the sense that they\u2019re caught in this hamster wheel of, even though they know how things might end, they keep trying to see if there might be a different outcome, which is actually the definition of insanity, but you get the sense that the movie in some ways is really about the cyclical nature of wants and desires and not being able to resist the things that you know will perhaps eventually destroy you. So, if we look at it from that perspective, so maybe this is a very entertaining slapstick horror movie about the horrors of celebrity. And the dangers inside of it, which actually relates back to the presidency, the current administration.WM: It is definitely meeting up with this moment we\u2019re in where we don\u2019t actually know what is actually going on outside the movie theater with what\u2019s real and not real. Sunday night, at the Emmys, not 20 minutes into the show, Stephen Colbert is doing \u2014 I think he\u2019s still in his monologue, actually, and at some point, he throws it to Sean Spicer!JW: Not even just live Sean Spicer, but Sean Spicer wheeling the podium that Melissa McCarthy uses to make fun of him on Saturday Night Live. And look, as someone who, I was en route to Charlottesville for a panel on some reporting on Sunday night, I only caught glimpses of it through Instagram, and let me tell you. It was gross. Like, it was not, I was like, I\u2019m not cool with this. The funhouse, I\u2019ve gotten too deep in the funhouse and I can\u2019t find the exit. Like, I don\u2019t know what mirror is me and what mirror is play Jenna. I just...it was deeply disturbing, the degree to which people were willing to embrace this person that they\u2019d been denouncing weeks, hours, how many minutes before?WM: And the thing that I always wondered when he was doing his job and lying on behalf of this administration...I actually thought, well, clearly, this guy has nowhere to go when this is over. Like, this guy has almost no viable culture position to maintain. And he will be shunned, he will be the first person to be stoned or something.JW: But will he? Will he?WM: Well, apparently not, because the very people who claimed to have contempt for him...I mean, I just feel like I don\u2019t even know how much control Stephen Colbert had in the production of that show...JW: A lot!WM: But it seems to me that it\u2019s a real moral abdication to allow Sean Spicer to get the last laugh not of the administration, but on Melissa McCarthy, who is sitting in the audience...her job with that role is done. He\u2019s out of a job. She can\u2019t play him anymore. He gets to have the last word on the woman who made him interesting in the first place, and who got the most scathing satire performed on him too.JW: And in addition to making him interesting also offered us the first avenue for comedic relief about something that has been an ongoing horror movie, more or less. Like, reality is shape shifting, reality is ephemeral, reality right now is a chameleon. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s up. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s down. Things are spiraling and continuing to spiral out of control. And the one thing that we had was grounding was the ability to take a step back and laugh at it a little bit, and that was lost when the Emmys allowed Sean Spicer to be in on the joke that he created the need for.WM: Here is Stephen Colbert throwing it to Sean Spicer at the Emmys.CLIP FROM THE EMMYSWM: Well, basically, what he\u2019s doing is playing Melissa McCarthy playing him, in a way, and Melissa McCarthy is sitting there kind of...like, the camera is on her face, and she does not know what to do.JW: I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell her.WM: I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t...I mean, I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell her. If they didn\u2019t tell her...oh, God. That\u2019s crazy. Can you imagine? She looked shocked.JW: This is how you know we\u2019re in the Truman Show. I need a scene to happen where someone is rowing to the edge of set and can\u2019t leave. You know what I mean?WM: But I actually think that\u2019s why Mother! is a movie for right now, because we\u2019ve been talking a lot about Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s role as sort of a passive victim and vehicle for the insanity that winds up swallowing her up, but really, it\u2019s about Javier Bardem\u2019s character, and it\u2019s about how nothing can stop what a narcissistic evil a-hole he is. And he\u2019s got the crystal. He can always just put the crystal back in the thing, the world resets, and another woman just wakes up in the bed every single time. He\u2019s got all the control.JW: All the power.WM: And I feel like this administration is so much like that. Nothing is stopping them from enacting their craziest most insane desires. People leave that administration, and they go on and do whatever they want. I went and say It, based on Stephen King\u2019s 1986 novel about a clown that haunts the daylight and nightlife of a group of children in a small town in Maine, and I thought, what a Trump metaphor! But I actually think it\u2019s so obvious and easy, and I think really that it is about how we don\u2019t want to live with what we\u2019re currently living with, and how there is a nostalgia for living in what we think is a simpler time, but I also think that the great thing about Stephen King and the reason we keep going back to him is that he\u2019s kind of uncompromising in his vision of what is horrific and what is scary.JW: And also, our inability to acknowledge that the seemingly impossible is possible, and our inability to comprehend that the most bizarre juxtaposition, we can\u2019t understand that things can have a duality and there can actually be a lot of evil embedded in something we\u2019re conditioned to believe is good. In fact, that\u2019s actually where the most evil thing might live, and I think for me, as a child, I read It, which was, I don\u2019t know what my parents were doing or thinking, they let me read all of Stephen King when I was like nine years old. It was in the house, like everything else \u2014 Danielle Steel, Stephen King, I read it all. Terry McMillan. But you know, aside from \u2014 and I have a high tolerance for horror, horror doesn\u2019t mess me up. Suspense does. I don\u2019t like suspense, I love horror. But the thing I always took away from It was just, you know, we are...we are fallible if we do not acknowledge the thing that is most present and most likely to be a threat. That\u2019s our Achilles heel as a society. It feels like the reboot is tapping into that too.WM: Yes. Both these movies to me are speaking to this moment in ways that are sort of maybe even beyond their makers\u2019 understanding.JW: Well, sir, that\u2019s an extremely generous read on your part to both of those directors who...I can\u2019t say for sure, because I\u2019m not living inside their heads like a little John Malkovich character, but look. There\u2019s a way in which it could just be a super fun early Halloween, campy, trashy film that you go see because you\u2019re bored and you need something to do on date night. There is, you know, a way in which Mother! is also causing a lot of outrage. People are very annoyed that this movie was funded, that this movie was made, that it\u2019s getting as much attention as it is. We\u2019re in a climate where people feel like there aren\u2019t enough stories that are relevant and interesting, especially movies that speak to queer POC perspectives, you know. This movie feels gratuitous in terms of scope and scale and budget and attention, so just to acknowledge that they might have some actual meaningful role to play in our general existential society consciousness is really nice of you.WM: But I think they\u2019re doing that anyway. I don\u2019t know. I just feel like...JW: Well, that\u2019s probably not what they intended.WM: Well...I think sometimes, the best and most lasting movies sort of live beyond what whoever made them intended to do. We should say that the director of It is Andy Muschietti. And I think that...there is a competency at work in both of these movies. I think one, it is too loud and a bunch of other things, but I think they wind up managing to speak to this moment better than you could have hoped. All our consciously trash movies...JW: And society right now is consciously kind of a trash society, so...like attracts like.WM: Right. And for anybody who is misunderstanding what I\u2019m saying, trash, I think, is my favorite type of movie.JW: Ditto. It took me a while to learn that about you, and I\u2019m here for it. I\u2019m into it.WM: Darren Aronofsky makes one trashier piece after the next, and I just really support that. Anyway. That\u2019s it.JW: Okay, cool.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

In the meantime, if you stayed at a Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Four Points, Aloft, Le M\u00e9ridien, Tribute, Design Hotels, Elements or Luxury Collection hotel in the last four years, you may want to assume that you were.Regardless of the type of breach or the company involved, it\u2019s always a safe bet to change passwords for sites that contain sensitive information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites, and do not use your Social Security number as a username or a password.And if you were not doing so already, you will have to treat everything you receive online with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick you out of even more information.These sites create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. Password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode.If you must create your own passwords, try creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters.My favorite number is Green4782#The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%Or, if you\u2019re extra paranoid, consider mimicking this setup. Take the sentence:\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\u201dAnd convert it into this:\u201cMni!m.YkMf.PtD!\u201dIn general, create the strongest passwords for the sites that contain the most sensitive information and do not reuse them anywhere.Passwords are not enough. If a site offers additional security features, like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text or a code through an authenticator app) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Many bank sites and major sites like Google, Facebook and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you are logging in from a new computer.If you get an email containing links or attachments, even if it appears to be from a familiar friend or colleague, do yourself a favor: Check the From Email Address. Often, attackers will tweak email addresses to be recognizable to their target. Only under closer examination does their target see that the domain is misspelled or the attacker has replaced an \"i\" with a 1. Other times, the email will contain obvious misspellings or strange syntax that was obviously created by a foreigner using Google translate or another translation service. If anything seems off, do not click.To help mitigate what malicious attachments can do to your machine, make sure to update your software regularly, particularly your operating system. Frequently, software companies will release updates that patch bugs and software vulnerabilities when they are discovered.Sites will often use common security questions to recover a user\u2019s account if the password is forgotten.These questions are problematic because the internet has made public record searches simple and the answers are usually easy to guess.In a study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat is your favorite food?\u201d (It was pizza.)With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat is your city of birth?\u201d and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.If you're required to answer security questions, lie and jot down your fake answers in pen or paper. (Q. \"Where were you born?\" A. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Q. \"What was your first pet\u2019s name?\" A. Peach.)Remember the old adage: Don\u2019t put anything in an email that you would not want to see on the front page of The New York Times. The same applies to your sensitive information. Never ever send sensitive data like passwords, Social Security numbers or PINs in an email. If you must share this information, do it over the phone or, worst-case scenario, through an encrypted messaging app like Signal, which allows you to scramble messages and time them to disappear.Never allow a retailer or merchant to store your credit card information unnecessarily. If it is offered, use PayPal or Apple Pay for online transactions. Both are safer than most online payment methods.Your phone is incredibly valuable to criminals and spies. Treat it accordingly. Don\u2019t bother with a four-digit passcode, which is easy to guess. Six-digit passcodes are harder to guess. Eight-digit-passcodes are better.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Start-Up Slump Is a Drag on the Economy. Big Business May Be to Blame.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment has fallen, and the stock market has soared. So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?Economists say the answer, to some degree, can be found in a start-up slump \u2014 a decline in the creation of new businesses \u2014 and a growing understanding of what\u2019s behind it.\u201cWe\u2019re still in a start-up funk,\u201d said Robert Litan, an economist and antitrust lawyer who has studied the issue. \u201cObviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you\u2019re left with the conundrum: Why hasn\u2019t there been any recovery?\u201dMany economists say the answer could lie in the rising power of the biggest corporations, which they argue is stifling entrepreneurship by making it easier for incumbent businesses to swat away challengers \u2014 or else to swallow them before they become a serious threat.\u201cYou\u2019ve got rising market power,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn general, that makes it hard for new businesses to compete with incumbents. Market power is the story that explains everything.\u201dThe start-up slump has far-reaching implications. Small businesses in general are often cited as an exemplar of economic dynamism. But it is start-ups \u2014 and particularly the small subset of companies that grow quickly \u2014 that are key drivers of job creation and innovation, and have historically been a ladder into the middle class for less-educated workers and immigrants.Perhaps most significant, start-ups play a critical role in making the economy as a whole more productive, as they invent new products and approaches, forcing existing businesses to compete or fall by the wayside.\u201cAcross the decades, young companies are really the heavy hitters and the consistent hitters in terms of job creation,\u201d said Arnobio Morelix, an economist at the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit in Kansas City, Mo., that studies and promotes entrepreneurship.The start-up decline might defy expectations in the age of Uber and \u201cShark Tank.\u201d But however counterintuitive, the trend is backed by multiple data sources and numerous economic studies.In 1980, according to the Census Bureau data, roughly one in eight companies had been founded in the past year; by 2015, that ratio had fallen to fewer than one in 12. The downward trend cuts across regions and industries and, at least since 2000, includes even the beating heart of American entrepreneurship, high tech.Although the overall slump dates back more than 30 years, economists are most concerned about a more recent trend. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entrepreneurial slowdown was concentrated in sectors such as retail, where corner stores and regional brands were being subsumed by national chains. That trend, though often painful for local communities, wasn\u2019t necessarily a drag on productivity more generally.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of pieces now that say dynamism has gone down a lot since 2000,\u201d said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist who has done much of the pioneering work in the field. \u201cStart-ups have gone down a lot since 2000, especially in the high-tech sectors, and there are increasingly strong links to productivity.\u201dWhat is behind the decline in entrepreneurship is less clear. Economists and other experts have pointed to a range of possible explanations: The aging of the baby-boom generation has left fewer Americans in their prime business-starting years. The decline of community banks and the collapse of the market for home-equity loans may have made it harder for would-be entrepreneurs to get access to capital. Increased regulation, at both the state and federal levels, may be particularly burdensome for new businesses that lack well-staffed compliance departments. Those and other factors could well play a role, but none can fully explain the decline.More recently, economists \u2014 especially but not exclusively on the left \u2014 have begun pointing the finger at big business, and in particular at the handful of companies that increasingly dominate many industries.The evidence is largely circumstantial: The slump in entrepreneurship has coincided with a period of increasing concentration in nearly every major industry. Research from Mr. Haltiwanger and several co-authors has found that the most productive companies are growing more slowly than in the past, a hint that competitive pressures aren\u2019t forcing companies to react as quickly to new innovations.\u201cIf we\u2019re in an era of excessive profits, in competitive markets we would see record firm entry, but we see the opposite,\u201d said Ian Hathaway, an economist who has studied the issue. That, Mr. Hathaway said, suggests that the market is not truly competitive \u2014 that existing companies have found ways to block competitors.Experts also point to anecdotal examples that suggest that the rise of big businesses could be squelching competition. YouTube, Instagram and hundreds of lower-profile start-ups chose to sell out to industry heavyweights like Google and Facebook rather than try to take them on directly. The tech giants have likewise been accused of using the power of their platforms to favor their own offerings over those of competitors.\u201cWe\u2019re saying that it\u2019s O.K. that they shape how a city charges taxes?\u201d Mr. Morelix said. \u201cAnd what kind of regulations they have? That should be terrifying to anyone that wants a free market.\u201d\u201cEverybody loves entrepreneurship, but they\u2019re not aware it\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Mr. Dearie said. \u201cIf new businesses are the engine of net new job creation, and if new businesses are the engine of innovation, and new business creation is at 30-year lows, that\u2019s a national emergency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And now, out of nowhere, he\u2019s Uber\u2019s new C.E.O. \u2014 and so far, he\u2019s been getting wide praise from many analysts. (Khosrowshahi is also on the board of The New York Times Company.)To me, Uber\u2019s board sounds as dysfunctional as a brunch between the Lannisters and the Starks on Game of Thrones, but isn\u2019t it kind of interesting that the process yielded a pick who seems pretty reasonable?I was surprised by the move; it\u2019s a rare moment of cooperation among tech behemoths. One thing I wondered is if it presaged some larger cooperation between the two, on matters even beyond voice assistants. What do you think?And if they can prove this works through Whole Foods, what\u2019s to stop Amazon from selling the entire system to other retailers, the way they do with cloud computing services?Well, thanks for joining me.

But is there anything you can do to prepare?That is not a philosophical question, or a theological one. And if it is a question that seems to beg any explication, you may stop reading now.But if you are among the swelling class of weekend paranoiacs of affluent means who are starting to mull fantasies of urban escape following the endless headlines about disasters, both natural and manufactured, you may be starting to see a different image in your mind when think \u201csurvivalist.\u201d You may no longer see the wild-eyed cave dweller in camouflage fatigues, hoarding canned goods. You may even see one in the mirror.These suddenly chic survival satchels, also known as go bags, are typically lightweight military-grade backpacks stocked with provisions for at least 72 hours. Ready-made bug-out bags containing staples like water purification tablets, a 20-hour body warmer and a multifunction shovel are available on Amazon for under $200.Unlike gold, which is hovering around $1,300 an ounce, these old silver coins come in small enough denominations to barter for a loaf of bread or a socket wrench in an economic \u201cMad Max\u201d scenario. Even so, some survivalists remain silver skeptics. \u201cFor $100, let\u2019s say you get five silver coins,\u201d said an urban preparedness expert who goes by the nom de guerre Selco. \u201cWhy not buy 100 cans of soup?\u201dImagine a true economic apocalypse, one that makes the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, with its wheelbarrows of near-worthless paper currency, look like a hiccup. To prepare for the worst worst-case scenario, some doomers prefer daily staples like tampons, vegetable seeds and cigarettes (that timeless prison medium of exchange) to silver or gold as an alt-currency.\u201cIf we look at examples of systematic social breakdowns, like Argentina in 2001, or the war in the Balkans, goods that people understood on an intrinsic level clearly carried the most value when trading \u2014 cans of food, gas, batteries, cheap Bic lighters,\u201d he said. \u201cA good rule of thumb: If you\u2019d find it useful in an emergency, you\u2019ll be able to find someone who will trade for it in an emergency.\u201dWhen President Trump issued his threat to North Korea at the United Nations, many preppers had an almost Pavlovian response: to check their nuclear survival kit. Ever since the backyard bomb shelter went the way of tail fins, survival in the face of mushroom clouds has seemed highly relative.Or people may just want to stock up on Snuggies, chocolate Easter bunnies, Hummel figurines or vintage Backstreet Boys paraphernalia, which will do about as much good in the event of a direct strike.Manhattanites face challenges unknown to their Western counterparts hunkering in remote desert bunkers. Their home turf, after all, is not only a prime target, but an island. In the event of a cataclysmic emergency, bridges and tunnels may be closed, or choked off by marauding mobs, forcing survivors to consider waterborne escape.Sure, there is the cost \u2014 about $250,000, which the company is hoping to bring down \u201cto the price of a luxury car.\u201d For now, just think of it as the survivalists\u2019 Maybach.The dome houses are so rugged, according the company\u2019s founder, Don Kubley, \u201cyou could buy one today and your grandkids will be playing in it.\u201d One can only hope.Should disaster not strike? They make a great man cave or backyard cabana.In normal times, this international historical-re-enactment organization seems like little more than a harmless bunch of Renaissance Faire types playing dress up on weekends and celebrating the arts, skills and costumes of pre-17th-century Europe.But should Armageddon arrive \u2014 say, in the form of a limited nuclear exchange, global pandemic or cyber mega-attack \u2014 these hobbies could mean your survival. In other words, chivalry may not be dead after all.There is bugging out, and then there is really bugging out. In a scorched-earth scenario where even a jet pack is not enough to escape harm\u2019s way, preppers with deep pockets and a taste for Arthur C. Clarke might consider the ultimate escape: launching their DNA into space.Who knows \u2014 some ultra-intelligent alien being may discover it in the future, and use your genetic code to reanimate a race of humans on a distant planet.

{"Headline": "A Different Brand of Leading Man", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019ve drifted away from that kind of stardom, which has tended to rely on a balance of the opaque and the transparent, the average and a cut above. It also requires roles that situate that balance on some kind of continuum. Are you seeing the development of an enduring screen self? Is the leading man doing more new characters than prefab franchise work? Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with prefab franchise work, depending on who\u2019s doing it.Maybe this thinking is as old as \u201cleading man\u201d itself. But for anybody clinging to the old definition, Tom Cruise appears eager to cling with you. Not too long ago, I walked into Times Square, looked up \u2014 way up \u2014 and saw him on one of those wraparound billboards. He was looking very Tom \u2014 the mussed, inexplicably dark hair; the sunglasses; the mouth open somewhere between smile and smirk. There\u2019s a plane doing something to his right and maybe somebody with a gun. I don\u2019t know, because all you\u2019re supposed to see is Tom Cruise, a man, leading.Mr. Gyllenhaal works a lot. And he works hard. You\u2019re happy to see him because what you\u2019re seeing is a commitment to several different ways of being an actor \u2014 sometimes in the same performance. He\u2019s too restless to remain a leading man for long, and he seems too embarrassed by stardom to do much flirting with it. \u201cOkja\u201d also happens to have an out-there part for Tilda Swinton (two, in fact!). Gonzo comes naturally to her. Mr. Gyllenhaal\u2019s lunatics tend to seem like they\u2019re doing research on lunacy, like the psychotic cameraman he played in the 2014 \u201cNightcrawler.\u201dThis kind of role \u2014 one of those triumphs of the human spirit \u2014 makes it hard to see the tribute for the stunt. Vanity is the risk. But prizes are a reward. The reason, of course, never to give up on Mr. Gyllenhaal is the reason not to abandon Mr. Cruise: You never know. They do manage to surprise you. The hard work can work on you.But a movie like \u201cStronger\u201d \u2014 regardless of its merits \u2014 makes me feel a little bad for the Jake Gyllenhaals of the world. There are a lot of us in the audience, at the studios and in the academy who suspect that the best acting involves the most suffering.Where does that leave acting that involves none? Where does that leave, say, Chris Hemsworth, the Australian who for years has been playing the Norse god Thor as a Shakespearean Brit? The part has never looked like heavy lifting for him. But it\u2019s taken a handful of tries, in his own franchise and as part of an overloaded ensemble in \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d to figure out how to have some fun with it. He started off doing bad fish-out-water stuff. It was the kind of \u201cI\u2019m a thespian\u201d acting you might try if Anthony Hopkins were playing your immortal father.Gradually, though, Mr. Hemsworth was allowed to cut down on the piety and self-seriousness so that, maybe, by the time \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d opens in November, what\u2019s left is a leading-man foundation that takes him from subpar Laurence Olivier to peak Charlton Heston or Mel Gibson. The comic book movie isn\u2019t where you\u2019d think to go for updates on the health of the leading man. But that\u2019s where the men are winding up: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Ben Affleck, Will Smith, Ryan Reynolds, Benedict Cumberbatch and so on.News like that \u2014 that men are now only leading in comic-book franchises \u2014 might be part of what\u2019s driving some major actors to streaming. But unlike most of those other actors, who\u2019ve brought their stardom to bear on masks and capes and facial scarring, Mr. Hemsworth is more a star as Thor than he is playing anybody else. And yet if you\u2019re having a good time watching his Thor, it\u2019s probably because he\u2019s having a good time playing superheroism for laughs. It\u2019s prefab-franchise work whose continuum belongs more to the Marvel Universe than to Hollywood. Mr. Hemsworth, though, appears to be coming to life in this one part, doing work that\u2019s harder to discern and applaud. His is a current model of movie stardom that\u2019s diminished but not without common sense, too. Why buy into your own leading-man persona when you can just rent Thor\u2019s?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Last Stand of the Amazon\u2019s Arrow People", "Date": "2017-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe history of Brazil\u2019s Amazon region, as elsewhere in the Americas, abounds with tales of mass death and brutality perpetrated against its native inhabitants. Entire tribes disappeared, many without a trace. Few of these atrocities figured in official accounts; rarely was anyone brought to justice.But 30 years ago, Brazil took an extraordinary step toward halting the march of this dismal history. It recognized the right of its indigenous people to pursue their traditional ways of life, including remaining apart from modern society. It also recognized that they require intact, pristine forests and rivers to survive as they have since before the arrival of Europeans.To that end, the government created a special unit inside Funai, its indigenous affairs agency. The unit was charged with protecting those untrammeled lands and ensuring the viability of the indigenous communities living within them. Field agents who previously sought to woo uncontacted tribes from the bush were assigned a new role: to identify the forests where such tribes live and staff outposts to block intrusions that could threaten the well-being of the native populations. The rights of these tribes \u2014 and the government\u2019s duty to safeguard them \u2014 were enshrined in statutes, international agreements and the country\u2019s 1988 Constitution, which remains the law of the land, at least on paper.But Brazil is rapidly backpedaling on these commitments. Severe budget cuts to Funai and the forced retirement of its most seasoned backwoods officials have caused the withdrawal of personnel and the closing of nearly one-third of the control posts that guard access to the territories of isolated tribes across the Amazon.I am one of few outsiders to see the flecheiros, albeit fleetingly. I trekked through their land on a 10-week expedition through the far reaches of the Javari Valley with Funai in 2002. Officials and indigenous scouts were on a mission to protect the flecheiros, collecting information from their abandoned campsites and monitoring possible threats to their territory, while seeking to avoid direct contact with them.Many of these isolated groups splintered off from larger, now-settled communities, and their cultures are familiar to anthropologists and other experts. But the flecheiros have remained so isolated that we do not know what their ethnicity is, what language they speak or what they call themselves.We do know that they are deft archers who have retreated into one of the Amazon\u2019s most inaccessible redoubts, from which they shun all contact with the outside world. This latest incident goes a long way toward explaining their choice.It\u2019s also the clearest signal yet that Brazil\u2019s failure to uphold its constitutional obligations carries with it lethal consequences. The Javari Valley indigenous land has been a secure bastion for the flecheiros and 15 other isolated tribal groups by dint of its rugged topography and the policies put in place to protect them. Until now.The government outpost on the Jandiatuba River, where the massacre is reported to have occurred, was shut down in 2014 because of budget cuts. Since then, alluvial gold dredges, largely manned by itinerant desperados, have penetrated deep upriver. Some of the prospectors also venture out to hunt bushmeat, and it was such a hunting party that came upon the flecheiros. The miners\u2019 reaction apparently was swift and definitive.Had the checkpoint on the Jandiatuba River remained in operation, it\u2019s likely this terrible encounter could have been avoided. There would be no gold dredges ransacking the Jandiatuba, one of the principal watersheds that sustain the flecheiros, nor hunters stalking game deep in their forests.As we hiked through the primal homeland of the flecheiros 15 years ago, we found ample evidence that Brazil\u2019s policies were working as intended: towering trees dripping with lianas, crystal-clear streams teeming with fish, an astonishing abundance of birds and wild animals, as well as a profound sense of security the flecheiros must have been enjoying.This strategy was the idea of Sydney Possuelo, then a high-ranking Funai official and veteran of dozens of similar treks through the Brazilian jungles. It was Mr. Possuelo, in league with a number of his colleagues, who steered Brazil toward a policy that stands at the confluence of human rights and environmental preservation. \u201cIn protecting the Indians,\u201d Mr. Possuelo told me as he led our expedition by map and compass, \u201cyou\u2019re also protecting vast areas of biodiversity.\u201d These policies have made Brazil a shining example for other countries with isolated tribal societies.Now Brazil stands at a crossroads. It can continue its slow strangulation of Funai, or it can enforce its own laws and reclaim its stature as guardian of its rich cultural and biological diversity.It would be the world\u2019s shame \u2014 and Brazil\u2019s in particular \u2014 to stand by and watch, or pretend not to see, as the forces of short-term gain wipe the last human vestiges of pre-European America off the face of the earth.Scott Wallace is an associate professor of journalism at the University of Connecticut and the author of \u201cThe Unconquered: In Search of the Amazon\u2019s Last Uncontacted Tribes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To measure this flow he stuck his hand in a plastic container with exposed metallic tape on the inside and outside connected to a wire. The same electricity that flowed through his arm would also flow through the wire \u2014 and that he could measure.When the eel leapt to his arm, he withdrew it immediately, comparing it to how you respond if you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove or touch an electric fence.\u201cI was surprised that it caused my arm to involuntarily come out of the water,\u201d Dr. Catania said. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s an animal out there that can remotely control your nervous system, I think is a pretty amazing thing.\u201dDr. Catania experienced about 10 shocks like this during the experiment, but with the data he obtained, he was able to use his numbers to extrapolate what kind of shocks eels of any size could deliver. A large eel, he said could paralyze you, causing you to fall down and potentially drown.\u201cThe total amount of energy would be considerably higher than a law enforcement Taser,\u201d he said.Through his work, Dr. Catania didn\u2019t experience the same pain as the horses or the man in the video, and he wasn\u2019t paralyzed. But he made sure to note that \u201cit efficiently activated my pain receptors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Big Business Got Brazil Hooked on Junk Food", "Date": "2017-09-16", "News": "FORTALEZA, Brazil \u2014 Children\u2019s squeals rang through the muggy morning air as a woman pushed a gleaming white cart along pitted, trash-strewn streets. She was making deliveries to some of the poorest households in this seaside city, bringing pudding, cookies and other packaged foods to the customers on her sales route.As she dropped off variety packs of Chandelle pudding, Kit-Kats and Mucilon infant cereal, there was something striking about her customers: Many were visibly overweight, even small children.She gestured to a home along her route and shook her head, recalling how its patriarch, a morbidly obese man, died the previous week. \u201cHe ate a piece of cake and died in his sleep,\u201d she said.Mrs. da Silva, who herself weighs more than 200 pounds, recently discovered that she had high blood pressure, a condition she acknowledges is probably tied to her weakness for fried chicken and the Coca-Cola she drinks with every meal, breakfast included.A New York Times examination of corporate records, epidemiological studies and government reports \u2014 as well as interviews with scores of nutritionists and health experts around the world \u2014 reveals a sea change in the way food is produced, distributed and advertised across much of the globe. The shift, many public health experts say, is contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago.The new reality is captured by a single, stark fact: Across the world, more people are now obese than underweight. At the same time, scientists say, the growing availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods is generating a new type of malnutrition, one in which a growing number of people are both overweight and undernourished.\u201cThe prevailing story is that this is the best of all possible worlds \u2014 cheap food, widely available. If you don\u2019t think about it too hard, it makes sense,\u201d said Anthony Winson, who studies the political economics of nutrition at the University of Guelph in Ontario. A closer look, however, reveals a much different story, he said. \u201cTo put it in stark terms: The diet is killing us.\u201dEven critics of processed food acknowledge that there are multiple factors in the rise of obesity, including genetics, urbanization, growing incomes and more sedentary lives. Nestl\u00e9 executives say their products have helped alleviate hunger, provided crucial nutrients, and that the company has squeezed salt, fat and sugar from thousands of items to make them healthier. But Sean Westcott, head of food research and development at Nestl\u00e9, conceded obesity has been an unexpected side effect of making inexpensive processed food more widely available.\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect what the impact would be,\u201d he said.Part of the problem, he added, is a natural tendency for people to overeat as they can afford more food. Nestl\u00e9, he said, strives to educate consumers about proper portion size and to make and market foods that balance \u201cpleasure and nutrition.\u201dObesity rates in the United States, the South Pacific and the Persian Gulf are among the highest in the world \u2014 more than one in four Americans is obese. But over the last 35 years, obesity, defined as having a body mass index over 30, has grown the fastest in countries throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia.By Audrey Carlsen | Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Data not available for French Guiana and Western Sahara.In places as distant as China, South Africa and Colombia, the rising clout of big food companies also translates into political influence, stymieing public health officials seeking soda taxes or legislation aimed at curbing the health impacts of processed food.The same trends are mirrored with fast food, which grew 30 percent worldwide from 2011 to 2016, compared with 21 percent in the United States, according to Euromonitor. Take, for example, Domino\u2019s Pizza, which in 2016 added 1,281 stores \u2014 one \u201cevery seven hours,\u201d noted its annual report \u2014 all but 171 of them overseas.\u201cAt a time when some of the growth is more subdued in established economies, I think that strong emerging-market posture is going to be a winning position,\u201d Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, recently told investors. Developing markets now provide the company with 42 percent of its sales.For some companies, that can mean specifically focusing on young people, as Ahmet Bozer, president of Coca-Cola International, described to investors in 2014. \u201cHalf the world\u2019s population has not had a Coke in the last 30 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s 600 million teenagers who have not had a Coke in the last week. So the opportunity for that is huge.\u201dIndustry defenders say that processed foods are essential to feed a growing, urbanizing world of people, many of them with rising incomes, demanding convenience.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of all factories and go back to growing all grain. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s not going to work,\u201d said Mike Gibney, a professor emeritus of food and health at University College Dublin and a consultant to Nestl\u00e9. \u201cIf I ask 100 Brazilian families to stop eating processed food, I have to ask myself: What will they eat? Who will feed them? How much will it cost?\u201dIn many ways, Brazil is a microcosm of how growing incomes and government policies have led to longer, better lives and largely eradicated hunger. But now the country faces a stark new nutrition challenge: over the last decade, the country\u2019s obesity rate has nearly doubled to 20 percent, and the portion of people who are overweight has nearly tripled to 58 percent. Each year, 300,000 people are diagnosed with Type II diabetes, a condition with strong links to obesity.Brazil also highlights the food industry\u2019s political prowess. In 2010, a coalition of Brazilian food and beverage companies torpedoed a raft of measures that sought to limit junk food ads aimed at children. The latest challenge has come from the country\u2019s president, Michel Temer, a business-friendly centrist whose conservative allies in Congress are now seeking to chip away at the handful of regulations and laws intended to encourage healthy eating.\u201cWhat we have is a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food once produced by the farmers around you and the producers of ultra-processed food designed to be over-consumed and which in some cases are addictive,\u201d said Carlos A. Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cIt\u2019s a war,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one food system has disproportionately more power than the other.\u201dMrs. da Silva reaches customers in Fortaleza\u2019s slums, many of whom don\u2019t have ready access to a supermarket. She champions the product she sells, exulting in the nutritional claims on the labels that boast of added vitamins and minerals.\u201cEveryone here knows that Nestl\u00e9 products are good for you,\u201d she said, gesturing to cans of Mucilon, the infant cereal whose label says it is \u201cpacked with calcium and niacin,\u201d but also Nescau 2.0, a sugar-laden chocolate powder.She became a Nestl\u00e9 vendor two years ago, when her family of five was struggling to get by. Though her husband is still unemployed, things are looking up. With the $185 a month she earns selling Nestl\u00e9 products, she was able to buy a new refrigerator, a television and a gas stove for the family\u2019s three-room home at the edge of a fetid tidal marsh.He said sagging incomes among poor and working-class Brazilians had actually been a boon for direct sales. That\u2019s because unlike most food retailers, Nestl\u00e9 gives customers a full month to pay for their purchases. It also helps that saleswomen \u2014 the program employs only women \u2014 know when their customers receive Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, a monthly government subsidy for low-income households.\u201cThe essence of our program is to reach the poor,\u201d Mr. Barbosa said. \u201cWhat makes it work is the personal connection between the vendor and the customer.\u201dNestl\u00e9 increasingly also portrays itself as a leader in its commitment to community and health. Two decades ago, it anointed itself a \u201cnutrition health and wellness company.\u201d Over the years, the company says it has reformulated nearly 9,000 products to reduce salt, sugar and fat, and it has delivered billions of servings fortified with vitamins and minerals. It emphasizes food safety and the reduction of food waste, and it works with nearly 400,000 farmers around the world to promote sustainable farming.In an interview at Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new $50 million campus in suburban Cleveland, Mr. Westcott, head of food research and development, said the door-to-door sales program reflected another of the company\u2019s slogans: \u201cCreating shared values.\u201d\u201cWe create shared value by creating micro-entrepreneurs \u2014 people that can build their own businesses,\u201d he said. A company like Nestl\u00e9 can bolster the well-being of entire communities \u201cby actually sending positive messages around nutrition,\u201d he said.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s portfolio of foods is vast and different from that of some snack companies, which make little effort to focus on healthy offerings. They include Nesfit, a whole-grain cereal; low-fat yogurts like Molico that contain a relatively modest amount of sugar (six grams); and a range of infant cereals, served with milk or water, that are fortified with vitamins, iron and probiotics.Dr. Gibney, the nutritionist and Nestl\u00e9 consultant, said the company deserved credit for reformulating healthier products.But of the 800 products that Nestl\u00e9 says are available through its vendors, Mrs. da Silva says her customers are mostly interested in only about two dozen of them, virtually all sugar-sweetened items like Kit-Kats; Nestl\u00e9 Greek Red Berry, a 3.5-ounce cup of yogurt with 17 grams of sugar; and Chandelle Pacoca, a peanut-flavored pudding in a container the same size as the yogurt that has 20 grams of sugar \u2014 nearly the entire World Health Organization\u2019s recommended daily limit.Dr. Popkin finds the door-to-door marketing emblematic of an insidious new era in which companies seek to reach every doorstep in an effort to grow and become central to communities in the developing world. \u201cThey\u2019re not leaving an inch of country left aside,\u201d he said.On the streets of Fortaleza, where Nestl\u00e9 is admired for its Swiss pedigree and perceived high quality, negative sentiments about the company are rarely heard.The home of Joana D\u2019arc de Vasconcellos, 53, another vendor, is filled with Nestl\u00e9-branded stuffed animals and embossed certificates she earned at nutrition classes sponsored by Nestl\u00e9. In her living room, pride of place is given to framed photographs of her children at age 2, each posed before a pyramid of empty Nestl\u00e9 infant formula cans. As her son and daughter grew up, she switched to other Nestl\u00e9 products for children: Nido Kinder, a toddler milk powder; Chocapic, a chocolate-flavored cereal; and the chocolate milk powder Nescau.\u201cWhen he was a baby, my son didn\u2019t like to eat \u2014 until I started giving him Nestl\u00e9 foods,\u201d she said proudly.Ms. de Vasconcellos has diabetes and high blood pressure. Her 17-year-old daughter, who weighs more than 250 pounds, has hypertension and polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder strongly linked to obesity. Many other relatives have one or more ailments often associated with poor diets: her mother and two sisters (diabetes and hypertension), and her husband (hypertension.) Her father died three years ago after losing his feet to gangrene, a complication of diabetes.\u201cEvery time I go to the public health clinic, the line for diabetics is out the door,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a family here that doesn\u2019t have it.\u201dMs. de Vasconcellos previously tried selling Tupperware and Avon products door to door, but many customers failed to pay. Six years ago, after a friend told her about Nestl\u00e9\u2019s direct sales program, Ms. Vasconcellos jumped at the chance.She says her customers have never failed to pay her.\u201cPeople have to eat,\u201d she said.In May 2000, Denise Coitinho, then director of nutrition for the Ministry of Health, was at a Mother\u2019s Day party at her children\u2019s school when her mobile phone rang. It was Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief of government relations. \u201cHe was really upset,\u201d she recalled.The source of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s concern was a new policy that Brazil had adopted and was pushing at the World Health Organization. If adopted, the policy would have recommended that children around the world breast-feed for six months, rather than the previous recommendation of four to six months, she said.It is hard to overstate the economic power and political access enjoyed by food and beverage conglomerates in Brazil, which are responsible for 10 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output and employ 1.6 million people.In 2014, food companies donated $158 million to members of Brazil\u2019s National Congress, a threefold increase over 2010, according to Transpar\u00eancia Brasil. A study the organization released last year found that more than half of Brazil\u2019s current federal legislators had been elected with donations from the food industry \u2013 before the Supreme Court banned corporate contributions in 2015.The single largest donor to congressional candidates was the Brazilian meat giant JBS, which gave candidates $112 million in 2014; Coca-Cola gave $6.5 million in campaign contributions that year, and McDonald\u2019s donated $561,000.So the stage was set for a mammoth political battle when, in 2006, the government sought to enact far-reaching food-industry regulations to curb obesity and disease. The measures, growing out of the earlier breast-feeding policy, included advertising alerts to warn consumers about foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats, as well as marketing restrictions to dampen the lure of highly processed foods and sugary beverages, especially those aimed at children.Taking a page from the government\u2019s successful efforts to limit tobacco marketing, the new rules would have barred brands like Pepsi and KFC from sponsoring sports and cultural events.\u201cWe thought that Brazil could be a model for the rest of the world, a country that puts the well-being of its citizens above all else,\u201d said Dirceu Raposo de Mello, then director of the government\u2019s health surveillance agency, widely known by the Portuguese acronym Anvisa. \u201cUnfortunately, the food industry did not feel the same way.\u201dThe food companies took a low profile, mustering behind the Brazilian Association of Food Industries, a lobbying group whose board of vice presidents included executives from Nestl\u00e9; the American meat giant Cargill; and Unilever, the European food conglomerate that owns brands like Hellmann\u2019s, Mazola oil and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. The association declined to comment for this article.During the early days of public hearings, the industry seemed to be negotiating the rules in good faith but behind the scenes, health advocates say corporate lawyers and lobbyists were quietly waging a multipronged campaign to derail the process.Industry-financed academics began appearing on TV to assail the rules as economically ruinous. Other experts wrote newspaper editorial pieces suggesting that exercise and stricter parenting might be more effective than regulations aimed at fighting childhood obesity.The industry\u2019s most potent rallying cry, analysts say, was its strident denunciation of the proposed advertising restrictions as censorship. The accusation had particular resonance given the nearly two decades of military dictatorship that ended in 1985.At one meeting, a representative from the food industry accused Anvisa of trying to subvert parental authority, saying mothers had the right to decide what to feed their children, recalled Vanessa Schottz, a nutrition advocate. In another meeting, she said, a toy industry representative stood up and assailed the proposed marketing rules, saying they would deprive Brazilian children of the toys that sometimes accompany fast-food meals. \u201cHe said we were killing the dreams of children,\u201d Ms. Schottz recalled. \u201cWe were dumbfounded.\u201dChastened by the industry criticism, Anvisa in late 2010 withdrew most of the proposed restrictions. What remained was a single proposal requiring that ads include a warning about unhealthy food and beverages.Then came the lawsuits.Over the course of several months, a disparate collection of industry groups filed 11 lawsuits against Anvisa. The plaintiffs included the national association of biscuit manufacturers, the corn growers lobby and an alliance of chocolate, cocoa and candy companies. Some of the lawsuits claimed that the regulations violated constitutional protections on free speech, while others said the agency did not have the standing to regulate the food and advertising industries.Mr. Raposo de Mello, the former Anvisa president, says he was stunned by Mr. Adam\u2019s change of heart, given the attorney general office\u2019s longstanding support for Anvisa. Seven years later, with most of the 11 lawsuits still unresolved, the regulations remain frozen.\u201cThe industry,\u201d Mr. Raposo de Mello said, \u201cdid an end run around the system.\u201dIn the meantime, the food and beverage industry became more aggressive as it sought to neutralize Anvisa, which it viewed as its greatest adversary.In 2010, in the midst of the battle against the agency\u2019s proposed regulations, a group of 156 business executives took its grievances to the campaign of Dilma Rousseff, who was running for president.Marcello Fragano Baird, a political scientist in S\u00e3o Paulo who has studied the food lobby\u2019s campaign against the nutrition regulations, said Ms. Rousseff assured the executives she would shake up Anvisa. \u201cShe promised them she would \u2018clean house\u2019 once elected,\u201d he said, adding that he learned about the encounter through interviews with participants.Ms. Rouseff won, and soon after her inauguration, she replaced Mr. Raposo de Mello with Jaime C\u00e9sar de Moura Oliveira, a longtime political ally and a former lawyer for the Brazilian subsidiary of the food giant Unilever.A spokesman for Ms. Rouseff declined to make her available for an interview.In 2012, Anvisa hosted a traveling anti-obesity exhibit at its offices. Titled \u201cLose Weight Brazil,\u201d the exhibit extolled exercise and moderation as the keys to tackling obesity, but largely ignored mainstream scientific evidence about the dangers of consuming too much sugar, soda and processed food.The exhibition\u2019s sponsor? Coca-Cola.More than 1,000 miles south of Fortaleza, the effects of changing eating habits are evident at a brightly painted day care center in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city. Each day, more than a hundred children pack classrooms, singing the alphabet, playing and taking group naps.When it was started in the early 1990s, the program, run by a Brazilian nonprofit group, had a straightforward mission: to alleviate undernutrition among children who were not getting enough to eat in the city\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods.These days many of those who attend are noticeably pudgy and, the staff nutritionists note, some are worryingly short for their age, the result of diets heavy in salt, fat and sugar but lacking in the nourishment needed for healthy development.\u201cWe are even getting babies, which is something we never saw before,\u201d said Giuliano Giovanetti, who does outreach and communications for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis for our society because we are producing a generation of children with impaired cognitive abilities who will not reach their full potential.\u201dNearly 9 percent of Brazilian children were obese in 2015, more than a 270 percent increase since 1980, according to a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. That puts it in striking distance of the United States, where 12.7 percent of children were obese in 2015.The figures are even more alarming in the communities served by the center: In some neighborhoods, 30 percent of the children are obese and another 30 percent malnourished, according to the organization\u2019s own data, which found that 6 percent of obese children were also malnourished.The rising obesity rates are largely associated with improved economics, as families with increasing incomes embrace the convenience, status and flavors offered by packaged foods.Busy parents ply their toddlers with instant noodles and frozen chicken nuggets, meals that are often accompanied by soda. Rice, beans, salad and grilled meats \u2014 building blocks of the traditional Brazilian diet \u2014 are falling by the wayside, studies have found.Compounding the problem is the rampant street violence that keeps young children cooped up indoors.\u201cIt\u2019s just too dangerous to let my kids play outside, so they spend all their free time sitting on the couch playing video games and watching TV,\u201d said Elaine Pereira dos Santos, 35, the mother of two children, 9 and 4 years old, both overweight.Isaac, the 9-year-old, weighs 138 pounds and can wear only clothing intended for adolescents. Ms. dos Santos, who works at a hospital pharmacy, shortens the pants legs for him.Like many Brazilian mothers, she was pleased when Isaac began to gain weight as a toddler, not long after he tasted his first McDonald\u2019s French fry. \u201cI always thought fatter is better when it comes to babies,\u201d she said. She happily indulged his eating habits, which included frequent trips to fast-food outlets and almost no fruits and vegetables.But when he began having trouble running and complained about achy knees, Ms. dos Santos knew something was wrong. \u201cThe hardest part is the ridicule he gets from other children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we go out shopping, even adults point and stare\u201d or call him gordinho, roughly translated to \u201clittle fatty.\u201dAt the S\u00e3o Paulo nursery, health care workers keep tabs on the children\u2019s physical and cognitive development, while nutritionists teach parents how to prepare inexpensive, healthy meals. For some children, the center\u2019s test kitchen provides their first introduction to cabbage, plums and mangos.One of the fundamental challenges is persuading parents that their children are sick. \u201cUnlike cancer or other illnesses, this is a disability you can\u2019t see,\u201d said Juliana Dellare Calia, 42, a nutritionist with the organization.Although staff members say the program has made significant strides in changing the way families eat, many children will nonetheless face a lifelong battle with obesity. That\u2019s because a growing body of research suggests that childhood malnutrition can lead to permanent metabolic changes, reprogramming the body so that it more readily turns excess calories into body fat.\u201cIt\u2019s the body\u2019s response to what\u2019s perceived as starvation,\u201d Ms. Dellare Calia said.Near the bottom of the food chain is Mrs. da Silva, the vendor in Fortaleza, who feels optimistic about the future despite her mounting health woes. Life has been a struggle since she dropped out of school at 14 when she became pregnant with her first child. Now she talks about fixing the missing teeth that mar her tentative smile and buying a proper home, one that does not leak during heavy rains.She has Nestl\u00e9 to thank.\u201cFor the first time in my life, I feel a sense of hope and independence,\u201d she said.She is aware of the connection between her diet and her persistent health problems, but insists that her children are well nourished, gesturing to the Nestl\u00e9 products in her living room. Being a Nestl\u00e9 vendor has another advantage: the cookies, chocolate and puddings that often sustain her family are bought wholesale.With an expanding roster of customers, Mrs. da Silva has set her sights on a new goal, one she says will increase business even more.\u201cI want to buy a bigger refrigerator.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from Fortaleza and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

In concept, the Arrow was the most advanced airplane of its time. Had it been fully developed, many people told me, Canada would have become a major force in aviation. (Several Canadian companies, notably Bombardier and CAE, nevertheless grew into major international aerospace players.)But almost everyone I met also mentioned the government\u2019s campaign to seemingly wipe away all traces of the Arrow. The six complete planes and the partially built ones on the assembly line were cut into pieces and many of their blueprints were destroyed, as was the manufacturing machinery.The effort to erase the Arrow is usually attributed to John Diefenbaker, the volatile prime minister who canceled the program.Through military and government documents, he found that the complete planes were offered to aviation research organizations in Canada, the United States and Britain. All of them said, no, thanks, apparently because of the cost of keeping a small fleet of orphaned planes flying.The destruction that followed, Mr. Isinger found, was not \u201cnot out of Diefenbaker\u2019s vindictiveness\u201d but was \u201csimply due to bureaucratic standard operating procedure.\u201dApple on Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by unveiling three new phones (four if you count the Apple Watch that can make calls). By coincidence that same day, I came across a folder with material from when I interviewed Steve Jobs shortly before the first Macintosh computer was unveiled in 1984. (At the time, I worked for Maclean\u2019s magazine.)Apple product launches were certainly less slick back then. The key handout for the Mac was a four-page, black-and-white photocopy with crude graphics made with the new Mac.But a spokeswoman sitting in during the interview on Jan. 12, 1984, would have nothing to do with that sentiment, interrupting Mr. Jobs to say: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be \u2018insanely great\u2019.\u201dNever modest, Mr. Jobs said that the Mac was as great an advance over other computers as the telephone was over the telegraph.Growing increasingly excited (according to my musty transcript), Mr. Jobs predicted that the Mac would give Apple sales of $10 billion by the end of the decade. That didn\u2019t pan out. In 1990 its sales were $5.5 billion. The company, of course, eventually far outstripped Mr. Jobs\u2019s dreams and reported sales last year of $215.6 billion.Keeping Apple from that fate, he suggested, required him to be a demanding boss.\u201cI really want to set an expectation of nothing short of great, and there are some people that are interested in doing adequate stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people and I don\u2019t get along very well.\u201dAbout a year later Mr. Jobs was ousted from Apple, and he didn\u2019t return until 1997.Many people at The Times, including me, tell you what\u2019s happening in the world.

How? Tell us in the comments._________BackgroundBorn with several genetic abnormalities, 10-year-old August Pullman, called Auggie, dreams of being \u201cordinary.\u201d Inside, he knows he\u2019s like every other kid, but even after 27 surgeries, the central character of \u201cWonder\u201d bears facial disfigurations so pronounced that people who see him for the first time do \u201cthat look-away thing\u201d \u2014 if they manage to hide their shock and horror.\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s probably worse,\u201d he says of his face as the book begins. He\u2019s used to the stares and mean comments, but he\u2019s still terrified to learn that his parents have gotten him into middle school at Beecher Prep and want him to go there rather than be home-schooled. But they persuade him to give it a try \u2014 and by the time this rich and memorable first novel by R. J. Palacio is over, it\u2019s not just Auggie but everyone around him who has changed.The book, originally marketed as a middle-grade novel, went on to draw the attention of teenage and adult readers as well. \u201cWonder\u201d reminds us that disability is not only about distress. It is about the triumphs, the resilience and the many gifts of love that make life work, no matter our experiences. As Ms. Russo observes in her review, \u201cPerhaps Palacio\u2019s most remarkable trick is leaving us with the impression that Auggie\u2019s problems are surmountable in all the ways that count \u2014 that he is, in fact, in an enviable position.\u201dBut nothing changes a disabled person\u2019s sense of self like another disabled person. I am a painter, and in 1995, I was invited to join a group of artists, writers and performers who were building disability culture. Their work was daring, edgy, funny and dark; it rejected old tropes that defined us as pathetic, frightening and worthless. They insisted that disability was an opportunity for creativity and resistance._________Key Questions\u2022 What assumptions do we make about people who have disabilities?\u2022 To what extent is our personal happiness determined by internal rather than external factors?_________Activity Sheets_________Does August see how other people see him, or has he gotten so good at pretending not to see that it doesn\u2019t bother him? Or does it bother him? When he looks in the mirror, does he see the Auggie Mom and Dad see, or does he see the Auggie everyone else sees? Or is there another August he sees, someone in his dreams behind the misshapen head and face? Sometimes when I looked at Grans, I could see the pretty girl she used to be underneath the wrinkles. I could see the girl from Ipanema inside the old-lady walk. Does August see himself as he might have looked without that single gene that caused the catastrophe of his face?I wish I could ask him this stuff. I wish he would tell me how he feels. He used to be easier to read before the surgeries. You knew that when his eyes squinted, he was happy. When his mouth went straight, he was being mischievous. When his cheeks trembled, he was about to cry. He looks better now, no doubt about that, but the signs we used to gauge his moods are all gone. There are new ones, or course. Mom and Dad can read every single one. But I\u2019m having trouble keeping up. And there\u2019s part of me that doesn\u2019t want to keep trying: why can\u2019t he just say what he\u2019s feeling like everyone else? He doesn\u2019t have a trache tube in his mouth anymore that keeps him from talking. His jaw\u2019s not wired shut. He\u2019s ten years old. He can use his words. But we circle around him like he\u2019s still the baby he used to be. We change plans, go to plan B, interrupt conversations, go back on promises depending on his moods, his whims, his needs. But he needs to grow up now. We need to let him, help him, make him grow up. Here\u2019s what I think: we\u2019ve all spent so much time trying to make August think he\u2019s normal that he actually thinks he\u2019s normal. And the problem is, he\u2019s not._________I was inspired to take matters into my own hands and write a book of my own, starring a girl with a disability. I knew exactly what genre of book I wanted to write. I\u2019ve never been a fan of \u201cgreat children\u2019s literature\u201d that was somber or tragic. My friends and I have loved the Cupcake Diaries series, paperbacks with pink covers that described four best friends and their adventures together, making cupcakes. Not exactly heavy stuff, but fun to read. I wanted to write something like the Cupcake Diaries, but starring a middle-school girl with a disability and her filmmaking adventures with her best friends. Instead of making cupcakes, they would make special-effect YouTube videos.My older sister Eva helped me set up a Kickstarter campaign to hire an editor. We wrote the first draft of the book, called \u201cMia Lee Is Wheeling Through Middle School,\u201d and found a literary agent. Using our money from our Kickstarter campaign, we hired someone to help us edit our draft into a polished copy, then sent it out to publishing houses.When the responses started to come in, they were almost all the same: For a girl who was in a wheelchair with a degenerative nerve disease, Mia Lee was just too happy.\u201cI keep expecting more from the plotline than what\u2019s currently here,\u201d one publisher wrote. \u201cWhat if it was about sisters who were twins, and one had Charcot-Marie-Tooth and one didn\u2019t? That would create a more important conflict.\u201d Another said that Mia Lee\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem suited for a lighthearted story. Finally, my agent told me, \u201cI just don\u2019t think people are ready for this type of story for this type of character.\u201dWhat she meant is that Mia Lee, my sassy, YouTube-loving heroine, differed too much from the convention of what a disabled kid is supposed to be like. There are very few stories about kids in wheelchairs, and there are even fewer with a disabled person who is cheerful and happy. Disability is always seen as a misfortune, and disabled characters are simply opportunities to demonstrate the kindness of the able-bodied protagonists._________For Writing and Discussion_________Going Further_________Was I nice? I think somewhere in between nice and not nice is where many people are. It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have told me that they identify with the book not because they have experienced bullying, but because when they were younger they remember that there were times when they could\u2019ve been nicer.Consider your own life. Where do you fall \u201cin between nice and not nice\u201d? Write a journal entry using specific examples from your life to investigate the answer to this question.___________________________It turns out that we are hard-wired to seek and make friends in novel, stressful circumstances. Students naturally assemble themselves into elaborate social networks \u2014 and not just Snapchat, Tumblr, Facebook or Twitter. Our modern technology is merely put into the service of more ancient and powerful impulses.___________________________Here is what we have so far, and the collection is always growing:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Natasha\u2019s Week in Review: Tech Tackles Trump, Again", "Date": "2017-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFor weeks, executives from across the business world, including tech, had been pushing the president to renege on his pledge to undo DACA \u2014 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children to remain here legally. This week Trump ignored them and went ahead with his plan to undo DACA anyway, which prompted a lot of impassioned outrage from the tech companies.And yet, there was a kind of kabuki aspect to the whole thing \u2014 a feeling that all this was all going according to what has become a kind of script for Trump-tech relations. Trump does something, the tech industry condemns it, Trump ignores them, then we all move on to the next thing. For some of the most powerful companies in the world, the tech giants sure do seem powerless to get the president to do what they want, don\u2019t they?But I see a related big issue here for the tech industry: trust in the data economy.It seems to me the fate of the DACA database will not only give us clues about whether the Trump administration intends to use data as a weapon to further disenfranchise the already disenfranchised. It could also impact consumers\u2019 trust in the popular online services that are stockpiling their personal data.What this all means is pretty hazy. It could be that these ads were part of a Russian influence campaign aimed at changing votes during the election. Facebook is cooperating with investigators, so we may learn more at some point in the future. But this could all be disconnected from any alleged Russian plan to get Trump elected. For one thing, the ad buy is pretty small, and some of the ads were purchased even before Trump was in the running. Who knows?To me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we\u2019re learning about it 10 months after the election. Facebook was at the center of the postelection controversy over \u201cfake news\u201d and other shenanigans meant to monkey with the vote. So why did it take the company so long to figure this out? And should we take that to mean there\u2019s a lot more icky that happened on Facebook around the election that it still hasn\u2019t found?But back to your question on why it took Facebook so long to figure out that a Kremlin-linked group had bought ads on the social network.Is the latest news on the Russian ad buy indicative of a larger problem of weak Facebook oversight of its advertising system?Advertisement"}

Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site, can show you where.After Mr. Colbert razzed President Trump for never winning an Emmy for \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d Alec Baldwin, who won best supporting actor in a comedy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d picked up the theme.\u201cI suppose I should say at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,\u201d he said.In some cases, the references were coy. Julia Louis-Dreyfus said \u201cVeep\u201d writers had scrapped a story line about impeachment \u201cbecause we were worried that someone else might get to it first.\u201d Tatiana Maslany, introducing the best actress in a drama category, said the Claire Underwood character from \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d would be a great president because \u201cshe doesn\u2019t tweet.\u201dTo little suspense, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her sixth consecutive award for best lead actress in a comedy for her role as Selina Meyer in \u201cVeep.\u201dHo-hum. We\u2019re used to that. But this time, the win allowed her to set or tie some major records.She is now the record-holder for most wins by an actor playing one character, passing Candice Bergen for \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d and Don Knotts for \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d Factoring in earlier wins for \u201cThe New Adventures of Old Christine\u201d and \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d she tied Cloris Leachman\u2019s record of eight prime-time acting Emmys.New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.The series, which felt topical and resonant (depending on your political views), represents Hulu\u2019s first genuine hit and will certainly increase the streaming service\u2019s profile among both cord-cutting users and stars and creators looking to place new series. While Netflix and Amazon Prime are still better known, Hulu is the first of the big three streamers to win best drama.\u201cI want to thank my cast. Milo, Mandy, Justin, Chrissy, you are the best white TV family that a brother has ever had. Better than Mr. Drummond, better than them white folks that raised Webster. I love you. Susan Kelechi Watson, it is my pleasure to rep black love with you, sister. Let\u2019s keep doing it like Martin and Gina. Ron Cephas Jones, you just have to show up and the work is already there, brother. Thank you so much for embodying the presence which is never an object. I love you. Our writers, you are a lifeblood. You can play, you can play. You can play. I didn\u2019t get that loud, nobody got that loud music.\u201dAs far as limited series go, the show came just shy of a batting a thousand: Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e won for directing, Nicole Kidman for lead actress, Laura Dern for supporting actress and Alexander Skarsgard for supporting actor. The only category it lost in was for writing, with David E. Kelley losing out to Charlie Brooker of \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Reese Witherspoon probably should have beat Ms. Kidman, but she still got to give her speech when accepting for best mini-series, because she was one of the show\u2019s executive producers.Advertisement"}

This means I can sign up for alerts to let me know when a film is going to be playing in the most convenient theater for me. When the most desirable option turns up, I buy my ticket \u2014 not that these movies are likely to sell out on a Thursday night or Friday morning, but you never know. It certainly helps me keep organized. FandangoNow is also useful when I need to research a sequel or some such thing.Fandango was founded in 2000; it was a start-up, backed by a group of movie exhibitors. In the intervening years, it was bought by Comcast, which now also owns NBCUniversal; Warner Bros. Entertainment has a minority ownership of Fandango as well. The movie-review aggregating site Rotten Tomatoes is part of Fandango\u2019s corporate family, as is the movie information app Flixster.FandangoNow started in April 2016. Adam Rockmore, Fandango\u2019s marketing chief, said the service necessarily retains its independence in spite of its lineage. \u201cWe just moved into a new office at the end of May, and it\u2019s completely separate from the other companies,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. \u201cWe have to serve all the studios and all the exhibitors and so it\u2019s important we operate in a discrete way. Similarly, we leave Rotten Tomatoes to do what they do.\u201dStill, Rotten Tomatoes is a presence on the FandangoNow site. You don\u2019t have to scroll down too far on the site\u2019s home page to find \u201c200 Essential Movies to Watch Now,\u201d touting several movies that received Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 \u201ccertified fresh\u201d scores; the top row of the movies offered from $1.99 up features \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201cThe Third Man,\u201d \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d and \u201cAll About Eve.\u201d In what may strike some as slightly paradoxical, this \u00e0 la carte site is actually doing more to promote classic film than Netflix. (In fairness to Netflix, which is more and more often being castigated for its indifference to classic film, the site never sold itself as a portal for any such thing.)FandangoNow, in addition to being a stand-alone video-on-demand transaction site, also wants to be \u201ca full movie-life-cycle marketer,\u201d as Mr. Rockmore put it. The ticketing site has an editorial component; on Fandango, the managing editor Erik Davis, whose numerous television appearances present him as an amiably gruff friendly neighborhood movie lover, contributes blog posts; on FandangoNow, Alicia Malone, whose book on women working in film, \u201cBackwards & In Heels,\u201d was published earlier this year, contributes an energetic indie movie guide.Fandango does remarkably well in the ticket-selling business. Its sales accounted for more than 25% of the opening weekend box office of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Blockbuster seasons aren\u2019t the only good time for the operation. During the coming awards season, Fandango and FandangoNow can promote Golden Globe and Oscar contenders both in theaters and beyond.

{"Headline": "Are Physical Limits All in Our Heads?", "Date": "2017-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingMere firepower isn\u2019t what will roll me out of bed at 3:15 a.m. to follow along online, though. Instead, it\u2019s the subplot created by a curious anomaly. The world record, set on the same Berlin course three years ago by the Kenyan star Dennis Kimetto, is 2:02.57. But one of the men in this year\u2019s field has covered the marathon distance of 26 miles and 385 yards more than two and a half minutes faster than that, in 2:00.25, powered, like Kimetto, only by his own legs and lungs \u2014 albeit with an asterisk.It\u2019s a truth universally acknowledged in the sporting world that the toughest obstacles to surmount are those we erect in our own minds. A barrier like the four-minute mile, we\u2019re told, is impregnable \u2014 until someone like Roger Bannister shows, as he did in 1954, that it can be breached, and then everyone else follows. Kimetto\u2019s world record, having been bested by such a large (though unofficial) margin, has lost much of its mental force. So will it, as the bookies seem to anticipate, be swept aside with ease?To me, the bout in Berlin seems like not just a clash of three heavyweights but a real-life test of the \u201cmental barriers\u201d theory of human endeavor. Faith in the primacy of mind over body is a trope as eagerly embraced in board rooms as in locker rooms and Nike commercials \u2014 and it\u2019s a message we\u2019ve lapped up, without much evidence, for centuries.This empowering idea is now ubiquitous. For the ambitious athlete who seeks to overcome a favored foe or break through to a new level of performance, the right attitude to overcoming obstacles is laid out clearly by the king of self-help books, Norman Vincent Peale, in \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking\u201d:\u201cJust stand up to it, that\u2019s all, and don\u2019t give way under it, and it will finally break,\u201d Peale counsels. \u201cYou will break it. Something has to break, and it won\u2019t be you, it will be the obstacle.\u201dThe logic here isn\u2019t totally crazy. Often forgotten is that in 1953, a year before Bannister\u2019s big run, he ran an exhibition race in which he was paced all the way to the finish, in part by one of his teammates who had deliberately allowed himself to be lapped. His time of 4:02 wasn\u2019t ratified as a British record, because it violated the same pacing rules as the Breaking2 marathon did \u2014 but it served its purpose. \u201cOnly two painful seconds now separated me from the four-minute mile,\u201d Bannister recalled in his autobiography, \u201cand I was certain I could cut down the time.\u201dThe four-minute mile is now an allegorical staple of the self-help literature. Bannister\u2019s feat shattered an imposing mental barrier much like the one holding you back from climbing El Capitan or getting promoted at work. \u201cWithin one year,\u201d asserts \u201cThe Winning Mind Set,\u201d a fairly typical self-help tract from 2006, \u201c37 other runners did the same thing. In the year after that, over 300 runners ran a mile in less than four minutes.\u201dNow, be honest for a moment: Did you smile a bit when you read that quotation? I know I did. Motivational slogans are great, but 26.2 miles is still 26.2 miles, and you can\u2019t simply will your muscles to keep contracting as their fuel supplies dwindle.But all three men are marathon veterans who under normal conditions have never cracked 2:03. While the exact magnitude of Kipchoge\u2019s boost in Italy is impossible to calculate, it seems likely that the drafting formation alone, which won\u2019t be duplicated in Berlin, saved him one to two minutes. So, back under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions in Berlin, why should we expect any of these men, all in or approaching their mid-30s, to suddenly burst through to a new level \u2014 unless what limited their previous efforts was more mental than physical?As a hard-nosed empiricist who laughed off the sports psychology seminars I was forced to sit through as a college track athlete, the skeptical take is my default position. I\u2019ve sneered at the bromides of self-help for as long as I\u2019ve known them.Four months later, that still feels true. A once-unthinkable time like 2:01-something no longer sounds that fast \u2014 because a human has run 2:00.25.So, if the weather is good and the stars are aligned, I expect to see Kipchoge set out at an impossible pace, in pursuit of an impossible time. And because any man can do what any other has done, I expect Bekele and Kipsang to follow. The tension will mount as the trio clip off mile after reckless mile, and we\u2019ll hold our breaths waiting for the inevitable moment when the physiological debt comes due. I expect to see carnage and mayhem and beauty and truth in the final miles.Something will have to break \u2014 but, despite myself, I don\u2019t think it will be Kipchoge. I think he\u2019s going to run 2:01-something. And if he does, I\u2019ll start writing my self-help book on Monday morning.Advertisement"}

Corporations such as Amazon and Google are only among the latest in a long line of corporations that have tried to influence students via their teachers. They benefit from decades of policies that have systematically underfunded and inequitably funded schools and that have placed an almost religious faith in the role of technology in education.We have no doubt about the dedication of Kayla Delzer, a third-grade teacher profiled in your article, to her students. The fact that she spends time hustling for funds and products is a direct result of policy decisions made in Washington and in statehouses across the country that have driven countless schools to desperation.It seems clear to us that she and other corporate-sponsored \u201cteacher ambassadors\u201d have a conflict of interest. Sadly, it appears that it is their dedication to their students that leads them to do the corporations\u2019 bidding. Ms. Delzer\u2019s efforts may benefit her students, though that is by no means assured. What is clear is that Ms. Delzer is helping to reinforce a status quo that places corporate interests instead of students at the center of education reform.The writers are, respectively, a research associate and a research professor at the National Education Policy Center, University of Colorado Boulder. To the Editor:I don\u2019t question the motives of Kayla Delzer. I believe that she honestly believes in all the products she is using in her classroom. The majority of teachers I have worked with in my 14 years in education are sincerely interested in finding any resources that work for their students. But determining what works for your students can be a very subjective evaluation.For all the money being spent by school districts on technology for students, there is a shocking lack of data to prove that this spending is yielding any benefit over traditional methods, as your article points out. In spite of this lack of data, technology spending by school districts seems to grow every year. And teachers like Ms. Delzer are celebrated not just for the particular product they are using, and endorse, but just for using technology in general.President Eisenhower warned us of the emergence of the military-industrial complex. I fear that the information-technology-industrial complex has taken hold in public education.NOEL CHANG, HOUSTONThe writer is a high school teacher. To the Editor:Companies give freebies to teacher influencers with the expectation that their school districts will buy something. What happens, though, when other teachers want freebies or when schools need to upgrade these freebie technologies, and money is not available? Funding teaching materials in such a haphazard manner is not efficient, nor can it be easily replicated in other contexts.There\u2019s a better way. Classroom grant programs from foundations, public entities and even some corporations can provide teachers funding that is free of the kind of influence peddling described in the article. Teachers who write successful grants through such programs have the power to spend the money on items and activities they want, not what corporate sponsors would like them to buy. In addition, a key part of most grant applications is the plan for sustainability and replicability.

{"Headline": "\u2018Pink Panther\u2019 and \u2018Decoy\u2019 Return on Disc", "Date": "2017-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVD\u201cDecoy,\u201d a syndicated half-hour show, which lasted 39 episodes and starred Beverly Garland as the police officer Casey Jones, is notable both for its unusual protagonist \u2014 a female crime fighter \u2014 and its New York City locations.A cop with the looks of a model and the instincts of a social worker, Casey is hard-nosed and big-hearted. (Her first kill, nearly a third of way through the show\u2019s run, is a traumatic event.) Inspired by \u201cDragnet\u201d but predating \u201cNaked City\u201d by one season, the show\u2019s ambience is that of Neorealist-inflected film noir.The plots have Casey usually going undercover, impersonating a petty thief, crooked cop, nightclub hostess, mannequin or showgirl, always with flair. In one powerfully claustrophobic episode, she\u2019s sent to prison to solve a murder; assumed by the guards to be a convict and branded as an informer, she has to cope with the scariest prisoner in the cellblock, played with consummate aggression by Colleen Dewhurst.Like \u201cThe Americans,\u201d FX\u2019s series about Soviet sleeper agents, \u201cDecoy,\u201d also known as \u201cDecoy: Police Woman,\u201d is all about acting. Ms. Garland (who appeared in several Roger Corman productions, including \u201cIt Conquered the World,\u201d but more steadily worked in television) cheerfully changes coiffure, and, in character as Casey, enjoys demonstrating her range. At the end of each episode, she breaks the fourth wall to deliver a tough-minded moral.Casey has no partner, professional or romantic (although she does make a date with a man she meets during an investigation in which she poses as a wealthy socialite). Her back story is sketchy; she\u2019s without a personal life. Several episodes refer to a tragic love affair with a fellow officer killed in the line of duty.The show\u2019s penultimate episode, \u201cFirst Arrest,\u201d flashes back to Casey\u2019s rookie assignment \u2014 under cover in Coney Island as an exotic dancer. Her droll, perfunctory gyrations and sketchy device to bust a dealer in stolen goods are worth noting, but these are upstaged by the wealth of scenes shot in the long-gone Steeplechase Park.Casey\u2019s co-star is New York (though \u201cDecoy\u201d seems to have never been telecast in the city where it was shot). Locations are not restricted to Midtown Manhattan or Times Square, and include Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, the South Bronx and Randalls Island. Harlem seems conspicuously absent. The show is notably (and shockingly) white; the Cuban-American actor Tomas Milian is a rare Latino. Nevertheless, \u201cDecoy\u201d did showcase a number of young New York actors, among them Edward Asner, Martin Balsam, Peter Falk, Zohra Lampert and Suzanne Pleshette.Diane Ladd appears in one episode, displaying an amazing resemblance to her daughter Laura Dern. Michael Tolan, a student of Stella Adler, plays a sociopath who has seemingly made a careful study of Adler\u2019s most famous acolyte, Marlon Brando. The combination of New York streets and local actors is irresistible. Take, as another example, \u201cJohnny Staccato,\u201d the 1959 series starring John Cassavetes as a jazzman private eye (brought out on DVD seven years ago by Shout! Factory/Timeless Media) and a trove of exaggerated Method-acting performances amid Manhattan locations.A series of set pieces in glamorous international locations, \u201cThe Return of the Pink Panther\u201d was followed by two diminished returns, \u201cThe Pink Panther Strikes Again\u201d (1976) and \u201cRevenge of the Pink Panther\u201d (1978).If both movies decline after the animated credits, it was in part because much of the live action feels like inferior animations. The running battle between Clouseau and his nemesis, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), suggests a third-rate Road Runner cartoon, while the racial stereotyping in Clouseau\u2019s obligatory, increasingly tiresome martial arts bouts with his Asian manservant (Burt Kwouk) seems a step away from the animated anti-Japanese propaganda from World War II.\u201cRevenge of the Pink Panther\u201d toyed with the idea of Clouseau\u2019s demise. (Amusingly, Dreyfus is required to deliver the eulogy.) \u201cTrail of the Pink Panther\u201d (1982) dealt with the fact that Sellers was actually dead. Recycling outtakes from previous \u201cPanther,\u201d the movie, with Sellers less an actor than an exploitable property, is not nearly as tasteless as its premise.

{"Headline": "How Operation Car Wash Is Exposing Political Crime in Brazil", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ReviewBrazil, a nation rich in natural resources, fertile lands and cultural diversity, has struggled for decades with underdevelopment. Some blame it on the \u201ccusto Brasil,\u201d or \u201cBrazil cost\u201d \u2014 the accumulated price, in cash, time and other resources, of doing business here \u2014 pointing to the weight of bureaucracy, high taxes and poor investment. Others cite insufficient investments in infrastructure, science, technology and education.The root cause of our struggle, however, is a decay of democracy in the face of systemic, institutional corruption. Our representative system has been so far removed from its raison d\u2019\u00eatre that the will to govern has been replaced by the goal of remaining in power.Our governmental structure is coalition-based, which makes it vulnerable to corruption. With dozens of parties vying to form a majority in Congress, elections are bloated and prohibitively expensive. Gaining power allows a political party the chance to appoint executives at state-run companies. Executives receive kickbacks from contractors, and some of that cash is funneled back to the party.It is a self-perpetuating cycle: Fraudulent elections generate public administrations that promote corruption, and are operated by politicians who create electoral reforms to grant themselves more and more power, resources and control. As a result, Brazil\u2019s main political parties, which have taken uninterrupted turns in authority for decades, are focused not on governing the country, but on building alliances to stay in power.Ministers, advisers, senators, representatives and even members of the judicial branch collaborate with private interests to make decisions about public investments and push for the approval of bills that disproportionately benefit those in power.Some of Brazil\u2019s largest economic groups are, in fact, artificial empires built on tax exemptions and loans from the Brazilian Development Bank, and their failures have shaken the foundations of the country\u2019s economy.Development resources intended to improve quality of life and reduce social inequality have been drained to enrich certain groups and companies that have been hailed as \u201cnational champions,\u201d and to finance the political party system. Through misguided economic policy and the misappropriation of public resources, they have cost more than 14 million people their jobs.Operation Car Wash also serves as a warning for the business sector and its deep-rooted practice of influencing government decisions. Businesses engaged in corruption can now be dealt with by the justice system, which will free us up to create an environment in which competition can promote efficiency and adequate public works and services.This tsunami sweeping Brazil will allow space for a new political paradigm founded on the principle that justice means justice for all. We\u2019re not there yet, but operation Car Wash is working, as evidenced by the reaction of the political establishment along the entire ideological spectrum.A significant number of political, party and business leaders are using all their assets to keep things as they are. There are alliances between former opponents aimed at stopping the investigation, and there are attempts to impose rules for the 2018 general election that would guarantee continuity for those currently in power. Operation Car Wash\u2019s main task force was even shut down in July, leaving the investigation to be absorbed by a larger anti-corruption division with a more limited scope.Our hope of seeing Brazil rejuvenated remains in the hands of the press, the judicial branch and the people. With a lot of pain, we are learning how to create effective laws and institutions. The first big test will be the 2018 elections, when voters will be able to conduct the biggest \u201cwash\u201d ever seen in Brazilian politics \u2014 when they will have a chance to clean out corruption and open the door to a reconstruction of the country\u2019s institutions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Othello\u2019: Shakespeare\u2019s Tragedy Was Orson Welles\u2019s Triumph", "Date": "2017-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDThis brilliant, confounding movie, which has several times vanished and reappeared since it had its world premiere (and shared the top award) at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival, will be available on Blu-ray next month from Criterion.In \u201cFilming \u2018Othello,\u2019\u201d made for West German television in the 1970s, Welles explains that he had endeavored to show not only Othello\u2019s insane jealousy of his wife, Desdemona, but \u201ca whole world in collapse.\u201d In a sense that world was Welles\u2019s. The movie is founded on dislocation. It was the first film Welles made after leaving Hollywood for Europe. Shot piecemeal over a period of three or more years in Venice, Tuscany, Rome and the walled city of Essaouira (then known as Mogador) on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic coast, it is a work of supreme pragmatism. Stranded without costumes, Welles invented a lengthy Turkish bath sequence using a local fish market.Throughout the off-again on-again production, Welles had to hold the film\u2019s continuity in his mind, not to mention holding onto his principal actors. In some respects the production mirrored the play. Welles\u2019s relationship with his Iago, Micheal MacLiammoir, was fraught with mutual professional jealousy. (MacLiammoir wrote a gossipy memoir about the making of the film.) And, according to Welles\u2019s biographer Simon Callow, the director was unusually unfair in his treatment of the movie\u2019s Desdemona (the strong-willed French-Canadian actress Suzanne Cloutier, his third choice for the role).One might even extend Welles\u2019s competitiveness to Shakespeare. Sound in \u201cOthello\u201d is always subordinate to image. Less windy than windblown, it is a film full of jarring shifts, disorienting angles, and sudden jumps to close-up \u2014 an expressionist style that let Welles accommodate all manner of mismatched footage. The continual cutting on movement creates a roiling, hectic quality in which each brief action seems to exist in its own eternal present.The movie\u2019s most compelling subtext is what the Russian montage theorists called \u201ccreative geography\u201d \u2014 the use of editing to create the illusion of a continuous, albeit imaginary, space. Consecutive sequences were filmed many months and thousands of miles apart; Welles would claim that he was never able to get Iago, Desdemona and Iago\u2019s stooge, Roderigo, together for a single shot. In \u201cFilming \u2018Othello,\u2019\u201d he maintains that \u201cIago changed continents in the middle of a phrase.\u201d The scenes are replete with stand-ins wearing hoods or turned away from the camera. Virtually all the dialogue was post-dubbed with Welles himself providing Roderigo\u2019s voice, among others.These editing strategies aren\u2019t simply described in \u201cFilming \u2018Othello\u2019\u201d they\u2019re also demonstrated \u2014 most hilariously when Welles splices himself into and otherwise re-edits a lengthy dinner conversation with MacLiammoir and his companion, Hilton Edwards, who had played Desdemona\u2019s father. \u201cFilming \u2018Othello\u2019\u201d also includes a fantastic duet between the old Welles and the young, the elder reading Iago\u2019s lines as his glowering younger self reacts to them.In \u201cFilming \u2018Othello,\u2019\u201d Welles appears to privilege his editing over his directing and his directing over his acting. But the movie is also a hall of mirrors, with Welles playing \u201cOrson Welles\u201d \u2014 at once pompous and self-deprecating, a celluloid Santa Claus with a full bag of tricks.A short coda has Welles answering questions from what looks to be a college audience that has just seen \u201cOthello\u201d at the long-gone Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Mass. A director, he explains, is \u201cthe man who presides over accidents\u201d (pause for applause) \u201cbut doesn\u2019t make any himself\u201d (hearty chuckle at his own joke).For Welles, process, however chaotic, was ultimately more important than product. With \u201cFilming Othello,\u201d he ended his film career as he began it: Like \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d the movie is a stunt that places the act of filmmaking at center stage.Welles\u2019s third Hollywood film, and by some accounts his most financially successful, \u201cThe Stranger\u201d (1946), has been released in a new Blu-ray from Olive Films. More staidly conventional than either \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d or \u201cThe Magnificent Ambersons\u201d (and evidently re-edited by its producer), the movie has been somewhat unfairly neglected.Advertisement"}

Few answers on those subjects have appeared rushed or flippant; rather, the essays have suggested strong, sustained interest in those topics.In a lot of ways, the Summer Reading Contest has been a showcase of students\u2019 empathy for others on a wide range of subjects.As I read Kang\u2019s piece on the death of Michael Deng, I saw not only another tragic case of a hazing incident gone wrong, but an introspective story of an 18-year-old seeking identity and kinship in a world seldom welcoming to faces like his.Perhaps Kang\u2019s article resonated with me because Deng reminded me of my brother, who is about the same age as Deng was when he died. Or perhaps it was that for the first time, I heard mention of cases like the racially-charged murder of Vincent Chin, or Korematsu v. United States, which perpetuated the internment of thousands of Japanese-Americans \u2014 all stories that were absent in my U.S. history class.Kang\u2019s piece opened my eyes to the lack of Asian representation in our textbooks and the Anglocentric perspective that pervades our society. Kenny Kwan, one of the boys involved, said he was grateful that a writer would provide the story with an \u201cAsian perspective.\u201d With so few people of color represented in the journalism industry, having our stories told is often an exception rather than the norm. While Kang firmly remained an objective and impartial reporter, his writing was unique in that it depicted the boys as human beings, rather than branding them as the \u201cfrat rats\u201d that others had. He openly addressed the difficulty for young Asian-Americans in coming to terms with their identities, and the adversity they face in white-dictated society.Our country is beset with anger. We hate white supremacists and neo-Nazis; they hate blacks and Jews. We call each other horrible names, scream directed chants and raise stinging signs into the air. Our nation has been torn apart without any hope of recovery \u2026 or so it seems.But Chlo\u00e9 Valdary reveals that there are better ways to fight back. Valdary, a black woman, recounts times in her past when she was attacked for her ethnicity. Yet she doesn\u2019t blame the other side. Instead, Valdary feels an emotion that I, at first, could not understand: Pity. Valday opens our eyes to groups that are, yes, hate-filled and guilty, but are also driven by pain. As she explains it, \u201cPeople often hurt because they have hurt in them.\u201dThe actions of white supremacists and neo-Nazis are monstrous, and their beliefs are inhumane, but they have been spurred by a harrowing past. We can condemn neo-Nazis. We can disparage white supremacists. But Valdary tells us that nothing we do will ever be as effective as looking into the eyes of our enemies and trying to fix their hidden pain. In her view, the color of our skin is irrelevant; it is the color of our hearts, which reflect our pasts, that truly measure our value. Valdary tells her readers that it is how we choose to respond to our pain that makes us worthy. So let us be like her and cast away our anger so we can rise to a level above the attackers and glue the shards of this nation together._________Thank you to Our Summer Reading Contest Judges:Alan Blinder, Amanda Christy Brown, John Dorman, Shannon Doyne, Caroline Crosson Gilpin, Michael Gonchar, Annissa Hambouz, Melissa Hoppert, Gina Lamb, Kathleen Massara, Sue Mermelstein, Wadzanai Mhute, Ken Paul, Pia Peterson, Flora Peir, Ken Rosen, Charles Rubin, Catherine Saint Louis, Teresa Smith, Samantha Stark and Nancy WartikAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Uncontacted\u2019 Amazon Tribe Members Reported Killed in Brazil", "Date": "2017-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 They were members of an uncontacted tribe gathering eggs along the river in a remote part of the Amazon. Then, it appears, they had the bad luck of running into gold miners.Now, federal prosecutors in Brazil have opened an investigation into the reported massacre of about 10 members of the tribe, the latest evidence that threats to endangered indigenous groups are on the rise in the country.The Brazilian agency on indigenous affairs, Funai, said it had lodged a complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office in the state of Amazonas after the gold miners went to a bar near the border with Colombia, and bragged about the killings. They brandished a hand-carved paddle that they said had come from the tribe, the agency said.\u201cIt was crude bar talk,\u201d said Leila Silvia Burger Sotto-Maior, Funai\u2019s coordinator for uncontacted and recently contacted tribes. \u201cThey even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river.\u201dThe miners, she said, claimed that \u201cthey had to kill them or be killed.\u201dMs. Sotto-Maior said the killings were reported to have taken place last month. The indigenous affairs bureau conducted some initial interviews in the town and then took the case to the police.\u201cThere is a lot of evidence, but it needs to be proven,\u201d she said.The prosecutor in charge of the case, Pablo Luz de Beltrand, confirmed that an investigation had begun, but said he could not discuss the details of the case while it was underway. He said the episode was alleged to have occurred in the Javari Valley \u2014 the second-largest indigenous reserve in Brazil \u2014 in the remote west.\u201cWe are following up, but the territories are big and access is limited,\u201d Mr. Beltrand said. \u201cThese tribes are uncontacted \u2014 even Funai has only sporadic information about them. So it\u2019s difficult work that requires all government departments working together.\u201dMr. Beltrand said it was the second such episode that he was investigating this year. The first reported killing of uncontacted indigenous people in the region occurred in February, and that case is still open. \u201cIt was the first time that we\u2019d had this kind of case in this region,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that was happening before.\u201d\u201cIf the investigation confirms the reports, it will be yet another genocidal massacre resulting directly from the Brazilian government\u2019s failure to protect isolated tribes \u2014 something that is guaranteed in the Constitution,\u201d said Sarah Shenker, a senior campaigner with the rights group.Three of those bases were in the Javari Valley, which is known as the Uncontacted Frontier and is believed to be home to more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth. Approximately 20 of the 103 uncontacted tribes registered in Brazil are in the Valley.\u201cWe had problems with previous governments, but not like this,\u201d said Ms. Sotto-Maior, the Funai coordinator.Her agency\u2019s budget this year for the uncontacted tribes department was just two million reais, or about $650,000, down from 7.5 million reais in 2014. \u201cWhat can I do with two million reais?\u201d she said.President Temer, who is deeply unpopular, has sought support from powerful agricultural, ranching and mining lobbies to push economic changes through Congress and shelter him from a corruption investigation. Last month, the lower house of Congress voted to spare him from standing trial for corruption in the Supreme Court, but only after the president doled out jobs and agreed to a series of concessions, many of which affected longstanding deforestation and land-rights regulations.A decree by Mr. Temer that opened up a large reserve in the Amazon to mining prompted an international outcry. After a judge blocked the decree, the government announced that it would revise its decision, but critics are wary.With land disputes on the rise in many remote areas of Brazil, indigenous groups, rural workers and land activists have all been targeted by violence. More than 50 people had been killed as of the end of July, compared with 61 in all of 2016, according to the Land Pastoral Commission.In some cases, government or police agents have been blamed for the violence. The authorities are investigating one police raid in the Amazon region that ended with 10 activists being killed. No officers were injured.Activists worry that the country\u2019s indigenous groups \u2014 and especially the uncontacted tribes \u2014 are the most vulnerable when it comes to land disputes.\u201cWhen their land is protected, they thrive,\u201d said Ms. Shenker, the rights campaigner. \u201cWhen their land is invaded, they can be wiped out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Before Wisconsin, Foxconn Vowed Big Spending in Brazil. Few Jobs Have Come.", "Date": "2017-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a news conference in Brazil, Foxconn officials unveiled plans to invest billions of dollars and build one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing hubs in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The government had high expectations that the project would yield 100,000 jobs.Six years later, Brazil is still waiting for most of those jobs to materialize.\u201cThe area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,\u201d said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even expressed an interest in meeting us.\u201dFoxconn\u2019s experience in Brazil and other parts of the world illustrates how difficult it has been for it to replicate its enormously successful Chinese manufacturing model elsewhere.But the model does not translate easily to other countries, where Foxconn must navigate different social, political and labor conditions.In Brazil, Foxconn\u2019s plans unraveled quickly. The administration that had wooed the company was soon swept from power amid corruption allegations and an impeachment vote. Some of the tax breaks that had been promised were reduced or abandoned, as economic growth and consumer spending slumped.Today, Foxconn employs only about 2,800 workers in Brazil.Foxconn does the \u201cbig song and dance, bringing out the Chinese dragon dancers, ribbon cuttings, toasts and signature of the usual boilerplate agreements,\u201d said Alberto Moel, an investor and adviser to early-stage tech companies who until recently was a technology analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThen, when it gets down to brass tacks, something way smaller materializes.\u201dFoxconn said in a statement that it was committed to investing billions of dollars in building facilities outside China. But the company also said it had been forced to adapt to changing conditions in markets like Brazil, where the economy had stagnated.\u201cThis and the changing needs of our customers that our proposed investments were designed to serve have resulted in scaled down operations in the country at this time,\u201d the company said in its statement.With regard to the Wisconsin project, Foxconn has said it plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturing campuses in the southeastern part of the state. The company expects the buildings that will make up the campus to total 20 million square feet \u2014 about three times the size of the Pentagon \u2014 and to help transform the region into a major production center for flat-panel display screens.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, called the Foxconn deal a \u201cgame changer\u201d that could help spur a manufacturing revival in the Midwest. At the White House in July, President Trump hailed the agreement as a great one for American manufacturing, American workers and \u201ceverybody who believes in the concept, in the label, Made in the U.S.A.\u201d Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin officially approved the deal on Monday.Foxconn has good reason to diversify its manufacturing operations. About 95 percent of the company\u2019s 1.1 million employees work in China. Building a large work force elsewhere could reduce the company\u2019s reliance on a single locale, lowering its risk if countries imposed tariffs or other trade barriers on Chinese exports.But exporting Foxconn\u2019s Chinese strategy is virtually impossible.The global supply chain for electronics remains firmly rooted in Asia, where advantages like low-cost labor and an abundance of skilled engineers have been crucial to the region\u2019s development as a manufacturing base.What makes Foxconn\u2019s Chinese operations really hum are the extraordinary level of government subsidies and support, and the sheer scale of those operations. Local governments often finance and build the company\u2019s factories, manage its dormitories and recruit tens of thousands of workers. Some government officials have gone door to door in small counties to recruit workers.The government aid can reach into the billions of dollars.Foxconn began to shift large-scale production operations beyond China in about 2009, when it opened plants elsewhere in Asia, including Vietnam and India. The company now has factories in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, and a large plant in Mexico that employs 18,000 workers.When several countries began to require that some components be made locally as a way of encouraging production at home, Foxconn stepped up its efforts to build outside China. And company executives essentially followed the same playbook they had used inside China.Foxconn\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, met with high-ranking leaders, including Brazil\u2019s president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Mr. Gou made pledges; won tax breaks and government concessions; and announced plans to spend billions of dollars to create tens of thousands of jobs in multiple countries. Brazil called one of the planned Foxconn sites the \u201cCity of the Future.\u201dThen reality set in.Labor strikes in India and Vietnam prompted Foxconn\u2019s operations in those countries to be shut down temporarily. Political and economic turmoil in Brazil led the authorities there to scale back some of tax breaks it had offered the company. A plan to invest $1 billion in the construction of a plant in Jakarta, Indonesia, collapsed, partly because Foxconn could not develop the supply chain it had hoped to, according to analysts and government officials.Foxconn\u2019s plans also fizzled in Pennsylvania. In 2013, the company, which has a small office in Harrisburg, said it intended to build a $30 million factory in the state that could employ 500 workers. The plant has yet to be built.Pennsylvania officials declined to comment on why the factory had not been built, but said that they had not given up hope. (Foxconn also did not comment.)\u201cWe do not believe Pennsylvania is out of the running for any particular project,\u201d David Smith, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development in Harrisburg, said about Foxconn\u2019s commitment in the state.For Foxconn, the move to Wisconsin offers political benefits.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump skewered China over what he deemed its unfair trade practices. He vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States and said his administration might impose a border tax on imports, raising the prospect of a trade war.After the election, Foxconn joined a parade of global companies bearing promises.Jack Ma, the executive chairman of the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, arrived at Trump Tower in New York and pledged to create one million jobs in America. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank of Japan, said his company would invest $50 billion in the United States. And at around the same time, Foxconn said it was planning to build production facilities in the United States.Wisconsin lawmakers pushed it through nonetheless, and when Mr. Walker approved the deal on Monday, he called it \u201ca truly transformational step for our state.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Brazil, and Joe Cochrane from Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Indie Designers, Uniting Is a Survival Skill", "Date": "2017-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor an independent designer operating in a world of megabrands like Amazon, Zara, Nike and H&M, an old maxim may hold the key to survival: United we are stronger.At least that was the thinking Elizabeth Solomeina applied when she was struggling to find a way to show and sell the jewelry she designs without spending huge amounts of money on rent or outsourcing her work to various boutiques.\u201cI needed a place to sell my stuff, I needed a customer base,\u201d Ms. Solomeina said. \u201cWhen stylists wanted to come over to my studio, I would tell them it\u2019s in Brooklyn, and they would be like, \u2018Never mind.\u2019\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI had friends like this, too.\u201dLast Friday, during New York Fashion Week, the group of 68 held a two-hour-long presentation and runway show in the store, displaying more than 350 looks. During the presentation, models in neutral colors showed off jewelry and accessories, rotating every few minutes.The runway show included a variety of aesthetic visions. Most of the pieces were the kind you could walk out onto the street wearing, and all were available immediately after the show.As techno beats and songs by Little Dragon, Migos and Sango pounded through the speakers, models strutted by in metallic and brightly colored pants and jackets (from Daniel Silverstain, who has designed for Solange and Lady Gaga); long coats with \u201cProud Immigrant\u201d written across the back (from Ricardo Seco, a Mexican designer); tweed suits and knit dresses (from Kathrin Henon, who works with Dennis Basso); and much more.Between each section of the show, models in silver pants and Flying Solo T-shirts created by the designers walked by with signs denoting the next designer\u2019s Instagram handle.Flying Solo operates somewhat like a grocery or building co-op, with members paying a membership fee that goes toward rent, production and marketing costs for events like the fashion week show. Each member is required to work eight hours every week, opening and closing the store, cleaning and helping customers on the floor.When the team members opened their first store on Mulberry Street, they put together as much of the interior themselves as they could. \u201cWe designed the racks, the shelving,\u201d Ms. Solomeina said. \u201cOur designers were sketching, running to Home Depot, assembling racks.\u201d They were ready for customers in three days. On West Broadway, it took all of four.\u201cIt\u2019s our sweat and I hope no tears,\u201d Ms. Solomeina said.Flying Solo has had help from outside. Early on, Ms. Solomeina secured funding from Alex Barnett, an investor who has worked with technology companies and charities. Mr. Barnett saw in Ms. Solomeina\u2019s proposal a model for the future.\u201cA lot of them are really brilliant designers,\u201d he said of Flying Solo\u2019s members. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy that the brilliance isn\u2019t rewarded. A lot of times it\u2019s who has a lot of capital or who gets picked up by a big brand or whatever the trend is at that moment.\u201dSpeaking of the changes in the retail landscape that have been spurred by the advent of technology and the expansion of giants like Amazon, Zara and H&M, Mr. Barnett said: \u201cI don\u2019t think change should be feared. It\u2019s creating space for innovation. Independent designers need to stop working against each other and realize they\u2019re all on the same side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whites Have Huge Wealth Edge Over Blacks (but Don\u2019t Know It)", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxFor every $100 earned by an average white family, how much do you think is earned by an average black family?For every $100 in wealth accumulated by an average white family, how much wealth has the average black family accumulated?The Yale researchers suspected that many people would not get the answers right.\u201cI\u2019m a person who studies inequality, who should really know how inequality looks,\u201d said one of the psychologists, Michael Kraus, who researches the behaviors and beliefs that help perpetuate inequality. \u201cAnd I look at the black-white gap, and I\u2019m shocked at the magnitude.\u201dBlack families in America earn just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04.If Mr. Kraus, of all people, is taken aback by these numbers, what are the odds that most Americans have a good understanding of them? The answer, he and his colleagues fear, has broad implications for how we understand our society and what we\u2019re willing to do to make it fairer.\u201cIt seems that we\u2019ve convinced ourselves \u2013 and by \u2018we\u2019 I mean Americans writ large \u2013 that racial discrimination is a thing of the past,\u201d said Jennifer Richeson, who was another of the study\u2019s authors, along with Julian Rucker, a doctoral student. \u201cWe\u2019ve literally overcome it, so to speak, despite blatant evidence to the contrary.\u201dTo understand how people have perceived that progress, the researchers asked blacks and whites of varying income levels to estimate answers to the questions above in both recent years and historically. They also asked about how much black workers with a high school diploma but no college degree earn relative to whites of the same education level, and how the earnings of blacks and whites with a four-year college degree compare.The present-day results, aggregated across several surveys used in the study, are compared here with actual government data:Why would people get these questions so wrong \u2014 and consistently in the direction of too much optimism? (This study was also conducted after the 2016 election.) Blacks overestimated equality, too, but the biggest effects were among wealthy whites.But the pattern this study identifies isn\u2019t simply about lack of access to accurate information. As Mr. Kraus points out, popular videos and charts regularly circulate on social media highlighting the startling levels of inequality in America. And yet, many people who click on them forget about the severity of inequality just long enough to be surprised by it again in the future.\u201cDespite this information being out there, we don\u2019t really take it in,\u201d Mr. Kraus said. This happens \u201cin a way that suggests that maybe we\u2019re motivated to forget it, or motivated to distort it in our own minds.\u201dWe\u2019re inclined, as well, to believe that society is fairer than it really is. The reality that it\u2019s not \u2014  that even college-educated black workers earn about 20 percent less than college-educated white ones, for example \u2014 is uncomfortable for both blacks who\u2019ve been harmed by that unfairness and whites who\u2019ve benefited from it.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to consider the possibility that some of what we\u2019ve achieved or gained is due to forces that aren\u2019t our own individual hard work,\u201d Ms. Richeson said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to grapple with, especially in American society. We really believe in egalitarianism and meritocracy.\u201dIt\u2019s a myth that racial progress is inevitable, Ms. Richeson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also dangerous insofar as it keeps us blind to considerable inequality in our nation that\u2019s quite foundational,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course we can\u2019t address it if we\u2019re not even willing to acknowledge it.\u201dSources: Census data from Current Population Survey 2010 (family wealth); 2013 (family income); 2015 (high school and college wages).

{"Headline": "And This Year, the Emmy Goes to \u2026 Politics", "Date": "2017-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In any other year, big-hearted dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d or \u201cThis Is Us\u201d or a period drama like \u201cThe Crown\u201d would dominate the Emmys.But this was no normal year.This is a moment in which the partisan chasm has widened and political discourse has taken on a greater sense of urgency. Bright lines are dividing those supporting President Trump and those vilifying him, and Hollywood has never been shy about signaling where it stands.And so Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards, as much as they were a celebration of artistic accomplishment, were also a statement that, eight months into a Trump presidency, topical and decidedly progressive shows rule the day in television \u2014 at least among the industry insiders who dole out the accolades.\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which revived its fortunes last season with a weekly skewering of Mr. Trump, claimed the most awards of any show Sunday. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a dystopian drama that tapped into fears about authoritarianism in America, nabbed best drama and several other awards. And individual winners like Alec Baldwin, Donald Glover and John Oliver took the stage to spoof Mr. Trump and give voice to the liberal worldview that prevails in much of the entertainment industry.A few hours after the ceremony, the former Emmy winner Jon Hamm described it as \u201cthe most diverse, most different, most interesting Emmy show I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dWhen his former co-star on \u201cMad Men,\u201d Elisabeth Moss, was asked if she had seen an Emmys quite this political, she was emphatic.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, holding an Emmy in each hand, including the one she won for best actress for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve also never seen anything like where our country is right now.\u201dAll year, late night shows with an anti-Trump bent and left-leaning cable news shows like Rachel Maddow\u2019s on MSNBC have seen their ratings soar, and now that political posture has received the seal of approval from Emmys voters.But it also means that the Emmys, and all awards shows, for that matter, are part of a broader cultural divide. And to its critics, Hollywood may be proving yet again that it lives in an elite, self-congratulatory bubble, showering awards on shows that reflect its worldview while ignoring the millions of people who prefer \u201cNCIS\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\u201cRemember, it\u2019s California,\u201d said Margaret Atwood, the author of the novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d on which the Hulu show was based, as she glided into her first Emmys party at age 77. \u201cThis would not happen in a lot of other states. This would, in fact, be a lot different. This is its own world here.\u201dThe show did not draw a big audience. The ceremony, hosted by Stephen Colbert, attracted just 11.38 million viewers, Nielsen said, in line with last year\u2019s total, which was a record low.On Fox News on Monday morning, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said viewers were \u201ctuning out\u201d because of how politicized the Emmys have become, and suggested that Hollywood\u2019s anti-Trump posturing had become tiresome.\u201cThey got plucked and polished and waxed, and some of them didn\u2019t eat for two months, and all for what?\u201d she said. \u201cTo sound the same?\u201dStill, the heated political climate produced some startling changes for the Emmys.\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has never appealed much to Emmy voters, and they had not given it a top show award in more than two decades. But just two years removed from inviting Mr. Trump to host \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d the NBC late night show excoriated him this past season, and reaped the rewards: Mr. Baldwin won an Emmy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who portrayed both Ms. Conway and Hillary Clinton, won an Emmy as well.\u201c\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 had a career year,\u201d said Warren Littlefield, a longtime Emmy voter who is a former NBC executive and a producer of \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cYou had to watch \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 to get an appreciation of the world we\u2019re living in, and it helped us endure what we\u2019re all living with.\u201dOther shows benefited as well, including Mr. Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d which won the prize for best variety talk show for the second consecutive year. Mr. Oliver delights in using Mr. Trump as a punching bag on his show.Mr. Glover of \u201cAtlanta\u201d and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of \u201cVeep\u201d were among the many winners who mocked President Trump on stage. And after Mr. Baldwin won, he alluded to the fact that Mr. Trump had long coveted an Emmy but never won one. \u201cI suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,\u201d Mr. Baldwin quipped.What benefited those shows, however, appeared to have hurt dramas like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d both of which were decidedly retro and unpolitical.\u201cStranger Things\u201d was a sci-fi homage to movies like \u201cStand by Me\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d was a heart-on-your-sleeve family drama that took inspiration from the 1983 tear-jerker \u201cTerms of Endearment.\u201dStill, Hulu\u2019s success was a shock in its own right. Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, Comcast, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, has a smaller programming budget compared with those of streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon.But \u201cHandmaid\u2019s,\u201d which was in development long before the Trump administration, struck a chord with viewers concerned about women\u2019s rights, and its creators proudly embraced the fact that some regarded their show as eerily timely.\u201cPolitics is at the front of everybody\u2019s head, not in the back of everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d said Bruce Miller, an executive producer for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI think all of the media, including the fictional and nonfictional media, are benefiting from taking that head-on. I have been told that you don\u2019t talk about religion and politics in kind company. Well, there\u2019s no company now where you don\u2019t talk about politics these days.\u201d\u201cPeople are talking about and thinking about some serious things and things that are uncomfortable,\u201d he added. \u201cShows that directly address difficult topics are having their day in the sun.\u201dEarly reviews for the series, which had its premiere three months after the inauguration, were positive, and it has been the show of the year for many TV critics.Hulu\u2019s marketing department took no chances. The streaming service bought its first-ever Super Bowl ad for an original series, even though the event was months before the premiere. And throughout the year, Hulu hired actresses to don red capes like characters in the show, and circulate in cities like Austin (during the South by Southwest Festival), New York, Los Angeles and Washington to create word-of-mouth buzz.Because Hulu does not release viewership data, it is impossible to know how popular \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d was, but it was far more successful than its previous iteration. In 1990, the novel was adapted into a feature film that was a flop at the box office and did not receive warm reviews.\u201cWe got a Trump bump!\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a producer behind both the movie and the TV show. \u201cTiming is everything. If we didn\u2019t have the president we have now, I don\u2019t know if it would have been this successful.\u201dMs. Atwood underscored that point as well.\u201cI wrote it in 1985,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some incredulity then: \u2018Margaret, you\u2019re way over the top! it could never happen here.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t hear any of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Alaska\u2019s Far-Flung Villages, Happiness Is a Cake Mix", "Date": "2017-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAMBELL, Alaska \u2014 In a modest boardinghouse on an Alaskan island just 30 miles across the sea from Russia, a handwritten order form hangs on the refrigerator. There are photos of cakes a few women in this village can make for you: rectangles of yellow cake and devil\u2019s food enrobed in buttercream, with local nicknames piped out in pink.\u201cHappy Birthday Bop-Bop,\u201d one reads. Another, \u201cHappy Birthday Siti-Girl.\u201dTraveling out here, where huge bones from bowhead whales litter the beach, takes a 90-minute jet ride north from Anchorage and another hour by small plane over the Bering Sea. In this vast, wild part of America, accessible only by water or air, there may not be plumbing or potable water, the local store may not carry perishables and people may have to rely on caribou or salmon or bearded seal meat to stay fed.But no matter where you go, you will always find a cake-mix cake.Elsewhere, the American appetite for packaged baking mixes is waning, according to the market research firm Mintel, as consumers move away from packaged foods with artificial ingredients and buy more from in-store bakeries and specialty pastry shops. Yet in the small, mostly indigenous communities that dot rural Alaska, box cake is a stalwart staple, the star of every community dessert table and a potent fund-raising tool.\u201cCake mixes are the center of our little universe,\u201d said Cynthia Erickson, who owns the only grocery store in Tanana, an Athabascan village of 300 along the Yukon River in central Alaska. \u201cI have four damn shelves full.\u201dEating in rural Alaska is all about managing the expense and scarcity of store-bought food while trying to take advantage of seasonally abundant wild foods. Cash economies are weak, utilities and fuel are expensive and many families live below the federal poverty line.To offset the cost of living, Alaska Natives here rely on traditional practices of hunting, fishing and gathering, known as \u201csubsistence.\u201d In a good year, they fill freezers with moose, berries, caribou, salmon or marine mammals, depending on where they live. In a bad year, they have to buy more from the store.The offerings in village stores often resemble those in the mini-marts or bodegas of America\u2019s urban food deserts, at two and three times the price. Food journeys in via jet, small plane and barge. Milk and eggs spoil fast. Produce gets roughed up. Among the Hostess doughnuts, Spam and soda, cake mix is one of the few items on shelves everywhere that require actual cooking.As a result, tricking out mixes has become a cottage industry, and many villages have a \u201ccake lady\u201d with her signature twist. Some bake as a hobby, while others do a brisk business selling cakes in places where getting to a bakery requires a plane ticket.In the far north, bakers make cake with fondant photo prints of Inupiat whaling crews and serve it with mikigaq, fermented whale meat. On the western coast, mixes may be prepared with sea gull eggs. In the interior, pineapple upside-down cake is eaten with a salad made of lard, sugar, berries and whitefish. Fund-raisers known as cake walks \u2014 a variation on musical chairs \u2014 pay for coffins, support people through chemotherapy and send whole basketball teams to the Lower 48.\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t have a lot of the stuff to make a regular cake,\u201d said Ms. Erickson, who frequently bakes for St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Church. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have butter or you don\u2019t have milk.\u201dBut with one substitution or another, you can always make a mix cake. Mayonnaise can take the place of an egg. Some recipes call for nothing but a mix and a bottle of Sprite. The Whole Foods crowd may judge it, she said, but where she lives it makes sense.In Unalakleet, 300 miles west of Tanana on Norton Sound, Donna Erickson (no relation to Cynthia) is a noted cake lady. Her most famous creation was born in a rush to get to a community potluck. She made a white cake and poured it into a sheet pan because she knew it would bake quickly.\u201cI mixed orange Jell-O with two cups of bright orange salmonberries. I poured it on top of that cake and I threw it in the fridge,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were just like, \u2018Wow, can you make that again for me?\u2019 \u201dRural Alaska has some of the highest rates of accidental death and suicide in the country. When there is tragedy in Unalakleet, bakers bring cakes to the school multipurpose room and lay them on a big table with corresponding numbers. Popular flavors include salmonberry, tundra blueberry and low-bush cranberry.Then the cake walk begins: People buy a ticket, then circle the table while music plays. When it stops, somebody draws a number out of an old coffee can. The person standing by the corresponding cake wins that one and the money goes toward healing someone\u2019s family, Donna Erickson said.\u201cIt\u2019s a festive environment even though it\u2019s a sad time,\u201d she added. \u201cYou should see the cakes; they are so beautiful. Village bakers are so brilliant.\u201dIn America\u2019s northernmost town, Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), the baker Mary Patkotak is an expert at gaming cake economics. She uses Betty Crocker triple chocolate fudge mix for her famous cherry-chocolate cake. In the village store, it costs $4.59 a box. On Amazon, where Ms. Patkotak orders it, it\u2019s $1.29. Alaska\u2019s many weather delays mean the mix never shows up on time, but she doesn\u2019t care because it qualifies her for partial refunds on her annual Prime membership.\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I paid the Amazon Prime fee,\u201d she said.She bakes when she knows a payday is coming around. She ships cakes and cupcakes to out-of-town customers who order from her Facebook page, freezing them and tucking them into the cargo hold of a small plane. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any bakeries. We have very few restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople really crave the fresh cake.\u201dLast winter, Cynthia Erickson snowmobiled an old propane stove to her summer hunting camp, 50 miles northwest of Tanana on the Tozitna River. It fell apart on the way, but her husband wired it back together. She fired it up and slid in a chocolate cake.It\u2019s a simple thing, making a cake from a box, but when you\u2019re doing it at 30 degrees below zero in Alaska, you feel rich, she said.\u201cI was, like, the camp queen!\u201d she said. \u201cMiddle of nowhere, eating cake.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Isn\u2019t Your Toddler Paying the Mortgage?", "Date": "2017-09-27", "News": "Supported byMila and Emma Stauffer, 2-year-old twin sisters who live with their parents and three older siblings near Phoenix, were sitting on the floor, having a discussion about what they might be when they grow up. \u201cMaybe a teacher?\u201d Emma said.\u201cEmma, you hate kids!\u201d Mila said.\u201cHow about a doctor,\u201d Emma suggested.\u201cEmma, you hate blood,\u201d her sister said.\u201cOy yep, I hate blood,\u201d Emma said.Mila and Emma are two breakthrough stars of a new class of social media celebrities: young children who appear in viral videos. In many of the most popular clips, these whippersnappers engage in adultlike conversations, amusingly given their babyish voices. The videos can be incredibly popular. And marketers have noticed.Mila and Emma have done advertising work for Amazon, Nest, Dollar Rental Car, Macy\u2019s and Walmart, among other companies. They\u2019re flying to New York in October to shoot video spoofs of movies including \u201cClueless\u201d and \u201cMean Girls\u201d for Harper\u2019s Bazaar.\u201cIt is really lucrative,\u201d said Katie Stauffer, their mother. \u201cBut I wish people knew that this is my job now.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t detail exactly how much money the children are bringing in, but she said she was recently able to leave her position as an escrow officer after 12 years, much to the relief of herself and her husband, a doctor. With her working outside the home, \u201cmy kids weren\u2019t getting what they needed,\u201d she said.Still, Ms. Stauffer often gets criticized in the comments of her Instagram feed, where people frequently remark on the food she lets her children eat and the brands she takes money from. After a sponsored post for a brand of chicken, \u201cwe got a lot of flak,\u201d she said.And the talent can be difficult. Emma doesn\u2019t love making videos, and Mila wants to make them only when she wants. Ms. Stauffer has stopped cutting deals with companies that insist on giving her deadlines. \u201cYou can\u2019t make 2-year-olds do anything,\u201d she said.Instead she stages photo shoots many times a week, during which the girls do relaxed toddler things: make princess cakes; drag dolls dressed like the twins; or sit in wagons while having staring contests in front of the family\u2019s stately red-doored home.Kaitlin often cues the children their more sophisticated lines. In one recent video, Mila addresses a date with her friend Sawyer that went boringly wrong when he paid more attention to his sports league than to her.\u201cFantasy football?\u201d Mila said, while raising her palm talk-to-the-hand style. \u201cSo basic.\u201d\u201cKids are the new social influencer,\u201d he said. He is not a parent himself, but he understands the instinct to seize on corporate offers when they arise. \u201cKids grow up and become less relevant. The sweet spot is between 2 and 4,\u201d after which, Mr. Smith said, \u201cthey\u2019re not that cute.\u201dHe has also teamed up with Korbin Jackson, a 3-year-old from Dothan, Ala., who is best known for his soccer and Ping-Pong ball trick shot videos.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to work with kids, but it\u2019s fun,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Ten of Korbin\u2019s videos have been featured on ESPN, and he has been interviewed by news stations in Japan and Romania. His Instagram feed has nearly 65,000 followers.Born with a disability, Korbin spent two and a half years doing physical therapy. \u201cHe finds so much joy and happiness in life, and we are so proud to share his good energy,\u201d said his mother, Stephanie Jackson.She said when Korbin arrives at school with his father, the older children surround him and ask to take selfies with the local celebrity. \u201cWhen Korbin gets to high school, his following will be huge,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Instagram just set him up for greatness.\u201dKorbin receives a lot of free stuff in the mail, and his parents often tag the brands in posts. Unsolicited, Ms. Jackson said, GoPro sent about $2,000 worth of camera equipment. Many sportswear companies send packages. Korbin\u2019s feed frequently promotes Under Armour. \u201cThey send him boxes once a month,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paper deal, it\u2019s not a contract, they are inspired by him.\u201dAware of the existence of online predators, she tries to limit the number of people who know the family\u2019s home address. \u201cWe do get weird emails and DMs like \u2018We will meet him no matter what you say,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Laws that regulate children\u2019s rights to money earned by parents using their images on social media aren\u2019t clear, lawyers say. In California, the so-called Coogan Law \u2014 named for the child star Jackie Coogan, who worked with Charlie Chaplin in \u201cThe Kid\u201d \u2014 mandates that a portion of money earned by child actors be placed in trust for the children.There are plenty of parents eager to jump in. Destiny Bennett and her husband, Devonte, moved to Los Angeles earlier this year and decided that acting would be a good career for their son Caidyn, 4.But when he didn\u2019t get the audition callbacks that his parents had hoped for, they decided to try marketing his talents through videos posted to Instagram and YouTube. \u201cWe told him, \u2018We can do our own auditions, and you can talk about anything you want.\u2019\u201dMs. Bennett says Caidyn is not yet sure if he will continue to focus on making viral videos, or the clothing line that she says he is preparing with his brother, who is 1.\u201cWe are a family of entrepreneurs,\u201d she said.Josh Gaines, known on social media as \u201cJosh Darnit,\u201d previously used the six-second video loop platform Vine, which was introduced on Twitter in 2013, to post videos of his children, most successfully his young son Evan smacking his dad. Making Vine videos was easy, he said, and he could repackage them on YouTube to generate revenue in addition to sponsorships.When Vine shut down in 2016, Mr. Gaines recalibrated his focus on videos for Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. These videos require more production resources. Evan, now 7, has grown bored. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like about doing them is they take a superlong time, and sometimes Dad tells me to say hard words. Like \u2018subscribe,\u2019\u201d Evan said.Fortunately, his older sister, Johnna, 11, has stepped up. \u201cOnce we got to that age that Evan resisted a lot, I shifted more to my daughter,\u201d Mr. Gaines said. \u201cShe is a little workhorse.\u201dImprovised videos are easier. \u201cI like to be in the spotlight,\u201d Johnna said. \u201cIf we have to do a script and Dad is telling us what to say, like an ad for a toy, or when we were doing the ones for the drones that had a script, that felt more like work.\u201dFor a deal he cut with Best Buy, Mr. Gaines enticed Evan and Johnna to spend their last week of summer vacation taking a road trip to a Nintendo World Championship qualifiers, which were taking place at a few Best Buy stores.On the trip, Mr. Gaines would post pictures and videos to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Each of the children got a new Nintendo Switch game system, he said.He and his wife, Sarah, said they don\u2019t pay the children or split revenue with them. The family\u2019s standard of living is improved when the social media business is going well, and all members benefit, they said.Best Buy wanted to team with the \u201cDarnit Family\u201d because they have broad reach across many digital platforms and are known for family fun. \u201cThey are on a road trip as a family and are having fun through Best Buy, and that\u2019s exactly the message we want people to get excited about,\u201d said Shane Kitzman, a Best Buy spokesman. He would not disclose any financial details about the partnership.Ms. Ryan didn\u2019t realize that Ava\u2019s proclivity to create characters and do deadpan impersonations of them would attract a wider audience.Thanks to the ad revenue she earns via YouTube, Ms. Ryan said she is able to be a stay-at-home mother.The video has been viewed 35 million times across various Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine Facebook pages, according to Anne Sachs, W\u2019s executive digital director.Though Ava writes her ideas for video in a journal and will ask to do them regularly, \u201csometimes I tell her, \u2018Let\u2019s just got to the park instead of doing a video right now,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ryan said. \u201cThis is like her little side project in life. She\u2019s happy and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201dMr. Fenty has done mash-ups of him \u201cFaceTiming\u201d with youngsters in viral videos, including Mila. As she described her experience of visiting a preschool (\u201cThe kids are insane, throwing staplers, pooping everywhere!\u201d) Mr. Fenty appears in the bottom left corner of the screen, shaking his head in sympathy and horror. (\u201cWhat? Ohmaga!\u201d)\u201cKids are entertaining, they don\u2019t care what anyone thinks,\u201d Mr. Fenty said in a phone interview. \u201cThere used to be a show called \u2018Kids Say the Darndest Things.\u2019 This is it today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shades of Noir: My Hunt for an Eclipse Glasses Villain", "Date": "2017-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI found counterfeits in a country store in a small town in New Hampshire,\u201d said Rick Fienberg, a press officer at the American Astronomical Society who became a sort of glasses safety referee in the weeks leading up to the eclipse. \u201cIf they reached there, they reached everywhere.\u201d\u201cATTENTION DO NOT USE OUR GLASSES,\u201d a sign declared.It was unclear who \u201cour\u201d referred to, as the space above was eerily blank and Rod\u2019s, the building behind the sign, was boarded up. Perhaps if I found the author of the warning, and followed the supply chain, I could find at least one person to blame for the inescapable, joy-killing sense that no matter where we bought our glasses, our retinas were about to be toast.A few hours before totality, a man at a nearby carwash pointed me through a suds-filled tunnel toward an auto repair shop. Veronique Ford, a clerk at the family-owned EZ Quick Lube, confirmed the glasses cited in the sign were theirs. They sold around 800 at three to five dollars each.Pasted to the counter, was an email from the man who sold them the glasses, which included what looked like a certification number.But then a customer called. The \u201cscore\u201d was not right.\u201cNow we\u2019re like, how do we know if he\u2019s telling the truth or not?\u201d said Mrs. Ford\u2019s boss, Carol Bishop, noting that the vendor had previously provided them with branded shirts.A Spirit Pack employee checked the certificate that had come with the glasses and saw it did not match the ad, instead listing a certificate number of 12312-1. When he followed up with the vendor, Global Promos Service, a woman told him that the glasses were safe. It was just an older certification. He said he believed her.But the problem was not about old certificates, it was about ineffective protection from sun exposure. And this is the part where we have to talk about federal regulations specific to eclipse glasses. In fact, there are none.Glasses claiming an ISO certification of 12312-2 transmit \u201cless than 0.003 percent of the incident light\u201d so as to safely allow direct viewing of the sun, Dr. Chou said. Filters with the 12312-1 certification are intended for sunglasses and generally transmit \u201cno less than 15 percent of incident light.\u201dIt\u2019s the difference between 0.003 percent and 15 percent that had many worried the week before the eclipse. While a quick glance at the sun through 12312-1 glasses might be O.K., \u201cextended exposures through such tinted lenses could result in solar retinopathy,\u201d said Dr. Chou.Several weeks before the eclipse, as reports of suspicious glasses surfaced, \u201cAmazon took down virtually every storefront selling eclipse glasses, including ones from legitimate manufacturers and their authorized dealers,\u201d said Dr. Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society. The company then sent emails to many customers warning them that they may have received eclipse glasses that couldn\u2019t be verified as safe.When Amazon issued its recall, the company yanked the entire product page, and sent emails to Mr. Panjwani\u2019s customers as well, even though they had received legitimate Baader glasses.In a statement to The New York Times, an Amazon spokesman said:\u201cOut of an abundance of caution and in the interests of our customers, we asked third-party sellers that were offering solar eclipse glasses to provide documentation to verify their products were compliant with relevant safety standards. After reviewing the documentation, the offers from sellers with compliant eclipse glasses remained available to customers. The listings from sellers who were not approved were removed and customers who purchased from them were notified.\u201dMr. Panjwani said he submitted proper documentation three times. He said that Amazon did reinstate the page, only to pull it again, and then reinstate it again, leaving him with an inbox full of confused and angry emails.\u201cAmazon could have addressed it earlier and more carefully instead of making everyone into a bad guy and freaking out the country out in the process,\u201d he said.Dr. Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society agreed that Amazon exacerbated confusion by failing to vet eclipse products earlier. Initially he estimated that the recall cost legitimate vendors millions in profits. In a statement to The Times, Amazon said the company would cover the cost of refunds for sellers with proper certification. This includes Agena AstroProducts.But for Steven W. Teppler of the Abbott Law Group, who is co-lead counsel in the two eclipse glasses lawsuits, the issue is much broader. If one cannot trust an Amazon listing, he said, \u201cWhat comfort can you get from the representation of anything you buy online?\u201dAs Mr. Panjwani, observed, the fraudsters are not going away. Even so, their motivations are a mystery to him: \u201cWhy would you risk bodily harm and injury to someone else for so little profit?\u201dI was hoping to ask this question to the people at Global Promos Service.As I parked near their address in Los Angeles, I knew that Spirit Pack\u2019s main contact, Fiona Rjrr as her name appeared in email, was in China that week. She\u2019d told me this in an exchange, which ended when I clarified that I was a reporter from The New York Times, not a buyer of eclipse glasses.Certainly there would be someone else to take my questions. Except there wasn\u2019t. Because the address, as listed in the Distributor Central directory, did not exist.I pulled up the company website, which offered an address that was one digit different. Aha \u2014 so it was just a typo. Except the suite was vacant.I emailed Ms. Rjrr \u2014 and no, that is probably not her last name \u2014 for clarification about whether there was another office somewhere in California.\u201cSorry, I have no comment to make,\u201d she responded.He also pointed out that there is little incentive for a Chinese manufacturer to go through the expensive, time-consuming process of getting certification for a rare event, even if the product could pass the test. In fact, one dealer that did product testing on suspicious eclipse glasses manufactured in China found that they were safe, but \u201cone actually failed to comply with ISO 12312-2 because its filters were too dark!\u201d said Dr. Fienberg over email.I called Ms. Ford of EZ Quick Lube to share my findings. A longtime Republican, skeptical of government regulation, she said that the experience reminded her of its occasional value.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have boundaries or there is chaos,\u201d she observed.But she could not identify a clear villain.\u201cWe trusted someone else who in turned trusted someone else,\u201d she concluded, \u201cso I think there is some fault in each step.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the different amounts of light blocked by glasses with two different ISO certifications. It is the difference between 0.003 percent and 15 percent, not the difference between .0003 and 15 percent.Advertisement"}
