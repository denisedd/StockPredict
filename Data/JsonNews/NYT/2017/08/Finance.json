{"Headline": "Does Qatar Support Extremism? Yes. And So Does Saudi Arabia.", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The spat between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which is accusing Qatar of supporting Islamist extremism and terrorism, remains perplexing. Perplexing not because Qatar is innocent \u2014 it has sponsored and hosted far too many jihadists for anyone to plausibly claim otherwise \u2014 but because it is the Saudis who are objecting to the funding of extremism. Qatar should be called out, but preferably by those who haven\u2019t spent quite so much time and money advancing extremism themselves.To be clear, it is not that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been directly funding terrorist organizations, and certainly not in Western countries. What has been happening for many years now, however, is that a set of beliefs has been advanced from Saudi Arabia that is, by any standard, extremist. The Wahhabi-Salafi belief system is one of religious supremacism, in which the very notion of man-made law, let alone democratic government, is derided.These beliefs create a worldview that is illiberal, intolerant and hostile to the West and promote a mind-set that makes adherents far more susceptible to the rhetoric of violent Islamist groups and preachers. So, even as several leading European governments have sought to promote tolerance and gender equality, there has been a relentless flow into their countries of funding for the promotion of intolerance and the incitement of hatred.Through the provision of generous scholarships and stipends, a generation of Muslim religious figures traveled from Western countries to Saudi Arabia to be trained in the Wahhabi ideology at institutions like the Islamic University of Medina. Among its alumni is Abu Usamah at-Thahabi, who has preached in British mosques, promoting holy war and the killing of gay men and apostates. Similarly, Sheikh Abdullah el-Faisal, who attended Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, has advocated the extermination of unbelievers.Saudi clerics, too, have visited the West to bring the same message. They include the cleric Muhammad al-Arifi, who has said that \u201cMuslims have no life without jihad\u201d and who has been linked to a number of Islamic State recruits from Britain.Facing such extensive Saudi financial support for Islamic literalism and extremely conservative practices, progressive and moderate Muslim voices in Western countries are often drowned out in their communities and places of worship. Fledgling progressive circles trying to develop a more liberal approach to Islamic scriptures can never hope to match the support the Wahhabi-Salafi vision of the religion has received.The Saudis insist they have not been supporting extremism, but these protestations of innocence are difficult to take seriously given the names of some of the institutions involved, such as the Islamic Saudi Academy in Alexandria, Va. Apologists for the kingdom sometimes argue that there is a distinction between what private Saudi institutions do and what the government does. Yet the notion that major institutions based in the gulf states could operate for decades without the blessing of their authoritarian rulers is hardly plausible.The more this Saudi version of Islam is advanced in Europe, the more such isolation and exclusion will become entrenched. Perhaps the European country that has taken this issue most seriously is Austria. In 2015, Vienna enacted legislation that blocked the foreign funding of mosques and imams. Austria\u2019s foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, was candid about the objective: The government wanted to stop certain Muslim countries from exerting financial influence, to \u201cgive Islam the chance to develop freely within our society and in line with our common European values.\u201dThe funding of extremism in the West is by no means an exclusively Saudi phenomenon. Qatar and Iran have played decisive parts, too. The international spotlight on Qatar\u2019s financing of extremism and terrorism is long overdue, but it should not distract from the Saudis\u2019 own spreading of hateful and bigoted beliefs. Given the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorism, Western governments must keep asking their Saudi allies tough questions about their support for this poisonous ideology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lobbyist at Trump Campaign Meeting Has a Web of Russian Connections", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian immigrant who met last summer with senior Trump campaign officials, has often struck colleagues as a classic Washington mercenary \u2014 loyal to his wife, his daughter and his bank account. He avoided work that would antagonize Moscow, they suggested, only because he profited from his reputation as a man with valuable connections there.But interviews with his associates and documents reviewed by The New York Times indicate that Mr. Akhmetshin, who is under scrutiny by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, has much deeper ties to the Russian government and Kremlin-backed oligarchs than previously known.He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage. He helped federal prosecutors bring corruption charges against an American businessman in the former Soviet Union who turned out to be working for the C.I.A.He also helped expose possible corruption in government contracting that complicated American efforts to keep troops at an air base in Kyrgyzstan \u2014 an American presence that the Russians fiercely opposed.In short, Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s projects over two decades in Washington routinely advanced the Kremlin\u2019s interests, especially after he became an American citizen in 2009. American counterintelligence agents took notice of his activities, but drew no conclusions about where his allegiances lay, according to a former law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing government secrecy rules.Ronald J. McNamara, a former staff member of the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe who met with Mr. Akhmetshin about Central Asian issues, said Mr. Akhmetshin openly alluded to involvement with Russian intelligence. \u201cMy understanding was that he had come from the security agencies in the Soviet Union-Russian Federation,\u201d Mr. McNamara said. \u201cHe did not make it a secret.\u201dMr. Akhmetshin, 49, said he is no Russian spy. \u201cI am the target of a well-coordinated and financed smear campaign,\u201d he said last month in a text message to The Times.Keenly intelligent, relentlessly charming and assiduously opaque about his work, Mr. Akhmetshin sometimes referred to his contacts by pseudonyms and collected his salary in stacks of hundred-dollar bills. A trained biochemist who speaks four languages, he described himself on one official document as a \u201chousehusband. \u201d He identified himself as the head of a Washington think tank for years after it was officially dissolved.\u201cI think he works for us. I don\u2019t think he works for them,\u201d said Lanny Wiles, a veteran Republican political operative who has worked with Mr. Akhmetshin for more than 15 years. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what he really does.\u201dBorn in Kazan, Russia, about 500 miles east of Moscow, Rinat Rafkatovitch Akhmetshin was drafted at age 18 into the Soviet army\u2019s war against Afghanistan. He served from 1986 to 1988 and again in 1991. He described himself on his visa application for the United States as a sergeant who rose to the rank of lieutenant in the military police, specializing in communications. He told some journalists that he worked with a military counterintelligence unit, but said he never joined Russian intelligence services \u2014 unlike his father, sister and godfather.In 1992 he graduated with honors from Kazan Federal University, and two years later arrived in Washington as a graduate student in chemistry at the Catholic University of America. He married a fellow Russian chemistry student and received his Ph.D. But he immediately abandoned his esoteric study of mechanistic enzymes and burrowed into Washington\u2019s foreign lobbying scene, promoting clients from Russia and former Soviet states.He never formally studied English, he said, or owned a car: He pedaled about Washington on a bright orange bicycle. But he was witty and erudite, a lover of literature, opera and snowboarding. Matthew Bryza, a former staff member in charge of Central Asia issues at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, remembers Mr. Akhmetshin as \u201cvery smart, slick guy\u201d serving as \u201cthe paid drone of unsavory, out-of-fashion former Soviet leaders looking to launder their reputations.\u201d\u201cHe would boast about ties and experience in Soviet intelligence and counterintelligence to give himself some cachet and make himself a mystery man,\u201d he said.Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s gateway to Washington was Edward Lieberman, a lawyer with corporate and political clients in former Soviet countries who was married to President Bill Clinton\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Evelyn S. Lieberman, who died in 2015. He called Mr. Lieberman, who could not be reached for comment, a personal adviser.Together the two started the Eurasian Institute for Economic and Political Research. Supposedly set up to promote democratic reforms in former Soviet states, it was essentially a vehicle to burnish the reputation of one client, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, an ex-K.G.B. officer and the former prime minister of Kazakhstan. Mr. Kazhegeldin had fled under a cloud of corruption charges and was seeking Washington\u2019s support to challenge his rival, Kazakhstan\u2019s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev.Mr. Akhmetshin worked to undercut his client\u2019s rival by funneling information to American prosecutors pursuing bribery charges against James Giffen, an American businessman close to the Kazakh president, according to people involved with the case. The prosecutors discovered only belatedly that Mr. Giffen had worked for the C.I.A. in the former Soviet Union.By 2005 the government of another former Soviet republic, Kyrgyzstan, had hired Mr. Akhmetshin to investigate whether Washington had bribed the family of the country\u2019s former president to keep an American air base there. The Manas base, established as a staging ground for American forces in Afghanistan, was a major source of friction with the Russians.In an affidavit that year, Mr. Akhmetshin said he worked closely with the American government about the location of the base. But Thomas Graham, the National Security Council\u2019s Russia specialist from 2002 to 2007, said the controversy put Washington on the defensive. \u201cLooking into allegations of fraud or bribery \u2014 anything that would complicate our presence at that air base \u2014 was in Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d he said.Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s work took him back and forth to Europe more than once a month, on trips lasting a few days each. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is now chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has sought to determine whether his travel pattern raised concerns among immigration officials who approved Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s application for American citizenship in 2009.Once naturalized, Mr. Akhmetshin began traveling regularly to Moscow and taking on more overtly pro-Russian projects. The new work led him into legal entanglements, the halls of Congress and eventually Trump Tower.Few episodes from Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s past seem more relevant to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation than his work for two Russian billionaires accused of infiltrating their adversaries\u2019 computers during nasty legal battles.The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. There is no public evidence that Mr. Akhmetshin played any role in the D.N.C. hack.The first hacking case, which has not previously been reported, began when Mr. Akhmetshin served an alliance of businessmen led by Suleiman Kerimov \u2014 a financier close to Mr. Putin in a commercial and political dispute with a Russian competitor, Ashot Egiazaryan.In early 2011, two London lawyers on Mr. Egiazaryan\u2019s team separately received suspicious emails and hired forensic experts to scrutinize them, according to people involved in a Scotland Yard investigation. The experts found that the messages concealed spyware meant to infiltrate their computers, and they fed traceable documents into the spyware that were then opened by computers registered at the Moscow office park of one of Mr. Kerimov\u2019s companies.After an inquiry of more than 18 months, Scotland Yard investigators concluded in January 2013 that they lacked sufficient evidence to bring any charges, a spokesman said. Representatives of the lawyers targeted declined to comment.Mr. Akhmetshin has said in court papers that he was paid only by one businessman in the alliance with Mr. Kerimov, but coordinated with Mr. Kerimov\u2019s team.Two years later, hacking accusations arose in another case, this time lodged directly against Mr. Akhmetshin. He worked as a consultant to a law firm representing EuroChem, a fertilizer and mining company controlled by another Russian billionaire close to Mr. Putin \u2014 Andrey Melnichenko. Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s target was a rival mining company, International Mineral Resources.Within months, documents stored in International Mineral Resources\u2019s computer systems began surfacing outside the company, leaked to journalists and others. The company concluded that its computers had been hacked, and replaced its servers. In lawsuits filed in federal court in Washington and state court in New York, the company accused EuroChem and Mr. Akhmetshin of computer espionage.EuroChem\u2019s information technology chief, Vladimir Chibisov, previously worked in the Russian government. He had written a book promoted as \u201ca hacker\u2019s Bible,\u201d which he described as a book \u201cabout us \u2014 about Russian programmers, men of the \u201980s and \u201990s\u201d who \u201chad done programming, and even a bit of hacking.\u201dMr. Akhmetshin personally handed a thumb drive containing stolen documents to a lawyer engaged in another matter potentially damaging to the rival company, according to a person familiar with the matter. The same thumb drive was later obtained by investigators, and someone using the initials \u201cR.A.\u201d had gained access to its contents, according to court papers.A spokesman for Mr. Melnichenko said in a statement that he has never condoned hacking or other illegal activity, nor had he ever met or known Mr. Akhmetshin. The spokesman said Mr. Chibisov\u2019s book was \u201ctongue in cheek\u201d and \u201ccannot possibly be taken seriously.\u201dAn investigator for the targeted company also testified that he had followed Mr. Akhmetshin in January 2014 to a meeting at London\u2019s Cafe Royal and watched him hand over an external hard drive to another individual. He said he had overheard Mr. Akhmetshin claim that he had paid a team of Russian hackers \u201ca lot of money\u201d for the records.Mr. Akhmetshin acknowledged in a deposition that he had turned over a hard drive with information about the firm\u2019s owners. But he said he had obtained the data from a Kazakh contact through a loose network he called the \u201cLondon Information Bazaar.\u201d Asked about computer hacking, he replied, \u201cI do not know a single person who could do that.\u201dInternational Mineral Resources dropped the lawsuits without explanation in early 2016, withdrawing all allegations before they could be adjudicated. The company said in a statement Friday that it dropped the charges \u201cafter careful consideration.\u201dDuring the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia\u2019s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.From 2009 to 2014, Mr. Ivanov led the Russian side of a joint effort with the Americans to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan, part of an early Obama administration initiative to improve relations between Moscow and Washington.When Mr. Ivanov traveled to Washington to promote the effort in October 2010, Mr. Akhmetshin helped shepherd him around town. In a deposition filed in one of the hacking cases, Mr. Ahkmetshin testified that he helped facilitate the Washington visit with one of Mr. Ivanov\u2019s aides, with whom he had served in the Red Army.In an affidavit in that same case, Mr. Akhmetshin said he had been in email contact with Mr. Ivanov on matters ranging \u201cfrom narco-trafficking and terrorism in Afghanistan to surveillance of undercover agents, suspected undercover agents and their identities.\u201dReporters who encountered Mr. Akhmetshin during his travels to Afghanistan said he grew a beard and wore a skullcap to blend in with the local population. He never identified whom he worked for, but two former American officials involved with the counternarcotics program said the American side did not hire him.Mr. Ivanov, who retired early last year, could not be reached for comment about whether Mr. Akhmetshin was on the Russian government\u2019s payroll.Russia ended the counternarcotics cooperation in 2014 after the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. Ivanov and other Putin allies in retaliation for Russia\u2019s invasion and seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region.There, too, Mr. Akhmetshin had tried to ally with Ukraine\u2019s pro-Moscow elements. Before the 2014 invasion, he told reporters, he unsuccessfully sought consulting work with the political party dominated by the nation\u2019s pro-Putin president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. A popular revolt forced Mr. Yanukovych to flee to Russia.Mr. Akhmetshin told journalists that he was a longtime acquaintance of Paul J. Manafort, who served as a high-paid consultant to Mr. Yanukovych for years before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort, said, \u201cPaul doesn\u2019t know and hasn\u2019t worked with the man.\u201dLast year, Mr. Akhmetshin took on a new project high on the Kremlin\u2019s agenda: a $240,000 lobbying campaign to amend the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on Russians for human rights abuses. The law was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian tax lawyer who died in custody after he uncovered a $230 million tax fraud allegedly tied to Russian officials. Several wealthy Russian businessmen financed a nonprofit group to spearhead the campaign, which was represented by Mr. Akhmetshin and a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya.Donald J. Trump Jr. has said the promise of damaging information about Hillary Clinton was just an excuse for Ms. Veselnitskaya to get into Trump Tower to talk about why the law should be changed. Mr. Akhmetshin, a Washington resident, has told reporters that he just happened to be lunching with Ms. Veselnitskaya in Manhattan that day when she spontaneously invited him to the meeting with the president\u2019s son, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Mr. Manafort. He did not explain why she wanted him there.After Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s presence came to light, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters: \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about this person.\u201dAn article on Monday about a Russian immigrant who met last summer with senior Trump campaign officials referred incorrectly to the location of Kazan, Russia. It is 500 miles east of Moscow, not west.Sharon LaFraniere and Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London. Andrew E. Kramer and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow, and Michael S. Schmidt and Eileen Sullivan from Washington. Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How This U.S. Tech Giant Is Backing China\u2019s Tech Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Chinese government develops drones, the American technology giant Qualcomm is helping. The same goes for artificial intelligence, mobile technology and supercomputers. Qualcomm is also working to help Chinese companies like Huawei break into overseas markets in support of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands.Qualcomm is providing money, expertise and engineering for Beijing\u2019s master plan to create its own technology superpowers.Big American companies fiercely protect their intellectual property and trade secrets, fearful of giving an edge to rivals. But they have little choice in China \u2014 and Washington is looking on with alarm.To gain access to the Chinese market, American companies are being forced to transfer technology, create joint ventures, lower prices and aid homegrown players. Those efforts form the backbone of President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious plan to ensure that China\u2019s companies, military and government dominate core areas of technology like artificial intelligence and semiconductors.Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are working with Chinese companies to develop server chips, creating rivals to their own product. Intel is working with the Chinese to build high-end mobile chips, in competition with Qualcomm. IBM has agreed to transfer valuable technology that could enable China to break into the lucrative mainframe banking business.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of unease in Washington,\u201d said James Lewis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThe defense, intelligence agencies and others are concerned that advanced chip-making capabilities are going to China.\u201dQualcomm declined to comment, as did Intel.Qualcomm is caught in the middle.The world\u2019s dominant mobile phone chip maker, Qualcomm ran afoul of the Chinese government, getting hit in 2015 with a record $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior. To get back in Beijing\u2019s good graces, the company agreed to lower its prices in China, promised to shift more of its high-end manufacturing to partners in China, and pledged to upgrade the country\u2019s technology capabilities.The extent of Qualcomm\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government \u2014 and the complications for American tech giants \u2014 is seen in a low-slung office building in the southwest part of the country. There, a team of engineers is developing leading-edge microchips to compete with the finest made by Intel. The chips will help power a huge data and cloud center with the potential to strengthen the country\u2019s computing capabilities. No longer content to rely on buying the chips that go into cellphones, computers and cars, China now wants to design and build the brains that drive much of the digital world.The government is providing land and financing to the start-up formed with Qualcomm, called Huaxintong Semiconductor. Qualcomm has provided the technology and about $140 million in initial funding.\u201cQualcomm has a balancing act,\u201d said Willy Shih, who teaches at Harvard Business School. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s PCs are made in China, and most of the world\u2019s smartphones too, so they have to play along. It\u2019s a fact of life.\u201dQualcomm was early to break into China.In the mid-1990s, as China\u2019s economy began to boom, President Bill Clinton pressed the country\u2019s leaders to open to American technology companies.Members of the Clinton administration, including Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce, were dispatched to Beijing to hammer out the details. They pushed for one company by name: Qualcomm.\u201cAt the time, they were the only U.S. show in town,\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said.\u201cBill Daley and I pushed the Chinese hard on accepting the U.S. standard for wireless technology,\u201d she added, \u201cand that was Qualcomm.\u201dMobile phone adoption was taking off globally, largely backed by a European wireless standard called G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications. Qualcomm had a competing American standard called C.D.M.A., or Code Division Multiple Access.Irwin M. Jacobs, a founder of Qualcomm, spearheaded an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington and Beijing, promoting the technology\u2019s potential to transform wireless communication markets.\u201cWe knew China would be important, and they didn\u2019t have their own system,\u201d said Perry LaForge, a former Qualcomm executive. \u201cWe also told them this system would give them an opportunity to manufacture their own handsets, and not rely on buying them from other countries.\u201dWhen Qualcomm first entered China in the late 1990s, it was slow to gain traction. The company struggled to find Chinese partners to produce mobile phones that worked with its network. China also tried to develop its own wireless standard.Qualcomm eventually won out, helping write the standards for next-generation mobile technology, 3G and 4G service. The standard championed by European telecom providers faded rapidly. And China\u2019s homegrown technology struggled.By 2013, virtually every wireless device around the world was reliant on either Qualcomm\u2019s chips or its patents \u2014 enough to provide some of the technology industry\u2019s fattest profit margins.With its dominance rising, global brands like Apple and Samsung began complaining to regulators around the world, citing \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d pricing practices and high royalty fees. In China, a trade group made up of the country\u2019s major handset makers complained about patent holders levying \u201cexorbitant licensing fees.\u201d\u201cThese days a smartphone is covered by about 250,000 patents,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational center based in Honolulu. \u201cA Chinese smartphone maker needs to negotiate license agreements with companies like Qualcomm that own the essential patents.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese government was worried about this,\u201d he added. \u201cThat all these costs could constrain Chinese companies.\u201dThe raids began at dawn, in late November 2013. Investigators descended upon Qualcomm\u2019s offices in Beijing and Shanghai, questioning the staff and hauling away laptops and documents.At the time of the raids, the San Diego-based company\u2019s senior managers were at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York, attending an investor conference. The executives were planning to talk about the company\u2019s strategy. Instead, they began fielding frantic phone calls from China.The China business, which accounted for more than half of its global revenue, was in trouble.A week later, one of the country\u2019s most powerful regulatory agencies, the National Development and Reform Commission (N.D.R.C.), announced that it was looking into whether Qualcomm had abused its power in the sale of mobile phone chips. \u201cQualcomm came to control so much of the chip market in China,\u201d said Louie Ming, a former Qualcomm executive in China. \u201cIt was clear they were eventually going to run into antitrust problems.\u201dWhile Qualcomm agreed to fully cooperate with the investigation, some senior executives appealed to the Obama administration, pressing the White House to raise the issue with China\u2019s senior leaders, according to a former administration official.Qualcomm\u2019s troubles went beyond China. The company was also under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the European Union and South Korea, as well as by the United States Federal Trade Commission.China didn\u2019t back down. The head of the N.D.R.C. branded Qualcomm a monopoly.In February 2015, after a 15-month-long investigation, Qualcomm settled allegations in China that it had charged unfairly high prices for its chips and patents. The company agreed to pay the $975 million fine \u2014 about 8 percent of its annual revenue in China \u2014 and to lower the prices for chips sold in the country.\u201cWe are pleased that the resolution has removed the uncertainty surrounding our business in China, and we will now focus our full attention and resources on supporting our customers and partners in China,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.Qualcomm then went into business with the Chinese government.There was a $150 million investment fund to help Chinese start-ups; new research and design facilities set up with Chinese companies such as Huawei and Tencent; and a partnership with a Beijing-based company called Thundersoft to develop drones, virtual reality goggles and internet-connected devices.Qualcomm is also helping the Chinese government develop supercomputers, a technology the United States government has discouraged American companies from supporting overseas. In May, Qualcomm agreed to form a joint venture with other state-backed firms to design and sell mass-market smartphone chips. And to help make Chinese chip manufacturing more competitive, Qualcomm has pledged to shift more of its high-end production \u2014 long done by outside contractors in Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 to China.\u201cThis is what China does better than anyone else,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank focused on technology policy that has conducted studies detailing the Chinese government\u2019s pressure on technology companies.\u201cThey have a large carrot and a large stick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have a market no C.E.O. can walk away from.\u201dQualcomm\u2019s biggest new venture is taking shape in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou Province. Determined to leap into advanced technology, China has designated a large parcel of land in the provincial capital of Guiyang as the home of a new industrial park for supercomputing, data centers and cloud computing. The country\u2019s large state-run telecom operators and its internet behemoths, including Alibaba and Tencent, are moving in, to build massive server farms. The region offers lower energy costs and abundant supplies of water, necessary to cool server farms.A year ago, Qualcomm set up a joint venture with the Guizhou government and pledged to invest about $140 million for a minority stake in the business, situated in a development zone that has also attracted the interest of Microsoft and Dell. Qualcomm says it received American government approval for the deal.The new Qualcomm joint venture, Huaxintong Semiconductor, broke ground on the site in 2016, and now operates in a 46,000-square-foot design and engineering center. A major test of the partnership will come when the joint venture\u2019s first server chips are released \u2014 helping Qualcomm and the Chinese government stake out new ground. The Chinese government will control the chips and reap most of the profits.In late March, Qualcomm\u2019s president, Derek K. Aberle, flew to Guizhou to meet a powerful local government leader, Chen Miner, a confidant of the Chinese president. Seated in a government hall, before an enormous landscape painting, Mr. Aberle pledged to \u201ccontinually cooperate\u201d with the Chinese government.A headline last Sunday with an article about Qualcomm\u2019s efforts in China misidentified the location of the company\u2019s headquarters. It is based in San Diego, not Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fund-Raising Push by Challenger Forces de Blasio Into Primary Debates", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio will have to appear in two debates before the September primary now that his chief Democratic rival, Sal F. Albanese, has crossed the threshold of fund-raising and campaign spending needed to qualify.\u201cThe debate will provide me with the opportunity to expose de Blasio\u2019s terrible performance as mayor and generate powerful momentum for my campaign,\u201d Mr. Albanese said in an email on Friday.One hopeful, Roque de la Fuente, found himself several hundred signatures shy of the threshold to even get on the ballot. The campaign of Mr. de la Fuente, a San Diego millionaire who moved to New York City to run for mayor as a Republican, has vowed to challenge the determination, made by the Board of Elections, in federal court.Without Mr. de la Fuente, only one Republican remains on the ballot: Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who raised $83,200 during the latest period. While her campaign wanted to avoid an intraparty battle in order to focus on Mr. de Blasio, the absence of a Republican opponent means she will not receive any city matching funds for the primary period, a potentially significant sum. (The city gives a six-to-one match for the first $175 from each contributor.)\u201cAssemblymember Malliotakis doesn\u2019t believe in having a primary just to get taxpayer money to fund her race,\u201d said her campaign spokesman, Rob Ryan.

{"Headline": "McConnell, in Private, Doubts if Trump Can Save Presidency", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility, complicated by the position of Mr. McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine L. Chao, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, according to more than a dozen people briefed on their imperiled partnership. Angry phone calls and private badmouthing have devolved into open conflict, with the president threatening to oppose Republican senators who cross him, and Mr. McConnell mobilizing to their defense.A protracted government shutdown or a default on sovereign debt could be disastrous \u2014 for the economy and for the party that controls the White House and both chambers of Congress.Yet Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are locked in a political cold war. Neither man would comment for this article. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, noted that the senator and the president had \u201cshared goals,\u201d and pointed to \u201ctax reform, infrastructure, funding the government, not defaulting on the debt, passing the defense authorization bill.\u201dStill, the back-and-forth has been dramatic.During the call, which Mr. Trump initiated on Aug. 9 from his New Jersey golf club, the president accused Mr. McConnell of bungling the health care issue. He was even more animated about what he intimated was the Senate leader\u2019s refusal to protect him from investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to Republicans briefed on the conversation.Mr. McConnell has fumed over Mr. Trump\u2019s regular threats against fellow Republicans and criticism of Senate rules, and questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the presidency in a public speech. Mr. McConnell has made sharper comments in private, describing Mr. Trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing.In offhand remarks, Mr. McConnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency may be headed, and has mused about whether Mr. Trump will be in a position to lead the Republican Party into next year\u2019s elections and beyond, according to people who have spoken to him directly.At a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, Mr. Trump alluded to Mr. Flake unfavorably, referring to him as \u201cweak on borders\u201d and \u201cweak on crime\u201d without mentioning him by name. He referred to Mr. McConnell only in passing, calling on him to abolish the Senate filibuster.\u201cWhen it comes to the Senate, there\u2019s an Article 5 understanding: An attack against one is an attack against all,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has found himself in Mr. Trump\u2019s sights many times, invoking the NATO alliance\u2019s mutual defense doctrine.The fury among Senate Republicans toward Mr. Trump has been building since last month, even before he lashed out at Mr. McConnell. Some of them blame the president for not being able to rally the party around any version of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, accusing him of not knowing even the basics about the policy. Senate Republicans also say strong-arm tactics from the White House backfired, making it harder to cobble together votes and have left bad feelings in the caucus.Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told colleagues that when Mr. Trump\u2019s interior secretary threatened to pull back federal funding for her state, she felt boxed in and unable to vote for the health care bill.In a show of solidarity, albeit one planned well before Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Flake, Mr. McConnell will host a $1,000-per-person dinner on Friday in Kentucky for the Arizona senator, as well as for Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who is also facing a Trump-inspired primary race next year, and Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Mr. Flake is expected to attend the event.Former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican who is close to Mr. McConnell, said frustration with Mr. Trump was boiling over in the chamber. Mr. Gregg blamed the president for undermining congressional leaders, and said the House and Senate would have to govern on their own if Mr. Trump \u201ccan\u2019t participate constructively.\u201d\u201cFailure to do things like keeping the government open and passing a tax bill is the functional equivalent of playing Russian roulette with all the chambers loaded,\u201d Mr. Gregg said.Others in the party divide blame between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell. Al Hoffman, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee who has been supportive of Mr. McConnell, said Mr. McConnell was culpable because he has failed to deliver legislative victories. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s been Mitch\u2019s responsibility, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done much,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.But Mr. Hoffman predicted that Mr. McConnell would likely outlast the president.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to blow up, self-implode,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said of Mr. Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if McConnell pulls back his support of Trump and tries to go it alone.\u201dAn all-out clash between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell would play out between men whose strengths and weaknesses are very different. Mr. Trump is a political amateur, still unschooled in the ways of Washington, but he maintains a viselike grip on the affections of the Republican base. Mr. McConnell is a soft-spoken career politician, with virtuoso mastery of political fund-raising and tactics, but he had no mass following to speak of.Mr. McConnell, while baffled at Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for internecine attacks, is a ruthless pragmatist and has given no overt indication that he plans to seek more drastic conflict. Despite his private battles with Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell has sent reassuring signals with his public conduct: On Monday, he appeared in Louisville, Ky., with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a discussion of tax policy.Mr. McConnell\u2019s Senate colleagues, however, have grown bolder. The combination of the president\u2019s frontal attacks on Senate Republicans and his claim that there were \u201cfine people\u201d marching with white supremacists in Charlottesville has emboldened lawmakers to criticize Mr. Trump in withering terms.For the moment, Mr. McConnell appears to be far more secure in his position, and perhaps immune to coercion from the White House. Republicans are unlikely to lose control of the Senate in 2018, and Mr. Trump has no allies in the Senate who have shown an appetite for combat with Mr. McConnell.Roger J. Stone Jr., a Republican strategist who has advised Mr. Trump for decades, said the president needed to \u201ctake a scalp\u201d in order to force cooperation from Republican elites who have resisted his agenda. Mr. Stone urged Mr. Trump to make an example of one or more Republicans, like Mr. Flake, who have refused to give full support to his administration.\u201cThe president should start bumping off incumbent Republican members of Congress in primaries,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cIf he did that, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan would wet their pants and the rest of the Republicans would get in line.\u201dBut Mr. McConnell\u2019s allies warn that the president should be wary of doing anything that could jeopardize the Senate Republican majority.\u201cThe quickest way for him to get impeached is for Trump to knock off Jeff Flake and Dean Heller and be faced with a Democrat-led Senate,\u201d said Billy Piper, a lobbyist and former McConnell chief of staff.Advertisement"}

Clements, the Republican incumbent. (Mr. Clements returned to defeat him in 1986.)In his four years in office, Mr. White won legislation requiring high school students to pass basic skills tests to graduate; establishing competency tests for public-school teachers and raising their salaries; capping class sizes in elementary schools; and increasing taxes by $4 billion to finance it all. Facing an economic downturn caused by plummeting oil prices, he also tried to wean the state off its dependence on oil and lure other industries to Texas.\u201cHe laid the groundwork for diversification of the Texas economy,\u201d President George Bush said in a statement, \u201cand he made significant investments in improving education in our great state.\u201dThat prompted a fierce backlash in a state where high school and college football are deeply ingrained in the culture. Mr. White received personal threats, and a legal challenge reached the Texas Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld the law.Mr. White defended the rule, telling state legislators at the end of his term, \u201cAmericans didn\u2019t get to the moon on a quarterback sneak.\u201dIn a campaign ad in 1985, he quoted the mother of a student who had been barred from his high school football team for failing his English class: \u201cHis father and I didn\u2019t send him to school to play.

{"Headline": "On Irish Border, Worries That \u2018Brexit\u2019 Will Undo a Hard-Won Peace", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland \u2014 Crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic used to involve delays, checkpoints, bureaucratic harassment and the lurking threat of violence. That it\u2019s now virtually seamless \u2014 that you can drive across without even knowing it \u2014 feels close to miraculous.It is also one of the great successes of the Irish peace process of the last several decades. \u201cIt was like you had to climb over a locked gate,\u201d George Fleming, the president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview. \u201cAnd then someone came and opened the gate.\u201dIf the British government succeeds in extricating itself from the European Union, the two parts of Ireland will lose one of their most important connective threads: a shared membership in the bloc. In an instant, one part of the island would be in Europe, and the other would not.Established nearly 100 years ago according to political expedience rather than natural logic, the border \u2014 some 300 miles long, with about 210 crossings \u2014 is not easy to control, police or even always identify. (Many of the crossings are on tiny back roads.)Reinstating a hard border, as residents call it, would have both psychological and practical implications. The movement of goods and services between north and south, now commonplace and easy, would become far more complicated with the introduction of new tariffs and customs regulations.There are fears, too, about the return of armed guards and checkpoints, a resurgence of smuggling and other types of lawlessness, and a renewal of violence from dissident Irish republicans bound to chafe at signs of British control at the crossings.Northern Ireland voted against Brexit in last year\u2019s referendum. Polls show that for practicality\u2019s sake, a majority of people in the region, whether they identify themselves as Irish or British, want the border to remain porous and fluid.\u201cTo reimpose the border is like putting up the Berlin Wall again, after you\u2019ve taken it down,\u201d said Mr. Fleming, whose farm equipment company is based just two miles from the border.He employs people from both north and south; does business in both north and south (and abroad); and, along with some 325,000 other people per week, regularly drives back and forth, too many times to count, between the two places. His 96-year-old mother lives just across the border, in the republic.But Ms. May\u2019s words have convinced few people here. One of the prime motivations for Brexit was Britain\u2019s desire to reestablish sovereignty and retake control of its borders. People who live on either side of the divide wonder how Britain can possibly expect to achieve both things \u2014 put in a new hard border with Europe while maintaining the current openness.They say, too, that easy statements from Westminster ignore hundreds of years of complicated history and show a profound failure to understand the intense emotions that Brexit has stirred up in a region scarred by the past.Londonderry, for instance, is a predominantly Catholic city in a majority Protestant region with a long and bitter history of violent sectarian conflict. Ancient problems can seem very close to the surface here. But in recent years \u2014 and most dramatically since the enactment, in 1999, of the peace accord known as the Good Friday agreement \u2014 the city has made a remarkable turnaround.Few people make a big deal now about the once life-or-death question of what to call the city: Londonderry, its official name and the one Protestants traditionally prefer, or Derry, the Catholics\u2019 favored name and the one by which it is generally known. Reflecting that both sides have a point, government organizations (and the BBC) have succumbed to practicality and often write it as \u201cDerry/Londonderry.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no trouble here anymore,\u201d said Shauna McClenaghan, a civic leader in Inishowen, a nearby area of the republic that is intimately connected to Londonderry politically and culturally, despite being across the international border. \u201cDerry\u2019s just a city.\u201dGerry Lynn, an amateur historian who leads tours at the Guildhall, the historic downtown building where the City Council meets, unleashed a condensed version of more than 1,000 extremely complex years of Irish history by way of explaining how far the country, and the region, have come since the Troubles (not to mention the 1600s).\u201cThis city, this country, is like a woman who has given birth,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cAll the trauma, the pain and the fighting are over. We\u2019ve come out of the Troubles \u2014 out of black and white and into color.\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s so content with the peace we have here, and nobody really makes too much fuss about the politics except the politicians,\u201d said Daphne Wilson, 50, who was ambling across the bridge the other day.Though she voted for Brexit \u2014 \u201cWe don\u2019t want pedophiles and terrorists coming here\u201d \u2014 she believes that free movement back and forth has helped the two sides feel like part of a greater whole.So does Toni Forrester, the chief executive of the chamber of commerce in Letterkenny, County Donegal, next door in the republic. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard and so closely together to get cross-border cooperation working,\u201d she said.As an example, she mentioned a new medical-imaging center in Londonderry that is open to patients from the republic. \u201cYou can have a heart attack in Donegal and be treated in Derry,\u201d she said.\u201cThis area benefits from E.U. funding, from peace programs that benefit north and south promoting the notion that we have more in common than we have differences,\u201d Ms. McClenaghan said.Now 49 and joint chief executive of the Inishowen Development Partnership, she grew up in Galway, in the republic, when the borders were pockmarked with checkpoints and the roads patrolled by armed officers.\u201cYou\u2019d see the army with their tanks and guns, and it was scary and intimidating,\u201d she said. \u201cPassing the border, they\u2019d always ask you where you were going and where you were from.\u201dMs. McClenaghan was chatting over a cup of coffee at a cafe in Bridgend, at the southern end of the Inishowen peninsula. The border with Northern Ireland was just down the road, near an intersection that already snarls up and slows down at rush hour.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to traffic if there\u2019s a hard border?\u201d she asked.Among other logistical awkwardnesses, the impractical way the island is divided means that unless you take a three- or four-hour detour through western Ireland, you cannot drive from Inishowen to Dublin without crossing the border at least twice.Back at the Guildhall, Mr. Lynn, the tour guide, said that having come this far, people in the city had no desire to return to the way things were before. \u201cHistory has to be history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be left in the past.\u201dEd O\u2019Loughlin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can\u2019t Afford to Buy a $3 Million Ferrari Enzo? Lease One Instead", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersAs a boy, Bill Ceno dreamed of owning a Porsche. His parents bought him model cars. He obsessed over the 1960s cartoon \u201cSpeed Racer.\u201d And in his spare time, he drew pictures of sports cars.By age 24, he had bought the real thing: a 1978 Porsche 930 Turbo. It was 1985, and he drove the car every day. When he was named employee of the month at the engineering firm where he worked, he parked it next to the chief executive\u2019s spot.\u201cHe only had a Lexus, and I had a Porsche 930 Turbo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was awesome.\u201dBut as his interest in collectible supercars \u2014 so called because they are the fastest of the fast \u2014 outpaced his capacity to pay for them, Mr. Ceno found a way to have his dream cars: He leased them, even though they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and sometimes millions.Leasing a collectible or high-performance car is a wholly different experience from leasing a Honda or a Lexus like that chief executive drove. It\u2019s a highly customized process, with negotiable terms. And it is increasingly common in a rarefied world where want trumps need.Unlike typical cars, which decrease in value as soon as they are driven off the lot, supercars often increase in value. The downside is they can increase so much, they become too valuable to drive.The first luxury sports car that Mr. Ceno leased was a yellow 2004 Porsche Carrera GT. It cost $360,000 in 2008. He said he had leased it because he could not afford to buy it.Shortly after, he found a 2004 Ferrari Enzo that he coveted, but the car, which had been owned by the actor Nicolas Cage, cost about $1 million. Mr. Ceno said he had put $100,000 down and put the rest on the lease.\u201cThe payments were probably close to $10,000 a month,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was painful.\u201dPutnam Leasing in Greenwich, Conn., specializes in leasing exotic cars like the ones that Mr. Ceno collects.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to come to me to lease a Ford,\u201d said Steven Posner, Putnam\u2019s chief executive. He said a client of his had bought a sleek, convertible 1958 BMW 507 for $2.75 million at the Gooding & Company auction in Pebble Beach, Calif., last weekend.\u201cYou definitely can\u2019t lease that through BMW Financial,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAnd if you go to the bank, no one is giving you a loan like that on a 1958 car.\u201dHe said a typical lease from his company for a car like that would be five years, with $1 million down and monthly payments of about $20,000.Other than a monthly payment equal to the total cost of many new cars, one big difference between customized leases and manufacturers\u2019 leases is what happens to the car at the end of the lease.Most car companies offer closed-end leases. At the end of the term, typically 36 months, the lessee brings the car back and can pay the residual to own it or lease a newer model. The lessee can also decide to switch car manufacturers and pay what is called a disposition fee \u2014 typically several hundred dollars for essentially going to another brand.Putnam and other exotic-car leasing companies offer open-ended leases. This allows the lessee to end a lease early or extend it a few years. But it also means that the lessee is ultimately responsible for buying the car at the end of the lease, whether the car is worth more or less than the residual amount.People lease exotic and collectible cars for various reasons. Some do it for the cachet, while others do it simply to get to and from work.And there are tax benefits. Business owners who lease a car for work can make the payments with pretax dollars and write it off as an expense to the business.In states with a high sales tax, like California, leasing allows people to defer the tax. If they were to buy or finance the car, they would have to pay the sales tax all at once, instead of monthly.And, of course, car enthusiasts can get more car now if they extend the payments until later.Mr. Ceno, who is an engineer and owns a web design company, said he did not buy his cars to sell them. He uses the lease as leverage. And in most cases, he saves up the money to buy the car before the lease expires.In the case of his Ferrari Enzo, he said, he paid about $200,000 in lease payments. \u201cSome people say, \u2018You could have saved $200,000 by buying it outright,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have the cash. The lease allowed me to have the car.\u201dToday, Mr. Ceno has a collection of exotic cars worth millions of dollars, and far more than the hundreds of thousands the cars initially cost.But few advisers would suggest using a lease to speculate on car appreciation.Cars in the middle \u2014 say, well-known Mercedes-Benz models that do not have the original engine or are missing certain details \u2014 are tougher to sell because collectors want only cars in mint condition. Cars valued at less than $100,000 sell well, Mr. Greisen said, but they appeal to people who often want to own a car they remember from their childhood.Tyler Winslow, a collector who owns a Mercedes repair shop in Cincinnati, has three cars that he purchased with a mix of leases, finances and cash. He said that if he bought a car to fix up and sell quickly, he paid cash.He leases his 1978 Ferrari 308 GTB \u2014 a car similar to the one Tom Selleck drove in \u201cMagnum, P.I.\u201d It cost $115,000 when he leased it. He said he had spent an additional $15,000 on repairs and upgrades and felt that it was still worth about that. Plus, he drives it to work, which adds value for him.Some people use leases to switch cars frequently. Steven Reed, a business manager for professional athletes, said his clients often wanted the latest model and traded up whenever a new version is released.\u201cIt\u2019s a cash management tool,\u201d Mr. Reed said, \u201cexcept these guys like a lot of cars.\u201dRichard Koppelman, president of Miller Motorcars, which sells exotic brands like Bugatti, Pagani, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce in Greenwich, Conn., said a common misunderstanding about leases for exotic cars was that a sign-and-drive program was available. His clients put down substantial amounts of money before they take a car home.Mr. Posner said a typical five-year lease on a 2017 Pagani Huayra, which costs $2.8 million, would require $1.5 million down. The monthly payments would be $17,500.David Gooding, president of the auction house Gooding & Company, said people were often surprised to hear that such expensive cars were leased.\u201cWhat people don\u2019t recognize is, we have extremely wealthy clients who have their money invested in various areas, and it isn\u2019t always liquid,\u201d Mr. Gooding said. \u201cThey may be looking at a $5 million car and have $1 million in their bank account and need to temporarily finance the balance. Or they may get a greater yield putting money in various investments.\u201dHowever people acquire these cars, they do not drive them as much as a regular leased car.Mr. Ceno keeps his collection in a 20-car garage underneath his home in San Diego. \u201cI go down at midnight before I go to bed and say these are the best of the best,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have these cars here.\u201dBut having such a collection, leased or owned, is not as carefree as it should be. \u201cMy Enzo is $3 million,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I say, do I really want to drive a $3 million car down the road?\u201dIt\u2019s a conundrum for sure, but one many enthusiasts would love to have.An earlier version of this article misidentified the first Porsche that Bill Ceno, a car collector, bought. It was a 1978 Porsche 930 Turbo, not a Porsche 933 Turbo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Board Considers 3 Investment Offers to Buy Company\u2019s Shares", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber\u2019s board has voted to move forward on proposals by two investment groups to buy shares in the ride-hailing service and is considering a third offer, with any final decision set to affect who gains the upper hand at the company.The three proposals were described by four people close to the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The offers \u2014 which are mostly focused on buying Uber stock from current shareholders, rather than issuing new shares \u2014 are preliminary. At this stage, the investment groups will begin a due diligence process that could eventually lead to formal investment terms.Yet even as Uber undergoes leadership troubles, the company \u2014 which is largely funded by venture capital and private equity firms \u2014 remains an attractive investment because it is the world\u2019s biggest ride-hailing service and is growing fast.Uber itself does not need new money; the company has raised more than $10 billion in debt and equity and has some $5 billion in the bank.But the board considered the proposals for a variety of reasons. For some of Uber\u2019s existing shareholders, selling stock now could help lock in a hefty profit at a time when the company\u2019s future is unclear. One of the proposals could also lead to the ouster of one investor whose firm \u2014 Benchmark \u2014 has an Uber board seat and that some other board members believe is deliberately damaging the company.One concern has been whether a share sale could end up negatively affecting Uber\u2019s valuation, which stands at $68.5 billion and has made the company the most highly valued private start-up in the world.Two of the three proposals include buying shares at a discount to Uber\u2019s valuation, but also provide a face-saving way for the company to maintain its $68.5 billion value. Dragoneer\u2019s investment coalition wants to buy out shareholders at a discount to Uber\u2019s current valuation, and SoftBank is offering to buy shares at a lower valuation as well. But both groups would also purchase a small amount of new shares at Uber\u2019s current valuation to keep the company\u2019s value propped up on paper.The group led by Mr. Pishevar said it would purchase the shares at the current valuation. Whichever deal ultimately gets approved, this would be the first time that Uber has sold a large chunk of shares at a price that was the same on paper as a previous round of financing.A spokesman for Uber and a spokeswoman for Uber\u2019s board declined to comment, as did SoftBank and a spokeswoman for Mr. Pishevar. Dragoneer did not respond to a request for comment.SoftBank emerged as one of the first to be interested in buying Uber shares. For months, the conglomerate has angled to purchase the shares from existing investors at a discount to the company\u2019s current valuation. To let Uber preserve its $68.5 billion valuation on paper, SoftBank agreed to put a small amount of new money into the company at that price.More recently, an investor coalition led by Dragoneer, which includes the private equity firm General Atlantic and others, has emerged with a deal that would protect Uber\u2019s valuation. The proposal incudes a small purchase of new shares at the current valuation, but the bulk of the investment would come through buying out existing shareholders at a discount via a so-called Dutch auction \u2014 an auction that begins with a high price that declines until a buyer says yes.Uber\u2019s board voted a little more than a week ago for the Dragoneer deal to move forward.The deal was complicated by the emergence last week of another investor consortium led by Mr. Pishevar. The group made a straightforward offer to buy Uber shares from an existing investor at the company\u2019s $68.5 billion valuation.But as a condition of the sale, Mr. Pishevar wants to buy out 75 percent of the shares held by Benchmark, one of Uber\u2019s earliest and largest investors. That would cause Benchmark to step down from its seat on Uber\u2019s board.\u201cWhile I publicly asked you to resign from the Uber board in light of the overall circumstances, I do have tremendous appreciation for your role in helping the company\u2019s development in the past,\u201d Mr. Pishevar said in a new letter to Benchmark on Saturday, which was obtained by The New York Times.A spokeswoman for Benchmark did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Stocks Reach New Heights, What\u2019s Trump Got to Do With It?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dIt was, all things considered, a factually accurate statement. Business is looking better. The stock market is at a high. And, yes, it did not happen by itself.The question, however, is this: Has anything that has happened at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had anything to do with it?Putting aside the administration\u2019s inability to successfully pass any meaningful legislation thus far \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot to put aside \u2014 can Mr. Trump fairly take any credit for the market\u2019s trajectory? After all, when I and others talk to C.E.O.s and investors, one constant refrain we hear is that they actually expect little to get done on the legislative front.Where they repeatedly said they were expecting big changes \u2014 that will translate into higher profits \u2014 was in Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to lower regulatory burdens and costs, something that he could accomplish, in part, through executive orders and the appointment of regulators who are less inclined to enforce the rules aggressively.But that\u2019s not right. Listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks \u2014 which are the real reason the stock market has soared \u2014 and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations.The only time the word \u201cregulation\u201d was even used on Apple\u2019s earnings call \u2014 during which the company described how it beat analysts\u2019 estimates by a wide margin \u2014 was in reference to China. The word did not get a mention on Amazon\u2019s earnings call, nor was there any reference to Washington at all, despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth.Even on Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings call, which included several questions and answers related to regulations, not once did any official suggest that the firm\u2019s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens. Indeed, the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses.\u201cThe administration is, at a minimum, telling a one-sided story \u2014 it\u2019s a bit disingenuous,\u201d Charles Campbell, managing director at MKM Partners, said about Mr. Trump and his team\u2019s taking credit for the rising stock market. \u201cFor the average American who is uninformed, it probably passes\u201d as sounding correct, he lamented.But Mr. Campbell said it was \u201ca little early\u201d for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts. \u201cThis is the first full reporting period, quite honestly,\u201d since Mr. Trump took office, he noted.In industries like finance, Mr. Campbell said, stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be business-friendly changes in the regulatory environment. \u201cIt is the anticipation that there will be an effect,\u201d he said.It is very true that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of United States companies, but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch.The larger issue is, when it does happen, how much can deregulation really help juice the economy?The answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy.According to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume.But here\u2019s the rub: It isn\u2019t that simple, in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like $225 billion.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Developers and Panel Makers Clash Over Tariff Request", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Dozens of solar industry executives, government officials and foreign diplomats gathered here on Tuesday to urge federal trade commissioners to reject a petition from two troubled domestic solar equipment manufacturers to impose steep tariffs and minimum price guarantees on similar imports.At risk, they argued, is the future of the solar industry itself.\u201cThey seek a public remedy for their own private failings,\u201d said Matthew R. Nicely, a lawyer representing the main solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, before the United States International Trade Commission. \u201cIf successful, they will undermine the hard work and innovation that is making solar a viable alternative to conventional energy sources.\u201dBut Matthew J. McConkey, a lawyer for Suniva, the Georgia-based manufacturer that originally brought the petition, argued that the case was about more than two companies that managed to outlast the many manufacturers squeezed out of business by foreign competition.\u201cThe United States is literally strewn with the carcasses of shuttered solar manufacturing facilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about all of those companies and their workers who are out of business.\u201dAt issue is whether the financial woes of Suniva and its co-petitioner, SolarWorld Americas, are a result of unfair competition from Chinese companies benefiting from state subsidies, or of their own business practices. And though the sharp drops in the cost of panels have made it difficult for domestic manufacturers to compete, they have also fueled a boom in solar development throughout the country, providing a lift to an industry that says it now has more than 250,000 jobs.Further complicating matters is that Suniva, once lauded on the White House blog as \u201can American success story\u201d during the Obama administration but now in bankruptcy, is majority-owned by a Chinese company that now disavows the case.With roots in a protracted trade war between the United States and China that started in 2011, the dispute centers on crystalline silicon cells, the major electricity-producing components, as well as the modules, or panels, into which they are assembled. SolarWorld Americas, a subsidiary of a now-bankrupt German panel maker, had filed a trade complaint along with six other domestic solar manufacturers that accused their Chinese counterparts of using unfair government subsidies to finance their operations and then selling their merchandise for less than the cost of manufacturing and shipping it.SolarWorld won the case, as well as a second that included Taiwan, where Chinese manufacturers had turned for cells to avoid anticipated tariffs. But that, the petitioners argue, set off a global race to the bottom on price, as manufacturers opened factories in other low-cost countries, leading to the current case. This time, the companies are seeking blanket global protections to keep manufacturers from circumventing tariffs aimed at specific countries by expanding elsewhere in what the petition referred to as a game of Whac-a-Mole.The case, which the commission itself designated \u201cextraordinarily complicated,\u201d has given rise to a number of unusual alliances and fault lines. It has lined up almost the entire domestic industry \u2014 from electricians to corporate executives \u2014 against two of its own. It has also made bedfellows of solar businesses and conservative-minded policy groups opposed to trade restrictions and subsidies that have in the past worked to undermine solar\u2019s forward march.Among those opposing the Suniva petition is the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is connected with Charles G. and David H. Koch, billionaire brothers whose fortunes derive, at least in part, from fossil fuels.About 300 people attended Tuesday\u2019s hearing, sending staff members scrambling to squeeze extra chairs into the chamber to accommodate all the witnesses and their lawyers, as well as the public. In that group was a crew of solar workers organized by the solar trade group, wearing T-shirts that said, \u201cSave America\u2019s Solar Jobs, No New Solar Tariffs.\u201dThe opponents, led by the trade group, argued that tariffs would increase the price of solar panels, halting the rapid spread of solar development \u2014 especially on the scale undertaken by utilities \u2014 and jeopardizing tens of thousands of jobs.\u201cAll else equal, any increase in equipment costs for utility-scale developers, whether the result of lower domestic subsidies or increased import tariffs, would increase the price of solar electricity developers could offer,\u201d said Amy Grace, who leads North America research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. And that increase, she said, \u201cwould result in fewer contracts being signed and lower solar deployment.\u201dA handful of renewable energy executives testified that the problems of Suniva and SolarWorld stemmed from their inability to qualify for financing, their inability to produce and deliver modules that met the industry\u2019s needs, and their inability to compete in a quickly evolving industry. But the petitioners defended their products, saying that they had attracted steady customers and had few performance problems. Instead, they said, the problem was the quickly plummeting prices that resulted from the oversupply of overseas panels last year.An economist testifying in support of the petitioners, Andrew Szamosszegi of Capital Trade, offered evidence of a relationship between the glut, particularly in China, and a steep drop in prices last year. He quoted the 2016 financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission from SunPower, whose chief executive, Tom Werner, had testified against imposing tariffs.\u201cExcess capacity and industry competition have resulted in the past, and may continue to result, in substantial downward pressure on the price of solar cells and panels,\u201d Mr. Szamosszegi read.A different argument in support of the case was delivered by Bucky Johnson, the mayor of Norcross, Ga., where Suniva is based.\u201cSome might say protectionism \u2014 I say bunk,\u201d he told the commission. \u201cGiven a level playing field, I believe that Suniva and the solar manufacturing industry can thrive in our economy and provide some of the most innovative and sustainable products in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ara Parseghian, Coach Who Returned Notre Dame Football to Greatness, Dies at 94", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAra Parseghian, a Presbyterian of Armenian descent who might have seemed an unlikely savior of Notre Dame football but became just that, coaching the Fighting Irish out of the wilderness and back to greatness in the 1960s and \u201970s, died early Wednesday morning at his home in Granger, Ind. He was 94.Parseghian, whose home was not far from the university\u2019s campus in South Bend, Ind., had recently been undergoing treatment at a care facility for a hip infection.Parseghian ranks with Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy in the pantheon of Notre Dame football coaches. In his 11 seasons (1964 through 1974), his teams won 95 games, lost 17 and tied four, for a .836 winning percentage. His 1966 and 1973 teams were voted national champions.When Parseghian arrived at Notre Dame, the university\u2019s football program had been in decline for years. The collapse started in 1956, when Notre Dame won only two games and lost eight. Though there were some victories, Notre Dame never won more than five games in a season from 1959 to 1963. Twice it won only two games.Notre Dame fans and Notre Dame haters \u2014 there have always been armies of each \u2014 offered theories: The university\u2019s leaders were de-emphasizing football as they sought to raise the school\u2019s academic reputation; good players didn\u2019t want to go to an all-male school; tradition alone could not attract enough talented athletes; the coaching was bad; all of the above.Meanwhile, Parseghian was gaining a reputation. After five highly successful seasons at his alma mater, Miami of Ohio, where he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Woody Hayes, he moved to Northwestern for the 1956 season. He barely broke even in his eight years there, but he was credited with doing a lot at an academically rigorous institution with no trace of a football factory image.By the early 1960s, Notre Dame\u2019s administrators were all too familiar with Parseghian; his Northwestern teams had beaten Notre Dame four years in a row.In the spring of 1964, student servers in Notre Dame\u2019s main dining hall noticed that football players were forsaking gravy and ice cream. The new coach had told them that they were going to be leaner and faster.Above all, Parseghian wanted to change the players\u2019 emotions. \u201cThe biggest problem was to re-instill the confidence,\u201d he recalled in a television interview years later. This he did, with an enthusiastic, hands-on approach in practices that were always well organized.Parseghian had a keen eye for talent that had been misused or overlooked. Besides shifting the sure-handed Snow to receiver in 1964, he converted three big but rather slow running backs (\u201cthe elephant backfield,\u201d he later called them) into linemen, where they thrived. Most important, Parseghian decided his starting quarterback would be the senior John Huarte, who had spent far more time on the bench than on the field his sophomore and junior years.Snow was Huarte\u2019s favorite receiver as the Fighting Irish won nine straight games in 1964, with many of the same players from the squad that had lost seven games the year before. Southern California spoiled a perfect season with a 20-17 victory in Los Angeles, but Huarte, who had not even won a varsity letter until 1964, was awarded the Heisman Trophy. Parseghian was acclaimed coach of the year.In his 11 seasons at Notre Dame, Parseghian demanded the best from his players without cursing or breaking clipboards on the sideline. \u201cAll he had to do was look at you,\u201d Ross Browner, an all-American defensive lineman in the 1970s, recalled years later.But for all his success, Parseghian was saddled for a time with the reputation of a coach who \u201ccouldn\u2019t win the big ones.\u201d That image was reinforced on Nov. 19, 1966, when unbeaten Notre Dame met unbeaten Michigan State at East Lansing in the most eagerly awaited college game in 20 years.Notre Dame fell behind, 10-0, then rallied to tie the score. But late in the game and in its own end of the field, Notre Dame played conservatively rather than risk a turnover, and the game ended in a 10-10 tie. Although Notre Dame was voted the national champion by the wire services, there were many who thought the game had taken some luster from the team\u2019s image.After the 1969 season, Notre Dame accepted an invitation to meet top-ranked Texas in the Cotton Bowl, ending four decades in which the Irish did not take part in postseason play. Texas won, 21-17, on New Year\u2019s Day 1970.A year later, after another season-spoiling loss to Southern California, Notre Dame returned to the Cotton Bowl and upset Texas, 24-11, to snap the Longhorns\u2019 winning streak at 30 games. Notre Dame\u2019s next bowl appearance was a crushing 40-6 loss to Nebraska in the Orange Bowl after the 1972 season.Parseghian\u2019s year of total redemption was 1973. The team won all 10 regular-season games, then defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, 24-23. The clincher was a daring pass from the Irish end zone for a first down that enabled Notre Dame to run out the clock and silenced those who said the coach lacked nerve when it really counted.The 1974 season was Parseghian\u2019s last, and in some ways his toughest, even though his team finished 10-2. Several players had been suspended for disciplinary reasons before the season. And in the regular-season finale, Notre Dame suffered a crushing 55-24 loss to Southern California after leading by 24-0.Parseghian announced in December 1974 that he was retiring, saying that a quarter-century in coaching had left him \u201cphysically exhausted and emotionally drained.\u201d Another New Year\u2019s victory over Alabama, this time in the Orange Bowl, enabled him to go out a winner.Ara Raoul Parseghian was born in Akron, Ohio, on May 21, 1923, to Michael Parseghian, who had fled Turkey amid the Armenian genocide, and Amelia Bonneau. His mother had forbidden him to try out for his high school team, and when he did, and made the team, he kept it a secret from her \u2014 until the day he came home with an injury.After high school, Parseghian joined the Navy and played football at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center under Paul Brown, who later gained fame as coach of the Cleveland Browns. When he left the Navy, Parseghian enrolled at Miami University in Ohio and earned all-American mention as a halfback. (He was 5 feet 10 inches, and for decades he maintained his playing weight of 185 pounds.)Parseghian joined the Browns after college, but a hip injury ended his professional playing career. He returned to Miami as the freshman coach and became the head coach when Hayes left for Ohio State.After leaving Notre Dame, Parseghian was a color commentator for ABC Sports from 1975 to 1981 and for CBS Sports in 1988.Surviving are his wife, Kathleen, whom he married in 1948; a daughter, Kristan, and a son, Michael. Another daughter, Karan, died in 2012. His brother, Gerard, died in 2010, and his sister, Isabelle Atwood, died in 2008.In 1994, Parseghian founded the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation, dedicated to financing research on Niemann-Pick Type C disease, a genetic pediatric nerve disorder that killed three of his grandchildren.\u201cThat was one of the main reasons I enjoyed being there so much,\u201d he added.Parseghian was only 51 when he left Notre Dame. Initially, there were rumors that he was weighing offers to coach in the N.F.L., but they remained rumors. As for the possibility that he might one day coach college football again, he would say, \u201cAfter Notre Dame, what is there?\u201dBecause of an editing error, an obituary on Aug. 3 about the former Notre Dame football coach Ara Parseghian misstated a reason that he initially hesitated to take the Notre Dame job. It was because his father had formed a dislike of Catholics, not Christians.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner Companies Said to Be Under Investigation Over Visa Program", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors are investigating Kushner Companies, the real estate firm owned by the family of Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, over its use of a program that grants visas to wealthy overseas investors.The authorities, in part, are looking into the role of Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Meyer, according to a person familiar with the matter who confirmed the inquiry.The investigation centers on the real estate company\u2019s use of the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for a $500,000 investment. Critics say the program has weak oversight and lax rules.Mr. Kushner gave up his role running the family company in January. He still owns a significant piece of the business.In a statement, Kushner Companies\u2019 general counsel, Emily Wolf, said the company was cooperating with the authorities.\u201cEB-5 is a longstanding federal program that is frequently used by many large developers to raise funds and help create jobs,\u201d Ms. Wolf said. \u201cKushner Companies utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations and did nothing improper.\u201dShe added: \u201cNeither Kushner Companies nor Nicole Meyer have done anything wrong in connection with the EB-5 program, and any suggestion to the contrary is simply false. The company and Ms. Meyer are cooperating with all legal requests in order to show that they did everything properly and clear up any questions.\u201dMr. Kushner has played an important role in United States-China relations, brokering meetings between Mr. Trump and top Chinese officials. About three-quarters of the roughly 10,000 investor visas issued last year went to applicants from China.Ms. Meyer apologized for mentioning her brother and did not appear at later events on the trip.This is not the first time Kushner Companies has turned to the program. In 2013, it raised $50 million in EB-5 financing for a Trump-branded luxury high-rise apartment building in Jersey City, which opened late last year.Created in 1990, the program was intended to provide financing for projects in areas with high unemployment. It has turned into a popular source of cheap financing for luxury developments.There are no federal standards to define the areas that qualify for the program. And developers have been accused of providing gerrymandered maps to qualify.Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have divested a portion of his stake in the family real estate empire, including the Jersey City project. But he has retained ownership in the bulk of the business, including the building that had received EB-5 funds.Government ethics filings show the stake held by Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump in the family business and other investments is worth as much as $761 million to them.Blake Roberts, a lawyer who is advising the couple on ethics issues, has said that Mr. Kushner will recuse himself from matters concerning the EB-5 program.Qiaowai, the Chinese immigration company helping Kushner Companies find investors, did not respond to a request for comment.Javier C.

{"Headline": "New York City Council Approves Rezoning Plan for Midtown Manhattan", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a rezoning for a section of Midtown Manhattan that is likely to make the area even more densely packed with high-rise office buildings but that promises to yield improvements to subway stations and public spaces.The rezoning, which has been in the works for five years, is intended to revitalize what was once the core of corporate activity in New York City. The area is home to more than 250,000 jobs and generates about 10 percent of the city\u2019s property tax revenue. But the buildings are relics of the \u201cMad Men\u201d era, with an average age of 75 years, according to city officials.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s proposal to rezone the area failed amid opposition from Council members and community leaders who said the plan was too generous to developers without ensuring sufficient benefits to the public. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who supports the revised plan, said it linked the construction of big buildings in the area to \u201creal-time improvements in its public transit and public realm.\u201dCouncilman Daniel R. Garodnick, a Democrat who represents the area and was the main sponsor of the bill that was approved on Wednesday, said that the rezoning would allow more intensive development near subway stations, which he described as \u201ccertainly the right place to put lots of new density.\u201dThe change could result in more ultra-tall towers like One Vanderbilt, which is going up near Grand Central Terminal and will be nearly as tall as the Empire State Building. When all of the additional development rights have been used in a decade or two, the Chrysler Building could cease to stand out on the Midtown skyline.Before all of the new towers can sprout, developers must strike deals with the owners of landmark buildings like St. Patrick\u2019s. The cathedral has not made full use of development rights for the block it occupies on Fifth Avenue opposite Rockefeller Center, and can now sell the rest, totaling about 1.1 million square feet.How much are the so-called air rights worth? The market will decide. But the rezoning calls for the city to collect a tax of at least $61.49 per square foot from the sale of such rights.Officials said the proceeds would be used to finance the city\u2019s commitment to spend up to $50 million on improving public plazas and streets in East Midtown.\u201cThe goal is to improve East Midtown not to simply keep it as it is,\u201d Mr. Garodnick said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Nomad to Avoid Summer Rent Spikes", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-five years old, employed and engaged, Elana Rosman had not envisioned moving back to her childhood home in Great Neck, N.Y., on Long Island.She is not in a quarter-life crisis, seeking a safe haven to figure out her next step. It\u2019s much simpler than that. To avoid taking on a new lease this summer, Ms. Rosman is \u201cgoing nomad\u201d and has moved home with her parents.The summer rental season is notorious for being the priciest time of year in New York, because demand shoots up as recent graduates flock to the city looking for a place to live, and prices naturally follow suit. As a result, some people do whatever they can to put off signing a lease until fall.Temporary strategies include couch-surfing, house-sitting, finding a short-term rental or a boardinghouse, or moving in with relatives \u2014 as Ms. Rosman did. She figures that by waiting out the summer\u2019s high rental season, she may find rents as much as a few hundred dollars a month lower when she starts apartment-hunting in the fall.Sharon Leonor, who just completed graduate school, and Max Scharf, who just graduated from law school, chose to delay their move to Manhattan until September, when Mr. Scharf starts a new job as a first-year associate in the city. Their nomadic solution: moving into an Airbnb basement apartment in a house in Paramus, N.J., for a month and a half.Ms. Leonor and Mr. Scharf, both 25, started an apartment search in New York in May. \u201cAlmost everything was over $2,000 a month for places that didn\u2019t have a good living space or even a complete kitchen,\u201d Ms. Leonor said. \u201cWe knew it wouldn\u2019t meet our needs.\u201dWith Ms. Leonor studying for her social worker licensing exam, and Mr. Scharf for the New York state bar exam, they needed an apartment with enough room for each of them to hit the books.Since finding a suitable rental seemed out of the question, the couple changed tactics and started looking for a short-term Airbnb rental. Their search in Manhattan was brief. Ms. Leonor realized \u201cthis is silly \u2014 we\u2019re not even working and it feels like with rent and cost of living, we would just be throwing money away.\u201dThey eventually found the Paramus Airbnb, which is just a few towns over from where her parents live in Teaneck. \u201cWe got more bang for our buck,\u201d Ms. Leonor said.Although Ms. Leonor and Mr. Scharf have enjoyed the perks of living in New Jersey for the summer (cheaper grocery stores and restaurants, more space), Mr. Scharf has not wavered on their plan to relocate to Manhattan come fall, especially as he anticipates some long workdays. \u201cI lived in Teaneck and interned in Midtown last summer, and it takes at least an hour each way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lincoln Tunnel during rush hour is the stuff of nightmares.\u201dTheir time in the Airbnb ran out late last month and they have moved in temporarily with Ms. Leonor\u2019s parents. They have started their online search for Sept. 1 rentals and estimate that the number available within their budget is almost double what they found previously.Summer is the most common time of year to move for three reasons, according to Grant Long, the senior economist at StreetEasy: graduation, the weather and employment cycles.\u201cA big factor is school turnover,\u201d he said. New graduates moving to the city for a job or college provide a steady flow of new residents through the summer.People generally don\u2019t want to move in the slushy, frigid New York winter weather, he said. Job turnover \u2014 specifically in the finance and insurance industries \u2014 is another factor. \u201cBonus season in finance comes from January to March, depending on the company,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s typical for people to wait until they get their bonus, give it a couple of months, and then find a new job over the summer.\u201dBut then begins the vicious cycle. A year or two later, those same people have decided to move when their leases run out and are once again on the hunt for a new place.Daniel Reisner, 25, and his two roommates were presented with a rent increase of several hundred dollars a month when the lease on their Upper West Side apartment expired this spring. Unable to take on more rent, Mr. Reisner, a third-year law student, decided to move into a two-month sublet with his girlfriend, a college senior, who was in New York for the summer.\u201cWe found it on Craigslist,\u201d Mr. Reisner said. \u201cIt was around the corner from my apartment. We needed a place to live for a few months and this was perfect.\u201dMr. Reisner\u2019s next housing solution as he enters his final fall semester of law school will be a bunk under the parental roof in Merrick, N.Y., on Long Island. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sharing a room with my brother, who just graduated from college and moved home, which will be interesting.\u201dDespite the extra burden of the commute to the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Greenwich Village and a hit to his social life, Mr. Reisner said the move home is a necessity. \u201cI\u2019ve had other people ask me to move into their apartments this summer, but it was too expensive.\u201cMy plan is to move back into the city in January, when rent is a little bit lower,\u201d he said.The rental cycle is deliberate, said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. \u201cOwners can try to stagger leases to have them expire during the May and June months, knowing full well it\u2019s the highest demand for apartments.\u201d Savvy renters try to negotiate a summertime lease beyond the typical 12 months to push their tenancy into the fall, when demand and prices drop.\u201cAs a D.I.Y. landlord myself, I\u2019ve experienced that first hand,\u201d said Mr. Coon, who is based in Chicago. \u201cIf I have units that are being rented during the summer, I am able to charge 10 to 20 percent more in rent. So in big cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, 10 to 20 percent is a very meaningful dollar amount.\u201dDaniel Gallant, 41, has considerable experience in short stays. Over the years, \u201cthere have been several times when I was nomadic,\u201d he said. In the summer of 2000, Mr. Gallant and his two roommates were preparing to re-sign the lease for their Turtle Bay apartment, only to learn that the rent had doubled.He had a college buddy who let him stay at his place while he was out of town. And when he ran out of places to crash, Mr. Gallant convinced New Dramatists, a playwrights organization where he had once interned, to let him sleep in rooms reserved for members \u2014 when they were empty, of course. He also spent some time at Penington Friends House near Union Square, a Quaker boardinghouse, and at Menno House, a Mennonite boardinghouse also near Union Square. He is neither Quaker nor Mennonite.\u201cThere are a lot of places like this, but each has its own rules,\u201d Mr. Gallant said. \u201cThere\u2019s a yoga place in the West Village that was a combo yoga studio and a residence. These places were not incredibly luxurious, but they are all clean and safe places to stay.\u201dFor Mr. Gallant, this uncertain lifestyle was thrilling at times. \u201cI was constantly trying to figure out the next place that I would be staying, he said. \u201cIt was exciting, it was nomadic, it was a little bit frightening. But I had the luxury of knowing I was in this situation by choice.\u201d He was comforted by the thought that \u201cif I didn\u2019t need to keep pursuing this directing project, I could have gone home to my family\u201d in Maryland.Going nomad is an attempt at beating a system that can seem to peg the renter as the loser.\u201cThe fact that we really got a look at the market and what was out there was really helpful,\u201d Ms. Feierman said. \u201cI was on the summer cycle, having moved here after graduation, but my boyfriend, Dan, was on a different cycle.\u201dEven though she had just re-upped on her lease, it quickly became clear to Ms. Feierman that they should go with Mr. Feinberg\u2019s cycle because his lease would expire in the fall. Hunting for a Nov. 1 vacancy, \u201cwe found out a lot more was out there,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there was not as much inventory, but the apartments were more affordable.\u201dWhen the couple found a reasonably priced one-bedroom in Chelsea in mid-September last year with a Nov. 1 lease, she moved out of her apartment early, having found someone to take her place there. She and Mr. Feinberg now have high ceilings, exposed brick, a nice bathroom and a renovated kitchen with a dishwasher and washer/dryer.\u201cWe kind of thought we would give up on those amenities,\u201d Ms. Feierman said.Mr. Long said listings lately include anywhere from one to three months of free rent. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a Netflix subscription, Amazon Prime subscription, or Uber credits and other crazy things they offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the concessions go overall, we did see a peak over the winter.\u201dReal estate brokers warn, though, that trying to outfox the system doesn\u2019t always work out. \u201cJust because you want to wait out the market doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will win,\u201d said Mr. Malin of Citi Habitats. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off \u2014 there\u2019s a risk and reward on both ends,\u201d he said.A renter who puts off a hunt in hopes of cheaper apartments in a few months could miss out on an ideal place. \u201cSometimes the reality is when you go see something you love and want, and if you can afford it, it\u2019s hard to turn it away,\u201d Mr. Malin said. The strategy could also backfire if the market shifts and rents go up across the board, even when the weather cools.Mr. Long said that being open to compromise will serve you well while apartment hunting. \u201cOne of the things to keep in mind is that renting and finding a good deal can favor those who are flexible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have the flexibility to stay on a friend\u2019s couch for a while, and it gives you a better chance to get what you want, do it.\u201dMs. Feierman believes her willingness to be flexible with moving dates made it easier to find a decent apartment. \u201cWe realized whatever we needed to do, we could make it work \u2014 like we could move out of our places a month early if we needed to,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving the time and money to do that made our process better. We didn\u2019t feel like we needed to settle or jump on the first thing we found.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Rosman spent part of the summer commuting from Great Neck to her job as a physician assistant at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She plans to move into an apartment with her fianc\u00e9 in November, around the time of their wedding. \u201cIt started out as a joke,\u201d Ms. Rosman said, referring to a conversation the couple had about her moving in with her parents on Long Island.But the concept turned serious when they realized they couldn\u2019t afford the summer leases they were finding online. \u201cWhen I go on StreetEasy and put in my specifications and my budget, there are fewer options available for this time of year than in the spring and fall,\u201d she said.Ms. Rosman says going nomad has been a good move. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely stressful moving home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s worth it.\u201dLooking ahead, she knows she won\u2019t have to be stingy when moving day arrives. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stress about nickel and diming my move,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saving in rent and I can move out in style.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bride, the Groom and the Elephant in the Room", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsA week before the July 30 wedding, Ms. Zhou faced the topic head-on in a conference room at Wolters Kluwer, an information services company in Manhattan, where she is a summer intern. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d she said. \u201cOur age difference is the elephant in the room.\u201dShe is equipped to confront the elephant, she said. She noted that people have accepted the marriages of interracial couples and gay couples, and they should accept the weddings of spouses with big age differences, too.\u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do, so I went to this party and there were a lot of people there and it helped my mood,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I saw Cynthia, and that helped my mood more.\u201dHis good spirits didn\u2019t prevent him from committing a minor social catastrophe. \u201cHe came up to me and spilled a drink on my dress,\u201d Ms. Zhou recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was intentional or not.\u201dWhat he will say is that he considers his act of clumsiness among the best moves of his life.Ms. Zhou was equally impressed by Dr. Wallack. \u201cHe was handsome, he was a gentleman, and he made me feel very comfortable,\u201d she said. He asked for her phone number and, like the old-fashioned suitor he said he is, waited a few days to call.Their first date, at an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village, came a week or two later. The conversation flowed, as it had on the phone when Mr. Wallack called to ask her out. Which, to Ms. Zhou, was itself an impressive gesture.\u201cNot a lot of guys call. Men my age will text you and want to meet at a dive bar. So I was really surprised when he called, and when I picked up he was really polite. He asked me how I was doing, how my day was. So it was just pleasant,\u201d she said.That pleasantness spilled into what turned out to be an almost, but not quite, perfect evening at Il Cantinori. Just after he ordered dinner, Dr. Wallack was called to the hospital on an emergency.\u201cThat was a curveball,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I was really having a wonderful time. But it\u2019s my job to take care of sick people, and at the time I had a patient who was close to passing away.\u201d He smoothed it over with Ms. Zhou with reassurances. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019ll be calling you very soon, and I mean that.\u2019 That night, after I had tucked everybody away in the hospital, I called her again.\u201dMs. Zhou remembers that follow-up differently. A few days passed before he called for a second date, she said. But the wait fueled her anticipation. \u201cI was really attracted to him on that first date, and I wanted to see where it would take me,\u201d she said.It took her to some spectacular places: They saw a series of Broadway shows including \u201cJersey Boys\u201d; went to top-tier restaurants in the city; and, toward the end of 2014, to Puerto Rico for a five-day vacation.\u201cThat was when I realized I could spend a lot of time with Marc,\u201d Ms. Zhou said. \u201cIt was just the two of us for an extended period of time, and we didn\u2019t get on each other\u2019s nerves.\u201d By then, Ms. Zhou considered their relationship exclusive. Dr. Wallack did not. But that was changing.\u201cOne of the mornings I woke up in San Juan, she had made tea in the hotel room,\u201d Dr. Wallack said. \u201cAnd that made me feel so wonderful. I thought it was so elegant. After that trip I fell in love with her.\u201dA year later, a trip to England and Italy brought them closer still. Each recalls their vacation as \u201cmagical.\u201d It was in Paris that Ms. Zhou said she started thinking she could marry Dr. Wallack. And Dr. Wallack began to distill what he loved about Ms. Zhou: Against the backdrop of beauty, youth and intelligence she presented, there was sophistication.When they went to museums in France, it was evident how smart Ms. Zhou is, Dr. Wallack said. He found her appreciation of art infectious. \u201cShe didn\u2019t try to tell me how she understands art,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just the way she acted, how at ease she was with it. The way she kind of translated that to me made me realize she was wise beyond her years.\u201dThree months later, Dr. Wallack was ready to propose. He went to the diamond district in Manhattan in search of a ring. And some advice.\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what she liked,\u201d he said. So he described their relationship, including the age difference, to salespeople and came away with a 2.6-carat solitaire \u2014 a nod to Ms. Zhou\u2019s age at the time, 26.Ms. Zhou expects to graduate in 2018 and hopes to find work in mergers and acquisitions, the focus of this summer\u2019s internship at Wolters Kluwer. In the meantime, she has little time off.That is O.K. with her, though. \u201cI came here to have a career on Wall Street, not to find a husband,\u201d she said.She acknowledges that the one she found anyway has caused raised eyebrows, and in some cases hackles, because he is so much older. When Ms. Zhou told her parents, Gary and Lily Zhou, of Shrewsbury, about the engagement, \u201cit was a shock,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve come to terms with it. I\u2019ve always been pretty independent.\u201dMr. Zhou, the head of histotechnology at St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center in Boston, walked his daughter down the aisle in Westhampton and kissed her cheek before she and Dr. Wallack exchanged vows. Cynthia\u2019s mother is a research associate at University of Massachusetts Medical School.Dr. Wallack has not been immune to tension and doubt over his marriage to Ms. Zhou, either.\u201cThe discussions haven\u2019t always been pleasant,\u201d he said of talks with some of the people closest to him.Whispers about the May-December romance aside, both bride and groom have also felt the encouragement of trusted friends and colleagues.Dr. Wallack said his residents and fellow surgeons are happy for him: \u201cThey know I\u2019ve found someone I can love again after my second divorce, someone who\u2019s going to keep me alive and engaged.\u201dSeveral hospital colleagues were at the beach wedding. After the couple read handwritten vows, Dr. Wallack stomped on a glass in keeping with Jewish tradition. Ms. Zhou grew up Presbyterian, but should the couple have children, they will be raised Jewish, she said.At a reception in the hotel\u2019s grand ballroom, Dr. Wallack\u2019s friend and best man, Devon Reiff, a trial lawyer, toasted the couple with scant mention of age.But just before the wedding he privately acknowledged the sea of doubters.\u201cThe predominant reaction from everyone I know has been shock,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just go: This is impossible, it\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s only going to last two or three years. I\u2019m one of the only ones I know of who has been understanding. But it\u2019s because I know Cynthia and they don\u2019t. They\u2019re both super-committed people and very serious.\u201dMs. Zhou has found support in friends like Sonia Rao, a fellow art history student from Dartmouth who was her maid of honor.\u201cCindy has always known what she\u2019s wanted out of life and love,\u201d Ms. Rao said during the reception. \u201cShe\u2019s very sure of herself, and that\u2019s been an inspiration to me. There\u2019s always going to be stereotypes, but Cindy is strong. I\u2019m excited for her.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arthur Finkelstein, Innovative, Influential Conservative Strategist, Dies at 72", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArthur Finkelstein, a reclusive political Svengali who revolutionized campaign polling and financing and helped elect a bevy of conservative candidates, including President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, died on Friday night in Ipswich, Mass., where he lived. He was 72.His family confirmed the death in a statement. The cause was lung cancer.Mr. Finkelstein was among the first political strategists in the late 1970s to grasp the potential of a United States Supreme Court ruling that allowed putatively independent political committees to spend money on behalf of individual candidates and causes.The decision led to a proliferation of fund-raising vehicles that were supposed to be beyond the control of candidates or party officials but that in fact often worked in concert with their campaigns. One such group, the muscular National Conservative Political Action Committee, was established with Mr. Finkelstein\u2019s help.He would bombard them with appeals to support a candidate through direct mail and phone calls, coupled with television advertisements that mercilessly exploited a rival\u2019s vulnerabilities\u201cThe numbers spoke to him,\u201d Kieran Mahoney, his frequent campaign collaborator and one of his many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Finkelstein\u2019s combative campaigns helped elect or re-elect the Republican Senators James L. Buckley and Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato of New York, Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Connie Mack III of Florida, Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.\u201cArthur was responsible for electing more people to the United States Senate than any other political consultant,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato said in an interview.In the process, Mr. Finkelstein transformed liberal into a dirty word.His conservative political action committee was instrumental in the surprise unseatings of liberal Democratic stalwarts in 1980, including Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana, Frank Church of Idaho and George S. McGovern of South Dakota. He also collaborated with fellow Republicans in establishing another fund-raising behemoth, the National Congressional ClubIn 1994, Mr. D\u2019Amato and Mr. Finkelstein engineered the defeat of Mario M. Cuomo, New York\u2019s three-term governor, by George E. Pataki, an obscure state senator. Mr. Pataki\u2019s resonant rationale was that Mr. Cuomo was \u201ctoo liberal for too long.\u201dA canny Brooklyn-born brawler who made his political debut on a Greenwich Village soapbox, Mr. Finkelstein was adept at aggressively wooing disaffected Democrats to his Republican clients\u2019 camps in statewide campaigns. His strategy was largely to ignore party labels and focus on the basic beliefs that moved these Democrats.He refused to acknowledge, though, that he engaged in negative campaigning. That phrase connotes false accusations, he said, when \u201cit just means that you speak about the failings of your opponent as opposed to the virtues of your candidate.\u201dRather, he called his strategy \u201crejectionist voting\u201d \u2014 a formula built on slogans that disparaged adversaries. (He would often count on a third contender to siphon votes from the rival who posed the most serious threat to a client).Prime examples of that strategy were Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s upset win over Senator Jacob K. Javits, the venerable liberal Republican incumbent, in the 1980 primary, and Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s re-election squeaker against the Democratic state attorney general, Robert Abrams (\u201chopelessly liberal,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato said), in 1992, when Bill Clinton swept the state with a 1.2-million-vote margin on his way to winning the presidency.\u201cI never once put him on television to talk,\u201d Mr. Finkelstein said of Mr. D\u2019Amato. \u201cHe was completely irrelevant to the campaigns.\u201dThe negatives used in the primary \u2014 portraying Mr. Javits, at 76, as sick and aging \u2014 were tempered in the 1980 general election campaign by an ad that famously featured Mr. D\u2019Amato\u2019s mother, armed with bags of groceries, lamenting the struggles of the middle class and urging, \u201cVote for my son, Al.\u201d\u201cThat humanized me,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato recalled.Mr. Finkelstein said, \u201cWe had to prove Alfonse had a mother.\u201dMr. D\u2019Amato narrowly defeated his Democratic rival, Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, in the general election, in which Mr. Javits ran on the Liberal line.As a gay, Jewish libertarian, Mr. Finkelstein helped elect homophobic candidates, once polled South Carolinians on whether they would support a rival candidate identified as a Jewish immigrant, and supported gay rights and abortion rights as what the political consultant Roger Stone, another of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, called, in a phone interview, \u201ca situational conservative.\u201dStill, Mr. Finkelstein suggested, he was not a hired gun who would provide his services to just anyone.\u201cIt would be very hard for me to work with somebody with whom I have fundamental disagreements, against someone with whom I agree,\u201d he said.Mr. Finkelstein insisted that he never lied \u2014 \u201cI do not slander somebody without proof,\u201d was how he put it \u2014 but he acknowledged a generation ago that truth was fungible.\u201cThe most overwhelming fact of politics is what people do not know,\u201d he told the college students in Prague. \u201cIn politics, it\u2019s what you perceive to be true that\u2019s true, not truth. If I tell you one thing is true, you will believe the second thing is true. A good politician will tell you a few things that are true before he will tell you a few things that are untrue, because you will then believe all the things he has said, true and untrue.\u201dArthur Jay Finkelstein was born on May 18, 1945, in the East New York section of Brooklyn, the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Morris, was a cabby. His mother was the former Zella Ordanksi. The family moved to Levittown, on Long Island, when he was 11, then to Queens, where he graduated from Forest Hills High School.In 1967, Mr. Finkelstein earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and political science from Queens College. As a student, he sometimes shared a college radio program with Ayn Rand, the author and philosopher whose laissez-faire capitalism he would fiercely defend in street-corner debates in Greenwich Village.After he volunteered in Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 presidential campaign, F. Clifton White, the architect of the Draft Goldwater movement, became his patron and recruited him to James Buckley\u2019s Senate race in 1970 as the candidate of the fledgling Conservative Party.Invoking Richard M. Nixon\u2019s silent majority, Mr. Finkelstein encapsulated Mr. Buckley\u2019s message in the catchphrase \u201cIsn\u2019t it time we had a senator?\u201dMr. Buckley went on to defeat the Republican incumbent, Charles E. Goodell, and the Democratic challenger, Representative Richard L. Ottinger.In 1972, Mr. Finkelstein founded the Westchester County-based Arthur J. Finkelstein & Associates with his brother Ronald. In the 1976 presidential campaign, he was credited with helping Reagan, in an unsuccessful bid to deny President Gerald R. Ford the nomination, win crucial Republican primaries in North Carolina and Texas.He later choreographed campaigns by his friend Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir, against Rudolph W. Giuliani in the 1989 Republican mayoral primary; a referendum to impose term limits on New York City elected officials; and races in Eastern Europe and in Israel, where he was recruited by supporters of Mr. Netanyahu and other conservative candidates of the Likud Party.\u201cI would always say, \u2018Arthur, do you realizes how much we\u2019re changing history?\u2019 \u201d his colleague George Birnbaum recalled. \u201cHe would say, \u2018I don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re changing history; we\u2019re touching history.\u2019\u201dPhilip Friedman, another political consultant, told The New York Times in 1994: \u201cFinkelstein is the ultimate sort of Dr. Strangelove, who believes you can largely disregard what the politicians are going to say and do, what the newspapers are going to do, and create a simple and clear and often negative message, which, repeated often enough, can bring you to victory.\u201dThanks largely to his brother\u2019s financial discipline, the messenger\u2019s firm prospered, too.His survivors include Mr. Curiale; their daughters, Jennifer Elizabeth Delgado and Molly Julia Baird-Kelly; a granddaughter; and his brothers, Ronald and Barry.Mr. Finkelstein smoked heavily, loved to gamble and was habitually rumpled.\u201cHe\u2019d walk through the door carrying a poll tucked under his arm and take off his shoes and unfasten his tie, leaving the ends dangling, and start pacing up and down in his stocking feet,\u201d Richard Morgan wrote in \u201cThe Fourth Witch\u201d (2008), describing a strategy session of the National Congressional Club. \u201cThen Tom Ellis would growl, \u2018O.K., you\u2019ve told me about the poll. Now tell me the ad,\u2019 and without blinking Arthur would go into a kind of trance and just dictate a 30-second ad.\u201dRarely photographed or interviewed, Mr. Finkelstein was unusually reflective during his 2011 public appearance in Prague, in which he discussed his accomplishments, the goals of negative campaigning and how television and the internet have altered politics since the eras of Goldwater, who remained one of his heroes, and Reagan.\u201cI went into this as a kid to change the world, because I was an absolute ideologue,\u201d he said. \u201cI would stand outside on soapboxes in Greenwich Village at 3 in the morning and argue with people about the nature of freedom.\u201cI said I wanted to change the world, I said I did, I made it worse,\u201d he added, without amplifying and, perhaps, with a dollop of self-deprecation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the middle initial of George Pataki, the former governor of New York.

{"Headline": "James Staley\u2019s Series of Unfortunate Events", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDays into a two-week sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Seumas Meharg reeled in a 150-pound yellowfin tuna.As the immense fish flailed on the deck, he tried to dispatch it with a knife. He stabbed the creature once, then took another shot. This time, his hand slipped, and the knife sliced deeply into his fingers.\u201cI went down to the galley, washed my hand, made a fist, sat down and was quite white,\u201d Mr. Meharg recalled.The sailboat\u2019s owner, James E. Staley, pulled out a satellite phone and dialed a doctor. Emergency stitches were a must. But help in Africa was three long days away; the Caribbean, a week and a half.So Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, got to work. While another mate did the stitching, Mr. Staley held down his friend and then helped tie the knots and mop up the blood.That incident, four years ago aboard the Bequia, is typical of Mr. Staley, now the chief executive of the British bank Barclays. Friends and colleagues said he reacts to problems quickly and sometimes impulsively, with dogged loyalty.Three decades ago, when his brother came out as gay, Mr. Staley began attending Act Up meetings. At the money management division of JPMorgan Chase, he ended a demeaning practice that required people who were fired to leave immediately with their belongings in a box. As a trustee of Bowdoin College, he helped install as president Clayton S. Rose, a longtime friend who was seen as an unconventional candidate because he didn\u2019t have tenure and had spent 20 years in banking before starting a second career in academia.But if Mr. Staley were a character from classical literature, his fidelity would be his tragic flaw.Since being named the chief executive of Barclays on Dec. 1, 2015, the 60-year-old American has come under investigation by British bank regulators for trying to unmask a whistle-blower who criticized the competency of one of his senior hires. He has lost the confidence of a major client, the powerful private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, which was angered by Mr. Staley\u2019s attempt to help his brother-in-law\u2019s business interests \u2014 at what KKR regarded as its expense.On a more prosaic note, he even fell for an email from a prankster, who, posing as the chairman of Barclays, pledged allegiance after a bruising annual investor meeting.Mr. Staley declined to be interviewed for this article, citing the whistle-blower investigation. But he agreed to let a reporter shadow him for a day while he worked.\u201cWe are done restructuring Barclays,\u201d he said that day in July at a town-hall meeting at the bank\u2019s office in Leeds in northern England. \u201cWe are going to make or break it based on what we\u2019re doing today and what we\u2019re doing here, in London, and in New York, and around the world. And I think it\u2019s going to pivot, sort of, the way the bank thinks about itself, because now the only thing that\u2019s going to work is us, if we make it work.\u201dMr. Staley\u2019s stumbles have spurred demands from some shareholders for his resignation. During the bank\u2019s second quarter, his asset sales led to a huge loss, which was compounded by disappointing trading results and sizable legal costs. Shares of Barclays are down 13 percent so far this year.His current quandary is an outgrowth of Barclays\u2019s transformation from a three-century-old British commercial and retail lender, with Quaker roots, into a global banking and trading powerhouse.In the 1980s, Wall Street banks arrived in London, and the city soon became the hub of global finance. Barclays decided it needed to compete with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and the like in trading and deal making. It brought in an American executive named Robert E. Diamond Jr. to build its investment banking business. And in the wake of the financial crisis, it acquired the United States\u2019 operations of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, giving it a large presence in New York.While the investment banking business brought growth, it also generated problems with regulators and a heavy legal cost. Mr. Diamond was jettisoned in 2012 after an investigation led to a $450 million fine over allegations that Barclays traders had manipulated an important interest rate benchmark known as Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate.The bank then turned to a retail banker, Antony Jenkins, as a safer steward of its business. But he, too, was ousted after a three-year turnaround effort that was deemed too slow.How much to emphasize investment banking over Barclays\u2019s traditional banking business in Britain continues to be a source of internal tension.Running Barclays \u201cis a challenge because of the structure of the bank,\u201d said Richard Portes, an economics professor at the London Business School.Under Mr. Staley, Mr. Portes said, \u201cit hasn\u2019t changed the strategy in terms of putting weight \u2014 a lot of weight \u2014 on the investment banking side of the business. Maybe that is a good call. It\u2019s not obvious.\u201dSo far, Mr. Staley has weathered an internal investigation and calls to throw him out at an annual shareholder meeting in May. But his ouster may still come due to an inquiry by a British regulator into his conduct toward the whistle-blower; the results of the inquiry are expected as early as this fall.In Britain, Barclays still has the cachet of a Goldman Sachs and the reach of a Bank of America. It was a major player in Africa for a century, and introduced the first automated cash machine in 1967. Last year, one of every three pounds spent in Britain was facilitated in some way by a Barclays credit card.But investigations and management missteps have turned its executive suite into a temporary office. Mr. Staley is the fifth chief executive in seven years.Despite the trouble, his strategy for reshaping the bank\u2019s operations has won praise from analysts and employees. To cut costs, preserve capital and strengthen Barclays in the eyes of regulators, he sold most of its African operations and cut the quarterly dividend to stockholders. He bolstered the company\u2019s commitment to investment banking, partly by working his own contacts in private equity and at multinational companies.But these efforts may not be enough.Mr. Staley was born in Cambridge, Mass., one of the many stops along his father\u2019s career as a plant manager of soap factories for Procter & Gamble. During high school, he was intrigued with politics, staying up late discussing the intricacies of Washington with friends.It was the 1970s, and the career guide \u201cWhat Color Is Your Parachute?\u201d had recently been published. \u201cI remember talking to him about the book,\u201d said John Farmer, a high school classmate who remains a close friend, \u201cand he said, \u2018I know what color my parachute is. It\u2019s green.\u2019 Meaning money.\u201dMr. Staley attended Bowdoin, in Maine, where he majored in economics. To make money, Staley spent two and a half summers mining trona, a mineral used to make baking soda, in Rock Springs, Wyo., where he lived in a tent by the Green River. He spent another summer working for a Pennsylvania congressman on Capitol Hill. But after graduation, he turned to Wall Street.In 1979, Mr. Staley landed at Morgan Guaranty, a forerunner to JPMorgan that was then primarily a commercial lender and bond dealer with asset-management and back-office services.He was soon transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he met his future wife, a 19-year-old college student named Debora Nitzan. After graduating from college, Ms. Nitzan worked for her family\u2019s business, an office furniture company called Aceco.In 1985, Mr. Staley\u2019s younger brother, Peter, was diagnosed as H.I.V. positive. During a painful series of conversations with his family that Thanksgiving, Peter revealed that he was both gay and ill. Jes was one of the last to be told.\u201cI sheepishly made it clear to him that I was most nervous to tell him, because I regarded him as homophobic,\u201d Peter recalled. \u201cHe looked at me quizzically and was baffled by that. He didn\u2019t realize the language he\u2019d been using over the years.\u201dBy 1989, Jes Staley was living in New York again and working to build Morgan into a full-service investment bank. He made a speedy professional ascent. In 2009 he was named to run the entire investment bank, a job reserved for executives with C.E.O. potential.Managing monster egos and ornery clients was one of his strengths. In 2004, when he engineered JPMorgan\u2019s $1.3 billion investment in the hedge fund Highbridge Capital as a way to increase returns for the bank\u2019s ultrawealthy investors, he preserved the Highbridge team\u2019s generous compensation terms and even prevented members of the bank\u2019s internal real estate division from visiting Highbridge\u2019s luxurious midtown Manhattan offices, fearing that they would alienate the Highbridge staff by insisting on cheaper space.\u201cJes understood that he had to run interference between us,\u201d said Glenn Dubin, one of Highbridge\u2019s founders. \u201cAnd he did that.\u201dOver a span of several years, the Highbridge deal helped sharply augment the client money JPMorgan Asset Management oversaw.Heavy hitters weren\u2019t the only ones to win Mr. Staley\u2019s attention. In 2002, after he joined the bank\u2019s operating committee, he halted a decision to force a woman who had been fired from the premises with her belongings in a box, insisting he would fire her manager if such humiliation occurred again. Underperforming employees would be given additional chances to prove themselves in other roles, he promised.A year or so into Mr. Staley\u2019s tenure at the investment bank, according to associates from that time, a personnel issue arose with another banker that would have ramifications for Mr. Staley years later.Tim Main, a respected banker who advised financial companies, was under duress from a divorce, according to these associates. Mr. Main was taking prescription medicine, they said, that affected his behavior when mixed with alcohol. During a management meeting with the bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, Mr. Main\u2019s speech was altered as he gave a report, said the associates from that time, and Mr. Dimon was concerned. Mr. Main soon took a sabbatical, they added, then he eventually left JPMorgan altogether.Mr. Staley, who was two notches above Mr. Main in the bank hierarchy, didn\u2019t know him well but respected the banker\u2019s professional achievements. Months later, when a smaller investment bank, Evercore Partners, called Mr. Staley for a reference, he recommended Mr. Main.Three years later, Mr. Staley left JPMorgan amid murmurs of discord with Mr. Dimon. He became a partner in the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital. The transition gave him time to pursue outside interests, including sailing the Atlantic with Mr. Meharg and working as a Bowdoin trustee.In 2014, he was chosen to lead the college\u2019s search committee for a new president. High on the list of candidates from Bowdoin\u2019s recruiting agency, said those involved with the process, was Clayton Rose, an old friend of Mr. Staley\u2019s from JPMorgan who had left banking to pursue academia. He earned a Ph.D., and then a teaching post at Harvard Business School.Mr. Staley was clearly a fan of Mr. Rose, these people said, but deferred to others through much of the screening process, fearing that a perception of positive bias might work against his old friend. Ultimately, Mr. Rose prevailed, winning the role by a unanimous vote.\u201cThe committee just rallied around Clayton because of his remarkable record of success throughout a varied career,\u201d said Mr. Staley in an announcement of the January 2015 decision.Soon after joining Barclays, Mr. Staley devised a strategy to cut what he regarded as nonessential businesses, freeze hiring to avoid laying people off, save costs by slashing the bank\u2019s quarterly dividend in half and refocus on both international investment banking and retail finance in Britain.On Wall Street, the idea of Barclays as a top-tier investment bank had become a stretch. Not only did it rank low among United States-based global advisers on big corporate mergers and stock and bond issuances, it suffered from the perception of a flawed culture, due to its role in the Libor scandal and other regulatory troubles.At a meeting with executives at the Blackstone Group, the world\u2019s biggest private equity firm, in 2016, Mr. Staley asked what Barclays could do to build up its book of banking businesses, according to people who attended. Providing a $100 million credit facility to one of Blackstone\u2019s energy funds would be a start, replied Bennett Goodman, a co-founder of its credit business.Though the economics weren\u2019t great, Mr. Staley agreed.Blackstone soon rewarded Barclays with additional work. At Apollo Global Management, another big private equity firm, the trajectory was similar. The company\u2019s relationship with Barclays has \u201cchanged dramatically since he arrived,\u201d said Leon Black, an Apollo founder and the firm\u2019s chairman and chief executive, referring to Mr. Staley, \u201cwhich speaks, one, of our relationship, and two, performance begets more business.\u201dTo further bolster the business, Mr. Staley then hired Tim Main to head the financial institutions advisory group within Barclays\u2019s investment bank.Not everyone welcomed the move. Shortly after it was announced, a letter was sent to Barclays\u2019s independent directors, according to people briefed on its details, complaining about Mr. Main\u2019s behavior during his rough spell at JPMorgan.When the letter was shared with Mr. Staley, he was troubled. In a note to employees, he said he had believed the intent of its writer was to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d their colleague.Hoping to defend Mr. Main, Mr. Staley asked fellow executives whether he could investigate the letter writer\u2019s identity, said one of these people. But since the letter was being treated internally as a \u201cwhistle blow,\u201d with protections around anonymity and against retaliation, colleagues told Mr. Staley to stand down, this person added.Yet weeks later, after the internal inquiry into the letter\u2019s allegations had been concluded and Mr. Main\u2019s hiring reaffirmed, Mr. Staley tried again, this time instructing Barclays\u2019s internal security team to track down the writer, Barclays said. The group made some effort, including asking the United States Postal Service for assistance through video footage, said a person with knowledge of its efforts. But ultimately, Barclays said, nothing came of their work.The following January, Barclays said, another whistle-blower contacted the board. This time, the complainant found fault with the entire whistle-blowing process at Barclays, mentioning Mr. Staley\u2019s handling of the Main letters.Barclays\u2019s directors hired a London law firm to investigate Mr. Staley\u2019s conduct. According to a statement on April 10, the firm found that Mr. Staley had \u201chonestly but mistakenly\u201d sought to unmask the writer without realizing the impropriety of his actions; the board accepted the explanation.But some lawyers said the entire chapter constitutes a grave breach of protocol, with broad implications for the bank.\u201cSeeking to identify the identity of the whistle-blower is a violation of the law,\u201d said Jordan Thomas, chairman of the whistle-blower practice at the New York law firm Labaton Sucharow, \u201cbut it also undermines the culture of integrity within Barclays.\u201dIf company executives have a reputation for retaliating against whistle-blowers, he added, \u201cthe leadership of Barclays will be disadvantaged because fewer people are going to be telling them about problems. And they\u2019ll learn about problems when they\u2019re at a more advanced stage.\u201dReading emails on his iPad the evening after the annual meeting, Mr. Staley responded enthusiastically to the message. \u201cThanks for sharing the foxhole with me,\u201d he wrote.The sender was in fact a disgruntled Barclays customer living near Manchester who was playing a prank. He shared his stunt on Twitter and then with The Financial Times, prompting merrymaking about Mr. Staley\u2019s gullibility.In recent months, lawyers for Mr. Staley have asserted that the letters objecting to Mr. Main were almost certainly written by someone outside Barclays, according to people with direct knowledge of their strategy \u2014 meaning not a whistle-blower in the conventional sense. Their hope, these people said, is that the argument somehow absolves him from the typical company restrictions around whistle-blowing.Yet as the writer\u2019s identity remains unknown, according to people who were briefed on the efforts to track him or her down, those arguments may fall flat. And with at least four major regulatory reviews now underway, among them probes from the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain and the United States Justice Department, some analysts and lawyers said he\u2019s on the knife\u2019s edge of professional survival.As if Barclays did not have enough distractions, Mr. Staley has become involved in another embarrassing squabble involving a major client of the bank, KKR.The dispute centers on KKR\u2019s 2014 investment in Aceco, the company founded by Mr. Staley\u2019s father-in-law decades ago that had gone from office furniture to data storage.KKR spent $700 million to acquire the company\u2019s debt and buy a majority stake in it from three sellers: Debora Staley, Mr. Staley\u2019s wife; Jorge Nitzan, her brother and the chief executive; and the private equity firm General Atlantic. But Aceco\u2019s fortunes soon turned, and in 2015, facing a cash crunch amid a broader swoon in the Brazilian economy, Aceco stopped paying off its creditors.By 2016, KKR had written its investment down to zero and was accusing Mr. Nitzan, who had been dismissed as chief executive, of foul play. Mr. Nitzan has denied the accusations, blaming Aceco\u2019s travails on the crashing Brazilian economy. KKR said whistle-blowers had claimed that there was accounting fraud at Aceco. The company has denied the allegations.Late in 2016, Alex Navab, an executive from KKR, called Mr. Staley to ask that Mr. Nitzan, Mr. Staley\u2019s wife and General Atlantic repay KKR for its investment.After that call, Mr. Staley felt he was being threatened by Mr. Navab, said someone who was briefed on its details. He asked a friend with his own private equity firm to consider investing in Aceco, which was then bankrupt, with Mr. Nitzan, its potential chief executive once again, said people who were briefed on those conversations. Then Mr. Staley vouched for Mr. Nitzan to two investors he knew who had lost money in KKR\u2019s failed Brazilian endeavor, said people who were briefed on the investors\u2019 conversations.Mr. Navab was unhappy when they heard of his actions, said someone with knowledge of his thinking at the time. KKR appeared to divert business that might have otherwise gone to Barclays. For Mr. Staley, who has been trying to bolster Barclays\u2019s private equity business, it was a real blow.On a drizzly Tuesday in July, Mr. Staley was at the Great Yorkshire Show, an annual agricultural fair not far from Leeds. With the whistle-blower investigations hanging over him, he was determined to focus on Barclays\u2019s core business. On that day, it meant visiting a sliding-door manufacturer the bank had helped finance, conducting the town-hall meeting and visiting with farmers for whom Barclays had recently doubled an existing 100 million pound investment pool.Inside the welcome tent, Simon Theakston, a local beer company scion, poured Mr. Staley a pint of bitter as a plate of hard cheese and Yorkshire pie was offered.Mr. Staley asked Mr. Theakston whether his company was publicly or privately owned.\u201cPrivately,\u201d the brewer said. \u201cMy brothers and I.\u201d\u201cNow I feel at home,\u201d said Mr. Staley, raising his pint glass. \u201cCheers.\u201dAfter half a drink and a chat with a farming union official, Mr. Staley walked down the muddy grounds of the fair, flanked by managers from Barclays\u2019s agriculture department. They stopped to talk to representatives from a rural charity and a luxury real estate company before strolling through the cattle-judging tents, where the stench of manure was powerful. In one stall, a cow appeared to be giving birth.\u201cThat might be a prolapse,\u201d said one of Mr. Staley\u2019s lieutenants, who walked on, chatting amiably with Mr. Staley about a brown bull\u2019s muscular physique.Hours later, he was on an express train back to London, sipping a drink with his communications managers and a young aide from his office. During the ride, Mr. Staley held forth on World War II, American politics and recent departures from JPMorgan. The possibility that he might have to leave his new one was not mentioned.Weeks earlier, he had interviewed Tim Throsby, president of the international unit of Barclays, at a company event in New York, said people who were there. Afterward, one of the employees in the audience asked him what he would have done if he had discovered the author of the letter that criticized Mr. Main.\u201cI should not have gotten that involved,\u201d Mr. Staley answered, according to a transcript of the remarks. \u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes. You know, I\u2019m sorry about it, but I\u2019m human.\u201dBen Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Smartphone App to Relieve Your Car-Buying Agony", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThese days, you can book plane tickets, buy appliances, pay for college, even schedule surgery with a few swipes and keystrokes on a smartphone.Buying a car is another matter. It retains much of the same analog agony as before: the haggling, the hours at the dealership, the gnawing worry of the fees, charges and rates behind the transaction.But progress is being made.The latest step forward comes from AutoGravity, a start-up based in Irvine, Calif., whose smartphone app for auto financing is gaining some traction. The app allows consumers to apply for and obtain approval for auto financing in a matter of minutes, and is now accepted at thousands of dealers across the country. It has been downloaded more than 500,000 times via the Apple and Android app stores.In July, Volkswagen\u2019s credit arm bought a stake in AutoGravity for a reported $30 million. That follows an equity investment by Daimler, parent of Mercedes-Benz, in February. AutoGravity started as a project within Daimler\u2019s financing arm and was set up as an independent company in 2015.The app addresses one of the most tedious steps in the car-purchasing process: waiting around, sometimes for hours, while the dealer tries to line up a loan. Nowadays, it\u2019s often quite a sum. Americans borrowed an average of $30,689 to buy new cars in July.Individual banks also make it possible to apply for loans by smartphone or online. But AutoGravity generates loan offers from up to four different institutions, allowing users to compare rates, payments and costs.\u201cWe are like Expedia or Travelocity, except for auto finance,\u201d said Andy Hinrichs, the company\u2019s chief executive, referring to the popular travel-booking sites.People can also shop for cars, browse the inventory of dealers in their area and compare prices on the app. After homing in on the type of car they want, users can apply for a loan.Most steps can be automated. Scanning the bar code from a driver\u2019s license populates basic personal information like name, address and date of birth. Employment history can be pulled from LinkedIn.A few months ago, Lisa Harrington, a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles, was shopping for a new car, and an acquaintance suggested she give AutoGravity a try. \u201cEven as an executive who negotiates for a living, it can be daunting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t easy, especially for women by themselves.\u201dShe decided on a Mercedes-Benz GLE, a cross between a sports coupe and a sport utility vehicle. The AutoGravity app let her check the models at a dealership, Fletcher Jones Motorcars, near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. From home she used the app to apply for credit and then went to the dealership with the lease financing already lined up.At the showroom, she merely picked out the color and trim level of the GLE she wanted. \u201cI was in and out,\u201d Ms. Harrington, 49, recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to deal with being in the dealership for a thousand hours, and this was definitely the most painless purchase I\u2019ve ever had buying a car.\u201dFletcher Jones Management, the owner of the Newport Beach dealership, thinks AutoGravity has the right idea, and has partnered to have the start-up create a version of the app tailored to the 17 dealerships it owns across four states.Auto dealers need to look for \u201cways of making ourselves more visual and ways of bringing the younger generation,\u201d said Keith May, the president of Fletcher Jones. Having an app geared toward how younger consumers shop \u201cgets us into their stream of consciousness,\u201d he added.Other apps and websites simplify various parts of the process.Hate haggling? TrueCar allows users to see average prices paid in their area for specific makes and models, and lets them print a certificate for a set price, eliminating most of the negotiation with the dealer.Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book both provide a wealth of data \u2014 specifications, reviews, trade-in values, manufacturer discounts \u2014 and help consumers connect with dealers offering attractive prices. AutoTrader is useful for searching in your area or nationwide for specific cars, colors and features you might desire, whether on a new or used car.Big dealer groups like AutoNation and Penske Automotive have apps and websites that allow you to carry out most of the buying process, but they are limited to the franchise dealerships they operate.More advances are coming. Mercedes-Benz Financial Services has developed technology that reduces the documents that a buyer must review and sign before getting the keys to a new car.A few dealerships in Texas and Florida have just started presenting documents in electronic form instead of paper, said Geoff Robinson, a vice president at the company. \u201cThe dealer shows them everything on a screen, and the customer gives one electronic signature that is populated on all the documents,\u201d he said.Instead of a folder with photocopies, the customer leaves with a thumb drive with the purchase receipt and other \u201cpaperwork.\u201dBut for now, no one has yet covered all the bases, allowing people to shop across all automotive makes and all dealerships, while providing financing options.Mr. Hinrichs said that was where AutoGravity hoped to go. The app recently added the ability to determine trade-in values drawn from Black Book, the source many dealerships use.Eventually he hopes AutoGravity will be able to become a means for automakers to target special offers to consumers. For someone shopping for a Honda Accord, for example, Nissan could provide a special deal on an Altima.\u201cPutting on marketing campaigns will be the value that AutoGravity will create for its partners,\u201d Mr. Hinrichs said. \u201cOnce we operate at scale, we want to provide unique offers that you can only find at AutoGravity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cuomo, who once doubted that congestion pricing would gain any traction in the state, is planning to resurrect the idea and will expend political capital to see it succeed.With voters increasingly blaming him for the transit mess, Mr. Cuomo is working behind the scenes to draft a proposal and is using Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s failed campaign as a lesson to improve its chances of winning the support of stakeholders, including the State Legislature.\u201cCongestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. He declined to provide specifics about how the plan would work and what it would charge, but said that he had been meeting with \u201cinterested parties\u201d for months and that the plan would probably be substantially different from Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s proposal.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s proposal was part of a broader plan for sustainable growth in the city and a major part of his environmental agenda.At the time, the city\u2019s subway system was ascendant, but the plan would have raised at least $500 million annually that could have been used to counter festering problems, including a fraying transit infrastructure.But despite the support of then-Gov. David A. Paterson, the plan failed in part because of stiff opposition from elected officials from Brooklyn and Queens, as well as the suburbs, who viewed it as primarily benefiting Manhattan at the expense of their constituents.With the subway riddled with problems, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, believes that the political dynamics and public opinion have shifted.\u201cFor people to make basic change in their own life is hard,\u201d he said. \u201cFor society, which is now the collective, to make basic change is hard.\u201dHe noted that in a time of crisis or hardship, legislation that might not otherwise be politically feasible can often be achieved. For example, he was able to secure some of the nation\u2019s most stringent gun control measures after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. While that traumatizing example was of a far different magnitude, the subway system is the backbone of New York and its decline imperils the city\u2019s economic vitality.\u201cThere is an awareness of the need to make a basic policy shift,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Congestion pricing is also no longer such a novel concept. Cities across the world, like London and Stockholm, have adopted systems that have succeeded in reducing traffic and improving public transit.Still, the politics of congestion pricing remain thorny.For one, the tax plan supported by Mr. de Blasio, who is also a Democrat, has also previously failed to gain support in Albany.He first proposed the tax to finance his program to provide universal prekindergarten. This time he believes the situation is different. \u201cI think the fact that there is a subway crisis, it\u2019s affecting everyone, including suburban residents,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters in announcing his tax proposal. \u201cBut we\u2019re saying we\u2019re only asking that New York City residents who are wealthy pay that tax. I think that\u2019s a sweet spot.\u201dMr. Cuomo still believes Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tax plan would face long odds in the Legislature, especially in the Republican-controlled Senate \u2014 and the chamber\u2019s Republican leadership has already opposed it. As for a congestion pricing plan, Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor, said in an email that \u201cwe\u2019ll review any serious and viable plan the governor puts forward.\u201dA spokesman for the Senate Republicans declined to comment on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s revival of congestion pricing. Mr. Bloomberg, through a spokesman, also declined to weigh in on the renewed interest.The debate about how to provide long-term funding for the subway is part of the continuing conflict between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo over how to tackle the transit system\u2019s woes.Neither congestion pricing nor a new tax would deal with the immediate needs or fund the emergency plan that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, has undertaken to make urgent repairs to trains, signals and other equipment. The state has contributed $400 million to start the work and has asked the city to provide the other $400 million needed to pay the total cost.So far, the city has refused.Those emergency funds \u2014 largely to be used to make stopgap repairs to aging equipment \u2014 are only a part of what is needed to get the system back into full repair.Unlike a tax on wealthy New Yorkers, which would be limited in scope and affect a relatively small number of people, congestion pricing would have a far broader impact on people inside and outside the city.After Mr. Cuomo\u2019s past skepticism that state lawmakers would support congestion pricing, his willingness now to support the idea may improve its fortunes in Albany. \u201cWith his bold embrace of congestion pricing, the governor is providing the kind of leadership that New Yorkers are starving for,\u201d Mr. Matthiessen said.Move NY recently unveiled a congestion pricing plan that attracted widespread attention and support from some elected officials. With a goal of spreading the burden more equitably, the plan features notable differences from the Bloomberg proposal, including lowering some tolls while creating new ones.The group projects that its plan would yield roughly $1.47 billion in annual revenue and proposes directing $1.1 billion to public transit and the rest to the city\u2019s bridges and roads.Drivers would pay a toll of $5.54 in each direction at four bridges that cross the East River into Manhattan \u2014 the Ed Koch Queensboro, the Brooklyn, the Manhattan and the Williamsburg. In Manhattan, drivers crossing 60th Street northbound or southbound would also be charged a $5.54 toll, including along the West Side Highway and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.At the same time, the plan would reduce other tolls by as much as 48 percent at other crossings, including the Cross Bay-Veterans\u2019 Memorial in Queens; the Henry Hudson, linking the Bronx and Manhattan; and the Throgs Neck, between the Bronx and Queens.Mr. Matthiessen said his group had been discussing the proposal with the Cuomo administration and was hopeful that political momentum was moving in its direction.Several months ago, Mr. Cuomo said, the state had quietly started a pilot program to limit the number of trucks in Manhattan during peak hours by offering them an incentive, through lower tolls, to conduct their work overnight.\u201cTo me, it has shown promise,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the issues was it requires people to make fundamental changes in the way they do business and the way they travel.\u201dMr. Cuomo is optimistic that the moment may be ripe for fundamental change on a vaster scale as he pursues a far more transformative traffic program.\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201csociety needs a wake-up call that readjusts their priorities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Jeep Ought to Be for Keeps", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSelling Jeep would leave Sergio Marchionne nowhere to hide.The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief executive advocates using mergers to stop carmakers wasting precious capital. Offloading the company\u2019s top brand to the Great Wall Motor Company, whose president has indicated interest, could raise billions of dollars. But it would leave an emaciated rump.With a market value of some $15 billion, Great Wall may struggle to secure financing or Beijing\u2019s approval for a deal larger than itself. Even if it succeeded, the Trump administration and Congress are likely to balk at allowing such a large and iconic American brand to end up in Chinese hands.Fiat Chrysler, though, does need to do something. It is already the earnings straggler among the major automakers. Its pretax margin last year, at 2.8 percent, was the lowest of the group. Ford Motor and General Motors both cranked out just over 7 percent.Things are improving as Mr. Marchionne shrugs off more of the debt that resulted in part from taking over Chrysler after the United States government-backed bankruptcy exit in 2009. But Fiat Chrysler is the only one of the top 12 that Wall Street analysts reckon will fail to earn more than a 6 percent pretax margin in each of the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.The $23 billion a Jeep sale might bring, according to Morgan Stanley, could be tempting, whether Great Wall or another carmaker ends up the buyer. It would clean up the balance sheet. Deep-pocketed players like Google, Apple and Intel are new rivals in the race toward autonomous driving. Lacking investment firepower, Mr. Marchionne has stayed largely on the technological sidelines, though last week he took his company into the Intel-Mobileye-BMW alliance.Yet handing the keys to Jeep to a new owner would combust even the modest earnings that are currently anticipated. The brand may account for almost three-quarters of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization next year, reckons Morgan Stanley. Ram trucks, Maserati and three captive parts makers are still profitable, but Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Chrysler are in the red. On top of that, the company still has more than $5 billion of both net debt and unfunded pensions.Mr. Marchionne is expected to step down next year to concentrate on running Ferrari. A radical move like selling Jeep would certainly leave a mark. But it would set up his last lap at what remained of Fiat Chrysler to be a dismal one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2 Senators Question Effects of a Reverse Mortgage Proposal", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvocates for the elderly persuaded federal housing officials two years ago to offer more rights and protections to the spouse of a borrower who takes out a reverse mortgage and later dies.Now there is concern that a small wording change in the Trump administration\u2019s proposed budget request for the Department of Housing and Urban Development could undo some of those protections \u2014 potentially increasing the chances that a surviving spouse who did not sign the mortgage documents could lose a home in a foreclosure.The senators have yet to receive a response from the housing agency about its intent for reverse mortgages, investment products that allow the elderly to tap the equity they have built up in their homes. And that is causing some concern.\u201cOur sense is it is bad drafting, but when bad drafting goes through, it can lead to bad policy,\u201d Alys Cohen, a staff lawyer in Washington with the National Consumer Law Center, said Tuesday. \u201cAnd you can lose control of things once you have new language.\u201dThe three-decade-old market for reverse mortgages is a niche one \u2014 there are about one million such loans outstanding.But reverse mortgages are viewed as crucial pieces in helping an aging population plan for retirement, and new lenders are coming into the market. The loans permit an elderly person to borrow against the equity in his or her home and avoid making any monthly payments until the borrower either dies or sells the house.Before the change in policy two years ago, a surviving spouse who had not signed the mortgage document often had to pay what was left on the loan in full or risk being evicted in a foreclosure.In their May 31 letter, the senators referred to the old policy as a \u201cloophole\u201d that had \u201ccompounded the stress faced by widows and widowers at a time when they were already grieving the loss of their spouse.\u201dThe phrase appears in a section of the housing act discussing what kinds of reverse mortgages are eligible for insurance guarantees from the Federal Housing Administration, a division of HUD.The revised wording would seem to suggest that a surviving spouse is not necessarily entitled to stay in the home. At the same time, however, the budget proposal includes a new line that would give the secretary of HUD wide discretion to determine when a loan is payable after the death of the borrower.\u201cHUD\u2019s proposed changes to reverse mortgages included in the last budget raised concerns that the administration may be seeking to undo hard-fought existing protections,\u201d Ms. Cortez Masto said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. \u201cI hope the administration can make clear that they\u2019re not looking to push seniors out of their homes after the death of their spouse.\u201dH.U.D. declined to comment.Making the wording change all the more perplexing is that the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, the industry\u2019s primary trade group, has not pushed for any regulatory changes over the ability of a surviving spouse to stay in a home after the death of a spouse.HUD extended the protections to surviving spouses after a series of lawsuits and critical news coverage about spouses losing their homes after the death of a partner.Controversy over reverse mortgages is not new.It is an industry that has drawn its fair share of scorn for using Hollywood actors to hawk its loans on late-night television advertisements. Some consumer advocates have complained that the reverse mortgage business preys on the financially ill-informed, who might be better off simply selling their homes and banking the cash.The market peaked in 2008, when the industry funded 114,923 loans, but it fell off sharply during the financial crisis, according to Reverse Market Insight. The industry has slowly rebounded with 48,732 loans funded in 2016 and 24,000 this year as of the end of May.Many predict that with home prices rising again and a growing number of baby boomers reaching retirement age, there will be a revival in this market as the elderly look to supplement their living expenses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Camping Today: Goodbye Pup Tent; Hello Wi-Fi", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayIf you\u2019re planning to spend the last weeks of summer sleeping under the stars, you won\u2019t be alone. A new wave of campers is taking to the great outdoors, though you might not find them in A-frame tents. They\u2019re in tree houses and Airstreams, king beds and plush robes, prompting campgrounds to install Wi-Fi, and inspiring start-ups to build hotel-caliber apps and websites for discovering and booking campsites with zip lines and fine food.About 13 million households in the United States planned to camp more this year than last year, according to research conducted by Cairn Consulting Group for Kampgrounds of America. More than a million new households have started camping each year since 2014, the company said, adding that millennials are now about 38 percent of the 75 million active camper households in America, up from 34 percent last year. Kampgrounds has been experiencing year-over-year growth for several years, yet last year was the best in its 57-year history. And it expects this year to top that.Through its website and iPhone app, Tentrr allows users to book at least 15 acres of private land and a fully equipped campsite that includes lounge chairs, a queen-size cot, a picnic table, a stone fire pit and a large canvas tent (already set up, of course). The idea is to make camping \u201cas accessible and as easy as booking an Uber to LaGuardia,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Agostino said. \u201cAnd I think that resonates with millennials who are used to experiences on demand, whether booking a car or a flight.\u201dThe Tentrr app allows users to also book experiences \u2014 skeet shooting, big breakfast spreads, yoga by the pond \u2014 or simply order more firewood from the CampKeeper. Some 40 percent of Tentrr campers are first-time campers. Mr. D\u2019Agostino said they\u2019re young families; millennials living in studio apartments in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or their parents\u2019 attics, who want personalized, affordable luxury. Tentrr, he said, gives them a comfortable, stylish place to enjoy the outdoors with privacy and thousands of dollars of equipment that they don\u2019t have to buy and store just because they want to take a couple of camping trips a year.Last summer was Tentrr\u2019s first season. It had 35 campsites in the Catskills. This year, it has about 300 campsites throughout New England, and there are plans to expand to the Pacific Northwest later this year. (A search for a campsite for two on a September weekend turned up properties in Big Indian, N.Y., for $135.) In the next four to five years, Mr. D\u2019Agostino hopes Tentrr will have around 100,000 campsites.Camping \u2014 historically an \u201colder, Caucasian, empty-nester-type activity\u201d as Ms. O\u2019Rourke put it \u2014 is attracting younger, more diverse individuals and families with hectic schedules and disposable income who are seeking healthy ways to de-stress. But not on just any patch of grass. The campground atmosphere matters. They want nice patios, food service, seating areas and fire rings for groups, which, Ms. O\u2019Rourke said, is typically how millennials travel. The average number of people they go camping with? Ten, Ms. O\u2019Rourke said. They want activities like hiking, kayaking and mountain biking. They also want to surf \u2014 the internet, that is.Despite the challenges and cost of bringing free Wi-Fi to a campground, Ms. O\u2019Rourke said it has become important, and that Kampgrounds is trying to make sure that all of its sites have strong Wi-Fi. People will camp on average two days longer, she said, if they can access their email.\u201cNo one really truly disconnects,\u201d she said.In addition to Wi-Fi, campgrounds are investing in enhancements like swimming pools and zip lines, and novel places to sleep like tepees and glamping tents. These sorts of unique accommodations are blossoming throughout the country, along with slick apps and websites to find them.You can hardly blame a backcountry purist for scoffing at glamping, fancy fireside dinners, tents with no assembly required and apps that allow you to order firewood on demand.Yet at the end of the day, Mr. D\u2019Agostino said it\u2019s not about deluxe accouterments. A former investment banker in New York City, he said that for years, his life was largely not his own.\u201cThe delight, in my experience,\u201d he said, speaking from somewhere in the Catskills, \u201cis coming from that nostalgia that we all have for sitting around a campfire and watching a shooting star.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Years After Acid Attack, an Afghan Story of Survival Takes a Dark Turn", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Mumtaz\u2019s new baby still has no name.Mumtaz is a 23-year-old woman from the northern Afghan province of Kunduz, the victim of an acid attack when she was 18, whose tormentors were jailed. It was a rare legal victory in the struggle for women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan, hailed at the time as proof that justice for female victims was possible.But as far as Mumtaz is concerned, justice has brought her nothing but tragedy.Last month she was widowed, her husband killed by relatives of her attackers. When his body was brought to her, she went through his pockets in desperation and found 2,000 afghanis, about $28, which was the only money he left her.Last week that money ran out when her first child, an 18-month-old daughter, Asma, became sick and Mumtaz spent what was left on a doctor.Before his death, her husband, Mohammad Khan, had bought a treat for Mumtaz, a large can of powdered milk. She was due to give birth in September and that would help with the baby\u2019s nutrition.But Mumtaz and Asma had little to eat besides bread and tea, so they finished off the milk last week. \u201cI have no hope. I have nothing,\u201d she said.Then, on Monday her second child was born prematurely, a month early but otherwise healthy. \u201cThere was no joy in her birth. For two days I could not even look at her,\u201d said Mumtaz, who like many rural Afghans uses only one name.Most of Mumtaz\u2019s own family, including her parents and all of her siblings, are now stuck in a Turkish refugee camp, unable to send her anything. She lives with her dead husband\u2019s family, who are just as poor, and now unable to work their fields for fear of being killed themselves.Even if anyone wanted to help, Taliban insurgents have made her area of Kunduz impassable to aid groups and government officials.This is the sad outcome to what was once hailed as an improbable success story in Afghanistan\u2019s effort to eliminate violence against women. Mumtaz\u2019s situation shows how difficult it is to protect women in the face of continuing conflict, in which chronic insecurity leads to the use of violence to enforce male prerogatives.Mumtaz and one of her sisters were sent to India for facial reconstruction surgery. Despite her worst fears that her fianc\u00e9 would no longer want her, he married her when she returned. Three years later, their daughter Asma was born.Five months ago, the spurned suitor who led the 2011 attack, Naseer, was caught and arrested and now faces a long prison sentence. That was when Mumtaz\u2019s fortunes, which had been looking brighter, took a turn for the worse. Her struggles underscore how little control the national government has over large areas of Afghanistan.Her family\u2019s village in rural Kunduz Province was overrun by the Taliban, and the militiamen who followed Naseer joined the insurgents; many of the numerous armed groups in Afghanistan change sides depending on who dominates their area.Mumtaz\u2019s father, Sultan Mohammed, refused demands from Naseer\u2019s relatives to withdraw the charges against him and his men, so they kidnapped his older brother, who was released after village elders intervened.Sultan Mohammed, badly beaten up by Naseer\u2019s men, decided to flee his country. \u201cI could not fight them, and I could not stay there, so I took my entire family and escaped to Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cI fled thinking they won\u2019t do any harm to my son-in-law and my daughter.\u201dWhen Mumtaz became pregnant again early this year, she and her husband excitedly discussed names: He chose Amir Khan in case it was a boy, and said she could decide on the name for a girl.But so far, the girl has no name; Mumtaz said she has been unable to choose one because she has been too distraught over the burden of another child to feed to think of a name. So nurses in the hospital gave the infant a temporary nickname, Husna.Mumtaz said her husband, 27, had been on his way home last month from his work as a taxi driver when Naseer\u2019s brother, Zabih, and another man, Baba, stopped Mr. Khan, dragged him out of the car and beat him to death with the butts of their rifles. Both men have been charged with murder but have not been arrested because the authorities cannot safely visit the area.Now Mumtaz is sorry she ever pressed charges against her tormentors. \u201cI regret that I didn\u2019t pardon them before they killed my husband,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had been begging for that, but we were late to do it, so it cost me the life of my husband.\u201dEven before the new baby was born, her father said his daughter\u2019s situation was hopeless. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she will cope with all that,\u201d he said. \u201cHer in-laws are not able to take revenge or protect her; they are very poor people. She needs to get out somehow.\u201dLast week her husband\u2019s killers came back to their village, knocking on doors at night, trying to find her relatives.\u201cHer case is one of our oldest ones,\u201d said Shamila Sahibzada, the organization\u2019s provincial director. \u201cWe would very much like to have her under our protection, but unfortunately we have no access to her.\u201dIn the meantime, Mumtaz has no expectations. She said she has run out of medication to treat the chronic pain from some of her acid wounds, which were on her body as well as her face.All her husband left her, other than the $28 and the powdered milk, was a carpet to sleep on. \u201cI have nothing left from him, but I still love him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very hard to live like this. There is no one to share the pain with. I don\u2019t know what the future will be like for my daughters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kazakhstan! Nomads! Genghis Khan! What I actually found, of course, were broad boulevards full of cars, jazz bars and Burger Kings, people walking through parks with their children eating ice cream, waiting for buses, shopping for potatoes. Bus stops displayed the covers of classic novels (\u201cJane Eyre,\u201d \u201cThe Last of the Mohicans\u201d), which could be downloaded to phones on the spot for reading while waiting for the next bus.On the other hand, one option for a pizza topping is horse meat. And the sushi rolls are made with cheese.On the Expo grounds, the visitors were overwhelmingly Kazakh \u2014 the official figure was 85 percent \u2014 and they had more than a hundred nations\u2019 pavilions to explore. The exhibits were chock-full of models and videos of windmill turbines and solar panels. And more windmills. And more solar panels. But there were variations. The German pavilion (motto: \u201cEnergy on Track\u201d) had, besides its algae-powered house, a hollow seesaw filled with water. As children rocked up and down, the water poured back and forth through blades, spinning them and generating the energy to turn on a light.Israel (\u201cThe Energy of Creation\u201d) had a (Popeye-inspired?) display about turning spinach leaves into hydrogen fuel as well as a lovely young dancer who performed an interpretive dance on the themes of solar and thermal power and alternative fuels transportation. Azerbaijan (\u201cLand of Energy\u201d) was proud to promote so-called burning ice (gas hydrates), flammable gas-filled frozen water that is found in the Caspian Sea and promises, the display said, to provide more power than all the world\u2019s oil and gas.

Future energy.Iran, in its display on solar energy, announced that \u201ctoday the sun has taken off its veil.\u201d Several Muslim nations managed to meld religion with a newfound devotion to green energy. Qatar quoted Muhammad himself as a proto-environmentalist: \u201cDo not waste water, even if you perform your ablution on the banks of an abundantly flowing river.\u201d Not to be outdone, Israel, in its showpiece video, quoted a prior Authority: \u201cLet there be light.\u201dI caught a much livelier performance on Solomon Islands national day, when a group of dancer/musicians, their bodies painted, clad only in loincloths, performed canoe paddling chants of their ancestors with infectious energy. The crowd loved them.As at any world\u2019s fair, participating countries took the opportunity to present messages about themselves beyond their devotion to algae and windmills. Cuba showcased its rum and cigars (sadly, I missed its national day, when it was giving out free samples). Finland wanted people to know that it is the most stable country in the world, and that it offers free school lunches. Russia wanted it known that, with the aid of President Vladimir Putin, it is protecting the Amur tiger. Russia also declared its strong interest in the Arctic, which, one display informed visitors, occupies 27 million square kilometers and, perhaps more to the point, contains 130 billion tons of oil and natural gas. Russia also displayed a purported four-meter-tall block of Arctic ice, which would seem to limit access to those resources. But not to worry, another display said: \u201cThe Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker ship Lider will be able to break ice more than 4 m thick.\u201dThat was then. When I clicked that link I reached a page that said \u201cThank you for your interest in this subject. Stay tuned as we continue to update whitehouse.gov.\u201dThe main elements of the U.S. pavilion were two videos that posed the question, \u201cWhat is the source of infinite energy?\u201d And they provided an answer. Solar power? Nope. Windmills? Nope. \u201cPeople are. You. Me. All of us together.\u201dThe first video emphasized American ingenuity, with images of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, and the garages where they did their early work. For current examples of ingenuity addressing energy needs, it cited teeny-tiny windmills that can power a mobile phone, a flashlight powered by the heat of the hand that holds it, and a soccer ball that generates and stores energy while being kicked and can be used, postgame, to light homes in the Third World. (The teeny-tiny windmills were developed by scientists at the University of Texas and remain a concept. The flashlight was the creation of a Canadian high school student who appeared with it on \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\u201d; it too remains a concept. The soccer ball, invented by a Harvard undergraduate, was produced for a while but is no longer.)The second video featured two attractive dancers moving among iconic American images \u2014 a rodeo, football, Mount Rushmore, Hollywood, and lots of happy families, of all races, smiling and hugging. I heard there had been complaints that the video was contentless, but I saw it three times, and every time the Kazakhs watching with me applauded.The centerpiece of the Expo, literally, was the Kazakhstan exhibit, housed in a structure billed as the world\u2019s largest spherical building, 100 meters tall, a giant marble that one hoped would not roll off its pedestal while one was in it. It contained a terrific museum, with clever displays telling you everything you\u2019d ever want to know about every kind of energy, and more, from the creation of the universe to a solar-powered car that looked like it had been crushed in a giant sandwich press. From the high floors one had a clear view of the surreal buildings of Astana and also of where Astana abruptly ended, at the edge of the vast Eurasian steppe, stretching flat to the horizon in all directions.To modern Kazakhstan\u2019s credit, it remembers and memorializes these women, all with the encouragement of Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been president of the country since independence in 1991 and regularly wins re-election with at least 95 percent of the vote. Mr. Nazarbayev is no model democratic leader \u2014 he presides over an unfree press and multiple human rights abuses \u2014 but, judging by Astana and its inhabitants, he seems content to share the country\u2019s wealth. The Expo was his idea, and so was Astana, and so are its monuments, most notably the 97-meter-tall Bayterek Tower, which, when I was there, was mobbed by Kazakh tourists in town for the Expo. They stood in long lines for elevators up to a golden ball that perches atop what looks like an enormous badminton birdie. Once inside the ball, they waited in line again to approach a silver pedestal topped by a solid block of gold with a handprint of Mr. Nazarbayev. Each put his or her own hand into the print and made a wish.So did I, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the president of Kazakhstan has large hands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sending Health to Rural Ghana via Traveling Medics", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesABOSAMSO, Ghana \u2014 Hayford Amponsam was making his daily rounds in this small town in south-central Ghana when he came across an infant who was dangerously ill. She had bloody diarrhea and had been coughing up thick mucus for days. Her mother had only sought treatment from a nearby traditional healer.As a member of Ghana\u2019s inaugural class of 20,000 community health workers, or CHWs, Amponsam, who hails from the area, had been trained for such a situation. He suggested they set off for the nearest health clinic immediately. He carried the girl the 10 minutes it took to cover the one-kilometer journey by foot.\u201cWe were told,\u201d he said, that \u201cif she hadn\u2019t reached there at that time, we don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d The infant was treated and, after several days, released. Every afternoon for the next week, Amponsam dropped by the house to monitor the girl\u2019s improvement, offering suggestions on how to keep her healthy.\u201cThe mother was joyous,\u201d he said. The following Sunday she stood up in the church they both attend, telling the congregation that Amponsam had saved her daughter\u2019s life.In Ghana, the government has long relied on local volunteers to deliver health care services to those who live far from the nearest facility. But government officials say the needs are too great to rely too much on those volunteers, who can grow fatigued by the demands.So now the Ghanaian government has begun to pay CHWs. Other countries have attempted similar initiatives, but the scale and the speed of Ghana\u2019s effort make it distinctive. If it succeeds, it could signal a path toward universal health programs for other countries.No one is following Ghana\u2019s progress more closely than the American pediatrician and public health specialist Sonia Sachs. The four-year-old campaign is her brainchild, drawing on lessons from the Millennium Villages Project that her husband, the economist Jeffrey Sachs, started in 2004. That project, carried out across 14 sites in 10 countries, attempted to wed a variety of interventions to help lift rural communities out of poverty.Among them were paid CHWs drawn from local areas. Though Sonia Sachs is still analyzing the research from the overall project, she says that \u201cthere were certain things that were obvious right then and there.\u201d One of them was simply that paid CHWs \u201creally save lives.\u201d That spurred her to start the campaign.Paying CHWs has long been a subject for debate, however. Some critics of the practice argue that it destroys a spirit of volunteerism that draws people to the positions in the first place. Communities and humanitarian organizations across the developing world have experimented with offering alternate incentives, including providing volunteers with T-shirts and bicycles. Others emphasize the social status conferred in being selected and trained as a CHW.Debra Singh, whose doctoral research in Uganda focused on how to motivate volunteer CHWs, found that alongside regular training, intangible returns like earning the gratitude of their community could play an important role in retaining volunteers. But she acknowledged that the trend today is toward remuneration, especially as more responsibilities are layered on the CHWs.She cautioned, though, that as governments move to introduce paid CHWs, they must consider how they will maintain those programs. When Ethiopia began to pilot its now widely celebrated Health Extension Worker program in 2002, it pulled together a mixture of funds from regional governments, the national government and donors. The program now supports more than 38,000 health extension workers, but manages to pay them only about $35 per month \u2014 a small salary even by the standards of one of Africa\u2019s poorest countries.Starting in 2013, the Sachs team began working intensively with 10 countries on strategies to introduce or increase CHWs and pay them a minimum wage, even as it searched for outside funding to support those plans. The idea quickly gained traction in Ghana, a country that in 2000 had already begun a transition from a health system driven by where facilities existed, toward a new focus on delivery of services to communities in need.That year the government began introducing basic health outposts around the country staffed with community health officers trained in community-based medicine who could circulate in their areas and boost prevention strategies. They also called on volunteers to supplement those efforts, but over time, Nsarko said, those volunteers became less and less engaged in those outreach efforts.The agency had been formed to create jobs for secondary school graduates younger than 35, to help curb the country\u2019s severe youth unemployment problem. It is funded by a tax on mobile phone users. The Sachs team suggested that if CHWs met the agency\u2019s criteria, YEA could hire them and fold them into the health system.Mahama agreed initially to use YEA to hire 5,000 of the more than 30,000 CHWs the campaign was requesting. The country\u2019s parliament raised that number to 20,000 for two years at a cost of $25 million for the initial two years, enough to pay each CHW a salary of roughly $100 per month at the time the program started.More than 100,000 young people applied for the positions when they were announced at the beginning of 2016, according to Nsarko, and the final 20,000 were selected after interviews with community leaders. Their training was completed by August and they were gradually deployed by the end of 2016.The participants\u2019 first task was to conduct a thorough survey of their communities. Each CHW was assigned roughly 100 households, and spent weeks going door to door asking about peoples\u2019 health and noting those with potential needs like diabetics or women experiencing complicated pregnancies. They continue to make those rounds and follow up with people who require extra attention. And they will gradually take on more responsibilities, like coordinating vaccination campaigns.Nsarko is anticipating results that exceed Ethiopia\u2019s. While that country\u2019s program focuses primarily on assisting mothers and young children, Ghana\u2019s CHWs train to provide a range of emergency and preventive health services to everyone.There have been some problems. While the government has agreed to pay the CHWs\u2019 salaries, funding gaps remain. Some training sessions were shortened because money had run out, and there have been delays in payments to the CHWs since a new president, Nana Akufo-Addo, came into office in January. YEA officials said the interruptions were temporary, while they were cleaning up the payroll. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the new administration will be as committed to the program as Mr. Mahama was.Back in Abosamso, Richard Appiah Kusi, a community health officer who helps oversee the CHWs, expresses confidence in them, saying that while the delays have caused anxiety, \u201cthey will not leave.\u201d\u201cThe CHWs,\u201d he said, \u201care willing to work.\u201dAndrew Green is a freelance foreign correspondent based in Berlin who writes primarily about health and human rights.

{"Headline": "What Qualifies a Woman to Compete as a Woman? An Ugly Fight Resumes", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesFor the past two years, Dutee Chand could be herself.She didn\u2019t have to feel pressure to change her body so it conformed to rules or contemplate quitting her sport \u2014 pressure placed on her after doctors subjected her to gender testing in 2013, humiliating her by doing so, when she was only 17.For two years, she could just be Dutee Chand. That\u2019s because, two years ago last month, the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is the supreme court for global sports, temporarily suspended an international track and field rule that had barred her from competing as a woman.Chand, a sprinter from India, and women like her were excluded because their bodies produced a high amount of testosterone. It was often so high it was classified as being within the male range, a situation the authorities considered an unfair advantage. The only way these women could compete, track and field officials ruled, was if they took hormone-suppressing drugs or had surgery to limit the amount of testosterone their bodies produced.The I.A.A.F. has until the end of September to file its new evidence with the court. If that information is not convincing, the hyperandrogenism rule that once barred Chand from competing could be wiped from the rule book.Any decision will have profound consequences for Chand, who failed to make it out of the heats at the 2016 Rio Games. And it will affect elite athletes, like Caster Semenya, the Olympic champion in the 800 meters, who have faced similar questions \u2014 and similar indignities \u2014 merely for competing with the bodies they were born with.The event that yielded the most glaring advantage was the hammer throw, an edge the paper put at 4.53 percent. The pole vault (2.94 percent), the 400-meter hurdles (2.78 percent), the 400 (2.73 percent) and the 800 (1.78 percent) were found to have smaller, yet significant, advantages for competitors with hyperandrogenism, but all were far below the 10 to 12 percent advantage generally recognized as the performance difference between men and women.That\u2019s an important point. In 2015, the court said the I.A.A.F. might want to reconsider barring women with hyperandrogenism from the female category \u201cif the degree of advantage were well below 12 percent.\u201dFor Chand, who competes in races decided by fractions of a second, this focus on numbers and percentages is not merely a theoretical debate. It has made her anxious about her fate.In a statement, Chand and her lawyers contended that the I.A.A.F. study failed to clear the high bar set by the court\u2019s ruling two years ago. They appear to be right. On its own, the study is hardly the slam dunk the I.A.A.F. probably hoped it would be.But nothing about this issue is a slam dunk.Dr. Eric Vilain, a medical geneticist, helped create the International Olympic Committee\u2019s hyperandrogenism policy, which requires a competitor with the condition to undergo treatment that lowers her testosterone levels. But he admitted that the policy was not perfect, and that it couldn\u2019t be perfect.Determining whether a single athlete has an advantage over others is \u201cbasically impossible,\u201d Vilain said, because looking at performance through the lens of only one variable, like high levels of testosterone, ignores too many others \u2014 training regimen, height, limb length, nutrition \u2014 that can contribute to success.This issue could be made simpler, according to Dr. Myron Genel, a Yale professor emeritus and longtime consultant to the I.O.C.\u2019s medical commission, if the governing bodies would finally listen to the advice that he and others had given them more than two decades ago.\u201cI think all elite competition at an elite level is unfair, in one form or another,\u201d Genel said.But will it ever be perfectly fair? Could it ever be perfectly fair? Not when so many different qualities come together to make athletes successful. And not when gender distinctions are changing so rapidly.Not every governing body is equipped to rule on these kind of eligibility questions. Not every athlete fits into this box, or that one.To Chand, though, the issue of hyperandrogenism in sports is clear cut. She grew up as a girl. At 21, she is a proud young woman. She wants to race as one.On Saturday, she did. But in the coming months, the Court of Arbitration for Sport will decide whether letting her continue to do so is fair.What if it gets it wrong?Email: juliet@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moving Past Health Care, White House Looks to Tax Reform", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration insisted on Monday, in a show of unity with one of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest financial backers, that its plan to rewrite the tax code would be a collaborative and ultimately successful process.In a scene that demonstrated the pressure the administration is under to deliver on that promise, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, appeared with representatives from the political network funded by Charles G. and David H. Koch to stress that there was little daylight separating the White House, Republicans in Congress and the well-financed conservative groups that are planning to devote tens of millions of dollars to the process.\u201cThis is a pass/fail exercise, and we will pass tax reform,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a question-and-answer session with Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch group that funds grass-roots political activity across the country. More than once, Mr. Phillips mentioned that the group\u2019s activists in 36 states were ready to be deployed, and that there was no higher priority for them this year. \u201cWe\u2019re going all in,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.Ideally, the administration would like a bill on President Trump\u2019s desk by Thanksgiving.\u201cThat, I think, is an aggressive schedule, but that is our timetable,\u201d said Marc Short, the Trump administration\u2019s legislative affairs director and a former executive for the Koch political organization Freedom Partners, who was also on hand for the event.The issue is so important to Mr. Trump, administration officials said, that he plans to travel the country holding campaign-style rallies to promote an overhaul.While overhauling the tax code is generally considered to be one of the most challenging legislative lifts for lawmakers to pursue, Mr. Short predicted that the House and Senate tax-writing committees would begin marking up legislation shortly after Labor Day. The House and the Senate, he said, would then pass bills in succession in October and November, sending the tax legislation to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk before December.As lawmakers and the White House work toward a plan that can pass both houses of Congress, conservative political groups are trying to impress on them that failure is not an option after the collapse of Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In addition to the Koch efforts, groups like the American Action Network and the Business Roundtable are beginning multimillion-dollar television and radio campaigns meant to coincide with Congress\u2019s August recess.Corry Bliss, the executive director of the American Action Network, said the group was prepared to spend $5 million in August alone \u2014 and $20 million by Christmas \u2014 on a campaign that included rallying activists to lawmakers\u2019 offices. \u201cEvery time a member has a town hall, Republican or Democrat, we\u2019re going to be there with a presence, holding them accountable, urging them to keep their promise to cut taxes,\u201d he said.Although Republicans have worked through some of their divisions on how to revise the tax code \u2014 deciding to shelve, for example, a controversial tax on imports proposed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan \u2014 significant differences remain.Mr. Short said that the White House was still pushing to cut the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. House Republicans had proposed cutting it to 20 percent and many tax experts think that even that number is overly ambitious with the import tax gone and with the Affordable Care Act taxes still in place.And the administration is also forging ahead with a proposal to eliminate the deduction that Americans can take on their state and local taxes, which members of both parties are already raising objections to.The deduction is a considerable source of financial relief for people who live in high-tax states along both coasts. Those states also tend to be dominated by Democrats and others who voted decisively against Mr. Trump. States that would be less affected tend to be those vast stretches of red that Mr. Trump swept last year, from Florida to Wyoming.The state and local tax deduction was on the chopping block in the House Republican tax blueprint and in Mr. Trump\u2019s tax outline, but like any significant change to the tax code, getting rid of it comes with political peril. Resistance to its repeal has already spurred bipartisan backlash.Last month, a bipartisan group of 70 members of Congress sent a letter to Mr. Mnuchin warning that eliminating deductions for state and local taxes would be a tax hike on middle-income taxpayers in states such as California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Seven House Republicans from blue states signed the letter, suggesting that if other Republicans feel the same way, then yet another big plan to raise tax revenues will have to be jettisoned.Mr. Mnuchin said that the loss of such deductions was the price to pay for substantially lower tax rates that he said would mostly benefit middle-income families.\u201cAs a matter of fact, I sometimes get complaints from my friends in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and California and Illinois that their taxes aren\u2019t going down,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cSo this is not about a tax cut for the rich.\u201dThus far, Republicans are refusing to publicly scale back their ambitions on taxes, but many veterans of previous attempts to change the tax laws think that there is little chance that something of such magnitude will be enacted. As long as the Trump administration remains fixated on health care, a budget will not be easy to pass. Also confronting Congress: The debt ceiling must be lifted by the end of September.\u201cAll of this is happy talk,\u201d Steve Bell, a Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee in the 1980s, said of the chances that a tax bill would be signed this year. \u201cI think there is a belief that if you say it often enough, it will become true.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Followed Their Wish List to the Bronx", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntKaRon Joyner grew up in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Leshawn Joyner, then Leshawn McFarlan, grew up in South Jamaica, Queens.The couple, who married last year on Cape Cod, met online five years ago and soon moved together to a luxury rental building, Moda, in Jamaica, Queens. Then, seeking lower rent, they moved again to a one-bedroom in a small walk-up in Long Island City, Queens, for around $1,500 a month.The location was convenient, close to the library branch where Leshawn, now 29, worked as a librarian. (KaRon, 32, is seeking a job in the field of strategy and finance.) But the place was in need of repair, with finicky hot water and an infestation of ants.\u201cI\u2019m not going to have my wife living in a slum \u2014 she\u2019s going to get a garden,\u201d KaRon said. \u201cI was stressing about being the best wife I could be.\u201dBut where to go? Last year, they gave themselves six months to find a place to buy. If they failed, they would rent again. In the meantime, they decided, the best option was to live with their mothers, both of whom owned houses. So the newlyweds temporarily split up.With a budget of up to $450,000, they were looking for a house with at least three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a yard \u2014 plus a basement they could rent out if they ever needed the income. They disagreed about where to look. Each had an allegiance to her own childhood neighborhood, but homes in both places were too expensive or would cost too much to fix up.\u201cSome things we could not agree on,\u201d Leshawn said. \u201cKaRon wanted the possibility of air rights, to build up. I was like, What? This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dThey found they loved the borough\u2019s houses, with their high ceilings and large rooms. They saw many spec houses that were fully renovated, as well as some that had basic renovations with new paint and appliances.KaRon kept an eye on transit options. \u201cI needed to be by the train and a rail, in case one group goes on strike,\u201d she said.They were interested in a two-story brick house on Weiher Court in Morrisania, listed at $379,000. A renovation was in progress when they visited.The problem was the backyard, a cement rectangle adjacent to a parking lot. Worse, the yard was accessible only from the basement, so renting it out would have eliminated their access to the yard altogether.A two-family house on Adams Street in Van Nest was listed for $475,000. Built on hilly terrain, it had a metal bridge leading to the entrance. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to react to that house,\u201d KaRon said. \u201cThe place was beautiful, but the setup was just weird.\u201dMost of the houses they saw were short on curb appeal, she said. But in many cases, \u201cwhen you walked in, you were pleasantly surprised.\u201dIn Bedford Park, not far from the botanical garden, they found a listing for a newly renovated house with three bedrooms, four bathrooms and a finished basement for $475,000. The yard was overgrown, with piles of trash. But both loved the interior, with a vestibule by the entrance and a bay window in the master bedroom.Negotiations began but proceeded slowly because of the many Jewish holidays in the fall. Their offer of $450,000 was accepted. When they received the bank\u2019s appraisal of $405,000, however, they renegotiated, seeking advice from a cousin of KaRon\u2019s who owned several residential properties. \u201cMy cousin said, \u2018Relax, no one else is going to pay more than this,\u2019\u201d she said.After a few weeks, the seller agreed to the lower price. The Joyners arrived last winter, relieved to finally have their own place. Leshawn transferred to a library in the Bronx; now she either walks to work or takes the Metro-North train. KaRon sometimes bicycles around the neighborhood, although some hills are so steep she must dismount and walk up them.Their first order of business was to clear the dead trees in the backyard. \u201cI was paranoid every time it rained,\u201d fearing falling branches, Leshawn said.Though relatives must be persuaded to come so far, the Joyners are happy they found \u201cthe courage to leave our childhood boroughs,\u201d KaRon said. And their new neighborhood has the homey feel they both grew up with.\u201cPeople know each other \u2014 people are walking, people are biking, everyone has a dog or a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cI know some of my neighbors\u2019 names.

Banks in Britain have repaid more than 27 billion pounds, or about $35 billion, and set aside at least another \u00a310 billion for customer redress.The improper selling of payment protection insurance is one of several scandals that have hit the banking industry in Britain since the financial crisis that began in 2008 and weighed on the bottom lines of some of the country\u2019s largest banks, including Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland.But this year, the F.C.A. adopted a deadline of Aug. 29, 2019, for the public to submit final claims for compensation and kicked off a two-year education campaign on Tuesday to spread the word.The Schwarzenegger ad is part of the campaign. In it, a robotic head of the actor and former California governor follows British shoppers around a supermarket, imploring them to file their P.P.I. claims.The regulator reportedly set aside \u00a342 million for the overall campaign, which is being financed by firms that sold the insurance.As many as 64 million payment protection insurance policies were sold, mostly from 1990 to 2010, netting banks about \u00a344 billion in premiums. Some claim-management firms, however, say the product was sold to a far larger number of people.The insurance was marketed alongside all sorts of products, including business and personal loans, mortgages, credit cards and in-store financing.British regulators determined that the complex pricing and detailed conditions on a buyer\u2019s eligibility to make claims made P.P.I. inappropriate for some consumers.The amount of compensation claims peaked in 2012, but the pace has not slowed as quickly as the industry had expected, particularly as regulators delayed placing a deadline for claims to be filed.Claim-management companies, which receive a commission when a person is compensated, have aggressively sought out consumers through cold calls, text messages and ads on daytime television.As a result, the unexpected number of claims has dragged on quarterly results for banks in Britain.Not everyone is happy with the advertising campaign, however.Mark Davies, a spokesman for We Fight Any Claim, a claim-management firm, said the regulator should be taking a more direct approach and make banks write to anyone who may potentially have a claim. We Fight Any Claim has gone to court to try to stop the regulator from imposing a deadline on P.P.I. claims.The point, he said, \u201cis not spend a large amount of money on a Hollywood star. The point about this should be reaching the people you won\u2019t reach, not making noise on television at enormous expenses.\u201d\u201cThat accomplishes little,\u201d Mr. Davies said, \u201cexcept to burn up the budget that the F.C.A. has allocated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street, Climbing Sharply, Skips Washington\u2019s \u2018Soap Opera\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the disorder in Washington \u2014 with a revolving door at the White House and roadblocks on Capitol Hill \u2014 Wall Street and corporate America are booming.\u201cNone of the soap opera in Washington matters,\u201d said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. \u201cNobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia.\u201dWhat does matter, Mr. Sullivan said, is stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining and oil and gas, a weaker dollar that helps exporters, and a lighter regulatory touch by the new administration.The initial stock market rally that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November \u2014 the so-called Trump bump \u2014 was fueled by optimism among investors that long-sought action on tax reform and infrastructure spending might finally be at hand.Few analysts are so sanguine now, especially after Republicans could not agree last month on how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after years of promising to do so. If anything, simplifying the tax code or investing in new roads and bridges seems farther out of reach than ever.But a market surge based on political hopes has been replaced by one more firmly grounded in the financial realm.Besides steady economic growth or less regulation, investors also have been encouraged by the loose reins of central banks like the Federal Reserve, which have helped keep interest rates not far above their historic lows. Inflation, too, remains tame, with price increases in recent months actually falling short of the Fed\u2019s targets.At the same time, with yields on safe assets like government bonds so minuscule, there are few appealing alternatives to stocks for investors, according to Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.\u201cNo matter how you look at valuations, they are high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as money flows into pension funds every month and needs to be invested, why would I put it in bonds?\u201cCorporations in America and Europe are still inventing new products and finding ways of doing things more efficiently,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThis is separate from the political theater around the world.\u201dMoreover, corporate earnings \u2014 the fundamental driver of individual stock performance \u2014 have been robust.\u201cThe first six months of the year have been the best period for earnings growth since 2011,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.Still, many Wall Street investors who are bullish over the longer-term, including Mr. Orlando, concede that the risk of a stock market correction was rising.\u201cWe\u2019ve had this fabulous run since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut could we see an air pocket in the next few months? Absolutely. Our best guess is that the next 5 percent move is more likely to be down than up.\u201dBut for now, whichever way the stock market goes, most economic metrics like hiring, consumer sentiment and home prices continue to point in the right direction.\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of it in Cleveland, and small businesses are looking forward instead of over their shoulder,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, who is the older brother of Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican.\u201cWhen Washington practices the Hippocratic oath toward business \u2014 first, do no harm \u2014 it\u2019s amazing what the American economy can do,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the prior administration, you had a very, very aggressive regulatory environment in which businesses felt under attack.\u201dEasing regulation is also something Mr. Trump can do with the stroke of a pen or with appointments to agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve, which require confirmation but not legislation.To be sure, the glow from Wall Street extends only so far. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, less than 15 percent of American households owned individual stocks and only half had any exposure to the broader market, including through mutual funds or retirement plans.\u201cOnly people with assets like stocks and houses are benefiting, and that\u2019s why this recovery has been weak,\u201d Mr. Slok said.The contradictory signals between the markets and the political world are hardly unique to the United States. \u201cMost investors in Europe are rolling their eyes at the U.S., but what\u2019s ironic is that it\u2019s similar to the European situation,\u201d Mr. Slok said.As in Washington, Mr. Slok said, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Brussels and other capitals over major issues, including Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union, the economic drag from the continent\u2019s restrictive labor laws and Greece\u2019s fiscal problems.If the stock market\u2019s prospects are unclear, then the outlook in Washington six months into the Trump administration is downright gloomy.The year began with Mr. Trump promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act; pass the most significant overhaul to the tax code since 1986; and get Congress to pass legislation to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. None of that has been accomplished, as Republicans have struggled to shift from being an opposition party to one that governs.Beyond those disappointments, fiscal land mines lie ahead that could rattle the economy if Republicans and Democrats cannot cooperate.By the end of September, Congress must reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling and fund the government for the coming fiscal year. Republicans remain divided over whether conditions such as spending cuts should be attached to raising the statutory borrowing limit. A standoff with Democrats over Mr. Trump\u2019s request to finance a border wall could lead to a partial government shutdown.The lack of progress has only led to more sniping among Republicans. This week Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cI think what\u2019s hurting the legislative agenda is Congress\u2019s inability to get things passed.\u201dMr. Trump has pointed to the growing economy and strong employment figures as evidence that his agenda is thriving. The data is indeed encouraging, but not very different from the figures he used as a candidate to paint a picture of economic despair.Still, the stock market\u2019s gains were likely to hold up as long as earnings remained buoyant, said Laszlo Birinyi, a longtime stock market analyst.\u201cWhile people may have strong feelings in other areas, the stock market is predicated on dollars and cents,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tony de Brum, Voice of Pacific Islands on Climate Change, Dies at 72", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTony A. de Brum, a longtime political leader in the Republic of the Marshall Islands who helped negotiate his country\u2019s independence in the 1970s and decades later fought for its survival in the face of climate change, died on Monday in the capital city, Majuro. He was 72.Hilda C. Heine, the country\u2019s president, announced his death.President Heine called Mr. de Brum a \u201cnational hero\u201d for advocating for nuclear disarmament and for giving the Marshall Islands, in the central Pacific, an outsize voice in global climate-change negotiations.In dozens of speeches to the United Nations over the years and in various government roles, Mr. de Brum would weave together the dominant themes of his country: the struggle for independence, the lingering suffering from nuclear testing that the islanders had endured, and the threat of rising sea levels from climate change.The nuclear issue was vividly real to Mr. de Brum: As a boy, in 1954, he had witnessed from a fishing boat a test of what was then the most powerful nuclear bomb ever developed by the United States.Mr. de Brum was not long out of college when, as vice chairman of the Marshall Islands Status Commission, he began advocating for his country\u2019s independence from the United States, taking his case to the United Nations Security Council. The Marshall Islands, a chain of islands and coral atolls that now have a population of about 50,000, were then under American administrative control.The Marshall Islands declared independence in 1979 and were granted sovereignty in 1986. Mr. de Brum helped negotiate the country\u2019s Compact of Free Association with the United States and led the drafting of the Marshall Islands constitution.In a nearly 50-year government career, he went on to serve as foreign minister (three times), minister of finance, minister of health and the environment, minister-in-assistance to the former president Christopher Loeak, and Marshall Islands climate ambassador.In 2013, Mr. de Brum criticized the Security Council for declaring that it was not the right body to address climate change. He reminded its members that 35 years earlier he had come before them to petition for his country\u2019s independence.\u201cIt seems to me ironic,\u201d he said, \u201cbizarre, perhaps, that the very same agency whose approval was needed for my country to become a country again would consider that my coming back to ask for help to survive, to keep that country going, was not relevant to their work.\u201dHe often linked the issues of nuclear testing and climate change, noting that the Marshallese had already been resettled onto other islands because of radioactive fallout related to nuclear testing. He said the idea that citizens might have to leave the islands again if seas rose higher was \u201crepugnant.\u201d\u201cEven the loss of a tiny island is, for us, significant,\u201d he said.At the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015, Mr. de Brum convened a group of about 100 nations, both rich and poor, to demand that the accord call for aggressive action, like establishing a clear long-term goal on global warming that was in line with scientific advice.Calling themselves the High Ambition Coalition, leaders of the group walked into the final day of talks wearing coconut leaves on their lapels in solidarity with island nations.The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 countries, called for concerted efforts to keep the global temperature increase no higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels by 2100.Mr. de Brum was vocal in arguing that even if the temperature increase were held at 2 degrees \u2014 which scientists often describe as a relatively safe \u201cguardrail\u201d \u2014 a resulting rise in sea levels would be devastating for the Marshall Islands and other low-lying countries.Todd Stern, who was United States special envoy for climate change under President Barack Obama, said in an interview that Mr. de Brum had been able to bridge divides among countries of different levels of wealth and responsibility for causing climate change and convince them that everyone must act.\u201cWe all owe a debt to Tony for getting Paris done,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cWhen I think of people who were meaningful in getting the Paris deal, he is definitely on the short list.\u201dMr. de Brum was critical of President Trump for announcing this year that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement. Celebrating the one-year anniversary of the pact, he wrote, \u201cMy country felt a little bit safer as a result of the historic agreement.\u201dTony Anton de Brum was born on Feb. 26, 1945, in Tuvalu, an island nation in the South Pacific. He grew up on the Marshallese atoll of Likiep and attended the University of Hawaii. President Heine said he was one of the first Marshallese to attend college.Working with the linguist Alfred Capelle, he created the first Marshallese-English dictionary.He is survived by his father; his wife, Rosalie; his daughters, Doreen, Dolores and Sally Ann; 10 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.Throughout his life Mr. de Brum carried a searing memory of a nuclear bomb exploding on the Pacific horizon. In March 1954 he was 9 years old and on the water fishing with his grandfather when, over Bikini Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands, the United States tested the most powerful bomb it had ever developed till then \u2014 one 1,000 times as destructive as those that had leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about Tony A. de Brum, a Marshall Islands political leader who fought for his country\u2019s survival in the face of climate change, referred incorrectly to the Paris climate accord\u2019s call for limiting a global temperature increase by 2011. It said temperatures should rise by no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (or 1.5 degrees Celsius, as the obituary correctly noted), not 34.7 degrees Fahrenheit.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

Tries a New Tack During Delays: The Truth", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter's NotebookOn my way home from work two Thursdays ago, the No. 3 train I was riding stopped suddenly, just before the 72nd Street station.This, on the New York City subway, was not particularly unusual. But what happened afterward was.\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d began the voice over the loudspeaker, sounding rattled. \u201cI have bad news. A passenger just jumped in front of the train.\u201dSeveral people gasped. A woman near me jerked her head up from her phone, wearing an expression of horror. We riders did something not normally acceptable: We made eye contact with one another.A train conductor or operator speaking of a death on the tracks without euphemism: We had never heard that before.He was speaking with supervisors about how to proceed, the voice continued. There would be major delays. He was very sorry.Nobody seemed annoyed about waiting. And that was most unusual of all.But not on this day, on this train. And that stems from a policy the M.T.A. adopted in response to a train\u2019s particularly harrowing delay in June: Tell riders the truth.The New York City subway has always had a code. Delays are explained with stock phrases that may or may not actually apply \u2014 \u201cwe are delayed because of train traffic ahead of us\u201d; \u201cwe are being held momentarily by the train\u2019s dispatcher.\u201d There might be \u201cpolice activity\u201d or \u201can investigation,\u201d which are often used to mean someone has been struck by a train. New Yorkers know this perfectly well, but the words have no emotional force.The specificity was not a one-off, the M.T.A. confirmed, but a new policy: part of a shift from recorded to live announcements.Now, Ms. Young said, \u201cconductors have to give more detailed announcements, and they can\u2019t play the automated announcements.\u201dExamples of the new approach have been popping up on social media and elsewhere over the past two months.Of course, transparent announcements can do only so much to placate riders. The big problem is the delays themselves; whatever the cause, they\u2019re still making you late for work. Mr. Roberts\u2019s A train \u2014 sitting in a station, West Fourth Street, served by six other subway lines \u2014 quickly emptied after riders were informed about the cat.Asked whether riders seemed to appreciate the honesty, Ms. Young, the union representative, said that while some did, still \u201cmost of the time, passengers are upset because of the delays.\u201dUnder certain circumstances, though, bluntness can bring what it did nearly two weeks ago: a humanity almost never found on the subway.Perhaps 10 minutes after the first announcement, the passengers in the first few cars of my train, which were in the station, were allowed to get off. We in the back, still in the tunnel, awaited our turn with a patience that I found remarkable. When the door between our car and the one in front of it slid open another 10 minutes or so later, the scores of us walked through, single-file. No one jostled. No one spoke. We stepped carefully over the gaps between cars, holding the doors for the people behind us.Up on the sidewalk, I checked my phone. The language on the M.T.A.\u2019s website matched the announcement we had heard: \u201ca person struck by a train.\u201dBut change can be slow. Later that evening, I checked again and found that the M.T.A. had slipped back into euphemism.

{"Headline": "Hartford, With Its Finances in Disarray, Veers Toward Bankruptcy", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARTFORD \u2014 By many measures, Connecticut appears to be brimming with wealth. The state is known for its Gold Coast, populated with chief executives and hedge fund billionaires and specked with mansions on spacious estates. Then there are the suburbs that draw families with placid neighborhoods and high-achieving public schools.But the state capital is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and the turbulence rocking Hartford has served as a stark reminder of the gulf between the affluent enclaves that drive Connecticut\u2019s wealth and its larger cities that have long grappled with high crime, underperforming schools and unsure financial footing.The problems in Hartford are similar to some other cities across the United States that have sought relief through bankruptcy: its tax base and population have shrunk and its pension obligations and debts have piled up. City officials, who are confronting a budget deficit approaching $50 million, have already made deep cuts in services, sought concessions from labor unions representing public employees and have taken steps, such as hiring lawyers, to position the city to be able to file for bankruptcy.At the same time, Hartford has looked to the state for help, only to find that financial situation is also in disarray. The state, which has a deficit of about $3.5 billion, started the fiscal year on July 1 without a budget after months of wrangling in the State Legislature and a resolution could be weeks away.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to persuade people around the state that cities matter,\u201d said Luke Bronin, Hartford\u2019s mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to get the Legislature to adopt a budget that includes very deep and painful cuts, but includes support for Connecticut cities.\u201dConnecticut has the greatest degree of income inequality of any state, according to Daphne A. Kenyon, an economist who studies local taxation at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a research institute in Cambridge, Mass. That, she said, has translated into an extreme in \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d among its municipalities.Cities and towns in Connecticut rely to an unusual degree on property taxes to finance their operations, a system that works well for more affluent communities, like Greenwich and Darien. But it is proving disastrous for a city like Hartford, which has one of the highest property tax rates in the state, but still cannot raise enough money to pay for basic government operations. Last year, state grants and assistance covered about half of the city\u2019s $566 million budget.Hartford, with a population of about 125,000, has a bounty of hospitals, colleges and government buildings, and a downtown of office towers filled with corporate tenants who contribute to the city\u2019s distinction of being an important insurance center.Still, it does not take long to find signs of distress.The mayor said city leaders have been trying to strike a painful balance.\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to do difficult things,\u201d Mr. Bronin, a Democrat, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to touch third rails while we do it.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do is find that line where we\u2019ve cut deeply because we know that the times demand it but we\u2019re not cutting so deep that we fail to deliver our basic responsibilities.\u201dBut even those onerous cuts may not be enough to relieve the situation. The state\u2019s inability to balance the budget comes at a particularly challenging time, as state aid that would normally arrive in September has been held up, and the city faces a $27 million debt payment in October.Hartford also has a fundamental tax problem: It is home to government buildings and other properties it has no power to tax, making up just over half the real estate in the city. Connecticut accounts for that by promising to compensate the capital for the forgone property taxes, but in practice, the flow of money has been unreliable. The mayor described the city as being in a situation that forces an urban center to operate with a tax base similar to that of a suburb. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a structure not built to work,\u201d Mr. Bronin said.In July, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Hartford\u2019s debt after the city disclosed that it had hired a law firm to advise it on a possible debt restructuring. Both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s now rate Hartford\u2019s debt in the junk range, signaling a greater likelihood of some sort of default on bond payments. Mr. Bronin has said he hopes to meet with the city\u2019s bondholders and persuade them to voluntarily accept lower payments.Some contend that filing for bankruptcy is inevitable and is the city\u2019s best option. But there is also a pervasive sense in the city, especially among public employee labor unions, that bankruptcy could have devastating consequences and should be vigorously avoided.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the capital city,\u201d said Shellye Davis, a co-president of the Hartford Federation of Paraprofessionals, who has worked for 26 years in the city\u2019s public schools system. \u201cThat would affect everything around us.\u201dIt is possible for a city to negotiate lower bond payments without going into bankruptcy. But municipal bankruptcy gives cities much greater leverage to negotiate the debt relief they believe they need.\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be entertained lightly, and I don\u2019t think it is being entertained lightly,\u201d Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said of bankruptcy, adding, \u201cThis is a critical period of time for them. I think they were right to hire counsel and I think they were right to understand what their options are.\u201dMr. Malloy has also proposed legislation that would put Hartford under state supervision.The financial limbo has created a level of uncertainty that some fear will only add to Hartford\u2019s troubles, clouding perceptions of the city, hampering much needed growth and overshadowing positive things they see happening here.\u201cWith all this momentum, having that fog or haze \u2014 a major fog or haze \u2014 which is the threat of looming bankruptcy is not good,\u201d said Shawn Holloway, 44, a housing inspector who has lived in Hartford his entire life. \u201cThere should be some better choices.\u201dRick Rojas reported from Hartford, and Mary Williams Walsh from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sempra Bid Tops Buffett and Singer in Race for Energy Future", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA month and a half ago, Warren E. Buffett unveiled a $9 billion takeover bid for Energy Future Holdings, setting up a battle with a fellow billionaire, Paul E. Singer, over the bankrupt Texas utility operator.More often than not, a deal with the market cachet of Mr. Buffett is as good as clinched. But the offer stirred up the interest of another potential suitor, which quietly spent weeks putting together its own rival bid.On Monday, that bidder, Sempra Energy of California, emerged as the winner.Not only has Sempra struck its biggest acquisition ever, but it even bested perhaps the most celebrated deal maker that corporate America has ever produced.Sempra represents Energy Future\u2019s latest hope for emerging from a decade of turmoil and uncertainty. In 2007, Energy Future \u2014 then known as TXU \u2014 sold itself to a group of private equity firms for a record-setting $45 billion, at the height of the leveraged buyout boom.But its enormous debt load dragged the company\u2019s fortunes down almost immediately, and its backers eventually wrote off their investment. Energy Future finally filed for bankruptcy in 2014, and it has spent the last three years searching for a way out of Chapter 11 protection.That quest had hit several roadblocks. Previous takeover bids for Energy Future by NextEra and by the Hunt Family ran aground amid opposition by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the state\u2019s energy regulatory agency.Mr. Buffett\u2019s offer, announced on July 7, seemed more promising. Berkshire possesses one of the most sterling reputations in all of corporate America, and it had bet on investors\u2019 exhaustion from a yearslong bankruptcy case.But Elliott, a veteran of many fights in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, quickly declared Berkshire\u2019s bid insufficient. The hedge fund, which had already purchased nearly $3 billion worth of Energy Future debt to become the company\u2019s biggest creditor, began working on its own takeover bid, which it estimated would be worth $9.3 billion.It was during that time that the hedge fund first heard from Sempra, according to people with knowledge of the process, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. Elliott had been searching for potential backers and interviewing both financial institutions and other utility operators as potential partners.But Sempra, which had watched Energy Future\u2019s bankruptcy case with interest over the years, wasn\u2019t interested in merely being a partner in someone else\u2019s bid.Instead, the company continued to work quietly with its own advisers, seeking to assemble a bid in secret and avoiding tipping off Berkshire or other potential suitors. By the beginning of August, Sempra was working in earnest to beat Mr. Buffett.Through Elliott\u2019s fund-raising efforts, Sempra knew the minimum that it would have to bid: $9.3 billion.Making such a big takeover offer was unusual for Sempra, which is based in San Diego and has 32 million customers. The company, which was created in 1998 from the merger of two Southern California utilities, has tended to invest in projects rather than buy counterparts outright.The opportunity to buy Oncor, which has almost 10 million customers, proved too enticing to pass up.\u201cWith its strong management team and long, distinguished history as Texas\u2019 leading electric provider, Oncor is an excellent strategic fit for our portfolio of utility and energy infrastructure businesses,\u201d Debra L. Reed, Sempra\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Monday.Sempra devised a two-pronged strategy aimed at assuaging both Texas power regulators and Elliott and other creditors, according to one of the people with knowledge of the process. In conversations with the public commission, Sempra committed to the same humble approach that Berkshire did, agreeing to exactly the same 44 conditions that Mr. Buffett\u2019s team had.That meant ensuring that Oncor\u2019s financial health would be protected regardless of any drama at its parent company\u2019s level.And Sempra also negotiated with Energy Future to win its approval, while ensuring that Elliott and other potentially recalcitrant creditors would come on board.The campaign to please creditors worked.\u201cElliott is supportive of the proposed Sempra transaction, which provides substantially greater recoveries to all creditors of Energy Future than the proposed Berkshire transaction,\u201d an Elliott spokesman said in an emailed statement.According to terms disclosed on Monday, Sempra will finance its bid with a combination of debt, newly issued shares and outside investment. The energy company said that it had financing commitments from RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley.Sempra largely succeeded in keeping its efforts out of public view, with executives hoping to keep their company out of the news until at least after market close on Friday. Media reports identified the machinations of an unnamed third party only late last week, when a lawyer for Elliott mentioned the matter in a bankruptcy court hearing.By the time Sempra\u2019s name formally emerged as the new bidder, the California utility had all but finished its offer. Energy Future\u2019s board then met on Sunday to approve the new bid \u2014 leaving Berkshire to lament a missed deal opportunity.An article on Tuesday about Sempra Energy\u2019s winning the bidding for Energy Future Holdings misstated an outcome for a losing bidder, Berkshire Hathaway. It is not entitled to a $270 million breakup fee.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Securities Fraud Case Against Financier Benjamin Wey Is Dismissed", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors have dismissed securities fraud charges against the New York financier Benjamin Wey after a judge tossed out much of the evidence against him in June.The request to dismiss the indictment against Mr. Wey was made in a brief court filing on Tuesday afternoon. Soon after the request was made, Judge Alison J. Nathan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan signed the orderProsecutors sought the dismissal just a few months before Mr. Wey was scheduled to go on trial on charges that he orchestrated a stock-manipulation scheme that generated tens of millions in illegal profits.Last week, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said in a filing that they were awaiting word from the Office of the United States Solicitor General for approval to appeal Judge Nathan\u2019s sweeping suppression order. Prosecutors said at the time that if the solicitor general decided against an appeal, the indictment against Mr. Wey would probably be dismissed.\u201cThe government made the correct decision to drop charges in light of the significant constitutional violations described by Judge Nathan in her ruling,\u201d said David Siegal, a lawyer for Mr. Wey and a partner with Haynes & Boone.A spokesman for Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment.The dismissals are a blow to the legacy of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, who had overseen the investigations that led to the indictments in those cases. Mr. Bharara was fired by President Trump in March and has since taken to Twitter and become an outspoken critic of the Trump administration.Also in July, a federal appeals court overturned the 2015 conviction of Sheldon Silver, once the powerful speaker of the New York State Assembly, after finding error with the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. Federal prosecutors have vowed to retry Mr. Silver, whose conviction was one of the highlights of Mr. Bharara\u2019s crackdown on public corruption.The dismissal of the securities charges against Mr. Wey closes a matter that has dogged him for several years. He was indicted on securities fraud and money-laundering charges in 2015.The founder of New York Global Group, Mr. Wey made a fortune helping Chinese companies acquire what are known as shell companies \u2014 often the remnants of publicly traded companies \u2014 in deals called reverse mergers. Prosecutors said he had secured secret ownership stakes in some of those companies and manipulated the share prices to reap big profits.But Mr. Wey made headlines outside finance. A few months before a federal grand jury indicted him, a Swedish model who had worked for Mr. Wey was awarded $18 million in a sexual-harassment lawsuit against him. The judge reduced the reward to $5.6 million.Mr. Wey, who also calls himself an investigative journalist, has frequently taken to Twitter to defend himself and criticize the actions of law enforcement in other cases for unfair prosecutions. He has also gone after his critics in articles published in an online magazine.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Wey said, \u201cThis ordeal devastated our employees and our families, has done irreparable harm to our lives and closed our prospering businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Bankers Are Selling Trump\u2019s Tax Plan. Is Congress Buying?", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin have spent months behind closed doors with Republican congressional leaders sketching the contours of an elaborate and politically difficult tax overhaul that is President Trump\u2019s top priority.Mr. Trump hopes to jump-start the process on Wednesday, traveling to Springfield, Mo., for a speech calling for large tax reductions and a long-anticipated revamping of the code. But he has largely left it to Mr. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, both new to government, to devise and execute a winning legislative strategy. And their involvement has some conservatives for whom tax cuts are a signal issue deeply concerned.\u201cThey are facing big frustration among policy makers, the business community and investors that there\u2019s been months of inaction, and the perception out there among investors is they don\u2019t think this is going to get this done this year,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump during the campaign.Already, their ambitions have drifted from the president\u2019s original mark: A 15 percent corporate tax rate proposed in April is now likely to move to the 20 to 25 percent range, say two people familiar with the officials\u2019 recent thinking. And a proposed 35 percent ceiling on the highest personal income tax rate could be shelved altogether, leaving the current 39.6 percent cap intact.For Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin, quiet competitors since their days as new partners at Goldman Sachs more than two decades ago, the task is a consequential test of whether real-world experience in finance has equipped them to carry out a delicate political negotiation, and whether two New Yorkers who have been lavish supporters of Democrats can succeed in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\u201cGoldman has thrived by hiring strong individuals with very different backgrounds and putting them together on a team,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in an email. \u201cGary and Steven are both steeped in that tradition from their years working side by side on the trading floor \u2014 not a bad training ground for the pressure cooker that is Washington.\u201dBehind the scenes, there have been differences of style and substance.Mr. Cohn \u2014 who wears monogrammed shirts, gold cuff links and a Rolex watch next to a brown leather bracelet with a \u201cpeace\u201d tag and a black beaded one with silver skulls \u2014 has brought a brash style and a take-no-prisoners approach to the tax issue. He is facile with data and has a keen understanding of the economy, according to people who have attended meetings with him, and he moved quickly to hire several experienced and well-connected aides \u2014 including Jeremy Katz, his deputy, and Shahira Knight, a former tax-writing congressional aide \u2014 who have been drivers in the private talks with Congress.But Mr. Cohn has also rankled lawmakers in both parties with comments that they suggest betray a lack of understanding about the political process and the intricate policy trade-offs that undergird a large tax rewrite. In a meeting with a group of Senate Democrats this year, according to people who were present, Mr. Cohn jokingly dismissed concerns about the wisdom and cost of repealing the estate tax, remarking, \u201cOnly morons pay the estate tax.\u201dA source close to Mr. Cohn denied that he had used the word, saying he had been referring to \u201crich people with really bad tax planning.\u201dMr. Mnuchin, bespectacled and crisply formal in his slim-cut business suits, is more reserved and careful than Mr. Cohn. A quick study on economic policy matters, he talks frequently about his level of access to the president and the strength of their relationship, making it clear to members of Congress as well as tax lobbyists that he has Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and is speaking for him on the tax plan. Mr. Mnuchin has been deferential to lawmakers, indulging House Republicans for weeks in talks about their idea of imposing a 20 percent border adjustment tax even after it became clear that the idea did not have enough support to be included in the plan.\u201cGary is pretty direct \u2014 he\u2019s come to the whip team meeting and he\u2019s probably less politically correct, and I use that in a loving way,\u201d said Representative Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe secretary is more correct. They complement one another.\u201dEarly in their respective roles on Trump\u2019s team, the two appeared to be jockeying for position in what one person who observed the dynamics described as an \u201cunholy alliance.\u201dDuring the transition, Mr. Mnuchin made a surprise visit to Mr. Cohn\u2019s job interview with Mr. Trump, greeting Mr. Cohn in the 26th-floor lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan to escort him to the president-elect.In meetings early this year before Mr. Mnuchin was confirmed, Mr. Cohn told key lawmakers that he would be leading the tax effort for the administration as the chief architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, according to several people familiar with the conversations who spoke about them on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Mnuchin appeared \u201czen\u201d when he learned of the meetings, said one person who was aware of the tension, assuring staff members that Mr. Cohn, whose job does not require Senate confirmation, was doing the right thing.Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin declined to be interviewed for this story.Aides to both deny any ill will or any attempt at one-upsmanship, describing any friction as a result of stylistic differences. And the two men have been virtually inseparable while working on the tax rewrite, talking at least once a day, dining together more than once a month at such popular Washington spots as Rasika and the Trump International Hotel, and keeping a singular focus on achieving the biggest tax cut possible in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s desires. Mr. Cohn was invited to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s recent wedding to the actress Louise Linton, said a person who was aware of the invitation, although he did not attend.The men have tried to avoid the mistakes that plagued the collapsed effort to repeal and replace the health care law, placing a premium on communicating with key members of Congress and finding a common approach to which the White House and Republican lawmakers could agree.\u201cI credit Secretary Mnuchin and Director Cohn for playing a key role in the work we have done to unify behind bold principles for tax reform, which really wasn\u2019t the case in health care,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.They recently intensified their efforts to present a united front. Last week, Tony E. Sayegh Jr., a top public affairs official at Treasury, was detailed to the West Wing to work with Hope Hicks, the interim White House communications director, on messaging for the tax push.\u201cThis is an administration where everyone is celebrating Festivus every day and airing grievances, and there\u2019s none of that here,\u201d said Rohit Kumar, a tax specialist at the accounting firm PwC and a former deputy chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.Still, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin have yet to produce the kind of comprehensive plan Mr. Trump has promised. A hastily compiled one-page document they presented in April proposing an array of tax cut bullet points in different fonts and type styles drew private ridicule from lawmakers in both parties and tax specialists throughout Washington as the mark of an administration wholly unprepared for the heavy legislative lift it was about to undertake.In mid-May, a few weeks after the one-page principles were issued, Treasury officials presented a more refined version to the president; his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner; Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist; and others: a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a 35 percent ceiling on the personal tax rate, said one person briefed on it, insisting on anonymity to describe private deliberations. Mr. Cohn, who attended the meeting but let Mr. Mnuchin and his deputies take the lead, had approved the plan beforehand with little argument, this person added.But in the weeks since then, the process has not always been smooth. Ms. Knight has advocated the elimination of the corporate interest deduction as a way of offsetting the cost of tax cuts without adding to the deficit, while Mr. Mnuchin has resisted the move, which would be costly to Wall Street firms and the real estate industry, according to two people briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.Mr. Cohn\u2019s staff felt frustrated to discover that Craig Phillips, the Treasury counselor most involved with planning structural reforms to the government-backed mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had been meeting with key players in the private sector to discuss potential policy without alerting the National Economic Council.Those divisions are slight compared with the vast disagreements between Democrats and Republicans on taxes, which the two have so far done little to bridge.\u201cYou get the sense that they think that somehow when they offer up all of this bravado about the deadlines and the plans that all of this is going to pop out of the oven like a cake fully baked,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the ranking member of the Finance Committee who has co-written two bipartisan tax rewrite proposals but said he has yet to be asked to meet one-on-one with either Mr. Mnuchin or Mr. Cohn.\u201cFrom the standpoint of getting real tax reform, which takes buy-in from both sides, they have just frittered months and months away needlessly,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.A White House spokesman said Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin have already met with Finance Committee members in larger groups and plan on reaching out to Mr. Wyden and other key Democrats in September, once their legislative push on taxes begins.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Kate Kelly from New York.Advertisement"}

But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore\u2019s firing has now plunged the nation\u2019s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country.Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Mr. Damore\u2019s comments carried additional weight to people on either side of the political spectrum because he was an engineer at Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.Alongside other giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Apple, these companies \u201care seen as pillars of our society,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cControversy and statements that emanate from these employees take on a different heft.\u201dThe technology industry has long marched in lock step on issues such as supporting immigration and diversity, even though their companies remained largely male, white and Asian. But last year\u2019s election of Mr. Trump \u2014 with his broadsides against political correctness, his coarse language toward women and his actions to restrict immigration and deny climate change \u2014 seemed to threaten many of those ideals.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s words may have made dissenters in the tech industry more comfortable about speaking out.\u201cTrump, in a sense, licensed people to express what some people would call politically incorrect thoughts,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Business School. \u201cThen there\u2019s the other force that a lot of Trump\u2019s policies go against the inclusive ideals these companies espouse.\u201dMr. Damore\u2019s memo and dismissal transformed him into a hero on right-wing news sites like Breitbart, which has long criticized the political leanings of the tech industry.\u201cGoogle drives a big sector of tech into the arms of Trump: fires employee who wrote memo about women in tech jobs,\u201d Dr. Pinker wrote.One of the most outspoken supporters of Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley has been Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who has since faced derision from other people working in tech for his political stance. In a sign of how deep that ill feeling runs, Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings warned Mr. Thiel last August, a few weeks after Mr. Trump had accepted the Republican nomination for president, that he would face consequences for backing Mr. Trump.\u201cI see our board being about great judgment, particularly in unlikely disaster where we have to pick new leaders,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote in the email to Mr. Thiel, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \"I\u2019m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from \u2018different judgment\u2019 to \u2018bad judgment.\u2019 Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Hastings declined to comment through their spokesmen; neither challenged the authenticity of the email. Both of the men remain on Facebook\u2019s board.Mr. Luckey, through mutual agreement with his employer, stayed away from the Oculus offices to let the controversy die down, according to three people with knowledge of the episode who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. In December, before returning briefly to the office, he told colleagues he was committed to staying at the company, according to a copy of a message he posted on an internal discussion board, which was reviewed by The Times.But by the end of March, Oculus said he was no longer working there.A Facebook spokeswoman reiterated an earlier company statement saying that Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure was unrelated to his political views.

And some worry that the men have made little progress.That might seem surprising as Houston is the fourth-largest American city and the center of a metropolitan area with economic output of half a trillion dollars a year. And indeed, the area does face years of rebuilding.And, while it is a macabre form of accounting, the need to repair buildings could create a surge in output.Still, the storm continues to wallop the Gulf Coast and it is too early to say that the economy is in the clear. But so far, the human damage is the greatest.Worth noting: Day traders have been pouring into the most arcane corners of markets, betting on whether the VIX, or the so-called fear gauge, will rise or fall.These wagers on expected volatility have traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors. But since the financial crisis, investment banks have offered VIX-linked products for purchase on the stock exchange, much like buying shares in IBM or Microsoft.But are all the investors aware of what they are getting into?\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d said Robert E. Whaley, a financial professor at Vanderbilt University known as the father of the VIX for his work on developing it. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was.

{"Headline": "Business Trip or Vacation? Travel Start-Ups Try to Blur the Line", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesPlanning a vacation? Chances are you\u2019ll think about it differently than you do that business trip you\u2019re also arranging.For the vacation, you may scroll through hotel reviews before deciding where to stay, not just to compare prices but also to consider the amenities offered.For the business trip, on the other hand, you may be inclined to book a hotel that offers rewards for frequent guests instead of the one with the lowest nightly rate. It is company money you\u2019re spending, after all.Leisure travelers are naturally more selective and cost conscious than business travelers. But a new breed of start-ups that caters to corporate travelers and focuses on user behavior may be making those distinctions obsolete.\u201cI came up with the concept in 2012, but it wasn\u2019t really my idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stumbled onto Google\u2019s approach,\u201d which has been in place at least a decade. The Google method includes drawing up a budget for airfare and hotels before every trip. If employees come in under budget, they earn credits that can be redeemed for travel upgrades in the future. The approach is different from \u201cgamified\u201d booking tools that encourage certain behavior, like using a preferred carrier, but generally do not let employees share in the savings.Mr. Ruch calls the system \u201cincentivized behavioral change,\u201d and he said it was either the most radical concept in corporate travel, or the most obvious.\u201cThere\u2019s such an enormous amount of inefficiency in business travel,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your company\u2019s policy allows business class on flights over six hours, it is not expected behavior to fly coach. If your policy allows five-star hotels, it is not expected behavior to stay at a three-star hotel or to stay with a friend.\u201dPeople are naturally drawn to comfort, Mr. Ruch said, meaning that unless they know they will be rewarded for cutting corners, they will indulge their inclination to make business travel as cushy, and as expensive, as possible.\u201cThere was really no incentive to save,\u201d he said. Once Rocketrip and its \u201cBudget to Beat\u201d formulas were adopted, Mr. Mintman said, AAF employees started to save the company 15 to 20 percent, or roughly $133, per trip. Travelers see how much they can earn for each cost-saving option \u2014 staying with a friend instead of staying at a hotel, for example \u2014 through Rocketrip\u2019s online booking tool.Rocketrip, like other start-ups applying a carrot-and-stick approach to travel, also gives reports to company managers about how much was saved and which action \u2014 settling, say, for a cheaper hotel or a coach seat \u2014 caused the savings on each trip, Mr. Ruch said. If an employee goes over the \u201cbudget to beat\u201d figure, management sees that, too.Mr. Mintman said that working with Rocketrip had helped AAF determine what was reasonable for a travel budget. \u201cNow, we can go back to someone\u2019s proposed spending on a trip and see how well it lines up with what Rocketrip has come up with,\u201d he said.TripActions, which gives users who save their companies money \u201cTripBucks\u201d redeemable for gift cards, upgrades and vacations, claims it can cut travel costs as much as 30 percent per trip. (Mr. Ruch said the average Rocketrip user saves the company 24 percent.)The TripActions app lets users specify airplane seat preferences, loyalty club memberships and other personal details before booking. It also allows for last-minute itinerary changes and features a chat line, should complications arise.\u201cI\u2019m leaving for a trip on Monday, so I know I\u2019ll get a call from them on Sunday afternoon letting me know my flights are still on schedule,\u201d he said. He also likes the TripBucks, which accrue the more you travel and the more you save. Mr. Rowley said he had earned $1,700 in rewards and had saved Jive $7,500 since the company started using TripActions at the end of last year. He cashes in his TripBucks for Amazon gift cards.\u201cMy daughter is getting married, so I\u2019m using TripBucks to buy things for her wedding,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve learned from using TripActions that travel really is a behavioral thing. I used to wait until the last minute if I needed to go somewhere. Like, I\u2019d book my tickets late so I could get into a certain hotel. But now I book months in advance because I\u2019m looking to save some money and earn some rewards.\u201dUpside, a third venture developed with the goal of getting business travelers to think like consumers, bypasses travel managers and works directly with employees.Kurt Hosna, global communications director at a Boston human resources management company, said he had used Upside since it started. So far, he has redeemed roughly $1,000 in rewards, much of it for gear for his cycling hobby.Before he and his colleagues started using Upside, Mr. Hosna said, they tried to be good sports about not overspending on travel. His company\u2019s pat-on-the-back approach to acknowledging their conscientiousness was nice, he said. But Upside\u2019s gift cards have been nicer. \u201cGiving people real rewards just makes sense,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Barcelona Attacks Add to Tension Between Catalonia and Spain", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKing Felipe VI and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy attended solemn commemorations in Barcelona for victims. Mr. Rajoy even held a news conference with Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, whom he had not met officially since April of last year.But with the end of the hunt for the assailants this week, the tensions that had been masked by the facade of unity are now threatening to boil over, as the political clock ticks toward a Catalan independence referendum scheduled for Oct. 1. Mr. Rajoy has threatened to block that vote with the help of Spanish courts.The attacks have already helped expose the gaps between the Catalan regional and Spanish national governments.Spain\u2019s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, and his regional counterpart in Catalonia, Joaquim Forn, publicly disagreed this past weekend in their assessment of whether the terrorist cell had been dismantled.Mr. Forn also stoked controversy by making a distinction between Catalan and other Spanish victims of the attacks, during an interview with local media.Those political differences, it is becoming clearer, also have practical security implications that the attack plotters perhaps managed to exploit.Two decades ago, Madrid agreed to give Catalonia full control over policing under its own force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra. Even before last week\u2019s attacks, however, Catalan separatists were demanding more resources for the Mossos.On Sunday, Mr. Puigdemont used a television interview to argue that Catalonia should have direct ties to the C.I.A. and other intelligence services, without information passing through Madrid.\u201cI\u2019m sure the Spanish secret services are in contact with the services of other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the Mossos would love to have this direct relationship with the C.I.A. but it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201dOn Tuesday, however, an association representing Spain\u2019s national and military police turned the argument around, claiming instead that the Catalan authorities had marginalized the contribution of Madrid, \u201cwith only one goal in mind: to show an image outside our borders of a self-sufficient Catalan state.\u201dAdding to this controversy, the Catalan authorities have now acknowledged that last year a Belgian police officer requested information from a Catalan colleague about Abdelbaki Essati, an imam who is believed to have inspired last week\u2019s attacks. The request, however, was made in \u201can absolutely informal manner,\u201d Mr. Forn, the region\u2019s interior minister, said Thursday at a news conference.The next significant test will come on Saturday, when political leaders are urging citizens to join a march in Barcelona to denounce terrorism. Earlier this week, the Popular Unity Candidacy \u2014 a far-left and anti-monarchy party known by its Catalan acronym, CUP \u2014 threatened to boycott the march if King Felipe attends.One of the party\u2019s lawmakers, Mireia Boya, told a local radio station that the monarch was \u201ca friend of Qatar and the Emirates\u201d and as such had contributed to the financing of Islamic terrorism. The party\u2019s threat, however, drew a strong rebuke from Mr. Puigdemont.The CUP is a small but pivotal force in the drive for Catalan independence. Its members have guaranteed that a coalition of separatists hold a majority of the seats in Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament.The party\u2019s reaction to the attacks suggests they not only aggravated tensions between Madrid and Barcelona but created frictions among the separatists themselves.After the attacks, Madrid-based newspapers ran editorials urging the Catalan separatist government to abandon its referendum plan. \u201cAn attack on this scale must serve as a wake-up call for Catalan political forces to return to reality,\u201d El Pa\u00eds wrote.Such commentary, however, has incensed separatists. \u201cSpain\u2019s politicians and media have a long tradition of using terrorism as a political tool, the clearest example being what happened in 2004,\u201d said Salvador Garcia-Ruiz, the chief executive of Ara, a Catalan newspaper that backs independence.\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing the start of the same kind of manipulation \u2014 and I think it will only get worse\u201d as the referendum deadline approaches, he said.The 2004 bombing of commuter trains in Madrid \u2014 only days before a national election \u2014 changed the course of Spanish politics.Voters then punished a conservative government for its rush to blame Basque separatists rather than jihadi militants for the train bombings, Spain\u2019s deadliest terrorist attack.\u201cThere\u2019s clearly the temptation to score points in both Barcelona and Madrid, but everybody remembers there could be an even bigger price to pay if any action gets seen as using such horror only for political gain,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate situation for both sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stung by Overdraft Fees? U.S. Nudges Banks to Explain Rules Better", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserConsumer advocates have long worried that bank customers are easily confused about how checking account overdrafts work, and that this confusion leads to costly fees.The overdraft form is the latest financial document to receive a makeover from the bureau: In 2015, the agency adopted simplified mortgage disclosure forms, which are meant to help borrowers understand the terms of their home loans.But don\u2019t expect banks to use one of the redesigned overdraft disclosures anytime soon. The one-page prototypes are still being field-tested on consumers, and a formal rule-making process would be needed in order to make them official, according to the bureau. Plus, the agency is under political pressure in Washington, where the Republicans who control Congress oppose the bureau\u2019s regulation-friendly approach.\u201cWe look forward to working with the bureau to test the proposed new disclosures to make sure they improve consumer understanding,\u201d said Virginia O\u2019Neill, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association\u2019s center for regulatory compliance.While the forms need tweaking, \u201cthey\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d said Michael Moebs, an economist whose research firm tracks bank account data.An overdraft occurs when you don\u2019t have enough money in your account to cover a bill or purchase, but the bank pays it anyway \u2014 then charges an overdraft fee (typically $34 per incident), which must be paid along with the amount of the shortfall. In the past, overdrafts were mostly caused by checks. But these days, with much consumer spending done on debit cards, overdrafts are commonly triggered by debit purchases. Even overspending by small amounts can trigger a hefty fee.Some bank customers use the service as a convenience, to help make sure their bills are paid if they make an occasional mistake.Mr. Moebs said he thought the new study, based on data from a handful of big banks, might overstate the impact of overdrafts. But the bureau said that its data set was \u201cpowerful\u201d and that the findings were representative of more than 40 million bank accounts.The form currently used to explain the option might confuse customers, Mr. Bourke said. Pew\u2019s own research has found that many people who are hit with overdraft fees don\u2019t recall opting into coverage.Allie Vered, director of the nonprofit America Saves program, which encourages low- and moderate-income families to save, said banks and credit unions often marketed the service as overdraft \u201cprotection,\u201d which sounds beneficial. But consumers should really think of it as opting into a \u201cconsent to fees\u201d if they overspend, she said.The current form omits some helpful information, Mr. Bourke said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show the benefits of not opting in.\u201dOne of the new prototypes does the math for customers, giving examples of what an account balance would be after an overspending incident, with and without overdraft coverage.\u201cThe prototype forms are designed to show more clearly the cost of the fees and when they can be charged,\u201d Mr. Cordray said in his prepared remarks.Here are some questions and answers about overdrafts:If I have already \u201copted in\u201d to overdraft coverage for debit purchases, can I still opt out?Yes. You can change your mind at any time by contacting your bank. If you opt out, and a debit purchase or A.T.M. withdrawal would overdraw your account, the transaction will be declined.Where can I offer my opinion on the redesigned overdraft forms?How can I avoid overdraft fees?Ms. O\u2019Neill of the American Bankers Association suggests signing up for alerts that will notify you if your checking account balance falls below a certain amount. You can also ask your bank about linking your checking account to a savings account or credit card and having funds transferred if you overspend. The bank may still charge a fee, but it\u2019s usually less than the typical overdraft fee.Advertisement"}

Find a way to work around it.\u201dIn particular, Ms. Macdonald must avoid a cycle that plays out over and over in moviedom, one that some film agents coarsely call the fat flavor of the moment. A plus-size actress, almost always an unknown, lands the central role in a film and delivers a knockout performance. She is held up by producers and the entertainment news media as refreshing, long overdue evidence that Hollywood\u2019s insistence on microscopic waistlines is ending.And then she is slowly but surely pushed into bit parts, many of which are defined by weight.\u201cSo often leading roles are perceived by writers, directors and producers as physically idealized, leaving little room for inventive ways of portraying them,\u201d said David Rubin, a casting director and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board member. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to cast actors in roles where their unconventional appearance has absolutely no bearing on the character or story line.\u201dTelevision is slowly changing. Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d helped break down barriers for actresses with average bodies. Even though Ms. Metz\u2019s story lines on \u201cThis Is Us\u201d are frequently about dieting and overeating, she is a star on the show. (She is up for an Emmy, to boot.) And Katy Mixon plays a forthright mom stuck in no-carb Connecticut on \u201cAmerican Housewife,\u201d an ABC sitcom.But movies \u2014 studio movies in particular \u2014 show little improvement for lead actresses. There is only Melissa McCarthy. She has become one of Hollywood\u2019s most bankable stars, reliably carrying movies like \u201cSpy\u201d and \u201cThe Boss\u201d to No. 1 at the box office. But instead of opening doors for other lead actresses, her success is viewed by studios as an anomaly.\u201cAt first you want to slap them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I got used to it pretty quickly. I know they are just doing their jobs. You can\u2019t take it personally.\u201dShe continued, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t look like most lead actresses look, I was told that I shouldn\u2019t even come to America. That I shouldn\u2019t even try! I think that\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m a realist \u2014 yes, I know, darn, I\u2019m unlikely to have a love scene with Chris Hemsworth anytime soon, if ever. But I also believe that persistence and hard work pays off.\u201dMr. Jasper, a first-time feature filmmaker, cast Ms. Macdonald based on her photo. A \u201cPatti Cake$\u201d producer had suggested her after seeing one of her few films, a 2013 thriller called \u201cThe East.\u201d\u201cI looked at that photo, and I just knew instantly,\u201d Mr. Jasper said. \u201cI wanted Patti to be pretty. I based her on some of my family members who are bigger women. And I find Danielle incredibly beautiful.\u201d\u201cPatti Cake$\u201d is a portrait of a self-assured young woman, but the film has some painful scenes related to weight. In one sequence, which takes place at night outside a ramshackle New Jersey gas station, Patti gets into a rap battle with some boys, who taunt her as \u201cDumbo.\u201dThe scene was difficult to shoot because the actor cast as the main instigator, McCaul Lombardi, could not bring himself to hurl the insults at Ms. Macdonald. She ended up coaxing him through it.\u201cI told him, \u2018Look, it\u2019s fine \u2014 words are just words,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIn truth, it was a little more complicated for me than I was letting on. In real life, I never let that kind of stuff bother me. But I had to let it affect me in that moment, at least a little, because my character was absorbing it.\u201d\u201cThis is only the beginning for her,\u201d said Chris Columbus, a \u201cPatti Cake$\u201d producer.

{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma Beats Back No-Confidence Vote in South Africa", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 President Jacob Zuma of South Africa survived a no-confidence motion in Parliament on Tuesday, but by a much narrower margin than expected, revealing the extent to which accusations of graft and mismanagement have weakened his party\u2019s hold on power.After hours of heated debate, the motion was defeated, with 177 lawmakers voting yes, 198 voting no and nine abstaining.If Mr. Zuma had lost, he would have had to resign, along with his entire cabinet. Although he prevailed, his standing within the African National Congress, which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid, has eroded, perhaps beyond the point of repair.Opponents had hoped that anonymous voting would embolden disaffected A.N.C. loyalists to defect and vote against Mr. Zuma without fear of reprisal. It appeared that many did so: The A.N.C. controls 249 seats in the 400-member National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of Parliament; the motion needed 201 votes to pass, and it fell only 24 votes short.As the debate proceeded, crowds massed in Cape Town, the seat of the legislature, to listen to the proceedings, which were streamed and broadcast live. Protesters also gathered in Johannesburg and Pretoria.\u201cThis president must just be removed,\u201d said one marcher, Godfrey Dromp, 54, a supporter of the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who replaces him.\u201dA.N.C. loyalists held a rival march outside City Hall, where Nelson Mandela addressed huge crowds after being released from prison in 1990. \u201cThis is where our democracy began,\u201d a party activist, Nobuntu Kuse, told supporters. \u201cThe A.N.C. freed this country. We aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201dMr. Zuma\u2019s opponents said the vote was essential to restoring confidence in the government and improving the economy. They repeatedly cited a lengthy controversy involving the Guptas, a powerful family that has extensive business holdings and is so close to Mr. Zuma that they were commonly called the Zuptas. Leaked emails have led to accusations of influence peddling and calls for investigations.He urged lawmakers to \u201cvote with your conscience and remove this corrupt and broken president from office.\u201d\u201cWe are not here today to remove the democratically elected government of the A.N.C., which was voted for by our people in 2014,\u201d he said, referring to the last national election.The vote, he said, was \u201cnot against the A.N.C.\u201d but against its leader, whom Mr. Malema called \u201cthe most corrupt individual in this country.\u201dMangosuthu Buthelezi, 88, a veteran of the struggle to topple apartheid and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, said that the \u201cpoisoned seed of corruption\u201d had been planted well before South Africa\u2019s transition to democracy, but that misrule by Mr. Zuma had \u201creached the point that the unthinkable became possible.\u201dUnder Mr. Zuma, he said, the country was for sale \u201cto the highest bidder.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis motion of no confidence is not against the A.N.C. We are not here to say \u2018A.N.C. must fall.\u2019 It is against corruption, it is against state capture, it is against one man.\u201dPieter Groenewald, the leader of Freedom Front Plus, a party of white Afrikaners, urged members of the A.N.C. to abstain rather than vote against the resolution, warning that if they kept Mr. Zuma, voters would blame them, not just the president.Mr. Zuma\u2019s term as president runs until 2019, but the party is gearing up to meet in December to choose new party leaders for the next five years. Mr. Zuma\u2019s narrow victory on Tuesday could empower his critics within the party and weaken supporters like his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is a former home affairs minister and a contender to succeed him as party leader.\u201cThe court of public opinion must not be allowed to become the benchmark of decision making,\u201d Mr. Mabe said. \u201cThis is even more important today, where social media seeks to influence the outcomes, even without subjecting itself to the test of veracity.\u201d\u201cWe are not sellouts,\u201d Ms. Dlakude said.\u201cThe A.N.C. I saw in today\u2019s debate was very different from the arrogant party we normally see in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Mathekga said. \u201c It was a complete shift in tone from previous motions of no confidence where they have defended Zuma.\u201dKimon de Greef reported from Cape Town, and Sewell Chan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Thriving City, SoHo\u2019s Soaring Rents Keep Storefronts Empty", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of the recession, as most of the country struggled, SoHo thrived. Between 2010 and 2014, rents for stores in the former industrial district in Lower Manhattan soared by 75 percent, to an annual $860 a square foot, or $4.3 million a year for a 5,000-square-foot storefront, as national chains pushed into the neighborhood, willing to pay seemingly any price to get a piece of the action.Those were the good old days.Now, with the city\u2019s unemployment at near historic lows and the economy humming along, empty storefronts dot SoHo\u2019s streets, with 16 in the six-block stretch of Broadway between Houston and Canal Streets, the area\u2019s retail spine. More stud the Belgian-blocked side streets, dark gaps between boutiques selling high fashion and designer furniture and the occasional remaining art gallery.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing no velocity in leasing,\u201d said C. Bradley Mendelson, vice chairman of Colliers, a real estate brokerage, and a longtime retail broker. \u201cNo one\u2019s taking space.\u201dAcross the country, retailers have been wounded by competition from Amazon and other internet sales sites, prompting caution in opening new stores, be it in the suburbs, in SoHo or on Fifth Avenue. But the problems in New York City, and in particular SoHo, go beyond that, brokers and retail experts say.\u201cRight now, it feels like retail is on pause,\u201d said David LaPierre, a retail specialist and a vice chairman at CBRE, a real estate services company. \u201cRents need to get to a much more realistic level.\u201dSoHo was once home to small factories, wholesalers and workshops. In the 1960s, artists in search of low rents and big spaces moved into the lofts, often illegally. Over time, art galleries, small boutiques and furniture designers followed, giving the neighborhood cultural cachet. Starting in the 1990s, though, more stores moved in, the galleries decamped for Chelsea and other neighborhoods, and the streets filled with tourists from around the world, often laden with shopping bags.But rents escalated far faster than retail sales throughout Manhattan. Between 2010 and 2014, retail sales in Manhattan climbed 31.9 percent, while rents soared by 90 percent, according to CBRE.In SoHo, big commercial real estate firms like Thor Equities, 60 Guilders and Premier Equities bought out longtime small-scale landlords, pushing rents there even higher.The area also became a hub of flagship stores, for which chains pay top dollar to expand their brand identity and don\u2019t mind breaking even, or even losing money. Typical is the five-story, 55,000-square-foot Nike behemoth at Broadway and Spring Street that opened last winter.\u201cEverything became a flagship,\u201d said Mr. Mendelson of Colliers. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have one on Fifth, one in Times Square and one in SoHo. Flagships don\u2019t make money. They\u2019re ad vehicles to promote the retailer.\u201dOnly the biggest brands can afford that kind of promotion. \u201cAt those levels, many retailers simply can\u2019t afford their store,\u201d said Mr. LaPierre of CBRE. \u201cI don\u2019t know any retailer who can survive while paying 50 percent of their revenue in rent.\u201dAfter rents peaked in 2014, vacancies began opening up and rents slipped. By the spring of 2017, the average asking rent for shop space on Broadway had fallen 21 percent, to $678 a square foot per year, according to CBRE.And still, there are plenty of locations to choose from.Some landlords have started finding ways to generate income. Pop-up stores \u2014 which take over a space temporarily, with a predetermined end date \u2014 offer landlords what Beth Rosen, a retail broker at RKF, a national firm, calls a \u201ckind of a band-aid for the space,\u201d bringing in revenue but not foreclosing the possibility of a permanent rental paying the higher asking rate. Ms. Rosen said that SoHo landlords are more willing than ever to permit the short-term stores, \u201cif they can\u2019t get the rents they want, and it\u2019s a way for the tenant to get comfortable.\u201dSome landlords are offering short term leases while they hunt for higher-paying long-term tenants, giving store owners months free for a limited period, or offering money or a discount on the rent to be used toward building a store.Cases like Milady\u2019s, where an older business closes and then the storefront sits fallow for months or even years, can seem puzzling.But building owners who purchased their properties in recent years with the expectation that rents could only continue to rise may be in a bind. To secure financing, they would have to project a certain level of income, and if they accept less than that, they run the risk of being in default, or having their lender require them to put more equity into the building. At some point, Mr. LaPierre said, those owners will lose their buildings or have to find a partner willing to invest money in the property.\u201cWe\u2019d been asking ourselves, when is this bubble going to burst?\u201d said Sean Sweeney, a SoHo resident since the 1980s and a leader of the SoHo Alliance, a group of residents and longtime shop owners who want to preserve their vision of SoHo, with its narrow streets, low-scale buildings, artists\u2019 lofts and independent retailers.The Alliance, along with the Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer, have pushed the city to enforce the special zoning restrictions in SoHo, like the one that limits the size of stores to no more than 10,000 square feet, which would rule out many of the big national chains. Mr. Sweeney bemoaned the fact that Broadway now looks more like an open-air mall than the home to cutting edge designers and boutiques.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing creative about sneaker stores,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said, a crack at the Nike store. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be known as Herald Square South.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the Untuckit store, it is on Prince Street, not Spring Street, and the storefront identified in a photo caption was occupied by an Old Navy, not a New York Sports Club.Advertisement"}

But not long after, he appeared outside of court and returned to form, saying that he was \u201cdelighted, in many ways,\u201d with the verdict. \u201cThis was a witch hunt of epic proportions, and maybe they found one or two broomsticks,\u201d he said.Later in the afternoon, he was live-streaming once more, sipping beer and joking about prison life from his Manhattan apartment.Jurors convicted Mr. Shkreli of three of the eight counts: securities fraud in connection with his hedge fund MSMB Capital; securities fraud in connection with MSMB Healthcare; and conspiracy to commit securities fraud related to the Retrophin stock scheme, in which he tried to quietly control a huge portion of Retrophin stock.He was acquitted of counts one and two, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud regarding MSMB Capital; counts four and five, the same charges with MSMB Healthcare; and count seven, conspiracy to commit wire fraud with regard to defrauding Retrophin by using funds from it to pay MSMB investors.Count seven carried the most weight for sentencing, charging Mr. Shkreli with defrauding Retrophin by creating sham consulting agreements and unauthorized settlement agreements to pay back MSMB investors. It was associated with the biggest loss, which judges take into account when deciding sentences in fraud cases, said Benjamin Brafman, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer.As Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto read the verdict, Mr. Shkreli, wearing a black polo shirt and khakis, sat with his arms crossed. He showed outward relief when Judge Matsumoto said he was not guilty on count seven, mouthing \u201cYes\u201d and patting Mr. Brafman on the back. When she said he was guilty of count eight, the Retrophin securities-fraud conspiracy, he hung his head.After the verdict was read, he gathered in a circle with his lawyers, looking a little shaken, then pulled on a hoodie. By the time he got outside court, where he gave his statements, he was smiling and speaking smoothly.Bridget M. Rohde, the acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the federal prosecutors\u2019 office in Brooklyn, said she was gratified by the verdict. \u201cOur work is not done: Mr. Shkreli remains to be sentenced, and there\u2019s a co-defendant in the case,\u201d she said, referring to Evan Greebel, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s onetime lawyer, who is scheduled to be tried in the fall.A sentencing date was not set; Judge Matsumoto said she would wait for submissions from both sides on how much money was lost. She set a fall date for those submissions. Mr. Brafman said the defense might ask for no prison time.He described the deliberations as methodical and logical and said the jurors had focused on whether Mr. Shkreli had intended to harm investors who gave him money.The jury voted to convict on counts in which they saw fraudulent intent to take money, the juror said.At Mr. Shkreli\u2019s trial, prosecutors, defense lawyers and witnesses provided sharply different takes on the defendant as they described how he rose from an ambitious young hedge fund manager to a notorious pharmaceutical executive.The prosecution brought forth an \u201cavalanche\u201d of evidence, as the prosecutor Jacquelyn Kasulis put it in her rebuttal argument, that Mr. Shkreli illegally used Retrophin to repay the defrauded MSMB investors. The evidence included a threatening letter he sent to the wife of a former employee; statements he sent to MSMB investors showing great returns at the same time he had no money in fund accounts; three versions of a backdated agreement to make it look as if MSMB Capital had invested in Retrophin when it had not; and claims about assets under management that were wildly out of line with his actual fund size.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Martin Shkreli to be held accountable,\u201d she said.His lawyers focused on the fact that his investors ultimately made back much more than their initial investments. They said that was proof that Mr. Shkreli had never intended to commit fraud. Instead, they said, he worked hard to get Retrophin off the ground so he could reimburse MSMB investors.\u201cHe did it, and it worked, and they got paid,\u201d Mr. Brafman said in his closing statement. \u201cWhen they got the financing, they started to pay these people, not to loot Retrophin.\u201dHowever, prosecutors said that paying Mr. Shkreli\u2019s old investors was not the responsibility of Retrophin, a public company, and that Mr. Shkreli had misled his MSMB investors. \u201cLying to people to get them to invest with you is fraud,\u201d Ms. Kasulis said in her final statement.Mr. Shkreli is the child of Albanian immigrants. He was raised in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College High School, one of the city\u2019s elite public schools. He went to Baruch, one of New York\u2019s city colleges, and landed an internship at Cramer Berkowitz, going on to other money-management jobs.As he recruited investors for his own funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, he was cunning at times, almost a shape-shifter. He told an investor who had not graduated from college that he had not finished college either, according to testimony. To an established Texas investor, he said he had graduated young from Columbia. He told another investor, in an email chain about Steve Jobs, a college dropout, that he had dropped out of Columbia.His lawyers painted him as an oddball who did not brush his teeth and slept in a sleeping bag at his office.Before the trial, Mr. Shkreli was perhaps best known for increasing the price on the drug Daraprim, which treats a parasitic infection, to $750 a tablet from $13.50, when he was the chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015. The public and politicians vilified him for the price increase, and Mr. Shkreli responded by buying another drug and saying he would raise the price on that one, too.Documents entered into evidence throughout the trial showed Mr. Shkreli as devil-may-care. At one point, Mr. Greebel, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s co-defendant and former lawyer, wanted to have a phone call with him about an issue involving lawyer-client privilege, and Mr. Shkreli responded, \u201cNot available by phone ever Sorry.\u201dDuring his postverdict live-stream, Mr. Shkreli, sipping from a bottle of India pale ale, speculated that his sentence would be \u201cclose to nil\u201d and said that he was not anticipating spending time in a maximum security facility, adding \u201cthis is not \u2018Oz\u2019 or \u2018The Wire.\u2019\u201dRather, he said, he imagined serving in what he termed \u201cClub Fed,\u201d playing basketball, tennis and Xbox, and resurfacing \u201cback out on these streets very quickly.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Martin Shkreli\u2019s position as the verdict was read. He was sitting, not standing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Have a Say Over the Subways, From Hundreds of Miles Away", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert G. Ortt is a Republican state senator from the Niagara Falls area who \u201chasn\u2019t had a recent experience with the NYC subway system,\u201d according to an email from his spokeswoman.Joseph A. Griffo, another Republican from upstate New York, who is the deputy majority whip in the State Senate, is not big on the subway when he visits the city. \u201cHe usually either walks or takes an Uber or taxi,\u201d his spokesman explained.The future of the nation\u2019s busiest subway system, which has become engulfed in crisis, could well depend on New York State lawmakers like Mr. Ortt and Mr. Griffo, who live hundreds of miles from the city and do not have day-to-day familiarity with its dilapidated transit infrastructure. But since they have a say over the finances of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, they can influence the lives of millions of subway riders.And in the drama that is state government in New York \u2014 with its complicated relationships between the mayor and the governor, as well as between the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled State Senate \u2014 the Legislature has not always been kind to the needs of the city\u2019s aging public transit system.Either approach would require the Legislature\u2019s approval, and winning passage would be difficult, if not impossible. The Senate has been particularly averse to imposing any new taxes or fees that would flow directly to the city.\u201cThe political dynamics of the State Senate have allowed New York City to be consistently outmaneuvered,\u201d said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor at New York University and the director of its Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management.\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of the upstate legislators treating New York City as if it was a wayward, profligate political entity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is just the reverse \u2014 upstate gets a disproportionate amount of attention and resources, given its half-century of economic decline, and that\u2019s hurt the New York metropolitan area, which is driving the state\u2019s economy.\u201dThe New York Times contacted the remaining 37 about when they last visited New York City and whether they took the subway during the trip. Eleven replied.Among them was Carl Marcellino, a Republican from Long Island, who said the subway was generally \u201ca good way to go,\u201d although he did not take it on his last trip to the city, after the birth of a grandchild about a month ago. He said he rode the Long Island Rail Road to Pennsylvania Station and then took a taxi to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center on the Upper East Side.He said he opposed both the millionaires\u2019 tax and congestion pricing. Of the mayor and the governor, he said, \u201cThey should come together and stop playing silly games.\u201dBut it is not just Republicans in the State Senate who are not regular riders. David J. Valesky, a Democrat who represents part of the Syracuse area, said through a spokeswoman that it had been several years since he had taken the subway.George Latimer, a Democrat from Westchester, said he usually travels to Manhattan a couple of times a month. The last time, on July 31, he took the subway, but said he prefers to walk when he can. He also said he was wary of raising taxes, given the property taxes that Westchester residents already pay.The mayor\u2019s proposed tax would raise about $700 million a year, with nearly three-fourths going toward capital costs for new subway cars and $250 million funding half-price fares for low-income riders, a plan that is gaining momentum among some lawmakers. City officials estimated that about 32,000 people earn enough to be subject to the new tax.Mr. Cuomo argues that the severity of the subway system\u2019s problems has shifted both the political landscape and public opinion and has made congestion pricing \u201can idea whose time has come.\u201d But Mr. de Blasio said last week that he \u201cdoes not believe\u201d in the proposal.\u201cI\u2019ve never been in favor of this strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an example of it that I thought was fair.\u201dIt was another governor who wrested control of the subways from the city: Nelson A. Rockefeller, in the 1960s. In the process, he displaced Robert Moses, who had shaped the physical and political landscape in New York for generations and whose many titles had included chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The authority had a large amount of surplus cash on hand. Rockefeller and William J. Ronan, whom Rockefeller named to run the new Metropolitan Transportation Authority, wanted to use money from the bridge-toll surplus to avoid a subway fare increase.\u201cThe city was pleased to shed the responsibility for operating and financing the transit system,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Peter W. Herman, who later became chairman of the Regional Plan Association, wrote in an article in 1970 for a law review journal that the creation of the transportation agency was \u201ccertainly a high-water mark in outside control over what was once a municipally owned and operated transit system.\u201dMr. Herman, who stepped down as chairman of the planning group in 2010, was asked recently if the city\u2019s transportation system was at the mercy of upstate lawmakers, Mr. Herman said, \u201cIt absolutely is, and always has been.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why a Republican legislature is so ignorant or selfish,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cMaybe, that they don\u2019t understand the economy of the entire state will be harmed if New York City\u2019s own economy is harmed.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the future of the New York City subway misidentified the person who said that \u201cthe city was pleased to shed the responsibility for operating and financing the transit system.\u201d The comment was by Mitchell L. Moss, a professor at New York University \u2014 not by Robert Moses, the noted New York City builder. (Mr. Moses died in 1981.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Summer Flight Delayed? Don\u2019t Assume It\u2019s a Storm", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesConsider all the reasons your summer flight could be delayed.And with more people taking to the skies in the summer, there are fewer empty seats on other flights to get travelers back on their way.\u201cThese tend to be a summer phenomenon, and that tends to be the busiest time,\u201d said Dan McKone, a managing director and partner at L.E.K. Consulting. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a delay, there\u2019s not a lot of slack in the system.\u201dJohn Grant, a senior analyst at the aviation data provider OAG, agreed. \u201cWith more passengers,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen things start to fall apart, more people are inconvenienced.\u201dRich Prest, a management consultant in the San Francisco Bay Area who flies up to 100,000 miles a year, said a recent business trip between Minneapolis and Chicago had turned into an ordeal because of the weather.His initial flight was canceled because of storms, and the subsequent flight \u2014 on which he managed to get the last open seat \u2014 was first delayed and then rerouted around a patch of stormy weather, more than doubling the length of a one-hour flight.Even with the detour, Mr. Prest said, it was a rough ride. \u201cBecause my other flight had been canceled, I was in the very last seat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like driving down a bumpy dirt road in a car.\u201dStorms that move eastward from the Midwest, particularly between 3 and 7 p.m., tend to wreak the most havoc on flight schedules.\u201cThe issue is they move in lines, generally west to east, and they generally move right through the Ohio Valley, which is probably the routing of 40 percent of the east-west traffic in the U.S.,\u201d said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant.\u201cAs those lines of thunderstorms move, they basically block traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re strong enough to go up to very high altitudes, sometimes up to 50,000 feet, and you\u2019re not going to outfly that.\u201dThe hub-and-spoke systems used by the major air carriers can make the problem worse. Not only are many major hubs in thunderstorm-prone locations, but connecting-flight delays can have a domino effect. That is one reason travelers might have weather-related flight delays even if the sun is shining at their origination and destination cities.The need to give rough weather a wide berth can also lead to delays. Airlines avoid flying through storm cells and fly around volatile weather, though the distance from the storm depends on its severity.\u201cThe wind is one of the most important issues,\u201d said Bijan Vasigh, professor of economics and finance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cWind shear is one of the most dangerous things,\u201d he said, referring to an abrupt shift in wind speed or direction.The real issue with wind shear, said Mr. McKone of L.E.K. Consulting, is \u201cif it gets down near the taxiway.\u201d Wind shear during landing \u201ccan be quite a problem because you\u2019re often slowing the plane down to a pace where it\u2019s very difficult to recover,\u201d he said.A single storm can disrupt up to 100 flights for a large carrier, and these disruptions can be expensive.\u201cWe absorbed $125 million pretax loss from the operational disruption following severe storms that hit Atlanta in early April,\u201d the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, Ed Bastian, told investors on the airline\u2019s most recently quarterly earnings conference call. Delta has 25 meteorologists on staff who create weather forecasts, with particular focus on its hub airports in the United States.Scheduling around storms is a complicated process involving not only the affected airlines but also air traffic control, and must take into account everything from the number of flights and passengers affected to limits on flight crew hours, gate availability and tarmac delay rules that airlines can be fined for violating.\u201cWe do have a tool that will optimize our best choices, but we have to give it the philosophy of how to apply it,\u201d said Steve West, senior director of network operations control at Southwest Airlines.\u201cWe might have to modify it a little with some human intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can reaccommodate some of our customers and keep everybody else on time, that\u2019s our preference.\u201dCarriers have also been rolling out new technologies to help travelers cope. Mr. Prest said he used a function on United Airlines\u2019s app to track where his plane was coming from so he would know whether to anticipate a possible delay.\u201cIf it\u2019s looking problematic, you\u2019ve got to expect delays, so you\u2019ve got to know where planes are coming from,\u201d he said.Last month, American Airlines added notifications that alert travelers if their checked bags have arrived so they are not left waiting at the luggage carousel.Airlines also say they have become more proactive about offering travelers the opportunity to change their flights without penalty if bad weather is in the forecast.\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely increased the number of waivers we\u2019ve put out this summer compared to other summers,\u201d said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines.Diana P. Wilson, who lives in Sacramento and works in event logistics, switched a flight for a business trip in Columbus, Ohio, to connect in Denver rather than Chicago after receiving an airline alert that heavy rain was predicted for Chicago.But Ms. Wilson did not fare much better in Denver, she said, when her flight was delayed because the airline had to find 17 passengers willing to take later flights.\u201cI started finding out that what was happening was there were weather issues,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cIt was too hot and they had to lighten the plane, and that\u2019s why they needed so many people.\u201dOn Chuck Doherty\u2019s way home to Providence, R.I., from a business trip to Baltimore last month, his flight was delayed nearly three hours because a backup plane was too hot for passengers to board after sitting on the tarmac for much of the day, he said. The backup had been pressed into service because the initial plane was running so far behind schedule.\u201cThey kept telling us they weren\u2019t able to get it cool enough for us to board,\u201d said Mr. Doherty, a software developer. \u201cAt one announcement, they said the internal cabin temperature was 110.\u201dHe added, \u201cI fly a lot, and this is absolutely the first time I\u2019ve ever encountered this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Vibrant Turnaround for a Neglected Charleston Neighborhood", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 On Sunday mornings about a decade ago, shortly after he moved here, Stephen J. Zoukis used to ride his bike around a ramshackle neighborhood a couple of miles north of the city\u2019s celebrated historic district and wonder why no one had built anything of note there.The neighborhood, known in the 1850s as Cool Blow Village and now as the Upper Peninsula, was dotted with small houses, warehouses and metal sheds; had only a few sidewalks; and was infused with an air of neglect. Even with easy access from an interstate ramp, the neighborhood \u201clacked an economic pulse,\u201d he said.Surveying the unprepossessing landscape of Charleston\u2019s Upper Peninsula, Mr. Zoukis imagined that it could be so much more.\u201cWe saw a big opportunity for our kind of money,\u201d said Mr. Zoukis, who, flush with cash from the sales of most of the New York properties, was unencumbered by the need to seek financing from banks. He joined forces with a Charleston partner, Michael L. Wooddy, who holds 10 percent of Mr. Zoukis\u2019s position, and in 2012 began snapping up all the available lots they could find, ultimately more than 20.\u201cIt was really before people realized what was happening, so the pricing was very different than it is now,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said, referring to a recent boom in Charleston\u2019s commercial and residential sectors. \u201cYou looked at a map of the city and clearly people had to move up the peninsula because there was no place else to go.\u201dWorking under their new shingle, the Raven Cliff Company, the partners initially sought to build a \u201cshrunken\u201d version of the Chelsea Market, the highly successful assemblage of food vendors and retail stores in Manhattan. \u201cBut we determined that you can\u2019t really just scale these things down that way,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said, noting the chasm between a place like New York\u2019s Fulton Fish Market, which \u201ccleans a million pounds of fish a day,\u201d and \u201csomeone who\u2019s starting an artisanal pickle company.\u201dA fresh option was suggested by Charleston\u2019s budding tech sector, which has since grown to about 250 companies in the metro area, according to the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. Many were downtown and had little room to expand there. That inspired the two Raven Cliff partners \u2014 eventually joined by two others, Martin Skelly and Christian Sullivan \u2014 to step in.\u201cI knew that we could get the tech companies to fill these places,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said of his Upper Peninsula properties. He and his partners spent more than $70 million, including construction costs and the land purchases, to create two architecturally striking office park developments to accommodate not only tech companies but businesses that could provide goods and services to the companies\u2019 workers, as well as to the public.\u201cWe saw them as places to not just impress your clients, like a law office, but to impress your employees,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said while sipping a cortado in a gleaming, white-tiled coffee and pastry shop at one of the two developments, Pacific Box & Crate, which covers 131,000 square feet in three buildings.In January, Pacific Box & Crate opened to its first tenant, BoomTown, which employs 250 people and creates software for real estate brokerage firms. \u201cThis suited our needs,\u201d said Nina Magnesson, whose business card describes her as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for \u201ccitizenship and social innovation.\u201dThe space BoomTown occupies, all 56,854 square feet of it, was designed in the \u201cindustrial chic\u201d style and built for the company from what had been \u201ca disaster of a warehouse,\u201d Ms. Magnesson said. \u201cWe were the first to sign on here. We\u2019d been in a little old grocery store downtown.\u201dOther tenants at Pacific Box & Crate \u2014 named after previous industrial tenants on the property \u2014 include PhishLabs, which helps companies and organizations fight cyberattacks; the crowdfunding company CrowdReach; Twelve South, which makes tech accessories; and the Harbor Entrepreneur Center. There are also Bad Wolf Coffee; Reverb Yoga; Edmund\u2019s Oast Brewing Company, set to open on Sept. 14; and a 9,970-square-foot food court, called Workshop, that functions as a \u201cfood incubator\u201d for aspirant restaurateurs.\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t love this space?\u201d asked Suzie Rybicki, a vice president for talent management at PhishLabs, as she surveyed the company\u2019s stark, efficiently laid out, two-story headquarters. \u201cIf you think about what\u2019s been developed up here, with the restaurants, etc., it\u2019s a very different scene.\u201dA few blocks away, Raven Cliff\u2019s other development, Half Mile North \u2014 its name an allusion to the site\u2019s distance from the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge \u2014 has been in business since April 2013. Its 12 buildings, which add up to 90,583 square feet, house several tech companies, including Blue Acorn, which calls itself a \u201cpremium ecommerce agency\u201d; the \u201cautomated bookkeeping\u201d firm Ceterus; SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, an expense management firm; and Integral Solutions Group. There are also three restaurants, a cheese store, an architecture firm and a shop that sells decorative hardware.\u201cSteve has taken a unique approach,\u201d said Kristopher B. King, the executive director of the Preservation Society of Charleston. \u201cHis strategy gets these neighborhoods functioning, which is a huge positive. It\u2019s putting these properties back on the tax rolls, creating jobs and bringing vibrancy to an area that quite honestly, 10 years ago, really needed it.\u201dIn addition, the two developments appear to have helped raise the cost of nearby properties.\u201cWhen we initially started buying land, values were in the $500,000 to $800,000 range per acre,\u201d Mr. Wooddy said. \u201cNow, purportedly, there are some tracts of land under contract for as much as $4 million per acre. Undoubtedly, land values have skyrocketed on the Upper Peninsula since we started to work in this area.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Wooddy said, rents for office space there have doubled since 2013.Rising prices are also a factor elsewhere in Charleston and its periphery. A wave of real estate investment, much of it from Europe, is beginning to change the landscape in all but the city\u2019s protected core.\u201cWe\u2019re talking to outside entities every month \u2014 that\u2019s a new phenomenon,\u201d said Michael J. Graney, a vice president for global business development at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. \u201cIt used to be that people thought we were talking about Charlotte,\u201d he went on, referring to the larger city in North Carolina, \u201cbut the recognition factor has dramatically increased. Many of the investors we talk to have already been here as tourists.\u201dThe boom in Charleston is already running up against a shortage of options.\u201cLack of readily developable land in the Charleston region is a real challenge,\u201d said Stephanie L. Yarbrough, a lawyer who represents companies looking to set up industrial plants, distribution centers or offices in the area. \u201cOne of our hurdles is finding them a place that is ready to go.\u201dLong a magnet for tourists, Charleston has taken decades to evolve from a placid, picturesque Southern town, replete with historical significance, into something resembling a 21st-century city.\u201cWe\u2019re in the awkward adolescent period of growth,\u201d said Josh Martin, a senior adviser to Charleston\u2019s mayor, John Tecklenburg. \u201cThis happened very quickly, and we\u2019re trying to grow up.\u201dA photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified a project that Stephen J.

{"Headline": "The Benefits of Standing by the President", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe heaped praise on Jared Kushner at a private gathering of bankers and corporate executives in December, congratulating President Trump\u2019s son-in-law on the surprise election triumph.He stood up again in May before a group of corporate leaders on the 39th floor of Citigroup\u2019s offices to remind them of all the good the Trump administration could do for the economy and the country.And at a meeting on Monday with his employees, as Mr. Trump\u2019s support in corporate America began to crumble over remarks about white nationalists, he condemned the violence in Charlottesville, Va., but not the president\u2019s response to it. By week\u2019s end, a rebellion among corporate leaders led to the disbanding of business advisory councils to the president.Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant Blackstone and the leader of one of the councils, has not been alone on Wall Street in his embrace of the Trump presidency, particularly after the corporate world endured eight years of Obama-era regulation. But in each of these private meetings, recounted by people who attended them, Mr. Schwarzman emerged as one of the president\u2019s most respected and reliable allies in high finance.People close to Mr. Schwarzman say he does not view himself as a member of the president\u2019s inner circle, but rather as an independent businessman who gives the White House advice on trade and the economy.In May, while the president was visiting Saudi Arabia, Blackstone announced the agreement to manage the fund, the largest in the world to invest in infrastructure projects. The announcement was made at the royal palace in Riyadh as Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner looked on.Blackstone has noted that it has a long-running relationship with Saudi Arabia, which had invested in Blackstone before, and said Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s support for the president had nothing to do with the infrastructure deal, which it believes would have happened regardless of who was president. The agreement was the \u201cculmination of a year\u2019s discussions\u201d with the Saudis that began during the Obama administration, the company said.Still, interviews with four people briefed on the deal revealed that the Saudis had been discussing a possible partnership with a number of other firms as well, and formally decided on Blackstone \u2014 a fund-raising juggernaut that manages funds larger than the economies of some nations \u2014 only after Mr. Schwarzman had started advising the president.In addition to Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s prominence, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund was drawn to the firm\u2019s record of generating huge investment returns and building new business lines, from real estate to hedge funds, according to the people with knowledge of the deal.There is no suggestion that Blackstone did anything wrong. Instead, the company\u2019s experience illustrates the incentives that corporate leaders have to develop strong ties with Mr. Trump \u2014 the country\u2019s businessman in chief \u2014 and the reputational risks associated with those relationships when Mr. Trump veers off course, as he did this past week.\u201cPublic service is a core value for people of my generation,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to be asked to help the country \u2014 even if it occasionally comes with some degree of criticism.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia pushed the Blackstone deal forward so that it could be announced while the president was there, two people briefed on the agreement said. And the new fund, which plans to invest in projects like aging bridges and roads primarily in the United States, is expected to benefit from any federal infrastructure plan that may materialize under the Trump administration.A Blackstone spokeswoman said that while a federal plan \u201cwould be helpful, our business is not at all dependent upon it since state and local governments \u2014 which build the vast majority of projects \u2014 are already pursuing billions of dollars in public-private partnerships.\u201dSome of the other investment firms that were in discussions about a Saudi partnership, including Brookfield and the Carlyle Group, had more experience in managing infrastructure funds and are still in talks with the Saudis according to the people who were not authorized to speak about a private deal.But the Saudi sovereign wealth fund saw that as a benefit for Blackstone: Without its own infrastructure fund, the company would have the flexibility to build one from scratch to the liking of the Saudis. Blackstone, which has invested in infrastructure projects but does not have a stand-alone fund, is expected to raise at least another $20 billion for the Saudi fund.Other deals involving chief executives with ties to Mr. Trump were announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia.In all, there were more than 40 signed agreements between Saudi Arabia and largely American corporations, including General Electric and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin. The deal signings, which Mr. Trump said were valued at nearly $400 billion, came on the same day that about 50 chief executives from the United States and Saudi Arabia had gathered at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh to discuss business opportunities.It is routine for the Commerce Department to advocate American companies \u2014 and for trade missions to lead to the signing of partnerships \u2014 but the scale of the Saudi event was unusual compared with previous United States-Saudi gatherings, according to people who attended.The Saudi sovereign wealth fund did not respond to requests for comment.While Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s support for the president caused a public relations headache for Blackstone this past week, friends say he is not the type of corporate leader to express regrets about taking on a prominent role in Washington.\u201cSteve Schwarzman is not a person who second guesses himself, and I don\u2019t believe anything catches him off guard,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group focused on economic policy.Ms. Wylde said she had spoken this month with Mr. Schwarzman, who is co-chairman of the group\u2019s board, and found him to be in good spirits. \u201cHe was speaking from a position of strength,\u201d she said.Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Trump are hardly old friends.Mr. Schwarzman, a Republican billionaire, did not support Mr. Trump during the election and gave no contributions to his campaign. Two of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s top deputies at Blackstone are big Democratic donors.But while Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s alliance with Mr. Trump is new, his ties to Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, run deeper. Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, attended Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 70th birthday party in February at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., near Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.In 2013, well before Mr. Trump was even a candidate, Blackstone financed the purchase of a few warehouses and industrial buildings by Mr. Kushner\u2019s family company, according to a person briefed on the transaction.Blackstone also made a loan, which has since been paid off, to Kushner Companies on a Rector Street property in Manhattan. And last summer, an entity controlled by Blackstone lent $376 million to Mr. Kushner\u2019s company to purchase a large property in Brooklyn that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had operated for many years, real estate records show.Mr. Kushner is also friendly with Jon Gray, a senior Blackstone executive who runs its real estate business. (Blackstone is the largest commercial real estate investor in the world.)Mr. Kushner and Mr. Gray, a Democrat, have been photographed together at Manhattan social events, and before the election, Mr. Kushner urged the staff at the Commercial Observer newspaper, which Mr. Kushner used to run, to place Mr. Gray higher on its list of \u201cPower 100\u201d real estate executives, according to a former employee with knowledge of the list. In 2016, Mr. Gray was No. 1 on that list.Blackstone said it had no knowledge of efforts to influence the ranking, but Mr. Gray often lands at the top of lists of leading players in real estate.Separately, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump invested up to $500,000 in a fund that Blackstone manages. The couple is now in the process of divesting, according to the couple\u2019s financial disclosure. Blackstone declined to comment on specific investors, but a spokeswoman noted that the firm had thousands of investors across its many funds.Shortly after the election, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Schwarzman to lead the Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of executives from big banks and other companies that would advise the president on economic issues. The group met only twice before being disbanded this past week in the wake of the president\u2019s comments about Charlottesville.In those two meetings, the group discussed issues important to business like infrastructure and regulations. Within hours of the first meeting in February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to roll back Obama-era financial rules.Weeks after the group met in April, Mr. Schwarzman addressed the board of the Partnership for New York City. He made a case that Mr. Trump was good for business and in turn the country, according to two people who attended. Unlike many people in Washington, Mr. Schwarzman said, Mr. Trump could accomplish tax policy reform and an infrastructure overhaul.Blackstone manages about $370 billion. But the private equity firm is always on the hunt for more \u2014 and Saudi Arabia was ripe for the picking.The kingdom has been looking to diversify its economy beyond fossil fuels and to make investments in other areas like tech and infrastructure.Last year, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund began soliciting bids from multiple investment firms to manage an infrastructure fund, according to two people briefed on the matter. Blackstone and other American asset managers were among those to have discussions with the kingdom, the people said.In May 2016, Mr. Schwarzman flew to Riyadh to speak with Mohammed bin Salman, then the deputy crown prince of the Saudi royal family. The prince, who has since ascended to become first in line to the throne, was overseeing the sovereign wealth fund, known as the public investment fund. Mr. Schwarzman and the prince met again about a month later in New York, in part to discuss infrastructure, a person briefed on the meeting said.It was not until months later that the selection process formally gained momentum \u2014 and by then, a lot had changed. The newly elected Trump administration signaled that its policies, particularly the president\u2019s hard line against Iran, would be more amenable to the Saudis than President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda for the region.In March, the Saudis hired an American adviser to help vet the investment firms vying for the infrastructure deal. By April, Blackstone stood out as the winner, a person briefed on the deal said. (Some of the other firms are still discussing other infrastructure projects with the kingdom.)The timeline for announcing the infrastructure fund manager was suddenly accelerated when the White House said in early May that Mr. Trump would make Saudi Arabia the destination of his first foreign trip as president.It was a big moment for the kingdom. After years of complex relations with Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump offered the Saudis a more straightforward alliance.\u201cThey felt they could do business with the Trump administration without any real focus on thorny issues such as human rights or questions of governance that have complicated bilateral ties with other presidencies in the past,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.The Saudis scrambled to put together a business meeting on the same weekend as Mr. Trump\u2019s visit \u2014 when the world\u2019s news media would be glued to the new president\u2019s first foreign trip.Dow Chemical\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Liveris, worked with the Saudis to organize a meeting that would showcase the country\u2019s many opportunities for global businesses.By then, Blackstone was exchanging formal documents with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. But if it wanted the infrastructure deal to proceed, Blackstone had to agree to a nonbinding version of the deal in time for the president\u2019s visit.Dozens of chief executives from across the United States faced pressure over the meeting. Some of them, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they had felt they had no choice but to go if they wanted to do business in Saudi Arabia. One executive said that he had planned to send a subordinate, but that an event organizer had told him that he should attend.The guest list included an oil executive, defense contractors and a college president. Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, was also at the meeting. In April, his bank had received a capital markets license in Saudi Arabia that would allow it do more business there, after being frozen out for many years.Mr. Schwarzman and other American executives had joined Mr. Dmitriev\u2019s international advisory board seven years earlier, but most resigned after Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Crimea.The celebration in Saudi Arabia stretched throughout the weekend, highlighted by a lunch at the royal palace and a dinner at the home of Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, the fund that is working with Blackstone, according to people who attended the dinner.The day after the deals were announced, Mr. Trump gave a speech, thanking the Saudis for their hospitality and their willingness to cooperate on terrorism and business matters.The president also called the deals that Americans companies had struck \u201cblessed news.\u201dReporting was contributed by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Jesse Drucker, Susanne Craig and Sharon LaFraniere.

{"Headline": "Pushing for a Commute That Would Rise Above the Rest", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey would seem more at home in Austria or Switzerland, zipping up the side of the Alps. But suddenly, American cities from Albany to Austin, Tex., are pinning their hopes on, of all things, gondolas.The allure is not just speed. Gondolas do not contribute to greenhouse gases, and they soar over clogged highways and balky subway signals. They are relatively fast and cheap to build. And unlike most forms of transportation, they offer singular vistas that attract tourism as well.Despite a dozen gondola proposals around the United States, in cities as varied as Seattle, Tampa, Chicago and Baton Rouge, La., only one such system has opened in recent years. The Portland Aerial Tram, which was built mainly to relieve crowding at Oregon Health and Science University, recently had its 10th anniversary. The tram drew more than two million riders last year and has spurred economic development in the area.Backers of gondolas in New York recognize the hurdles in convincing both elected officials and the riding public that aerial transit\u2019s time has come.\u201cThere\u2019s not really a road map for doing this type of project,\u201d said Daniel Levy, president of CityRealty, a real estate listings and data website, and the man behind East River Skyway. \u201cIf you are doing an office building or apartment building, those things get built every day.\u201dMr. Levy lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. During a ski trip to Chamonix, France, in the Alps a few years ago, he had an epiphany of sorts.\u201cI stumbled upon a brand-new state-of-the-art gondola system in France and it frankly reminded me of a New York City subway car,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was quite large, with 35 passengers per car. And by the time I got halfway up the mountain, I said, \u2018Jeez, why isn\u2019t there one of these between Brooklyn and Manhattan?\u2019 The congestion on the L train is legendary.\u201dIn 2014, Mr. Levy formed East River Skyway, a limited liability corporation. He has since talked to anyone who will listen \u2014 including officials in City Hall and potential investors \u2014 about his vision for a 1.8-mile system that would have cables strung across a half-dozen towers carrying 120,000 people a day, between the intersection of Delancey and Chrystie Streets in Manhattan, to two different stops in Williamsburg.Like the proponents of the Albany-Rensselaer gondola, Mr. Levy thinks that the East River Skyway could be built with private financing and supported through a combination of ticket sales (monthly passes of about $25 to $30) and corporate sponsorships, similar to Citi Bike, the bicycle sharing program.\u201cWe envision it being a profitable endeavor and that\u2019s why there is interest from the private sector,\u201d said Mr. Levy, who declined to identify potential backers. \u201cBut first and foremost, having experienced this type of technology, I think it would be a beautiful addition to the skyline and a beautiful way for people to start their day.\u201dNew York already has something akin to a gondola: About three miles north of the proposed East River Skyway, the Roosevelt Island Tramway has been operating since 1976. (An aerial tram has one very large cabin going in both directions; a gondola uses many smaller cabins that run continuously in a circle.)Nonetheless, there are skeptics. Transportation Alternatives, the bicycle and pedestrian advocacy group, said that a gondola, while worth pursuing, was not a solution to the coming shutdown of the L train for repairs related to Hurricane Sandy. Rather, the group was focused on urging the city to create a network of dedicated bus lanes in and around the L train corridor.\u201cIn the bigger picture, none of these concepts are necessarily either/or,\u201d said Caroline Samponaro, the group\u2019s deputy director, referring to gondolas versus bus lanes. \u201cBut the gondola is not something on our list of priorities right now.\u201dIn Syracuse, a gondola seemed far less a priority there than it was to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who included it in his executive budget in January. The gondola would \u201ctransport visitors and concertgoers between the fairgrounds and Onondaga County\u2019s Lakeview Amphitheater,\u201d according to the budget summary.While the fate of the fairgrounds gondola seems murky at best, another gondola plan seems to be gaining traction in the state capital. State lawmakers and others who get off Amtrak trains in Rensselaer often compete for taxis to take them over the Hudson to Empire State Plaza, the state government complex in downtown Albany, and a new convention center.According to Mr. Melewski, the gondola would connect the Rensselaer rail station to two locations in downtown Albany. Four dozen cabins would stretch along a one-mile-long steel cable supported by 14 towers. Plans call for the gondola to operate 16 hours a day, transporting at least 3,000 passengers an hour.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in urban gondolas right now,\u201d Mr. Melewski said. \u201cYou are seeing the same thing with ferries, where the ridership far exceeds what is estimated. You know when you are going to get on and off, and you are not stuck in traffic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venice Film Festival Tends Its Prestige With Care", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d and other opening-night predecessors, \u201cDownsizing\u201d is a pedigreed American film with stars, a hook and an ambitious use of genre. Mr. Payne, though a generation older than Mr. Chazelle, also had his roots in indie film before moving on to larger canvases and even bigger names. From \u201cDownsizing\u201d to \u201cGravity,\u201d a particular curated brand of cinema is discernible in Venice\u2019s opening-night selections, one that captures the imagination while delving into character psychology.\u201cThe premise may be a bit fantastical, but I\u2019m more interested in human beings and, in a way, the banal side of a fantastic idea. It\u2019s really a science fiction idea as an excuse to enter the story,\u201d Mr. Payne said of \u201cDownsizing\u201d in a telephone conversation during a break from putting the finishing touches on the film\u2019s coloring.\u201cDownsizing\u201d is one of three highly anticipated genre-related efforts from big studios in competition for Venice\u2019s Golden Lion honors. Darren Aronofsky returns with \u201cMother!,\u201d a thriller starring Jennifer Lawrence; \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d is the Cold War-era tale of an aquatic creature from the fantasy-friendly director Guillermo del Toro.Other high-profile selections include \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d starring Matt Damon and directed by George Clooney from a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen; the period picture \u201cVictoria and Abdul,\u201d starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria of England and directed by Stephen Frears; Paul Schrader\u2019s \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d with Ethan Hawke as an angst-filled priest; \u201cLoving Pablo,\u201d with Javier Bardem as Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug lord; the John Woo action film \u201cManhunt\u201d; and Martin McDonagh\u2019s salty Southern drama \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d starring Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson.Two films pair screen stars of a certain age: \u201cLeisure Seeker\u201d stars Donald Sutherland and Helen Mirren as an aging couple who hit the road while dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s, and \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d follows widowed neighbors played by Jane Fonda and Robert Redford (who will receive Golden Lions for lifetime achievement).These titles speak to Venice\u2019s appeal for mainstream films seeking a classy international debut and an early platform well in advance of their theatrical premieres in the United States. But the festival has also traditionally been home to its share of adventurous art-house fare. In that regard, Mr. Barbera, who heads what is billed as the world\u2019s oldest film festival, believes the landscape of contemporary cinema has definitively changed.\u201cFifteen or 20 years ago, there was a kind of auteur cinema you could expect to find in every festival,\u201d Mr. Barbera said in an interview from the festival\u2019s headquarters on the Lido in Venice. \u201cNow it\u2019s much more difficult for filmmakers to express themselves the same way and to finance the films.\u201dDespite Mr. Barbera\u2019s observations, this year\u2019s festival will offer premieres of films from an array of independent voices at various points in their careers. These include the new films by Japan\u2019s Hirokazu Kore-Eda, \u201cThe Third Murder\u201d; Israel\u2019s Samuel Maoz, \u201cFoxtrot\u201d; Takeshi Kitano, \u201cOutrage Coda\u201d; also the festival\u2019s closing film; \u201cThe Insult,\u201d from the Lebanese-born director Ziad Doueiri; and \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d from Andrew Haigh, the director of \u201c45 Years.\u201dBut two titles will probably top the watch list of the festival\u2019s cinephiles: Lucrecia Martel\u2019s colonial drama \u201cZama,\u201d her first in nearly a decade, screening out of competition; and \u201cMektoub, My Love: Canto Uno,\u201d from Abdellatif Kechiche, the outspoken director of \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color.\u201dThe premiere of \u201cMektoub\u201d will occur after months of reports concerning Mr. Kechiche\u2019s dispute with a financier, which was followed by his attempt to auction off the Palme d\u2019Or award he received at Cannes for \u201cBlue.\u201d Reached by email, Mr. Kechiche struck an optimist\u2019s tone.\u201cIn my films, I have always tried to achieve a certain faithfulness, a fidelity to how things are when they happen, and that still holds true for me. But in \u2018Mektoub, My Love\u2019 especially, I think the audience will also recognize an honest search for new talent. My protagonists, all of them first-time actors on the big screen, are wonderful,\u201d wrote Mr. Kechiche, who won a Golden Lion in 2007 for \u201cThe Secret of the Grain.\u201dEven as \u201cZama\u201d and \u201cMektoub\u201d attract critical attention, one of this year\u2019s most controversial films lurks in the festival\u2019s Horizons section. \u201cCaniba,\u201d directed by the nonfiction pioneers Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel (\u201cLeviathan\u201d), centers on Issei Sagawa, an aging Japanese cannibal. Jailed but ultimately released after eating a woman in France, Mr. Sagawa has made a living from his life story. \u201cCaniba\u201d promises an eyebrow-raising, intimate look at the man and his caretaker brother.\u201cI wanted to push collaboration further than filmmakers usually do with their subjects, and I knew he was interested in dying by being eaten by someone he desired,\u201d Ms. Paravel wrote of Issei Sagawa in an email. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure that he would want me to eat him, or that I would be able to. But I felt I at least partly understood his desire.\u201dOther nonfiction films in Venice may pale beside the mysteries of \u201cCaniba,\u201d but even sans cannibalism, the rest of the documentary lineup is robust.Frederick Wiseman examines a literary and social institution in \u201cEx Libris: The New York Public Library.\u201d Errol Morris rolls out his hybrid Netflix series \u201cWormwood,\u201d about the unexplained death of a Cold War military scientist. William Friedkin, the director of \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d confronts actual ghost-busting in \u201cThe Devil and Father Amorth.\u201d The Chinese art star Ai Weiwei surveys world immigration in \u201cHuman Flow,\u201d while Stephen Nomura Schible portrays a leading contemporary composer in \u201cRyuichi Sakamoto: Coda.\u201d The comedy trickster Andy Kaufman gets his close-up in Chris Smith\u2019s new documentary, with the help of Jim Carrey. And the Bronx\u2019s own Abel Ferrara takes a look at today\u2019s Rome in \u201cPiazza Vittorio.\u201dThis year, in addition to cultivating a larger-than-life documentary slate, Mr. Barbera is taking the plunge with the virtual reality trend that has swept across the festival world. Venice\u2019s twist is a competition devoted to virtual reality, subjecting an infant medium to the same scrutiny as film, with the help of a jury led by the director John Landis.\u201cThis is a bet,\u201d Mr. Barbera said. \u201cThe last two years, everybody talked about V.R. There were V.R. installations in Cannes, Venice, Sundance, Tribeca. So we thought that it was the right moment. There are big investments from the film industry in researching and implementing the technology, and at the same time curiosity from the filmmakers and a willingness to experiment.\u201dThe V.R. competition includes work by Laurie Anderson and Tsai Mingliang, and at 22 titles, outnumbers even the film competition. Other nontraditional cinematic offerings this year include Mr. Landis\u2019s own 3-D version of his \u201cThriller\u201d video. And just a vaporetto ride away is Venice\u2019s ongoing art Biennale, featuring film-related work: Candice Breitz\u2019s film installation about refugees starring Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore, and a video piece by the Turner Prize winner Douglas Gordon.All of which brings new meaning to the notion of a festival competition: a competition for attention. By opening with \u201cDownsizing\u201d and featuring a potent mix of anticipated titles and conversation-starting nonfiction, this year\u2019s film festival is poised to continue attracting the notice of film fans beyond those populating its cinemas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Countering West Coast Pull, by Helping Finance Start-Ups Sell in New York", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jeff Bezos, then a New York hedge fund employee, decided to start Amazon in 1994, he quickly moved to the West Coast. So did Mark Zuckerberg, who moved from Harvard to California in 2004 to find the technology talent and financing needed to build up Facebook.Today, the West Coast exerts a similar tidal pull for start-up companies in finance. Nine of the 15 United States financial technology \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 companies worth $1 billion or more, as tracked by CB Insights \u2014 are in the San Francisco area. These Bay Area companies, which are not public, include the online payments processor Stripe, the online lender Social Finance and the finance website Credit Karma.For the last seven years, a New York business-backed program \u2014 the FinTech Innovation Lab \u2014 has been working to stem that West Coast tide by helping financial services start-ups sell their services in New York in an industry where the city clearly dominates: big banks and other finance companies.The program\u2019s backers include Henry Kravis, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Fred Wilson, a co-founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures; and James D. Robinson III, a former chief executive of American Express.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason New York should not be the fintech capital of the world,\u201d said another program backer, the internet entrepreneur Kevin Ryan. He is a former chief executive of the online advertising pioneer DoubleClick and a founder of the flash-sale platform Gilt Groupe and the business news website Business Insider.The term \u201cfintech\u201d covers a group of start-ups, often funded by venture capital investors, that aim to apply new technology in areas like online lending, investing and payments. These start-ups have surged in popularity among investors as banks have had to focus on complying with regulations and rebuilding capital.The FinTech Innovation Lab is a so-called accelerator that annually gives a half-dozen start-ups the chance to interact with top financial firms, hone their products and learn how they can fit into what Accenture, a management consultant, estimated was a $270 billion technology budget for banks worldwide.Tim Estes, the president of Digital Reasoning in Nashville, which uses artificial intelligence to spot compliance and reputational risks for banks in routine employee emails, said that going through the lab program in 2012 was \u201ctransformative for the company, opening up doors across Wall Street as advertised.\u201dAs Digital Reasoning won business from Wall Street, it opened a New York office near Union Square, which now has about 30 employees and is the firm\u2019s second-largest office. Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse Group have become investors.Mr. Estes said Goldman was an early customer, two years after the investment bank\u2019s chief executive was attacked in televised congressional hearings over a subprime debt sale that one Goldman staff member had described in an email as a bad deal. As firms like Goldman realized other such \u201ctime bombs\u201d might be in their email files, \u201ceveryone wanted a better bomb detector,\u201d Mr. Estes said.Another start-up that won business through the lab, in 2012, was True Office, which turns compliance training into a game experience for employees. Adam Sodowick, the chief executive of True Office, had first met Maria Gotsch, a lab co-founder, at a dinner event at a Flatiron district loft. Morgan Stanley signed as a client and invested in True Office, which eventually moved its headquarters from Boston to New York and was acquired in 2014 by the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange resold it this year.The best-known firm to go through the program, in 2015, was the blockchain start-up Digital Asset, shortly after it recruited Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase derivatives pioneer, as its chief executive. Accenture soon invested in the company, which aims to improve Wall Street trade processing.The New York lab is one of hundreds of incubators and accelerators that have sprung up throughout the country to help start-ups, such as Y Combinator in Mountain View, Calif; Techstars in Boulder, Colo.; and Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, Calif. Though many programs require start-ups to give them an equity stake of 5 percent or more, the New York lab gets only 0.5 percent.The lab began in 2010 as a way to bolster the New York City economy after the 2008 financial crisis. It is co-sponsored by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City, an arm of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City \u2014 a business-backed civic group formed in 1979 by David Rockefeller.The lab is designed for companies that want to become partners with big financial institutions, rather than compete with them. One goal, said Mr. Robinson, an investor at RRE Ventures since 1994, is to \u201cexpose the big banks and insurers to early-stage companies doing interesting things in this area.\u201dJean Donnelly, the executive director of the Boston accelerator FinTech Sandbox, said, \u201cNew York has come up pretty quickly as No. 2\u201d behind Silicon Valley in fintech venture investments.Accenture says data from CB Insights indicates that Silicon Valley\u2019s lead in fintech debt and equity financing has narrowed. In 2012, the gap was 4.5 to 1, as valley fintechs raised $1 billion against $225 million for New York fintechs. In 2016, the gap was just 1.1 to 1, with $2.65 billion for Silicon Valley and $2.41 billion for New York.Some West Coast venture investors acknowledged the city\u2019s progress. The gap between Silicon Valley and New York has narrowed, said Pat Grady, a partner who focuses on fintech at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif.But he added: \u201cIf you want to build the next Apple or Airbnb, you come to Silicon Valley. The unmatched talent, risk-taking culture and relentless optimism mean that you have a better chance of outsized success here than anywhere else in the world.\u201dNew York can be fertile ground for \u201cbusiness to business\u201d start-ups selling to banks, Mr. Grady said. But some of the largest United States fintechs, like Social Finance and Credit Karma, cater directly to consumers and have potentially larger markets, he said.So how does the FinTech Innovation Lab work?Every year, the staff and a sponsor committee choose 20 to 25 start-ups from more than 100 applicants to meet with about 35 banks and other sponsoring institutions. The sponsors, in turn, collectively choose six to eight winners for the three-month program.Banks that once had to be \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d to participate in the lab are now waiting in line to check out the start-ups, said Matt Harris, a partner in Bain Capital Ventures. Lately, out-of-town banks like KeyBank in Cleveland and U.S. Bank in Minneapolis have joined.Companies selected to participate this year included Cutting Edge, Nova Credit and BehavioSec. Cutting Edge, a cybersecurity firm, helps protect customers\u2019 locations and identities on the internet. Nova Credit processes and provides credit data from foreign institutions on individuals so banks can lend more readily to immigrants. BehavioSec helps confirm customer identities by analyzing how they type, click and swipe on their devices.The lab featured 19 events over three months, including meetings with Mr. Kravis and James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Kravis stressed the importance of company culture, and Mr. Gorman fielded questions about Wall Street\u2019s use of artificial intelligence and how investment banks do business with start-ups. There was also a practice pitch session at the office of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.This year\u2019s lab culminated with a Demo Day on June 22 at a packed 215-seat auditorium at Bank of America\u2019s New York office. Each entrepreneur was introduced by a Wall Street mentor and then gave a brief pitch for his business.Mr. Robinson and other venture investors strolled a hall with exhibit tables for each start-up. David Reilly, a senior technology executive at Bank of America, said the program was useful because big banks \u201ccan be exceptionally difficult to sell to.\u201dStill, none of the three New York fintechs that raised the most financing in 2016 were alumni of the FinTech Innovation Lab, according to the Accenture data.In one of last year\u2019s largest New York financings, Oscar Health Insurance, the lone New York fintech unicorn on the CB Insights list, raised $400 million. Oscar was co-founded by Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and backed by the younger Mr. Kushner\u2019s Thrive Capital.Other New York fintechs that raised the most money in 2016 included the online student lender CommonBond, which raised $612.5 million, and Payoneer, a global payments platform, which raised $180 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Down the Breitbart Hole", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "FeatureSteve Bannon once said it was the platform for the alt-right. Its current editors disagree. Is the incendiary media company at the nerve center of Donald Trump\u2019s America simply provocative \u2014 or dangerous?Supported byAlex has been the editor of Breitbart for about four years. In 2008, he was the first employee hired by its founder Andrew Breitbart, and he began to lead the editorial staff when Breitbart died in 2012, although it would be another year and change before he claimed the title of editor in 2013. However you cut it, that puts Alex in charge of Breitbart long before last year\u2019s election, responsible for the daily decisions about what to cover and how. If right now you\u2019re thinking that it\u2019s kind of weird how you\u2019ve been reading about Breitbart more or less constantly for the past year, following the daily exploits of former employees like Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos, but this is the first time you\u2019ve ever heard of Alexander Marlow, that\u2019s by design. People close to Alex refer to him variously as \u2018\u2018a shut-in,\u2019\u2019 a \u2018\u2018misanthrope\u2019\u2019 and a \u2018\u2018hermit,\u2019\u2019 who communicates with his staff primarily by phone/text/email and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. In fact, if you have come across Alex before now, it was probably in mid-June, when some of the people on the business side of Breitbart persuaded him to appear on the HBO show \u2018\u2018Real Time With Bill Maher.\u2019\u2019Before we get into that debacle and the jeweler\u2019s-loupe clarity it gave to Breitbart\u2019s predicament, you should know that in the weeks leading up to the appearance, Alex was nervous for all the wrong reasons. It seemed as if every time we got together, the topic of the show would arise, with Alex saying something along the lines of how much he hoped it wouldn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t that he worried what Maher would ask him or how he should respond. Alex grew up in one of the crunchier enclaves of Los Angeles, went to school at Berkeley and lives today in Washington on the boundary between Dupont Circle and Georgetown, which is another way of saying that he has spent his whole life surrounded by liberals who can\u2019t figure out why he doesn\u2019t get it. More than most of us, he is accustomed to defending his job and his opinions to the postman, the neighbors and his wife\u2019s colleagues with a faint, forbearing smile and quickly changing the subject if the vibe starts going south.What troubled him about the Maher appearance had nothing to do with the interview per se. It was the fact that after trying for years to maintain a certain balance in his public life \u2014 broadcasting his thoughts on Breitbart\u2019s website and radio program but declining most invitations to appear on television and public stages \u2014 he was apprehensive about trading 15 minutes of face time on cable TV for the precious anonymity that allows him, for example, to shamble through his neighborhood every afternoon, walking his two dogs, without running into the rabble of protesters who have been known to picket Breitbart offices, or being spit upon by the 30-to-1 ratio of Democratic voters at the dog park.Also, at a more basic level, he was feeling self-conscious about his looks. Alex is maybe six feet tall, with a thick head of dark hair that he brushes in the slapdash manner of a kid giving in to his mother, and he speaks in a bracing, nasal timbre that recalls a Wayans brothers imitation of white people asking for directions. Entering his 30s, he is well aware that his physique is filling out, hovering on the gauzy line between sturdy and stocky. I remember in particular a dinner that we shared about three weeks before the show, when he confessed, as we shoveled handfuls of stewed Ethiopian vegetables into our faces, that he\u2019d been trying all week to stay off carbs and slim down for Maher.\u2018\u2018The thing is,\u2019\u2019 he said with a sigh, \u2018\u2018if I gain 10 pounds, seven of them go to my face.\u2019\u2019I mention this not to harp on a person\u2019s ordinary insecurities but to give you a sense of how little importance he gave to the substance of the coming show. Among the topics that preoccupied our conversation \u2014 the precipitous rise of Breitbart; its elusive place in the taxonomy of conservative thought; its asymmetric impact on the last election and the subsequent migration of its staff into the West Wing, with writers like Julia Hahn and Sebastian Gorka decamping for senior policy positions, even as the company itself achieved a kind of mythic boogeyman status on the left \u2014 I don\u2019t think either of us paused to consider that any of these things would be clarified in a few minutes of television.\u2018\u2018You do ignore stories, would you not agree to that?\u2019\u2019 Maher asks.\u2018\u2018On purpose,\u2019\u2019 Alex replies.\u2018\u2018Do you agree that Russia did meddle and try to fix this election?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Russia absolutely was trying to interfere,\u2019\u2019 Alex says.\u2018\u2018You don\u2019t have to share your bona fides with me,\u2019\u2019 Alex says.\u2018\u2018But your followers threatened my family, my children, my wife,\u2019\u2019 Nance says. \u2018\u2018You can apologize to me now.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Show me the story,\u2019\u2019 Alex says. \u2018\u2018If the story is as you describe it, I\u2019ll be happy to offer an apology.\u2019\u2019For a moment, then, on the third weekend of June, it was possible to behold in a single television incident both the fracturing of the American public sphere into discrete fields of reality and their temporary reconvergence around the unlikeliest of propositions. Whether you trusted Daily Kos or The Daily Caller, whatever you thought about Russian hacking, however you placed yourself in relation to the dueling Manichaean orthodoxies of contemporary politics, for a few minutes everybody seemed to agree that just six months after tipping a presidential election, Breitbart was in retreat.Shortly after the election, my friends at The Times told me there was an internal debate over what to call Breitbart. Somehow, the words \u2018\u2018news organization\u2019\u2019 seemed too generous, and anyway, didn\u2019t encompass the weird power it had amassed \u2014 this company that began as a smattering of websites about Hollywood, government and the media, then morphed into a sprawling multimedia conglomerate with offices overseas, including an eight-person bureau in London and a daily radio program on Sirius XM, all financed by shadowy right-wing figures and buttressed by a mob of fervent readers whose engagement in the comment section, for example, dwarfs the comments at this newspaper by roughly a factor of 10, even as those readers/commenters/trolls remain, to most of the outside world, a mysterious horde of indistinct origin and uncertain intent.This leads to a curious phenomenon as the Trump presidency proceeds and we begin to see long articles about Breitbart by writers who are clearly more familiar with the conventional wisdom about the website than with anyone on its staff. Writing about Breitbart has become one of the few instances in American journalism where it\u2019s considered passable to publish a major feature speculating on the internal machinery of a company without naming a single source inside. A recent cover of Newsweek showed Alex hoisting Donald Trump on his shoulders, without any discussion of who Alex is, how he rose to power at Breitbart or what he believes.I\u2019m reminded of an incident earlier this year, when an article in Business Insider reported that the staff of Breitbart had been ordered not to write critically about Jared Kushner anymore. The article explained this in the context of byzantine palace intrigue: Bannon, after butting heads with Kushner, was rumored to be planting negative articles about him in Breitbart, but Kushner\u2019s allies caught on and complained to Trump, who ordered Bannon to stop the fighting. All of which made for delicious gossip but didn\u2019t appear true. In the days leading up to that article, I sat in for maybe a dozen editorial calls with Alex and his staff, who don\u2019t have a physical newsroom in Washington but gather twice a day by phone. Throughout that time, Alex repeatedly asked for more dirt on Kushner, whom he considered a \u2018\u2018Wall Street Democrat.\u2019\u2019 Just that morning, I heard him instruct a staff member to call the White House every day and try to get Kushner on the phone. When the Business Insider article appeared a few hours later, Alex was livid, not because it was true \u2014 Alex vigorously denied it \u2014 but because, true or false, it shaded any story he wanted to publish. He had already heard from his senior White House correspondent, Charlie Spiering, who was working on a profile of Kushner and wanted to know if there was anything to this claim that he was supposed to back off.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s what happens,\u2019\u2019 Alex said as we shuffled along a shady trail near his apartment that evening. \u2018\u2018I told him not to let them get in his head \u2014 just write the piece.\u2019\u2019 But when I met up with Spiering a few days later, he had decided to kill the story anyway. \u2018\u2018No matter what I write, people will read it as a response to that article,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it\u2019s tough on Kushner, I\u2019m Steve\u2019s attack dog. If it\u2019s not, I backed off for Steve.\u2019\u2019 It seemed as if Breitbart was descending into a Droste effect. A story about the writing of a story came as news to the story\u2019s writer and caused the writer to stop writing the story in an effort to rewrite the story about the story.\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t set out to study Breitbart,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Breitbart came from the data, not the other way around.\u2019\u2019The project, Benkler said, began with a friendly argument about how the internet works \u2014 whether it serves mainly as a distribution network for the articles on major media, or if small blogs and websites can funnel their own stories back into the mainstream press. \u2018\u2018I had taken the position that it created significant democratization and open pathways for diverse voices to speak,\u2019\u2019 Benkler said. His friend and colleague at M.I.T. Ethan Zuckerman disagreed. \u2018\u2018Ethan thought you saw more amplification and circulation of stories from the mainstream.\u2019\u2019But last spring, as Donald Trump was hurtling toward the Republican nomination in defiance of every analyst everywhere, Benkler got a call from the Open Society Foundations. This being an article about right-wing media, let\u2019s insert the disclaimer that O.S.F. was created by George Soros, the billionaire activist who haunts the fevered imagination of the right in about the same way the Koch brothers terrify the left. At the time, nearly everyone assumed that Clinton would win the election, but people at O.S.F. were still intrigued by the rise of Trump. \u2018\u2018They said: \u2018Something different is happening,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Benkler recalled. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018We need to understand what.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Benkler made some tweaks and pointed his machine at the election. The list of websites it scooped up each day was dizzying. \u2018\u2018We begin with several thousand sources,\u2019\u2019 Benkler said, \u2018\u2018and then we look at links in all those stories, and we crawl out to grab them. If they fit the keywords that we\u2019re looking for \u2014 any candidate name, anything around the election \u2014 we put them in the data set. Then we go to the links in those stories, and draw in those, and go to their links. Usually by the time we\u2019ve done this 15 times, there are no new stories.\u2019\u2019At the same time, Benkler\u2019s team developed a method to determine the political association of any website\u2019s audience. If an article was posted by people who retweeted Hillary Clinton, they characterized the publication as one with a liberal readership. If an article was posted by Trump retweeters, they assumed the publication\u2019s readership was conservative. I can hear you thinking, \u2018\u2018Retweets do not equal endorsements,\u2019\u2019 but it turns out they mostly do. But when they encountered articles linked to by supporters of both candidates, they looked to see which side linked more often, then characterized the audience as center-left or center-right.Looking at the blue parts of the image, nothing was surprising: The largest circles were CNN and The New York Times, each shaded pale blue to indicate a center-left association. But the other side of the image showed just one big red circle: Breitbart. It was three times the size of Fox News and maybe a dozen times larger than any other news source on the right. If you wanted to know who was driving the Republican agenda in 2016, you didn\u2019t need to look much farther than the massive crimson orb parked on Benkler\u2019s screen.Benkler sighed. If the Trayvon Martin study challenged his theory about the democratizing power of the internet, the Breitbart study offered an unsettling confirmation. \u2018\u2018An important part of what happened in this election is that a marginalized community, with views that were generally excluded, forced their way into the mainstream,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Now, whether that\u2019s \u2018democratizing\u2019 or not depends on how much emphasis you put on people being able to contest an election versus how much you put on civil rights, protection of minorities, rule of law. You could say that if it translates into denigration of minorities, it\u2019s antidemocratic. But as long as you are focused on the question of \u2018Do you have an intensely engaged minority able to clarify its message so clearly that it can contest politically in a way that it couldn\u2019t before?\u2019 then it\u2019s a democratizing effect.\u2019\u2019Unlike pretty much all of the above, Alex never adopted a swaggering Rush Limbaugh bravado. He never even thought of himself as a Republican. Even today, his basic menu of ideas is fairly conventional fare. He thinks the federal government is clumsy and wasteful, that rich people get too many breaks, that mucking around in other countries is risky, that anybody entering the United States should pass through customs and that nobody should be defined by his or her gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. He is fond of pointing out a conflict between the traditional American ideal of a \u2018\u2018melting pot,\u2019\u2019 in which individual differences blend into a common culture, and the more recent understanding of multiculturalism, which tends to celebrate differences. Other than that, it\u2019s difficult to know where he\u2019ll land on many issues. He often declines to land at all. On several occasions, when I mentioned something in the news, he responded: \u2018\u2018I haven\u2019t made up my mind.\u2019\u2019 And I lost track of how many times he told me: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not an opinion guy.\u2019\u2019 A few months ago, when the Trump administration announced that it was scaling back plans on the border from a \u2018\u2018big, beautiful wall\u2019\u2019 to something that looked more like a chain-link fence, he sparked the wrath of two staff members by announcing on an editorial conference call that it looked O.K. to him.\u2018\u2018In there?\u2019\u2019 I asked, looking at the building.\u2018\u2018Out here,\u2019\u2019 he said.Later that evening, Kassam and I traveled to a neighborhood of East London known as Tower Hamlets for dinner, where we encountered graffiti celebrating the Taliban and were harassed by young men who took offense at the sight of Kassam. Most of the locals on the street were dressed in traditional garb, with maybe half the women cloaked in niqabs and hijabs, whereas Kassam was wearing a blue blazer whose inner lining was patterned on the American flag. All day, the lapels had been flapping open to reveal the stars and stripes, but in Tower Hamlets he buttoned his blazer and kept his head down. \u2018\u2018Do you know what Islam says about apostates?\u2019\u2019 he asked quietly. \u2018\u2018The penalty for leaving the religion is death.\u2019\u2019I\u2019m aware that what Breitbart is doing when it publishes a writer like Kassam is to co-opt the principle of representation and use his identity as a shield to promote inflammatory ideas. Kassam was hired by Steve Bannon, whose own fixation on Islamic extremism takes a far more apocalyptic context and tone. But I still think it\u2019s worth holding in mind that when writers like Kassam or Hudson decide to write about the community they come from, they expect a certain prerogative to speak their minds without being labeled, as they so often are, traitors to their race.I won\u2019t delve into all the twists and turns in this theory, but the underlying contention is that a few refugee intellectuals from the Frankfurt School \u2014 Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, Herbert Marcuse \u2014 were lucky enough to escape the Nazis for sunny California, and being constitutionally incapable of happiness, promptly began complaining. Their grousing and moaning and general sourpuss disposition soon filtered into academia, Hollywood and the media, then into the upper echelons of American snobbery, a.k.a. the Democratic Party. So today you have, per Breitbart, a \u2018\u2018Democrat-Media Complex\u2019\u2019 whose principal aim is to disparage everything quintessentially American, by which he really means Americana \u2014 think Norman Rockwell archetypes and whatever social conventions they imply. This is extraordinarily reactionary stuff, but not especially political in the sense of electioneering. Andrew Breitbart was never as interested in backing candidates as he was in attacking the media and entertainment industries for corroding American traditions. When people asked Breitbart why he wasn\u2019t more involved in electoral politics, he liked to say that if you could reorient news and entertainment, the rest would follow. \u2018\u2018Politics,\u2019\u2019 he often said, \u2018\u2018is downstream from culture.\u2019\u2019Solov is about as media-shy a personality as exists in American life, and despite my most plaintive efforts, he opted not to speak to me for this article. But I heard that many of the editorial staff were skeptical of his decision to hire Bannon, who had never been formally involved with the websites and was known for his explosive outbursts about politics. When staff members expressed concern to Solov, he reassured them that Bannon\u2019s role would be limited to fund-raising and public relations.For a few months, this proved true, but soon Bannon began to dial in to editorial conference calls; he began to interject suggestions, and then to make demands. At the same time, Alex was becoming increasingly central to the daily work flow. Unlike Pollak and Shapiro, he wasn\u2019t particularly fast or facile as a writer, but he was widely regarded as the best on staff at selecting which stories would resonate with readers, and he had a knack for punchy, half-comic headlines. Many of the other editors and writers believed he was already functioning as the editor. In the summer of 2013, Alex approached Solov and Bannon to ask for the top job. At a meeting in Los Angeles, where he made the case in person, he told me Bannon \u2018\u2018had this little smile, like he wasn\u2019t sure he would go for it, but he liked that I was asking.\u2019\u2019 Alex got the job.Although staff members believed Bannon wouldn\u2019t have a role in website content, he continued to parachute into editorial decisions any time he wanted. Alex describes Bannon\u2019s approach as \u2018\u2018theatrical,\u2019\u2019 but other people are more blunt. When Bannon wanted a story assigned or changed, they say, he would call Alex and commence screaming. Alex occasionally pushed back, but far more often he deferred. The stories that Bannon pushed were some of the most ideologically driven. Under his leadership, the site\u2019s coverage of immigration focused not just on trade and jobs but on panicky stories about the coming of American Shariah. So you could say that Bannon influenced only a handful of stories each week, but it\u2019s probably more accurate to say that he guided every editorial decision that mattered.After Breitbart\u2019s death, Bannon began to steer the site in a more nakedly political direction. If politics was downstream from culture, Bannon was downstream from Breitbart. He began to use the company as a tool for political action, coordinating with the site\u2019s activist investors Robert and Rebekah Mercer and using the website to support candidates and partisan causes. At the root of this lay the agenda described in Mead\u2019s book: American workers were under siege by clueless elitists whose embrace of open borders, trade agreements and environmental zealotry was destroying the working class.The last thing Yochai Benkler noted before I left his office at Harvard was that his team had performed a textual analysis of all the stories in their database, and they found a surprising result. \u2018\u2018One thing that came out very clearly from our study is that Breitbart is not talking about these issues in the same way you would find on the extreme right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t use the same language you find on sites like VDARE and The Daily Stormer\u2019\u2019 \u2014 two sites connected to the white-nationalist alt-right movement. He paused for a moment, then added: \u2018\u2018Breitbart is not the alt-right.\u2019\u2019 Yet precisely because articles on the site were often less extreme than their own worst headlines, Breitbart functioned as a legitimizing tether for the most abhorrent currents of the right wing. Benkler referred to this as a \u2018\u2018bridge\u2019\u2019 phenomenon, in which extremist websites linked to Breitbart for validation and those same fanatics could then gather in Breitbart\u2019s comment section to hurl invectives.Shapiro\u2019s story suggests a more complicated view of Breitbart\u2019s relationship to the extreme right: not an exponent of all the most incendiary rhetoric but its willing conduit. Under Bannon, the site seemed content to welcome its alt-right base. This is what Bannon meant when he described the site as a \u2018\u2018platform for the alt-right,\u2019\u2019 and what Yiannopoulos was doing in March 2016 when he published \u2018\u2018An Establishment Conservative\u2019s Guide to the Alt-Right.\u2019\u2019 Maybe the difference between these things is slight \u2014 between espousing hatred and indulging it \u2014 but how you parse that distinction will shape the way you interpret what Alex is doing now.How much of this comes at Bannon\u2019s direction is hard to say. Bannon received an ethics waiver that allows him to remain in contact with Breitbart staff, and it would seem pretty obvious that some conspiring must go on. No writer on earth would allow a colleague to decamp for a job in the White House without pestering the daylights out of him for leads and scoops; what\u2019s harder to explain is why so few of those leads and scoops turn up on Breitbart. When a White House leak does surface on the right, it\u2019s far more likely to appear in a competitor, like Shapiro\u2019s The Daily Wire or the blog of Mike Cernovich. Shapiro told me that he doesn\u2019t think Bannon gives much to Breitbart at all. \u2018\u2018The way Steve plays the game, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If he\u2019s going after Jared Kushner, he\u2019s not going to do that through Breitbart, because it\u2019s too obvious.\u2019\u2019 Charlie Spiering has yet to land an interview with the president, and in early June, Alex traveled to Sicily for the G-7 meeting, hoping to interview Trump himself \u2014 but Trump declined to see him. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s starting to become a pattern,\u2019\u2019 Alex told me recently. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re keeping us out of reach.\u2019\u2019We were sitting at a Mexican restaurant sipping mezcal, and I asked whether he felt he was trying to make Breitbart legitimate. At first, he scowled, but then he nodded. \u2018\u2018Are we trying to become a legitimate news site?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Yes. The question is why. I don\u2019t think we have a choice. We are so high-profile now, we get so much scrutiny, we have no choice but to get it right. That\u2019s something that has changed over the past year. People read our stuff and pay attention. We don\u2019t need to be outraged and hysterical anymore. We don\u2019t need to wave our arms around, flailing madly because we don\u2019t feel like we are being listened to.\u2019\u2019I mentioned that I didn\u2019t really believe he would hire another Milo Yiannopoulos.\u2018\u2018You may be right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It was getting to a point where Milo was limiting Breitbart, and Breit\u00adbart was limiting Milo. Our stories should look like they could appear in any other publication. The bias now comes in story selection. We\u2019re not going to cover the Russia scandal as much as we\u2019re covering the cartels coming over the border.\u2019\u2019The problems with trying to legitimize Breit\u00adbart are, of course, abundant. One is that conventional news organizations are themselves in a fight for economic survival; another is that the whole concept of news is in the midst of a revision. Most reporters these days think of objectivity as a laudable but abstract goal. Trying to verify facts and elide opinion may push a writer to higher standards, but the overall thrust of journalism these days has been a move away from the construct of objectivity, not toward it.In moments like this, it was possible to feel sympathy for a man in his predicament. He confided to me on another night that like so many people he has tried to hire, he knows that working for Breitbart will occlude his future. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have a lot of security,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I think I\u2019m the best person to be editor of Breitbart, but what does that mean to the rest of the job market? I don\u2019t have a lot of outs.\u2019\u2019 I sometimes had the sense of him as a figure trapped in a myth \u2014 a man adrift on a rudderless ship, reeling from the tempest of Trump\u2019s election, surrounded by the deck fires of incendiary staff members and trying to pull down the pirate flag in order to steer a new course, past the sirens of click-bait outrage, between the Scylla and Charybdis of Bannon and Breitbart, and he could feel the sea of global resentments beneath him, tossing him this way and that, a riotous current that he partly understood and partly rued but mostly just wanted to leave behind.An article on Aug. 20 about Breitbart News misstated the religious affiliation of a British anti-extremist activist named Maajid Nawaz.

{"Headline": "Public Works Funding Falls as Infrastructure Deteriorates", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s basically the opposite of a major government infrastructure program.Government spending on transportation and other public works is in decline as federal funding stagnates and state and local governments tighten their belts.In West Virginia, where President Trump on Thursday touted a vague $1 trillion infrastructure plan, public works spending has fallen for five straight years.Nate Orders, who runs a construction company founded by his grandfather to build bridges for the state, said he had been forced to scramble for other kinds of business. Only three of the 15 projects on his current slate are bridges in West Virginia.\u201cMy grandfather would not recognize the business we have today,\u201d he said.What\u2019s worse, he said, is that he recently hit a highway pothole and had to replace a wheel. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate, I suppose, that we don\u2019t have a growing population, so we don\u2019t have a lot of congestion issues,\u201d Mr. Orders said. \u201cOur problem is safety.\u201dThe deterioration of the nation\u2019s infrastructure has raised widespread concerns about safety, quality of life and the impact on economic growth. Politicians in both parties have declared the issue a priority. So far, there is no sign of a solution.\u201cIt\u2019s always easier to defer new construction than to stop paying people who are on the payroll or the welfare rolls,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of states are under real stress.\u201dGovernments have cut back most sharply on new construction projects. Even so, the nation\u2019s existing infrastructure continues to age and deteriorate.Arizona has reduced spending on public construction every year since 2007. State lawmakers, reluctant to raise taxes, have diverted money from highway work to pay for public services like Medicaid and prisons. One Arizona county, Navajo, has shifted from aiming to repave roads every 20 years to repaving every 40 years.Roads are the largest category of public works, accounting for about a third of annual public works spending. The federal gas tax, at 18.4 cents a gallon, is the largest source of funding for those projects, but it is not indexed to inflation and has not been raised since 1993. It would need to be 31 cents a gallon to restore its buying power.Chris Spear, the president of the American Trucking Associations, said his group had testified before Congress at least 19 times since 2006 in favor of raising the tax.But the price of gasoline has outsize importance in the American psyche, and Congress has demonstrated an extreme reluctance to consider a gas tax increase.California in April also passed its first gas tax increase in more than two decades.And last month, West Virginia passed a package of higher taxes, including an increase in its gas tax, estimated to lift road funding by $140 million a year.The Trump administration says it is still working on an infrastructure plan that would supplement the increases in state funding. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposed just $200 billion in new infrastructure spending, plus unspecified incentives for private investment that it hopes will add another $800 billion over 10 years. But he also proposed larger cuts in projected public works funding.However the details end up, Mr. Trump\u2019s sagging popularity and his souring relationship with Republicans in Congress have jeopardized his ability to win their support.Senate Democrats in January unveiled their own $1 trillion infrastructure plan, which calls for the federal government to provide all of the funding.Another challenge is that workers are getting harder to find. Jobs in highway construction in July were 2.6 percent below the prerecession level. With fewer people working in road-building \u2014 and when almost everyone who wants a job has one \u2014 the industry can\u2019t simply restock from the pool of unemployed workers. Skilled workers, in particular, are in short supply.Total construction spending has climbed above the prerecession peak thanks to stronger activity in the private sector, particularly in commercial construction.Tom Brown, the president of Sierra Pacific West, a construction company based in Vista, Calif., said that the company had seen a significant decline in state road work, but that it had managed to keep busy with building construction and military contracts.Public construction spending in California last year was down 27 percent from 2007.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to make it all up,\u201d Mr. Brown said, referring to the decline in road construction projects, \u201cbut we have gotten a lot more diversified lately.\u201dMr. Brown said he sympathized with people who didn\u2019t want their taxes to rise.\u201cIt\u2019s hard pill to swallow,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay more money, either. On the other hand, it\u2019s the lifeblood of what supports this firm. And I want the trash to get picked up and the sewage to go down the drain, and I want the roads to drive on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Brexit Britain Can Reset the Immigration Debate", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The Labour Party is surging in British polls. That\u2019s after a June general election in which it unexpectedly won a remarkable 40 percent of the vote under the leadership of the much-derided Jeremy Corbyn. Young and previously disengaged voters were galvanized by a left-wing policy platform that pledged to deal with the wealth inequalities and economic hardships that affect so many people today.The challenge for the Labour Party is to devise a policy that honors Brexit voters\u2019 decision but doesn\u2019t dishonor its own values. That\u2019s an especially tough circle to square when it comes to immigration. During the recent general election campaign, Labour conceded that the right to free movement within the European Union for member-state citizens would end post-Brexit. But the party leadership also championed migrants\u2019 vital contributions to Britain, while promising to scrap the \u201cbogus immigration targets\u201d that have been set by the Conservative government and to guarantee the rights of European Union citizens living in Britain.This balancing act seemed to work for Labour\u2019s alliance of Leave and Remain voters, consolidating support. But it involves delicate positioning.Some sections of the party are still urging Mr. Corbyn to harden his stance on the issue to appease the party\u2019s traditional working-class base \u2014 which, according to this analysis, is never as ethnically diverse as, in actual fact, it is. Nevertheless, Labour will need to show how removing from millions of people the right to move and work freely across the European Union is a progressive policy.This is not impossible. Arguably, free movement of labor has made migration harder for those outside the European Union, whereas a Labour Brexit policy could equalize the criteria for all. But this approach might go awry if the European Union makes preferential trade access for Britain contingent on preferential treatment of migrants from within the union. Plus, of course, Labour would still have to sell the policy to a public that wants more immigration controls. So we\u2019re back to where we started.The solution for Labour must be to be as bold in its desire to shift the migration narrative as it has been to move the national debate on economic issues. If the party is riding a progressive wave, there is an opportunity to bring more of the public on board \u2014 including people worried about immigration.With policies like the nationalization of rail and energy companies, a higher minimum wage and higher taxes on the top 5 percent of earners, the Labour Party succeeded in recapturing some voters who had been won over by the pro-Brexit, anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party. Thousands of Labour campaigners, enthused by the Corbyn leadership, engaged in doorstep discussions that destigmatized migrants by shifting blame for people\u2019s hardships onto a more deserving target: the government.Of course, racism is an animating force of its own. Bigotry is not tied to economic fortunes, and some will always resent hearing languages other than English spoken on their street. But those who hold such sentiments are a minority and not likely to support progressive parties, in any case. So it makes no sense for Labour to formulate its strategy with this cohort in mind.Most crucial in a hostile climate, the party\u2019s language should stick with its manifesto promise that Labour \u201cwill not scapegoat migrants nor blame them for economic failures\u201d \u2014 and sound less like Mr. Corbyn\u2019s recent comments about foreign workers. Even optimistic experts agree that on the issue of immigration, long-incubated antipathies take time to change. But if it is possible to shift the mood on this, it is surely within the power of Labour\u2019s current leadership, with its populist left-wing platform and an army of enthusiastic, progressive and campaign-ready supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Deadline Forces American Aid Workers to Leave North Korea", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A group of American and Canadian humanitarian workers who were traveling in North Korea recently had to make a tough decision: leave the country immediately and hope to return to their lifesaving work in the future, or stay in the North and face possible problems trying to go home later.Every six months, Mr. Linton leads a delegation of about 12 volunteer health care specialists, half of them American, on a three-week trip to North Korea. During the visits, which take place in May and November, they examine new patients and discharge from care those who have completed an 18-month treatment program. The treatment must follow a strict schedule to be effective, hence the delegation\u2019s fixed schedule for trips.Now, Mr. Linton is fretting over whether his team can visit in November.It is unknown how many Americans are still in the North in ignorance or defiance of the ban. Also unclear is how effectively the United States will enforce it. \u201cU.S. citizens are not required to register their presence with the U.S. government,\u201d said William Cocks, a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs.North Korea has called the ban \u201cchildish\u201d and has said it will keep its doors \u201cwide open to any U.S. citizen who would like to visit our country out of good will.\u201dMr. Kim, the DoDaum founder, said a 15-member delegation from his group had been cleared by the North Korean authorities to visit in mid-September to deliver H.I.V. medication and help treat patients, but the trip had to be canceled. Mr. Kim is a Canadian citizen, but key members of the delegation are Americans affected by the ban.The university, a private one that is financed by evangelical Christians, has relied on dozens of volunteer teachers, mostly Korean-Americans. Now, it must find non-American replacements if no exemptions are offered.\u201dI think this travel ban is being seen by North Korean officials as an explicitly inflammatory measure,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cWhen we informed them of the need to pull out, there was a sense of understanding but at the same time, there was a sense of disappointment on both sides really.\u201dThe ban, by squeezing the flow of tourist cash, also helps international efforts to undermine North Korea\u2019s ability to finance its nuclear and missile programs.But critics of the ban say it will further restrict people-to-people interactions between the United States and North Korea. Among the hardest hit will be Korean-Americans who have been visiting to trace their family roots or for reunions with long-lost relatives.\u201cRestricting humanitarian access puts lives in immediate jeopardy and increases the likelihood of humanitarian disaster,\u201d said Daniel Jasper, advocacy coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization that has provided humanitarian relief in North Korea for decades. \u201cOur long history in the region leads us to believe that the travel restrictions will greatly reduce the likelihood for peaceful relations on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dAmerican humanitarian workers said that the travel ban endangered the trust with the North Koreans that they had spent years building. To the North Korean authorities, who are hard-wired to consider Washington a mortal enemy, the fact that these American workers volunteered to visit despite their government\u2019s warnings had been part of their credibility.\u201cGetting permission from the government to go puts an X mark on your back because the North Koreans will never believe that you are there just for humanitarian purposes if the government gave you permission to go,\u201d Mr. Linton said. \u201cIn fact, this travel ban, the way it\u2019s set up, puts N.G.O.s in much greater danger by requiring official government permission to travel to North Korea.\u201cThere is no one I know in North Korea who would believe that there isn\u2019t some connection between the N.G.O. and the government that made that permission possible,\u201d he added.For Mr. Linton, helping Koreans has been a family mission for more than a century.His grandfather\u2019s father-in-law, Eugene Bell, arrived in Korea in 1895 as an American missionary to engage in medical and evangelical activities. Mr. Linton\u2019s grandfather, William Linton, also a missionary, served in Korea for half a century. In 1995, Mr. Linton established the Eugene Bell Foundation to help tuberculosis patients in North Korea.The members of Mr. Linton\u2019s North Korean mission show that same dedication, including an 83-year-old Catholic priest who has been visiting the North despite a heart condition.They are determined to return, even if that means signing a waiver forsaking their right to consular service \u2014 a move they hope will make it easier for them to receive permission from the United States government to travel to the North.\u201cWe are not going to hold the U.S. government responsible for trying to get us out if we get into trouble,\u201d Mr. Linton said. \u201cWe are doing this as mature adults who have made a decision that this program is worth the risks involved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France, Facing Criticism, Promises the Bare Essentials for Migrants", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 After banking on neglect, hostility and mistreatment to discourage a steady trickle of migrants, the new French government was ordered by France\u2019s highest administrative body to do better this week and at least provide water and toilets to the people.That order has defused, for now, a new migrant crisis brewing at the northern port of Calais, the favored would-be jumping off point for Britain. Yet a permanent solution to France\u2019s slow-boiling migrant problem still appears to be distant.That has not stopped the French authorities from trying. In recent days, President Emmanuel Macron proposed opening European-run reception centers in Africa \u2014 perhaps in Niger, Chad or even Libya \u2014 to discourage migrants from risking the journey across the Mediterranean Sea.Critics quickly pointed out the fierce determination of Africans to make the journey, regardless of counsel to the contrary, and the huge numbers intent on doing so.Up to one million migrants are in refugee camps in Libya alone, as Mr. Macron pointed out in a speech in which he highlighted his own recent peacemaking initiative for Libya. He also called for broader European involvement in African development as a long-term solution to the migrant crisis.The migrants have made thousands of attempts to enter the tunnel and board trucks bound for England since the beginning of the year, the police say.The French migrant numbers are small compared with the thousands pouring into Italy. There, about 95,000 migrants have arrived from across the Mediterranean this year.But that lower court order was upheld Monday by the Council of State, which criticized Mr. Macron\u2019s government for \u201cinhuman and degrading\u201d treatment of the newest migrants at Calais, in northern France.On Monday, the council blasted the government\u2019s \u201cmanifestly insufficient\u201d accounting for \u201cthe elementary hygiene and water needs\u201d of the migrants at Calais by compromising \u201cin a serious and obviously illegal way, a fundamental right.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, immediately promised water, showers and toilets for the migrants at Calais, as well as two new regional reception centers where demands for asylum could be processed more quickly. He also promised an investigation into the police\u2019s conduct.\u201cI can\u2019t accept the putting in place of facilities which will once again facilitate the creation of encampments and slums,\u201d she said in a statement late on Monday.The majority of residents of Calais might agree. The leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, won a majority of the vote against Mr. Macron in the second round of the presidential election in May.Mr. Macron wants a fresh start on policy regarding migrants, but until last week he had mainly allowed his tough-talking interior minister to set the tone: no coddling of migrants at Calais and harsh words for the humanitarian organizations working there.The government wanted to avoid setting up new reception centers at Calais or do anything that would encourage migrants to head to that English Channel port, further exasperating local officials.It has also pledged to step up the expulsion of economic migrants looking for work, as opposed to those seeking political asylum. Less than a third of the 91,000 illegal migrants arrested in France last year actually left the country.Mr. Macron turned his attention to migrants last week in a speech in Orl\u00e9ans, vowing then to end the phenomenon of migrant encampments in France. \u201cThe first fight is to house everybody decently. Between now and the end of the year, I want no more men and women in the streets, in the woods, or lost,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of dignity, it\u2019s a question of humanity, and of efficiency also,\u201d he said at the end of a ceremony to swear in new French citizens.\u201cMost of those who are, dreadfully, called migrants today, are not all men and women demanding asylum, coming from countries where their lives are in danger,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cThere are many, more and more, who come from peaceful countries, and are following the economic migration routes, who are financing the smugglers, the bandits, even terrorists, and in those cases we need to be strict, tough even, rigorous, with those coming by those routes. We can\u2019t welcome everybody.\u201dHe promoted his own \u201cmuch more ambitious\u201d European development policy, called the Sahel Alliance, intended to keep the migrants in Africa.While Africans have welcomed these outlines of initiatives, many reacted angrily to remarks Mr. Macron made at the Group of 20 summit meeting about Africa\u2019s \u201ccivilizational challenge.\u201d\u201cWhen you have countries where there are still seven to eight children per woman, you can decide to spend million of euros, nothing will be stabilized,\u201d he said.Despite the angry African reaction, Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks are consistent with the demographic reality in several West African countries that are sources of European migration.The new president turned aside from the migrant issue in his first months. Instead, he has been preoccupied with reforming France\u2019s economy and meeting foreign leaders, a suddenly plunging popularity rating and a raft of inexperienced parliamentary deputies in his own political movement.But politically hazardous images of African migrants camping out \u2014 in the streets of Paris, at Calais or near the Italian border around Nice \u2014 keep turning up in the French news media.Last month the police in Paris carried out their 34th evacuation of migrants since 2015, removing nearly 3,000 from the Porte de la Chapelle, then busing them to gymnasiums in the region for processing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Judge\u2019s Bid to Clean Up Brazil From the Bench", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileCURITIBA, Brazil \u2014 Outside the courthouse, T-shirts with Judge S\u00e9rgio Moro\u2019s picture go for $12. Novelty passports for the so-called Republic of Curitiba \u2014 the city that\u2019s become the hub of the judiciary\u2019s crusade against corruption \u2014 are $3 apiece.Inside his chambers, there are few signs of grandeur or the cultlike following now surrounding Judge Moro, the 45-year-old jurist who has rattled Brazil by sentencing some of the country\u2019s most powerful politicians and businesspeople to prison on corruption charges.His desk is a mess, with bulging folders, books and printouts stacked haphazardly a foot high. Down the hall, his courtroom, run by a clerk in sneakers and jeans, looks like a cramped classroom, with rows of cheap chairs. By official title and rank, he is a relatively ordinary federal judge, one of hundreds in the nation.Now entering its fourth year, the sprawling investigation into corruption at the highest levels \u2014 known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash \u2014 is proceeding with surprising consistency and results in a country with a long history of impunity, both prosecutors and defense lawyers say, in part because of the unyielding pressure from figures like Judge Moro.Brazil\u2019s anti-corruption effort is much broader than him alone. The prosecutors and investigators handling cases around the country have secured 157 convictions and recovered more than $12 billion and are overwhelmed by the number of leads.Even so, Judge Moro, who sent shock waves through the political establishment when he sentenced Mr. da Silva, the former president, to nearly 10 years in prison last month, conveys more concern than swagger these days.\u201cAs I see it, the case known as Lava Jato represents the end of impunity as a rule in Brazil for this type of crime,\u201d Judge Moro said. \u201cThe question is: Will it be a permanent change or just an episodic thing?\u201dOn a recent afternoon, the judge strode in for a hearing in the mammoth corruption cases that have upended Brazil. Two former midlevel executives at the state-run oil company Petrobras, on trial and dressed in sweatsuits, looked crestfallen as a handful of witnesses took turns at the stand to describe the institutionalized system of graft that has siphoned billions of dollars from public coffers and helped cement distrust of lawmakers.Judge Moro and Brazilian prosecutors believe that a deeper political transformation can be achieved only through sweeping changes like overhauling campaign finance rules, doing away with the de facto immunity members of Congress enjoy in office and winnowing down the vast number of political parties, to curb horse trading.Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would make it easier to rein in judges who, the politicians contend, are abusing their authority by ordering pretrial detentions and relying too heavily on plea deals.\u201cBrazil is at a tipping point and it\u2019s unclear right now which of these two forces is going to be victorious,\u201d said Matthew Taylor, an expert on Brazil\u2019s judicial system at American University.Judge Moro, a studious, sullen lawyer who spent the early years of his career studying the history of money laundering and corruption investigations, is widely credited with setting up that clash.It took a decade and a \u201chighly improbable set of necessary conditions,\u201d said Deltan Dallagnol, a Lava Jato prosecutor, for Brazil\u2019s judiciary to start applying the tactics of \u201cClean Hands.\u201dIt began in early 2014 with a routine investigation into money laundering at a gas station in Bras\u00edlia, which eventually led investigators to unravel a gargantuan web of kickbacks at Petrobras.Critical cases in the inquiry were assigned to a close-knit team of federal police officers and prosecutors in Curitiba that happened to have expertise in financial crimes. A new electronic case system allowed judges to expedite cases that had lagged for years. Switzerland, long a haven for stolen public funds, agreed to share information with Brazilian prosecutors. A 2013 update to Brazil\u2019s penal code made it easier to turn defendants into cooperating witnesses by offering them leniency.And then there was Judge Moro.In May 2014, he startled the legal community by demanding that a former Petrobras chief, Paulo Roberto Costa, be held pending trial, calling him a flight risk. In doing so, he stared down a Supreme Court judge who had signed off on Mr. Costa\u2019s release. But Judge Moro prevailed, and with Mr. Costa behind bars, several other suspects agreed to cooperate with investigators.As a cascade of new charges were filed against politicians and Petrobras executives, Judge Moro soon became a celebrity. During a visit to a supermarket in Curitiba, an employee took to the loudspeaker to announce his presence. At large protests in 2015 against the government of President Dilma Rousseff, previously the chairwoman of Petrobras, many demonstrators wore Moro masks and T-shirts with the slogan \u201cWe are all S\u00e9rgio Moro.\u201dMany Brazilians hoped the judge would run for office, a prospect he has ruled out. Judge Moro, who comes across as reserved and taciturn, said that he stumbled into the limelight but that his newfound fame had served the investigation well.\u201cIt was important so that these cases, which implicated powerful people, weren\u2019t obstructed in some way,\u201d he said.As the cases advanced, Judge Moro and the Lava Jato prosecutors began to make a broader argument to the public about the need to change the nation\u2019s political culture.\u201cThe exposure and punishment of public corruption is an honor to the nation, not a disgrace,\u201d the quoted portion said.The revelation fueled public outrage that contributed to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster last year. But it also focused anger on Judge Moro. Even some legal experts who support his work have argued that releasing the wiretap was improper because the warrant used to record the call appeared to have expired when the conversation took place. The judge says he has no regrets.\u201cI think that democracy wins when, shall we say, people learn what their leaders do in the shadows,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when what they\u2019re doing is illicit.\u201dProsecutors charged Mr. da Silva in 2015 with corruption, accusing him of illegally receiving about $1.1 million in improvements and expenses for a beachfront apartment. They have also described him as the mastermind of the kickbacks scheme at Petrobras. As the case unfolded, the Brazilian news media covered it as a duel between two titans \u2014 Judge Moro and the leftist former president \u2014 that could shape the broader political future of Brazil.Last month, in finding Mr. da Silva guilty, Judge Moro wrote that \u201cno matter how important you are, no one is above the law.\u201d The decision has thrown into turmoil next year\u2019s presidential election, in which Mr. da Silva is currently the front-runner. He could be barred from running.With the appeal pending, Mr. da Silva\u2019s supporters are attacking Judge Moro and the Lava Jato team. This month, supporters held a mock trial in Curitiba, accusing them of abusing pretrial detentions, offering questionable plea bargains and trying the case in the press.\u201cJudge Moro cannot continue behaving like he was a czar,\u201d Mr. da Silva said late last month in a radio interview.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cecil D. Andrus, 85, Carter\u2019s Preservationist Interior Secretary, Dies", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCecil D. Andrus, a four-term governor of Idaho who as interior secretary under President Jimmy Carter helped set aside vast expanses of Alaska for parks and reserves, died on Thursday at his home in Boise, Idaho. He was 85.The cause was complications of lung cancer, his daughter Tracy Andrus said.Mr. Andrus liked to portray himself as having stumbled into public life \u2014 he was a \u201cpolitical accident,\u201d in his words. It was a sophisticated bit of self-branding, positioning him as passionate rather than opportunistic in a state where the notion of Western authenticity had always played well.He was 28 in 1960 when his tiny community of Orofino, Idaho, invited the area\u2019s aging Republican state senator to a town meeting to try to persuade him to fight for more financing for a public kindergarten.\u201cHe made the statement, \u2018Well, this school system was good enough for me, it\u2019s good enough for your kids,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Andrus, a Democrat, recalled in an interview for this obituary in 2012. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself. I said, \u2018It\u2019s pretty obvious, Senator, that the school system wasn\u2019t even good enough for you.\u2019 \u201dThat exchange prompted laughter, and it helped propel Mr. Andrus to run for the same State Senate seat. He won it that fall, and a decade later became governor, the first Democrat elected to that post in 24 years.He also may have been the first governor of either party to win by running on an environmental issue. His opposition to a proposed molybdenum mine in the White Cloud Mountains of central Idaho was at the core of his campaign. The mine was never built, and Mr. Andrus cruised to re-election in 1974.Halfway into his second term he received a call from another rural Democrat, Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. They had become friends over the years while attending meetings of governors\u2019 groups.\u201cWe got along very well,\u201d Mr. Andrus said, \u201cbecause both of us understood the need for protection of the land that the dear lord has provided to us.\u201dMr. Carter had just been elected president and had Mr. Andrus in mind for secretary of the interior. \u201cCece was the only person I considered for the cabinet post,\u201d Mr. Carter said in a statement on Friday.The call came in around 6 p.m. By the next morning, after hopping a short flight to Seattle, a red-eye to Atlanta and, finally, a tiny Cessna to an unpaved landing strip in Plains, Ga., Mr. Andrus was shaking hands with his future boss.\u201cI come from the old school that says when the president of the United States asks you to do something, you do it,\u201d Mr. Andrus said.Mr. Andrus never liked Washington, but he believed in his work. Over the next four years he helped reduce the impact of mining in Appalachia and protected rivers in California. But his most notable work happened in Alaska, which had been admitted to the union just 17 years before Mr. Carter was elected.\u201cWe developed America by giving away resources,\u201d Mr. Andrus said in the interview. \u201cWhen we got to the Pacific Ocean, we looked back over our shoulders and said, \u2018Oh, my God, look what we\u2019ve done.\u2019 But in Alaska we had the opportunity to do it right the first time.\u201dWith Mr. Andrus leading the way, the Carter administration set aside more than 100 million acres in the state for federal protection, including what became the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The measure was completed in a lame-duck session of Congress in the final weeks of the Carter administration, after Ronald Reagan had won the 1980 election, denying the president a second term.The plan drew intense criticism from many Alaskans and industries that wanted more freedom to develop the state\u2019s oil, mineral, timber and other resources. It also frustrated environmentalists, who wanted the protections to go further.\u201cAfter review of all the exceptions, some critics wondered that it was called a conservation act at all,\u201d the Alaska historian Stephen Haycox wrote in his book \u201cFrigid Embrace: Politics, Economics and Environment in Alaska\u201d (2002). \u201cBut most recognized that it did provide a framework for preservation in Alaska.\u201dMr. Andrus acknowledged the imperfections but said that environmentalists would have fared much worse if they had waited for Reagan to take office.\u201cEven though we were creating tomorrow\u2019s controversies, a 103-million-acre plan \u2014 amounting to more than 25 percent of Alaska \u2014 was a helluva lot better than nothing,\u201d he said in his 1998 memoir, \u201cCecil Andrus: Politics Western Style,\u201d which he wrote with Joel Connelly, a Seattle journalist.Mr. Carter saw the Alaska legislation as one of his biggest accomplishments. \u201cTogether we made conservation history,\u201d he said in his statement about Mr. Andrus on Friday. \u201cAmericans are better off because of his service,\u201d he added, \u201cand I am better because of his friendship.\u201dMr. Andrus returned to Idaho soon after Mr. Carter left office in 1981. Asked in interviews before he left whether he might stay in the nation\u2019s capital, he wore his Western pride openly.\u201cThe only reason so many people live on the East Coast is that they don\u2019t know any better,\u201d he said.Back in Boise, he caught some people off guard by becoming a spokesman for the aluminum industry, which relied on the region\u2019s hydroelectric dams for cheap power. Mr. Andrus had been a longtime critic of the dams\u2019 effect on migrating salmon, but he also believed a balance could be achieved that preserved the dams, industry and the fish.Years later, however, that balance has proved elusive, as fish populations continue to suffer and advocates on various sides continue to fight in court.Mr. Andrus also surprised people when he decided to run for governor again in 1986. He won by just 3,500 votes. His popularity would steadily rise, and he was re-elected with more than 70 percent of the vote in 1990.In 1988, during a dispute with the federal government over the storage of nuclear waste in Idaho, he won new supporters when he ordered state troopers to block a railroad car filled with nuclear waste from entering a storage site. Two years later he confounded some supporters when he vetoed a bill that would have given Idaho one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the nation. Once again he appealed to his state\u2019s independent streak.\u2019\u2019We Idahoans are a fiercely independent group,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Andrus said at the time. \u2019\u2019We call them as we see them, and I have done that. I know there will be some fallout. I can\u2019t do anything about that.\u2019\u2019The Legislature, which included an evenly divided Senate and a Republican-controlled House, upheld his veto of the anti-abortion bill. Of more than 100 vetoes he issued while in office, lawmakers overturned just one.Mr. Andrus did not seek another term in 1994. Idaho has not had a Democratic governor since, and its Legislature has long since become dominated by Republicans.Later in life, Mr. Andrus lamented what he described as increasing partisanship in the state and the nation.\u201cWe used to be able to work in the middle,\u201d he said in 2012, \u201cbut there is no middle anymore.\u201dCecil Dale Andrus was born on Aug. 25, 1931 \u2014 he died a day before his 86th birthday \u2014 in Hood River, Ore. He grew up fishing for salmon with his father, Hal, who worked in the timber industry, and he could recall watching Native Americans fish at Celilo Falls, the famous rapids on the Columbia River that were permanently submerged when dams were built in the 1950s. His mother, the former Dorothy Johnson, was a homemaker.He graduated from high school in Eugene, Ore., before enrolling in Oregon State College (now Oregon State University). He served in the Korean War, flying with a patrol bomber squadron.In 1949 Mr. Andrus married his high school sweetheart, Carol May, who survives him. Looking for work, the family moved to Orofino, where his father helped him find a job in a timber mill.In addition to his wife and his daughter Tracy, Mr. Andrus is survived by two other daughters, Tana Andrus-Watson and Kelly Andrus; a brother, Steve; a sister, Margaret Gardner; three grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.Mr. Andrus avoided many of the trappings of being governor. He lived in his own house, mowed his lawn himself, and had limited security. But he was, by all accounts, a deft politician \u2014 and one who kept score.When he ran for governor in 1986, the state\u2019s Republican senators signed a large advertisement in The Idaho Statesman saying they opposed his election. Mr. Andrus kept a copy of the ad in his desk at the Capitol, and he enjoyed pulling it out when a Republican lawmaker would come in trying to win his support for a bill.\u201cIf you had legislation you wanted and you were on that list,\u201d recalled Bruce Newcomb, who was the Republican majority leader at the end of Mr. Andrus\u2019s final term and later became House speaker, \u201cwell, you had an uphill battle.\u201dAn obituary on Saturday 27 about Cecil D. Andrus, who was secretary of the interior under President Jimmy Carter, referred incorrectly to his marriage to Carol May in 1949. They married before he fought in the Korean War \u2014 not after he returned.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Robinson has been an outspoken supporter of the anticorruption battle led by Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Attorney General Thelma Aldana.In a post on his Facebook page on Monday, Mr. Morales promised to abide by the ruling of the court.In the eyes of many Guatemalans, Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, a professorial Colombian prosecutor, has become their champion because of his role in cracking open corruption schemes led by members of Guatemala\u2019s political and economic elite.The breaking point appeared to come on Friday, when Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Ms. Aldana announced that Mr. Morales\u2019s party had failed to report anonymous campaign contributions made during the 2015 presidential campaign.They asked for his immunity from prosecution to be removed to allow their investigation to proceed.

{"Headline": "Bumpy Times in Brazil, but Hedge Funds Boom", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 After more than a decade as an asset manager for large multinational banks, a Brazilian, M\u00e1rcio Appel, wanted to make it on his own. The political and economic upheaval in his country was not going to deter him.Even on the heels of a new scandal erupting in May that rocked the markets, the hedge fund firm he co-founded here, Adam Capital, started raising money for its newest fund. It is expected to be a $6.1 billion macro global fund, or one that invests based largely on the political and economic prospects of various countries.If it succeeds, the firm could become one of the top independent asset managers in Latin America, based on total assets under management, and among the largest worldwide of its vintage.Mr. Appel is going solo as Brazil\u2019s hedge fund sector is growing even though the short-term prospects of the economy remain uncertain.Total assets under management in June increased to $85 billion, a jump of 15 percent from the $74 billion in June 2016, according to data provided by the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association, known by its Portuguese acronym Anbima.Brazilian macro funds had a total under management of $30.79 billion (or 97 billion reais) in June, a 51 percent increase from the same month one year earlier. Just in the first six months of this year, that figure grew by 18 percent.Such funds are more and more sought after out here. They received a net increase of $5.3 billion (or 16.7 billion reais) in the first half of this year, a turnaround from the net outflow of $412.7 million (or 1.3 billion reais) over the same period last year, according to Anbima.Even with all that money going into hedge funds, it is still an unusual time to form a new investment vehicle here and court investors.Brazil\u2019s president continues to be investigated for corruption, his low popularity has eroded even further, and his ability to shepherd unpopular reform measures considered by bankers as essential to turn around the economy has diminished.Yet Adam Capital\u2019s founding partners, Mr. Appel and his longtime colleague Andr\u00e9 Salgado, are no strangers to crisis.\u201cBrazil is a very good place to make money. It always has been,\u201d said Mr. Appel in a recent interview at the firm\u2019s office in the upscale Leblon neighborhood near the beach.From 2001 to 2008, Mr. Appel led asset management at the Spanish banking giant Santander\u2019s Brazil subsidiary. Then he did that for Banco Safra from 2008 to October 2015. There he gained acclaim for his performance with their Galileo fund, which gained 199.43 percent during his tenure, according to the brokerage firm XP Investimentos.But, he said, \u201cI always dreamt of opening my own firm.\u201dThe two founding partners met while at Santander \u2014 Mr. Salgado headed its brokerage house from 2003 to 2010 and later held a similar role at Safra.Adam Capital opened its initial funds in April last year. Two weeks earlier, Brazil\u2019s lower house had voted to move forward the impeachment process of Dilma Rousseff, then president.Still, the firm ended up raising $2.9 billion for its flagship macro fund and accumulated a total of about $3.3 billion in under nine months. That was in part because several private banks, including Itau Unibanco and Safra, agreed to be distributors, providing access to their private banking clients.Adam Capital \u201chas had very strong success in raising funds,\u201d said Michael Viriato Araujo, a professor of finance at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based business school Insper. \u201cFor Brazil, the speed at which they raised was impressive,\u201d he said.The firm\u2019s performance has been well above benchmarks. As of July 31, the flagship fund is up 27 percent since inception. That is about 1.65 times the return of the CDI, a type of certificate of deposit common among Brazilians and considered risk-free as it is tied to local interest rates, which have long been sky-high.The firm currently holds about $4.51 billion in assets under management, according to Mr. Salgado.That ranks it first globally among hedge fund managers established in 2016 or later and based on total assets under management, according to the research firm Preqin.Black and White Capital in the United States is in second place with $2.8 billion. Only two others have surpassed the $1 billion threshold in assets under management. Those are the Holocene Advisors and Sagewood in the United States.Adam Capital so far has focused on investing in equities, mostly indexes, foreign exchange and interest rates. It has done so in the United States, Japan, and Europe as well as in emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and Mexico.Until May, the firm kept about a 50/50 split between investments in Brazil and overseas, its founders said. The leak of a taped conversation between Joesley Batista, chief executive of J & F Investments, the parent of the meatpacking giant JBS, and Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, who seemed to endorse Mr. Batista\u2019s bribery, resulted in a market panic.Immediately afterward, Adam reduced everything related to Brazil: stocks, local interest rates and the real. Its flagship fund fell 3.52 percent that month.Yet the firm\u2019s funds have since rebounded, as has their exposure to Brazil, including even betting on the real over the dollar. \u201cAs of today, we\u2019re just back to pre-Batista levels,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back to 50/50.\u201dThey also feel like they passed an important test during that episode. \u201cGenerally I think it was bad because nobody likes to lose money,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cBut we managed to prove to the market that our size was manageable even with an event of this proportion.\u201dIn Brazil, several factors have buoyed independent asset managers. Interest rates falling significantly in the past year forced normally conservative Brazilian investors to start taking more risks. The emergence of new brokerage firms, some online, has also cut into the dominance banks used to have in controlling hedge funds.Large banks are starting to sell to independent managers, said Mr. Appel. \u201cThat is what allowed us to get that big that fast,\u201d Mr. Salgado noted.That bodes well for other firms, too. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely the industry will continue to grow,\u201d said Professor Viriato, the hedge fund expert at Insper.The minimum amount needed to invest has also fallen, making the funds more accessible.\u201cHedge funds in the past were for the ultrarich in Brazil,\u201d said Mr. Salgado. Now a hedge fund investor needs only a minimum investment of $3,175 and can make that through his bank or other firms.Reflecting that change, Adam Capital already has about 18,000 individual investors in its funds.Mr. Salgado said that to put money in hedge funds in Brazil today, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a millionaire anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Weary Wisconsin Town, a Billionaire-Fueled Revival", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "Diane Hendricks and her late husband saw opportunity in Beloit, a decaying industrial town. Now, she dreams of turning it into a mecca for start-ups.Supported byBELOIT, Wis. \u2014 When Diane Hendricks sees something she doesn\u2019t like here, she buys it.A bankrupt country club. A half-empty mall. Abandoned buildings. The rusting foundry down by the river.\u201cI see old buildings, and I see an opportunity for putting things in them,\u201d says Ms. Hendricks, 70, who got her start fixing up houses here as a single mother and made her billions selling roofing felt, copper gutters and cement with her late husband, Ken.Now Ms. Hendricks is fixing up Beloit.She took the library from its historic location downtown and resurrected it inside a failing mall at the edge of town, replacing the original with a performing arts center where dance and music students from Beloit College can study and perform each year. Then she scooped up nearly every building on a downtown block and knocked each one down, making way for a sushi restaurant, a high-quality burger joint and modern apartments with marble countertops and exposed-brick walls.She called the complex the Phoenix. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re beautifying the city, but we\u2019re really beautifying the economy,\u201d she says, casting her piercing blue eyes out of the window of her office in Ironworks, the old foundry complex she converted into a commercial space.She has wooed several start-ups, persuading them to set up shop in the old foundry building \u2014 one with the help of Wisconsin\u2019s governor, Scott Walker, who personally called the co-founders on her behalf.Ms. Hendricks, a major Republican donor, was briefly thrust into the national spotlight a few years ago when she was recorded asking Mr. Walker to break up the labor unions. He then introduced a bill limiting the ability of public workers to bargain over wages. In response, protesters occupied the halls of the Capitol for weeks.Not long ago, Beloit\u2019s economy was ugly. Like many American cities \u2014 Detroit, Youngstown, Gary \u2014 it had fallen victim to the damage that is wrought when one major industry vanishes from town, reversing local fortunes.Beloit is different today. That\u2019s because this town of nearly 37,000 has a billionaire who has gone to great lengths to help it turn a corner.In a nation with countless struggling towns and small cities, Beloit is not a model for economic revival that is easily replicated, although a few others have tried.Ms. Hendricks\u2019s project has not been cheap.Buying and fixing up the foundry alone has cost Ms. Hendricks around $40 million, according to Rob Gerbitz, the president and chief executive of Hendricks Commercial Properties. The Phoenix complex has cost $7 million (with a $1 million assist from the city).And, of course, money doesn\u2019t solve everything. Ms. Hendricks\u2019s overhaul faces challenges big and small, including skepticism. Early on, some residents joked about giving the city a new name: Hendricksville. Unemployment remains stubbornly high, as does poverty.Her activities on Beloit\u2019s behalf are complicated by the fact that not everyone agrees with Ms. Hendricks\u2019s political views. She was an early supporter of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign here in Wisconsin, a state with a history of progressive politics, and that has pitted her against some current and former students at Beloit College, a liberal arts school and one of Beloit\u2019s other big employers. (Ms. Hendricks sits on the college\u2019s board of trustees.)\u201cDiane Hendricks is the most powerful woman in Wisconsin,\u201d says Charlie Sykes, a former talk-show host in Milwaukee.In Beloit, she\u2019s so influential that some worry about what would happen if someday she walks away. \u201cWill the kids take over?\u201d asks Rod Gottfredsen, a local barber, referring to her seven adult children.Mr. Gottfredsen has had a front-row seat to Beloit\u2019s travails for nearly 40 years. He\u2019s been cutting hair and trimming beards since 1978, when he took over Austin\u2019s Barbershop on one of Beloit\u2019s main streets downtown.On a clear June day, one of Ms. Hendricks\u2019s sons, Brent Fox, is in his white Ford Super Duty truck driving through the lush tree-lined streets around Beloit College. This is the neighborhood where Ms. Hendricks and her husband got their start a half-century ago, buying and fixing up homes, in the 1960s.\u201cMom wanted me to show you these,\u201d Mr. Fox says as he stops outside two Craftsman-style homes where trucks marked CCI, a Hendricks-owned construction company, are parked. \u201cOne of the biggest problems we find is suitable housing stock, so we decided to buy old, stately houses,\u201d says Mr. Fox, who is also the chief executive of Hendricks Holding Company.\u201cAs long as we can break even or make a dollar, we\u2019ll keep doing it,\u201d he adds.Mr. Fox drives north, past Beloit\u2019s industrial sites, through the town\u2019s history. The red roof of ABC Supply comes into view, overlooking Beloit from a slight hill. When the Hendrickses bought the property in the 1990s, it was an abandoned factory that had once made diesel backup engines for military submarines.We pass the Eclipse Center, which in its heyday in the 1960s was the biggest mall in Rock County. By the 1980s, it had become better known for a notorious double murder at the Radio Shack. The place was half empty when the Hendrickses stepped in.He stops at the Beloit Club, a beleaguered country club near the Rock River, which cuts through the town. Ms. Hendricks bought it several years ago, possibly saving the club from an ignominious fate as a gravel pit.\u201cFrom a business perspective, it was a horrible decision,\u201d he says of the purchase. But if Beloit was to be reimagined as a modern city, the thinking went, it needed a club for golf.Beloit\u2019s Hendricks-fueled revival happened largely by chance.Ms. Hendricks grew up 200 miles away from Beloit, on a dairy farm, with eight sisters. As a child, she yearned to work outdoors on the farm, but her father forbade it. A surprise pregnancy at 17 and her short marriage to Mr. Fox\u2019s father brought her to Janesville, to work briefly in the Parker Pen factory, where women assembled fountain pens.Soon she divorced. She had to find a way to support herself on her own, as a single mother. She switched to selling real estate, and had gotten her broker\u2019s license by the time she turned 21.Before long, she had found a business partner, a roofing contractor who had dropped out of high school, named Ken Hendricks. Together the two bought old houses in Beloit, fixed them up and rented them out. They married in 1975 and moved on to buying industrial spaces at around the same time. They found a rundown sugar beet plant in Janesville, 20 miles up the road from Beloit.When Mr. Hendricks went to a Janesville bank to finance the purchase of the plant, he was turned away. \u201cThe banker said, \u2018We don\u2019t do business with entrepreneurs, and we don\u2019t want your business,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hendricks recalls.It was a turning point. The couple turned their backs on Janesville, focusing instead on Beloit.They would move from renting local apartments to starting ABC Supply in 1982, buying up distributors nationwide.Beloit at the time was on the cusp of a steep decline after successive economic blows, among them the grinding to a halt of Fairbanks Morse, a diesel engine maker and a onetime major employer.Like struggling cities and towns across the country, Beloit went through a period of Band-Aid-like efforts. By the 1980s, local businesses were petitioning the city to change its image by cleaning up the riverfront, where vacant stores sat along the banks of the river, and by reviving the withering downtown. The initiatives barely made a dent.Into the 1990s, at least, the town still had its foundry, Beloit Corporation, by that time owned by a Milwaukee company, Harnishfeger Corporation. At its height, Beloit Corporation had employed more than 7,000 people building papermaking machines. Late into the night, the flickering light from the welding in the foundry would light up the Rock River.In 1999, the foundry went bankrupt, leaving behind an empty, sprawling complex the size of 15 football fields. Beloit\u2019s downtown became a bleak landscape of \u201cdecayed, bombed-out buildings,\u201d recalled Jeff Adams, who moved to Beloit to teach economics at Beloit College in the early 1980s and was involved in early initiatives to try to fix the town.But if Beloit was sinking, the Hendrickses were riding high. Their business was booming, and they saw opportunity in the desolation.One day, a few years after Beloit Corporation went bust, the two were riding their Harley-Davidsons past the abandoned factory and noticed someone wandering around the property. They stopped to ask what he was doing. The man, Samuel Popa, turned out to be looking for a place to put his aluminum business.On a whim, the Hendricks decided to buy the 800,000-square-foot building. They knew it had the potential to one day become commercial space, perhaps residential, too. They ended up becoming a partner in Mr. Popa\u2019s company, American Aluminum Extrusion.Next, they bought the old mall on the edge of town, which they planned on turning into \u201ca community and civic center,\u201d Ms. Hendricks says.Around the same time, Ron Nief, the director of public affairs at Beloit College, and two of his friends had an idea that in almost any other dying industrial town would not have gotten out of the starting blocks: Let\u2019s start an international film festival.They approached Beloit\u2019s billionaire benefactors about the idea, and in 2006, the festival opened on a frigid Wisconsin weekday in January.Despite the fact that its debut occurred the same week as the much more famous Sundance Film Festival, it has thrived. Jon Voight, Melissa Gilbert and David Zucker, the director of \u201cAirplane!,\u201d have attendedMr. Nief recalls a conversation with Mr. Hendricks, who had told him to aim high with the film festival idea. Mr. Nief said to him, \u201cIt needs to be special, but it doesn\u2019t need to be, say, the Toronto Film Festival,\u201d referring to the giant on the festival circuit.\u201cKen said: \u2018Why not? Why don\u2019t you want to be the biggest and the best in the world?\u2019\u201d Mr. Nief said.But tragedy struck one evening, just days before Christmas in 2007. Mr. Hendricks fell through the roof of his home after inspecting some renovations; he died from the injuries.Mr. Hendricks\u2019s death led residents in Beloit to worry that Ms. Hendricks would sell ABC and abandon the couple\u2019s efforts to revive the town.Then came the 2008 economic crisis. Housing and construction, the very businesses on which the Hendrickses\u2019 fortune had been built, suffered through one of the worst downturns in decades.ABC pulled through, and grew in part by buying its biggest rival, Bradco. Today ABC is a private company and the largest wholesale distributor of roofing, windows, siding and gutter materials. It has 715 stores across the United States and employs 656 people in Beloit alone.Ms. Hendricks also began putting to use the industrial buildings that she and her husband had bought over the years. She turned the foundry into a commercial space with high ceilings, dubbing it Ironworks, and turned to a political ally, Mr. Walker, to help attract at least one tenant.The move worked.\u201cI had 17 employees at that moment, and the governor of Wisconsin told me my business mattered to him,\u201d recalled Kerry Frank, the co-founder with her husband, Dude Frank, of Comply365, which makes software used by airline pilots to complete their flight paperwork. Started in the Franks\u2019 basement, the company is now housed in Ironworks and counts Southwest Airlines among its biggest clients.In 2011, after Illinois created a new law to collect sales tax from online shoppers, the Rockton online coupon company FatWallet needed to find a Wisconsin town for its headquarters. Ms. Hendricks worked with the city to make Beloit, just over the state border, FatWallet\u2019s first choice. The company is now based in Ironworks.\u201cThe advantage here in Beloit is that the same type of engineer that you hire in Silicon Valley can have a large house,\u201d says Ryan Washatka, general manager in Beloit for Ebates, FatWallet\u2019s parent company.Still, few people in the start-up world outside of Wisconsin know much about Beloit. It certainly was not on the radar of Chris Olsen, a former executive at Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, whose Ohio venture capital firm Drive Capital is now one of Comply365\u2019s biggest investors.After several airlines told him to look at Comply365, Mr. Olson found himself looking at a map. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know where Beloit was,\u201d he jokes.In part to address problems like that, Ms. Hendricks has sent members of her property company, Hendricks Commercial Properties, to Madison to talk to venture capitalists. \u201cCandidly, I wasn\u2019t looking at Beloit,\u201d said Joe Kirgues, a co-founder of Gener8tor, a tech incubator, who one day found himself at a table with Ms. Hendricks\u2019s team.He said the pitch to him had boiled down to: \u201cTell us what resources you need.\u201d Today, Gener8tor has an office in Ironworks and is working with several local start-ups.What\u2019s more, many new jobs are filled by people who commute to Beloit from nearby cities. At AccuLynx, a software company based in the Ironworks, just 17 percent of the employees live in Beloit. The rest live in nearby towns in Wisconsin and just over the border in Illinois.And many of the new jobs require technical skills, like engineering, that residents who once worked in manufacturing often lack. \u201cI know that there are parts of Beloit that are not sharing in this renaissance,\u201d says Scott Bierman, president of Beloit College.Mr. Bierman credits Ms. Hendricks for providing a vision of how things can be. Still, he says, \u201cI worry a lot.\u201dWhile he does see signs that what Ms. Hendricks has built can be sustainable, \u201cWe\u2019ll know a lot more once we get through the next recession,\u201d he said.For now, around 1,000 people currently work out of Ironworks, according to Mr. Gerbitz of Hendricks Commercial Properties. \u201cOur goal is to get to 5,000, which was what was lost when Beloit Corporation went away,\u201d he said.Ironworks today is a far cry from its foundry origins. At AccuLynx, the software firm, there is a giant slide running down from the second floor to the first, a video-game console and a giant gold bell that is rung when sales are made.AccuLynx\u2019s founder, Rich Spanton, described the day his grandfather, who had worked at the foundry as a superintendent for nearly a half-century, visited the building, where he had spent a career assembling steel parts for paper machines. He was astonished at what he saw.\u201cHe walked in,\u201d Mr. Spanton recalls, \u201cand he said, \u2018Jeez, we couldn\u2019t have gotten any work done if this had been our office.\u2019\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts by Diane Hendricks to remake Beloit, Wis. misidentified the company led by Brent Fox, one of Ms. Hendricks\u2019s sons. It is Hendricks Holding Company, not ABC Supply. The article also referred incorrectly to Ms. Hendricks\u2019s ranking among the richest women in the United States. She is the second-richest self-made woman, according to Forbes magazine, not the second-richest woman.Advertisement"}

Yee, the Democratic state controller. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do our work to really heal our divide, we are going to miss our chance to motivate Democrats.\u201d\u201cThe truth of the matter is, Kimberly Ellis cannot accept that she lost the election,\u201d Mr. Bauman said. \u201cShe\u2019s willing to allow the party to be torn asunder in an effort to prove that she really did win. My attitude about this is, I was elected chair under the rules. I have attempted to be the most open and transparent chair this party has ever seen.\u201dMs. Ellis, 44, has from the start presented herself as an outsider: It is her first run for party leadership. She has spent several years as executive director of Emerge California, which recruits and trains women to run for office. Ms. Ellis \u2014 who backed Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary race last year but has gained the support of Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 presented her candidacy as a challenge to the way the Democratic Party in California does business, starting with an animating promise: \u201cGiving the Democratic Party Back to the People.\u201d If she had been elected, she would have been the first African-American to lead the state party.By contrast, Mr. Bauman has spent 30 years working for the Democratic Party, including leading the Los Angeles County Democratic Party. He was a delegate for Mrs. Clinton in last year\u2019s presidential election. With his gruff demeanor and a strong-as-ever Bronx accent \u2014 no matter that he came here 40 years ago \u2014 he has been called \u201cBoss Bauman,\u201d as Mr. Bauman himself noted in an interview.Ms. Ellis said Mr. Bauman and other Democratic leaders represented an old-school, top-down style of party leadership that had been rejected by the new wave of Democrats brought into the party by Mr. Sanders last year and by Ms. Ellis this year.\u201cThe Democratic Party is in many ways right now where the Republican Party was when the Tea Party took over many years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in a rebuilding moment.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of things that have gone on here that have really caused folks to feel that leadership doesn\u2019t care about them or their voices,\u201d Ms. Ellis added. \u201cThe Democratic Party is not only changing but has changed. There are folks who haven\u2019t gotten that memo. The way that we did things before is not going to work going forward.\u201dFor many Democrats, what is particularly worrying is the extent to which the lingering battle illustrates the bitterness between supporters of Mr. Sanders and those of Mrs. Clinton. The California Democratic Party has seen a surge of active members since Election Day, not only in response to Mr. Trump and his policies, but also because of Mr. Sanders\u2019s success in stirring enthusiasm.But in some ways, these are the kind of internecine fights \u2014 be they between the old guard and new faces, or between liberals and moderates \u2014 that are common in Democratic circles, usually mainly of interest to the most inside of insiders. \u201cRemember: We are Democrats. We do this all the time,\u201d said Christine Pelosi, a supporter of Ms. Ellis who is the head of the California Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus and a daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader.For all that, Mr. Bauman, 58, is hardly your run-of-the-mill party leader. He is openly gay and an Orthodox Jew, a nurse by training who sprinkles his remarks with Hebrew and tears up when talking about his late mother and the time he heard Bill Clinton, running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992, appealing for gay support at a rally in Hollywood at the height of the AIDS crisis.But as much as Ms. Ellis is portrayed by her supporters as the future of the Democratic Party, Mr. Bauman is perceived as the face of the establishment Democratic Party they blame for the party\u2019s setbacks in Washington. \u201cHe has a style that is sometimes not the most warm,\u201d said Ms. Yee, who supported Ms. Ellis. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact. And I think he knows that. He can be abrasive. He can be dismissive.\u201dMs. Ellis said Mr. Bauman was a product of the environment created by the state Democratic Party. \u201cAnd the environment includes bullying and a lot of bad behavior,\u201d she said.Mr. Bauman did not dispute that as he sat behind glass walls in an office of a sleek two-story building with an outdoor terrace that serves as the state party headquarters here. \u201cA lot of people perceive me as a Tammany Hall kind of guy,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I do have that personality. And it works. And I use it.\u201dFor the most part, the fight in California\u2019s Democratic Party is over tactics, style and personalities. But there are some differences over issues as well.The leader of the California State Assembly, Anthony Rendon, came under fire after he blocked a bill that would have created a state single-payer health care system. Mr. Rendon called the legislation, which had passed in the Senate, \u201cwoefully incomplete,\u201d saying it failed to account for how to finance a hugely expensive idea. His move was attacked by, among others, the powerful state nurses\u2019 union \u2014 and by Mr. Bauman, who called it an \u201cunambiguous disappointment.\u201dParty leaders have urged Ms. Ellis and her supporters to unite the party.\u201cIt\u2019s basically up to those who supported Kimberly: Do they want to help elect Democrats, move the state forward, or do they want to sit at home and suck their thumbs?\u201d said John L. Burton, the departing Democratic chairman in California, who did not endorse a successor. \u201cIt was a hard-fought election. She did better than anybody thought she would do. But she lost. I\u2019ve lost an election. It ain\u2019t fun. You\u2019ve got to get up and dust yourself off and start all over again.\u201dMs. Ellis rejected that argument as she pledged to continue her fight.\u201cOne of the false narratives that has been promoted is that if we don\u2019t unify that we are going to break the party,\u201d she said.Steve McMahon, a Democratic consultant who advised Howard Dean, the Vermont governor, when he ran for president in 2004, compared what is happening with Democrats in California to the Tea Party\u2019s emergence in heavily Republican districts in 2010.Mr. McMahon said these struggles would probably move the party to the left, with one immediate result: Democrats in places like California will come under increasing pressure to support single-payer health care, much the same way opposition to the Iraq war, a central issue for Mr. Dean, became a litmus test issue for Democrats in 2004.\u201cYou tend to see these kinds of things first in areas where there is single-party dominance,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to start seeing this in other parts of the country in Democratic primaries \u2014 typically in districts where there is not an effective voice on the right. There will be those left-further left primaries in those districts where the further-left nominee will win.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the Democratic Party in California misidentified the presidential candidate that Kimberly Ellis, a Bay Area activist, supported in the presidential primary last year. She backed Hillary Clinton, not Senator Bernie Sanders. The article also referred incorrectly to Ms. Ellis\u2019s association with Emerge California. She is a former executive director, not the current one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P. Morgan) and $275 (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).As for other large multinationals and the broader market indexes, Mr. Arone sees no immediate threat to further gains. None of the warning signs he looks for \u2014 more-frequent market corrections, higher interest rates and widening credit spreads \u2014 have yet materialized. \u201cNone is flashing red,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even yellow.\u201d While conceding the bull market \u201cis getting long in the tooth,\u201d he said, \u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gonz\u00e1lez Laporte, the chairman of Kimberly-Clark de Mexico for decades.In an interview scheduled for broadcast on Thursday night, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he did not have a clear recollection of the details of the meeting, but he recalled that the subject of corruption was discussed. He said he had urged the attendees to talk about the positive achievements of the administration.\u201cI said to them, \u2018Don\u2019t be shy in defending the good things we have accomplished,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLet\u2019s speak more of the good and work on where we are lacking. One of those things is the issue of corruption.\u201dPressed by the interviewer whether he had singled out any attendees in particular, he said no, according to an excerpt of the interview posted on Twitter early Thursday by the news division of the broadcaster, Televisa.\u201cNo one in particular,\u201d he replied. \u201cNo complaints or denunciations or lamenting or anything. We were discussing these issues in an open dialogue, very casual from what I remember and, well, there will be many witnesses to this meeting.\u201dThe government has denied any involvement in the spying and has launched an investigation to determine who was responsible for the campaign.One of the targets of the espionage was Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son, Claudio Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., who currently runs an investigative news group that, among other work, has exposed contract rigging by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s allies.In the face of the president\u2019s denials, Carlos Loret de Mola, one of Mexico\u2019s best-known journalists, published a column on Thursday in which he said his own sources had reaffirmed the account in The Times.Mr. Loret de Mola, who is known for his deep sourcing in the government, reported that the president had singled out Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Sr. during the private meeting with business leaders in May.Mr. Loret de Mola added that the president also criticized another leading anti-corruption activist who has received financial support from one of the other attendees.According to Mr. Loret de Mola\u2019s account, the attendees were asked to surrender their cellphones before entering the meeting room.

(Mr. de Blasio is an enthusiastic Red Sox fan.)The threshold to prove need is low. Mr. de Blasio had to show only that the candidates he is facing had appeared in the local news media at least 12 times or had received significant endorsements.

The White House has worked assiduously to cultivate more support from advocacy groups and their donors ahead of a push to overhaul the tax code. Their support could be even more critical if businesses and trade groups, which might otherwise support tax reform, hold back out of concern of affiliating with Mr. Trump.Jo Becker contributed from New York.Advertisement"}

Elliott, the largest creditor in one of the company\u2019s main impaired classes of debt, had said it would reject Berkshire\u2019s deal.The hedge fund\u2019s opposition created an opening for Sempra, albeit one that forced a proposal to beat the judge. Sempra, which owns an electricity provider and transmission utility in California and assets in South America, has checked boxes that other bidders have not. It looks, for example, to be providing an independent board structure that NextEra, a previous Oncor bidder, would not agree to. And it appears to have Elliott\u2019s blessing, which ought to make the regulatory and bankruptcy process more manageable than previous bidders faced.That Sempra has agreed to terms other bidders balked at should make its shareholders pause though. For one, it\u2019s short on cash and making other large investments in the Gulf region. Its debt is already at a punchy 5.4 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 or Ebitda \u2014 over the last 12 months, yet Sempra will have to borrow more money to help finance its offer for Energy Future.In addition, the buyer is having to rely on at least one third party to come up with some of the equity financing. That will leave Sempra owning less than half of Oncor.The target ought, at least, to throw off steady, if not growing, cash flow to service the debt. Converting any of that into increased dividends will be hard: Oncor will have an independent board \u2013 and regulators tend to regard generous dividends with suspicion. Such terms may eventually give shareholders a nasty shock.Advertisement"}

Some observers say that they also pay bribes to the security forces, which then allow them to do their work unmolested.Gang-related violence is not uncommon in towns like Ozubulu, where drug cartels are active; one even occurred recently during the funeral of a reputed gang member who had died in South Africa.The governor, Mr. Obiano, declared Monday a day of mourning, and in the afternoon, Bishop Okeke celebrated Mass in honor of the victims.The church killings have produced an outpouring of denunciations across the country.\u201cWhatever may have been the situation, this attack represents a descent into the pit of hell,\u201d the Nigerian Labour Congress said in a statement from Abuja, the capital. \u201cIt is animalistic, cowardly and shameful.\u201dHowever, others said that religious leaders needed to do more to make clear that they shun violence, even if it meant declining donations if they were not certain of the source of the money.Some religious leaders \u201cworship money irrespective of where it comes from and have now become part of the alliance of evil,\u201d said Adeola Soetan, an activist.Bishop Okeke did not respond to messages requesting comment about Mr. Ikegwuonu and his role in financing the construction of the church.The Rev. Hyginus Aghaulo, director of communications for the Diocese of Nnewi, said in a statement: \u201cThe prophetic church\u2019s mandate compels her to love the sinner and hate his evil ways. The church does not say: You are already in hell and have nothing to do with us. No, she uses every available opportunity to continue to call sinners to repentance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Audi Engineer Implicates Superiors in Diesel Case, Lawyer Says", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A cloud of suspicion hanging over Volkswagen thickened on Monday after a lawyer for a jailed former engineer said his client implicated top managers of the German carmaker\u2019s Audi luxury brand in a continuing diesel cheating scandal.The steady drip of revelations shows how difficult it has been for Volkswagen to move beyond the emissions scandal, nearly two years after it first became public. On the contrary, the scandal has only widened.Volkswagen, which has admitted to outfitting its diesels in the United States with software to evade emissions rules, has paid out tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements over the deception, and several executives have been arrested. Now, its operations in Europe are coming under greater scrutiny, as prosecutors attempt to pressure lower-level employees, like Mr. Pamio, to testify against their superiors.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Mr. Pamio has told prosecutors in Munich that top Audi managers were aware as early as 2006 that vehicles made by the division could not meet American and European emissions standards, according to Walter Lechner, a defense attorney for the former Audi engineer. The cars could not carry an adequate supply of a urea solution known as AdBlue used to neutralize harmful tailpipe fumes.Like its parent company, Audi solved the problem of faulty pollution equipment by deploying software that fooled regulators. The cars were programmed to deliver low emissions during conditions that matched those used during compliance tests. At other times, Volkswagen has admitted in court, the cars polluted far more than allowed.Prosecutors have interviewed Mr. Pamio 10 times, Mr. Lechner said, and will speak to him again later this week. Mr. Pamio has also provided investigators with emails and other documents to substantiate his verbal testimony, according to the defense attorney. In addition, Mr. Pamio has spoken to United States investigators, Mr. Lechner said.Spokesmen for Audi and Volkswagen said on Monday that they could not comment on a continuing investigation.Mr. Pamio has been held in a Munich jail since July at the request of American investigators, who are expected to file a formal request for extradition in the coming days. Mr. Pamio is at least the third former Volkswagen employee to cooperate with investigators, a number that is likely to rise.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. Lechner, the defense attorney, declined to say which managers Mr. Pamio implicated. The testimony covers a period beginning in 2006, when Martin Winterkorn was chief executive of Audi and chairman of the unit\u2019s management board. A year later, he became chief executive of Volkswagen, and was replaced by Rupert Stadler, who had previously been the Audi board member responsible for finance.Mr. Winterkorn resigned in September 2015 after the emissions cheating scandal came to light, but Mr. Stadler has remained in his post as chief executive of Audi. Mr. Stadler, who is also a member of the Volkswagen management board, is not officially considered a suspect, said Karin Jung, a spokeswoman for the Munich state attorney\u2019s office.A lawyer for Mr. Winterkorn did not reply to a request for comment.Current members of Volkswagen\u2019s leadership also have ties to Audi during the time period covered by Mr. Pamio\u2019s testimony. Matthias M\u00fcller, who replaced Mr. Winterkorn as chief executive of Volkswagen, was head of product management at Audi until 2007, when he assumed the same position at the Volkswagen brand. Mr. M\u00fcller has said he had no knowledge of the illegal software.German prosecutors are investigating about 40 people. The vast majority are German citizens who according to German law cannot be extradited to the United States. As a citizen of Italy living in Germany, Mr. Pamio does not enjoy the same protections.Mr. Lechner said Mr. Pamio was suffering in jail and being treated unfairly by authorities simply because he is Italian.\u201cHe is the only one who has cooperated fully,\u201d the lawyer said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Europe Sours on Diesel, Germany Fights to Save It", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Britain and France want to end the sale of diesel cars. Madrid and Athens are banning them entirely. Automakers like Volvo are switching to electric engines.In Germany, those developments have created something akin to a national emergency, threatening an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people.As others have increased investment in electric cars and pushed tougher rules threatening diesel, though, German auto executives and political leaders meeting in Berlin on Wednesday appeared determined to rescue the technology.After a largely stage-managed meeting \u2014 described as a \u201cdiesel summit\u201d \u2014 they announced plans to update the software in 5 million cars to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, the byproduct of diesel most harmful to human health.The German manufacturers also said they would contribute to a fund worth 500 million euros, or $590 million, to finance measures to reduce urban pollution, for example by modernizing bus fleets or building bike paths.Most of the software upgrades had already been announced by the German manufacturers, while politicians and automotive executives alike rejected calls by environmental groups to force carmakers to add antipollution hardware like better catalytic converters. And they were unanimous in opposing plans by some cities to ban diesels from downtown areas.\u201cThe government\u2019s chumminess with the auto industry continues,\u201d Oliver Krischer, a leader of the opposition Green Party, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWhile China, California, Norway and many others are tackling electromobility, the government is turning Germany into a diesel museum.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In fact, as far as auto industry leaders were concerned on Wednesday, diesel remained central to their ambitions.\u201cFuture mobility will definitely depend on state-of-the-art diesels as well,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, the chief executive of BMW, said in a statement. The carmaker said it would offer a bonus of up to \u20ac2,000 to anyone who traded in an older diesel vehicle for a new BMW electric or hybrid car \u2014 or a diesel that met the latest emissions standards. Volkswagen and other carmakers said they would offer similar incentives.Wednesday\u2019s meeting between ministers, state leaders and car company chiefs was an attempt to contain a crisis of confidence that threatens Germany\u2019s most important industry, and perhaps even its national identity, ahead of elections next month.Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW confront growing public outrage domestically and overseas for underplaying the health effects of diesel fumes and, in at least some cases, misleading customers about how much harmful nitrogen oxides their cars produce in everyday use.Leaders of both major political parties, meanwhile, face criticism that they have been too cozy with carmakers, blocking stricter European Union regulation of diesel emissions while providing tax breaks on diesel fuel.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under particular pressure ahead of the election on Sept. 24, in which she is seeking a fourth term in office. She has a long record of advocating for the auto industry, once even complaining about California\u2019s strict limits on vehicle emissions while visiting the state\u2019s governor at the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger.Despite the announcements, there were hints of conflict among the participants at Wednesday\u2019s meeting.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Horst Seehofer, prime minister of the state of Bavaria, called for the government to provide financial incentives for Germans to trade in old vehicles. But Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, blamed automakers for the diesel crisis and said they should not expect government help.Foreign manufacturers, including Ford of Europe, which is based in Cologne, drew sharp criticism Wednesday after they declined to participate in the \u20ac500 million fund to improve urban air quality. Ford said it would take other measures to reduce emissions, including incentives for people to trade in older cars.Vehicles are Germany\u2019s single most important export product and, in many parts of the world, the most visible symbol of German engineering prowess. Within the country, BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes and Porsches are a source of considerable pride and an essential part of the postwar national self-image.Diesels are particularly important to German carmakers, and the technology has a long history here \u2014 Rudolf Diesel, a German, invented the diesel engine. Because of diesel\u2019s superior fuel economy today, it is a popular option with buyers of the large luxury cars that are profit centers for the industry. Until recently, Diesels outsold gasoline cars in Europe, thanks in part to de facto subsidies.Last week, a lower court judge in Stuttgart ruled that a ban on diesels in the city center was the only way to address nitrogen oxide pollution that frequently exceeded levels considered acceptable. If affirmed on appeal, the decision could pave the way for widespread diesel bans.Moves like those have left many diesel owners fearing that the resale value of their vehicles will plummet.In the United States and Canada, lawyers have filed suits claiming that collusion among the automakers did harm to buyers of German cars.Among owners and environmental activists there is considerable skepticism about whether software fixes alone will make much difference. There is growing pressure for carmakers to retrofit cars with better antipollution hardware, which would be extremely costly.Auto executives rejected that option Wednesday. \u201cWe consider it out of the question to carry out hardware retrofitting,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said during a news conference. \u201cIt is questionable what the result would be.\u201d\u201cI would like my engineers to be working on future-oriented technologies,\u201d he said, \u201cnot working on motors that are 10 or 15 years old.\u201dIn a sign of the public anger that the issue has generated, dozens of protesters gathered early Wednesday outside the Transport Ministry, where the summit took place. Activists from the environmental charity Greenpeace hung a banner across the facade of the ministry proclaiming \u201cWelcome to Fort NOX,\u201d a play on the abbreviation for the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

Instead of a lease, he had a handshake agreement with his landlady and later, after she died, with her children. His starting rent was just over $600 a month.Mr. Bodley, 52, and thrifty to a fault, had been saving his whole life. \u201cNo wife, no kids, no pets, no plants, no mortgage,\u201d he said. But now, he finally had reason to buy a home. \u201cFor the money I would put into a rental,\u201d he said, \u201cI could do the same or better by putting it into a mortgage.\u201dLast fall, he contacted Adam Fischel, a salesman at Citi Habitats and a fellow musician, a drummer.Mr. Bodley and Ms. McBride wanted a two-bedroom co-op so each could work and practice at home, within commuting distance of Times Square, where Ms. McBride, 36, works as a Broadway pianist and music director. The budget was something under $400,000.\u201cWe had a wish list,\u201d Mr. Bodley said. It included an elevator and a balcony. \u201cBut this stuff wasn\u2019t practical or available. The wish list went out the window as soon as we got into the nuts and bolts of it all. There\u2019s a finite number of properties that fit that budget.\u201d A second bedroom was the first thing to go.As a self-employed musician, Mr. Bodley was concerned about securing approval from a co-op board. \u201cThere is a prejudice against us crazy, longhaired types,\u201d he said. Musicians, he said, are also often perceived as undesirable noisemakers, though he practices on an electric bass and Ms. McBride on an electronic keyboard, both virtually silent, thanks to headphones.The couple began the hunt in Jackson Heights, Queens, where prices were reasonable. They saw similar co-op units in similar buildings, primarily brick buildings of medium size.They liked a large one-bedroom with 900 square feet, on the ground floor of Hampshire House on 79th Street, a 1939 elevator building. The price was around $370,000, with monthly maintenance of just over $700. It felt charming and palatial.But another buyer had gotten there first, and the seller went with that party\u2019s cash offer, Mr. Fischel said.They went to see another apartment at Plymouth Court, a 1917 building a few blocks away on 82nd Street. This one had a railroad layout covering 800 square feet and was on the third floor of a walk-up. \u201cThe third-floor walk-up thing is what we had in Williamsburg, although I do have to carry a bass and an amplifier up, so not having stairs would be nice,\u201d Mr. Bodley said.The price was $330,000, with maintenance in the high $400s. \u201cThey were calling it a two-bedroom, but you would have had to construct some walls and doors,\u201d Mr. Bodley said. His offer of the asking price was accepted.Unsure that they would clear the co-op board, the couple had been checking out Forest Hills, slightly farther into Queens.\u201cForest Hills is not hip at all,\u201d Mr. Bodley said. \u201cForest Hills is people who were born here. The hipsters in Williamsburg seemed to come from somewhere else.\u201dThere, they found another ground-floor apartment, a charming 950-square-foot one-bedroom, in a 1940 building. \u201cIt had this sunken living room and this built-in bookcase in the wall, the kind of features that don\u2019t seem to be prevalent in newer construction,\u201d Mr. Bodley said.The place was a sponsor unit, sold by an original investor and requiring no co-op board approval. The price was $368,500, with maintenance in the low $700s.\u201cI had to explain what a sponsor unit was,\u201d Mr. Fischel said. \u201cI said, as long as you can get the financing, you\u2019re good to go. He had no debt, and he did it all playing the bass.\u201dSo Mr. Bodley went with the Forest Hills sponsor unit, preferring to skip the risk of being rejected by a co-op board.The couple arrived in the spring. \u201cI realize that I\u2019d been living in squalor before this,\u201d Mr. Bodley said. His old place had not been painted since he moved in. The new place was immaculate. He decorated with his 18 guitars and his acoustic bass violin. His skull collection fills the built-in bookcase.\u201cWe weren\u2019t living in squalor before,\u201d Ms. McBride said, \u201cbut if you live in an apartment that long, you have a lot of things.

An independent candidate, Bo Dietl, began some television advertising in July.\u201cPeople are away or not in front of their TV, so it\u2019s logical that with limited resources he would wait until after Labor Day to go up on the air,\u201d Jessica Proud, a Republican political consultant, said of the mayor.For Mr. de Blasio, one of the biggest challenges of his primary may be a lack of enthusiasm in the race and low voter turnout. Thus far, his campaign strategy has been to mobilize the mayor\u2019s supporters through a fund-raising effort aimed at small contributions with repeated email requests for donations of as little as $3. The theory is that small-dollar contributions create a connection, making the donor more likely to actually go to the polls and vote. The campaign has also organized groups around the city and amassed endorsements from labor groups and elected officials.Before the advertising began, the mayor\u2019s campaign had spent $2.5 million on those efforts, including 25 full-time staff members and consultants that work with them, as of the last campaign filing. A new filing is expected on Friday; the mayor can spend as much as $6.9 million in the primary.\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to invest in organizing,\u201d said Rick Fromberg, the campaign manager for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election. He said other ads could appear but would not describe the potential subjects under consideration.Bradley Tusk, a former campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who at one point publicly sought a candidate to run against Mr. de Blasio, questioned whether the mayor\u2019s campaign wanted turnout beyond his base of labor unions and the city\u2019s more liberal circles. \u201cIf you\u2019re going on TV for just the final week or two, it\u2019s clear you have no interest in seeing turnout rise beyond what you know you can control,\u201d he said.Mr. Fromberg disputed the idea that the campaign would not want to target the widest number of voters.\u201cIf that was our strategy, we wouldn\u2019t make this ad very broadly seen and remind people to vote on Sept. 12,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Odd plot twists. Tit-for-tat accusations. One candidate calling another \u201ccrooked.\u201dThose political phenomena, familiar to voters in the United States and Europe, have surfaced in Kenya ahead of a tightly contested presidential election on Tuesday. But in a country with a history of election violence, the addition of such toxic behavior has further fanned fears about whether the country can pull off a credible and peaceful vote.In the latest development, just two days before Election Day, the main opposition coalition, the National Super Alliance, accused Mr. Kenyatta of ordering an armed raid on one of its tallying centers. The accusation was reported by some media outlets but dismissed by others as false.\u201cThere is an ecosystem of fake news around this election,\u201d said Alphonce Shiundu, editor of Africa Check, a fact-checking organization. \u201cKenyans really don\u2019t know what the truth is.\u201d\u201cThis makes me worried,\u201d Mr. Shiundu said.\u201cAfter what happened in 2007, no one wants the same,\u201d said Vanity Kosgi, 37, a politician in Eldoret. \u201cPeople learn.\u201dAlfred Agisu, 35, the leader of a scraggly troupe of young drummers in Eldoret, urged residents not to succumb to violence. \u201cWe make music to preach peace,\u201d Mr. Agisu said.Facing no limits on campaign financing, politicians have spared no expense. They have showered voters with money and even hired helicopters for their campaigns. The common belief is that once voted in, lawmakers, whose official salaries are 25 times higher than those of average Kenyans, will redistribute some of that wealth to their supporters.Eldoret, for example, is a stronghold of Vice President William Ruto. It has some of the best roads in Kenya. Its city center is a hive of businesses and hotels. There is little garbage on the streets. Outside town, lush cornfields and banana forests stretch as far as the eye can see. (Mr. Ruto\u2019s country estate, which was breached by an unknown assailant who was later shot dead by members of the security forces, has a well-manicured garden decorated with pink bougainvillea.)If the election is transparent and credible, it will send a powerful message to Kenya\u2019s neighbors, where longtime leaders are holding on to power, as is the case in Ethiopia, Uganda and Rwanda, or have taken a despotic turn, as in Tanzania.President Kenyatta, 55, who leads the Jubilee Party, will face off against Mr. Odinga, 72, a former prime minister who leads the National Super Alliance. Both men are wealthy scions of post-independence leaders, and their families have largely dominated Kenyan politics for decades.Mr. Odinga, who is running for a fourth time, says he was robbed of victory in the previous two contests. In 2013, Mr. Kenyatta won by a tiny margin, prompting Mr. Odinga to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate the election. Mr. Odinga is now rousing supporters by warning that this year\u2019s election could also be stolen, which critics say is an incitement to violence.Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga were virtually tied in recent polls, but neither is drawing more than 50 percent. They are running on similar platforms \u2014 economic development \u2014 and have mostly appealed to voters based on ethnic affiliation.The Kikuyus and Kalenjins, who make up a large chunk of Kenya\u2019s population, are mainly supporting Mr. Kenyatta. The Luos, Luhyas, Kambas and other smaller ethnic groups are backing Mr. Odinga.For most Kenyans, unemployment and the high cost of living are the dominant issues, intertwined with deep-rooted ethnic allegiances, which were entrenched under Britain\u2019s colonial rulers, who pursued a policy of divide and rule.Although the economy has been growing at an annual rate of 5 percent in recent years, inflation, partly caused by drought, is whittling away at Kenya\u2019s fragile middle class and creating a vast underclass. Many Kenyans cannot afford to buy staple foods or pay school fees. Electricity and water shortages are common. Youth unemployment is high.\u201cWhat do you want us to do, steal?\u201d asked Vincent Losano, an unemployed man in Eldoret. \u201cWe need jobs.\u201dKenyans, still smarting from past violence, are hopeful that this year will be different. One reason is that the two ethnic groups that fought each other in 2007 and 2008 \u2014 the Kikuyus and the Kalenjins \u2014 are now in the same camp. (President Kenyatta is a Kikuyu; his running mate, Mr. Ruto, is a Kalenjin.)Many Kenyans interviewed for this article also expressed optimism that, despite the gruesome murder of the election official, the vote would be fair and credible \u2014 as long as the technology did not fail. Kenya will be using biometric technology to identify voters and transmit results electronically, which should diminish the chances of fraud.In June, KPMG, the auditing firm enlisted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, recommended that more than 92,000 dead voters be removed from the registration rolls.Before his death, the election official, Christopher Msando, reassured the public that the collection and tallying of votes was watertight. The commission, he said, had invested in satellite technology in case phone networks failed, as well as backups. It even ordered, for each of the country\u2019s 40,883 polling stations, more technology kits than necessary to identify voters and transmit the results.There are other reasons for optimism. \u201cA lot of work has gone into institutions, at the grass-roots level,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, who leads the European Union\u2019s Election Observation Mission. \u201cYou have a new Constitution, and that has put in place checks and balances. These are the kind of steps that have been meaningful compared to even five years ago.\u201dCandidates who are not affiliated with any party or driven by ethnic interests have also started to emerge.Boniface Mwangi, 34, a photojournalist and activist who gained prominence for his work documenting electoral violence a decade ago, formed a party and has become popular on social media sites. He is the leading candidate for a seat in Parliament representing Starehe, a constituency in Nairobi.Mr. Mwangi said voting habits were starting to change, especially among young people, who make up more than half the electorate and who, he said, \u201care tired of party and tribal politics.\u201d He said that by the next election, in 2022, he expected the dominance of the two political families to have diminished.Kenyans, he said, are beginning to pay more attention to economic issues than to ethnic and party loyalties. \u201cWhen they get even more broke they will start to look at actual ideas,\u201d he said.Mr. Mwangi said that a decade ago, when he traveled around Kenya taking photographs of the violence, he was struck by haunting images of \u201cthe poor killing the poor.\u201d\u201cThe poor should be smarter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t die for Boniface Mwangi. They shouldn\u2019t die for Raila Odinga. They shouldn\u2019t die for Uhuru Kenyatta.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alarming Levels of Sexual Violence Found on Australian Campuses, Report Says", "Date": "2017-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 A long-awaited national survey on sexual assault and harassment at Australian universities \u2014 the first of its kind in the country \u2014 has revealed that young women are experiencing what victims\u2019 advocates describe as \u201cshocking levels\u201d of sexual violence on campuses across this country, prompting a range of new measures by officials to tackle the problem.\u201cWe are sorry that this happened to you. Sexual assault is a crime,\u201d said Margaret Gardner, the chairwoman of Universities Australia, an association of the country\u2019s universities, which helped finance the survey. \u201cThrough your stories you call on us and on every fellow student and member of staff to do more to prevent others from ever experiencing the damage,\u201d she said.\u201cWe cannot take away the pain that you have felt and that you feel,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we acknowledge it and we can respond to that pain with compassion and care.\u201dThe report had been widely anticipated, and its release will no doubt intensify Australia\u2019s national conversation about the prevalence of sexual violence and its impact. The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 30,000 students at 39 Australian universities, map the full extent of the problem and largely confirm the accusations of victims and advocates who have been arguing for years that Australian universities have underestimated the severity of the sexual harassment and assault, and failed to adequately respond with support for victims and punishment for perpetrators.\u201cThis report marks a huge milestone,\u201d Kate Jenkins, Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, said at a news conference. \u201cFor decades, university students and survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment have advocated for change. We have all heard stories of these behaviors occurring on campus. Today, we have the first statistically significant, national data on the scale and nature of this problem at Australia\u2019s universities.\u201dAfter the release of the report, the commission and Universities Australia made several recommendations regarding prevention, the response to accusations and specialized training for staff members.The report showed that students often do not disclose sexual assaults to the police, university administrations or other formal reporting bodies, instead confiding in friends, tutors or lecturers, advocates say. But these people are rarely trained to respond to such disclosures, prompting a new set of recommendations to provide them with specialized training.\u201cWe know that the way a disclosure of sexual assault is handled in the very first instance can make all the difference to the recovery of the victim or survivor,\u201d said Belinda Robinson, the chief executive of Universities Australia.But the problems go beyond just the official response, to deeply ingrained behaviors reflecting what experts have long described as a culture of hypermasculinity and privilege. The report found, for example, that bisexual students, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and students with a disability were all more likely to be harassed and assaulted than other students.The report also found that it was not just victims who did not report the episodes; bystanders also stayed silent.\u201cThe most common reasons bystanders did not take any action were that they did not think it was serious enough to intervene or that they did not know what to do,\u201d the report said.More results from the survey are expected to trickle out over the next day as news outlets work to compile and compare statistics from universities, which will publicly release data on rates of sexual assault and harassment at their institutions.Nina Funnell, a victims\u2019 advocate, said the commission\u2019s findings did not come as a surprise to advocacy groups.\u201cWhat the report shows is as expected: Young women in Australia are experiencing shocking levels of sexual violence within universities,\u201d Ms. Funnell said. \u201cIn the majority of cases, the perpetrators are known to them, and those who live in residential facilities are more likely to experience and are more at risk of experiencing sexual assault than those who are day students.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that these have been the prevailing trends,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, now we have the data to back up our assertions.\u201dIn the days leading up to the report\u2019s release, victims of sexual assault and harassment from around the country stood outside their universities holding signs detailing how they thought their institutions had failed them.Some of the signs also offered support for victims.Many female students said they feared that in the coming weeks, their voices could be drowned out by university leaders working to protect their institutions\u2019 reputations.\u201cHere\u2019s what the University of Adelaide\u2019s response to my rape cost me,\u201d Matilda Duncan\u2019s sign read. \u201cMy degree, the chance to graduate. My career. My education. My health and happiness. Friends, trust, confidence, curiosity and hope.\u201d Ms. Duncan submitted a complaint to the commission about an accusation that she said forced her to drop out of the university.The photo campaign, splashed across the pages of major news outlets in Australia, was organized by End Rape on Campus Australia and modeled on Project Unbreakable, an American photo campaign in which victims of sexual assault held placards of what their perpetrators said to them following an assault.\u201cBehind every one of those statistics there is a real person who has experienced that violence,\u201d said Ms. Funnell, who led the campaign. \u201cWe did the campaign to put a human face on the issue so that the voices and experiences of students and survivors are not lost in the data.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major Rental-Home Companies Set to Merge as U.S. House Prices Recover", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the housing market collapsed more than a decade ago, new investors poured in to buy foreclosed homes and rent them out. Now, a $4.3 billion deal suggests that the bargain-hunting binge in housing is finally over.Two of the biggest institutional single-family landlords in the United States said Thursday that they planned to merge, an indication that the housing market has recovered much of the ground it lost in the financial crisis. And as home prices rise in many areas, affordable housing, for deep-pocketed investors and young first-time buyers alike, is becoming harder to find.The two institutional landlords, Invitation Homes, a rental business spun out of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group, and Starwood Waypoint Homes said they would combine to create an entity with about 82,000 homes in more than a dozen big markets.The deal could set the stage for other institutional investors to join forces. With fewer opportunities to buy homes at a discount, the keys to growth will be reducing operating costs, gaining market share and potentially increasing rent.With consolidation, Wall Street-backed firms\u2019 once-bold strategy of cleaning up the mess created by the crisis by going to foreclosure auctions and snapping up hundreds of cheap homes has ended.Wall Street jumped into foreclosed homes reckoning that there would be a fundamental shift in housing, with millions of people losing their houses and becoming renters \u2014 at least until they could repair their credit scores.On the eve of the crisis, the rate of homeownership \u2014 the percentage of households that own a home \u2014 hovered around 69 percent. Today, it is 63.7 percent, according to the United States Census Bureau. And last year, the number of new renters again outpaced the number of new homeowners, according to Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.But the economics of buying recently foreclosed homes to rent out have become more challenging for Wall Street firms that seek to generate double-digit returns for investors, and for publicly traded real estate investment trusts that promise shareholders hefty quarterly dividends.For the past year or so, many institutional investors have had to compete with potential homeowners shopping for foreclosed homes posted for sale on multiple listing services.\u201cAs home prices rise, most of the institutional investors are dramatically slowing the rate at which they buy new homes,\u201d said Laurie Goodman, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Housing Finance Policy Center. \u201cAnd with the easy money days behind them, they need a more efficient cost structure.\u201d She said the merger was a way accomplish that by gaining further economies of scale.Blackstone was one of the first private equity firms to begin buying foreclosed homes in the wake of the financial crisis, fixing them up and renting them out. The firm, which began buying homes in earnest in 2011, is estimated to have spent $10 billion on its foreclosed-home-to-rental bet.Invitation Homes, which emerged from that push with almost 50,000 homes, is a company that Blackstone built from scratch.Purchases by Invitation Homes have dropped sharply since 2013, when it was buying hundreds of homes each week. Its acquisitions are down more than 90 percent from then, and the period of \u201chyper growth\u201d for the industry has passed, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.In all, institutional investors have bought an estimated 200,000 single-family homes to operate as rentals.But that is a fraction of the overall number of rental homes in the United States. According to housing industry estimates, there are as many as 17 million single-family rentals across the country, most owned by mom-and-pop landlords or firms operating fewer than 100 such homes.Before the crisis, there were about 10 million rental homes, an indication of how many homeowners were displaced by the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression.Consolidation among institutional investors began three years ago with American Homes 4 Rent, which owns 49,000 rental homes, buying Beazer Pre-Owned Rental Homes. A few months later, Starwood Waypoint bought Colony American Homes in an all-stock deal that valued Colony American at $1.5 billion. Most of the mergers since then have been small, and the deal between Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint would be the biggest in an industry that did not exist a decade ago.The move by institutional investors into the housing market has been credited by some with helping to stabilize the sharp and steady decline in home prices early in the financial crisis. The presence of private equity firms and hedge funds in the market also helped attract the interest of smaller investors.But big firms like Invitation Homes and American Homes have drawn criticism from housing advocates for renting their homes at prices that are unaffordable for the working poor.Few renters with federal rent subsidies known as Section 8 live in homes owned by Invitation Homes and other institutional investors. That is partly because such investors have tended to operate in largely suburban communities and have avoided buying homes in urban areas.In the past, Blackstone has said that 72 percent of houses owned by Invitation Homes have monthly rents within federal affordability guidelines for the markets where it operates.This year, housing advocates and some legislators criticized Fannie Mae, one of two government-controlled mortgage finance giants, for agreeing to guarantee a $1 billion financing deal for Invitation Homes without getting any assurances that the company would do more to provide affordable housing.Kevin Stein, a lawyer and deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a group that supports the rights of tenants and homeowners, said he was concerned that the merger of Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint would increase their power to raise rents.\u201cWhat is the level of concentration? This is a concern to our members,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cThere are so many communities in California where people are being driven out because of housing costs, and this is part of the dynamic.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal announced on Thursday, each Starwood Waypoint share will be converted into 1.614 Invitation Homes shares. The total enterprise value of the combined company, including debt, would be $20 billion, the companies said.Invitation Homes\u2019 shareholders will own roughly 59 percent of the combined company\u2019s stock, while Starwood Waypoint\u2019s investors will own the rest.Blackstone, which took Invitation Homes public in January in an offering that raised $1.7 billion in net proceeds, would continue to have a stake in the combined company.After the merger, which is subject to the approval of shareholders, is completed, John Bartling, Invitation Homes\u2019 chief executive, will step down. Fred Tuomi, the current chief executive of Starwood Waypoint, will be the chief executive of the combined company.The new company\u2019s 11-member board will include six members of the Invitation Homes board, including the chairman, Bryce Blair, who will be chairman of the new company\u2019s board. Jonathan D. Gray, head of global real estate for Blackstone and an architect of its single-family rental trade, also will be on the board.The combined company will operate as Invitation Homes and trade under the Invitation Homes ticker symbol.On a day when a nervous stock market declined, shares of both Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint surged. Invitation Homes\u2019 shares gained 3.91 percent; Starwood Waypoint\u2019s shares rose 5.15 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Slaughter of Children in Yemen", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Saudi-led coalition waging a bombing campaign in Yemen has once again been named in a United Nations draft report as the major culprit in the deaths and injuries of children in that war-ravaged Arab state. The Saudis are already said to be privately campaigning to change the report and keep its coalition off the list of armies that kill and maim children. Last year they succeeded. That should not be allowed to happen again.Last year, threatened with inclusion on the United Nations blacklist of forces that harm children, Saudi Arabia threatened to withhold financing from major humanitarian operations, and Ban Ki-moon, then secretary general, reluctantly struck the coalition off the list. But he made the episode public, effectively acknowledging that the coalition (which includes Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates) did belong on the list.The civil war, which ostensibly pits the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi against Houthi rebels, is a tangle of religious and tribal rivalries, in which no side is innocent of atrocities. Saudi Arabia\u2019s main motive for joining the fighting was to prop up a Sunni government against what it saw as an Iran-backed assault by Shiite rebels.But the war is at a stalemate, and the Saudi coalition \u2014 and its American enablers, who provide military equipment, aerial refueling and targeting \u2014 simply cannot be allowed to continue killing civilians and destroying what little is left of Yemen. That is why it is imperative to publicly identify the unconscionable slaughter of innocents for what it is, and to hope that this will shame Saudi Arabia and its American backers to search for a humane end to Yemen\u2019s hell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even on Break, a Congress Weary of Trump Gets No Respite From Him", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Washington needs a vacation from itself.\u201cDoing nothing is exhausting,\u201d said Jason Chaffetz, the former Republican congressman from Utah, whose head start began with a surprise resignation in June.Yet for those who remain in Congress \u2014 and across the city\u2019s motley roster of aides, journalists, consultants and lobbyists \u2014 the collective exhaling over this August recess has been complicated, as ever, by President Trump.No commander in chief in recent memory has rendered elected officials more vacation-ready. Nor has any exacted a greater psychic toll on them once they got away.The result has been a recess on edge, with daily prayers to the swamp gods that the president refrain from any sudden movements that would upset the hard-won quiet.\u201cUnder this presidency, every hour feels like a day. Every day feels like a week. Every week feels like a month,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York. \u201cBoth the American people and the Congress do need a mental health break.\u201dIt has indeed been a particularly long seven-twelfths of a year, by any measure except math. Tweets have been tweeted. Resisters are resisting. Bills have rarely become laws, but the journey has been taxing.Of course, the first rule of Washington vacation is that it must not be labeled a vacation.\u201cMeetings and calls!\u201d Mr. Trump posted on Twitter from his club in Bedminster, N.J., over the weekend, describing his getaway plans as he began a 17-day out-of-town residency. A social media spy soon spotted him in a golf cart.Among members of Congress, \u201cdistrict work period\u201d is the preferred euphemism, though many do spend much of their month visiting with constituents.Already, Mr. Trump has found ways to encroach.It is clear by now that Twitter cannot be left unmonitored. Even workaday cable news appearances run the risk of rousing the First Viewer, especially if adverse weather upends executive tee times in New Jersey.On Monday morning, with conditions soggy in Bedminster, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, spoke with CNN about investigations into Mr. Trump and his team.A short while later, an aide reached the senator with an update: The president was at it again.\u201cInteresting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. Before joining the Senate, Mr. Blumenthal made misleading remarks about having \u201cserved in Vietnam\u201d when in fact he served in a Marine Reserve unit in Washington. Mr. Trump himself received five deferments from the draft, including one for bad feet.Asked hours later how his recess was going, Mr. Blumenthal drew a long breath.\u201cWell,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s barely begun.\u201d He added that he was on the way to visit a veterans\u2019 health center.For Republicans, the break has delivered a different kind of angst after a failed health care repeal effort in the Senate. Most have chosen to avoid the types of raucous town hall settings that could provoke confrontations with voters.But at least they are home.Initially, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said that the chamber would remain in session until midmonth. Mr. Trump himself had insisted that lawmakers stay in town until the health care impasse was resolved. (He also called out Mr. McConnell on Wednesday in a tweet expressing further disappointment in the repeal stumble.)By last Thursday, three days into August, bipartisan consensus reigned inside the Capitol in the case of Washington v. Anywhere Else.Sensing the prospect of mass exodus, lawmakers swiftly passed important legislation to finance the Food and Drug Administration, approved dozens of presidential nominees and set off on their \u201cstate work period.\u201dNo votes, no caucus meetings, no reporters lurking around every corner of their workplace.No shoes, no shirt, no problem.Except, well.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say that they shouldn\u2019t be there right now,\u201d said Jason Pye, the vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group, echoing a widespread view among activists angry with the output of a Republican-led Congress. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of sympathy there at all, especially on the Senate side.\u201dAt the same time, lawmakers have grown defensive, perhaps justifiably, at the suggestion that their time at home is not productive.Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, Democrat of Texas, said that while he was spending the recess campaigning to unseat Senator Ted Cruz next year, he would \u201cmuch rather be at work.\u201dRepresentative Dan Donovan, Republican of New York, said members were \u201cjust working in a different place.\u201dThose who have left this life behind seem disinclined to turn back.Mr. Chaffetz, who joined Fox News as a contributor upon leaving office, said he had quit in part because he grew weary of stalled progress on signature policies.\u201cI didn\u2019t leave because I got tired of winning,\u201d he said, though not before detailing his post-congressional ventures: \u201cI\u2019ve been to Hawaii, going to Africa, reintroduced myself to my family. It\u2019s been great.\u201dHe will not be there in September, when the tussles over tax policy boil over, when the debt ceiling deadline is nigh. He will probably not miss it.Instantly, staff members strained to catch up, hustling in their home offices. Statements were prepared in their bosses\u2019 names. The city stirred, grudgingly.Washington had not been sleeping. It was just resting its eyes. And it was time, like it or not, for meetings and calls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Linking Public Works to Local Hiring Faces a Trump Challenge", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is a classic win-win for Chicago,\u201d Mayor Rahm Emanuel said last year when he announced the contract and the 170 jobs that the factory would create, in addition to training programs and community hiring.Now the Trump administration may rescind an Obama-era initiative that allows hiring preferences on transportation and construction projects in states like New York, California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, a prospect that has alarmed advocates of such programs.Jobs to Move America was one of several groups that spent years working with transportation officials in the Obama administration on a pilot project to test whether local hiring preferences reduced competition or drove up prices. In January, days before President Trump was sworn in, the Transportation Department extended the experiment, taking place in more than a dozen cities, for five years so that research could be completed.The agency\u2019s move troubled officials both within and outside the affected cities.Cleveland, which is not a part of the pilot project, has been fighting for its own local hiring ordinance in the courts, Washington or the Statehouse since it was first adopted in 2003.Citing federal restrictions, however, the Federal Highway Administration still ended up using its discretionary power to withdraw funding for a project there because of the Lewis law. And in 2009 during the recession, President Barack Obama\u2019s transportation secretary rejected Cleveland\u2019s request to apply its provisions to the city\u2019s share of federal stimulus money.The ban, Attorney General Mike DeWine of Ohio argued in his appeal, \u201cprotects construction workers from residency quotas\u201d like those that exist in Cleveland and Akron, and \u201callows construction workers to live where they want without losing out on available work.\u201dMayor Frank G. Jackson of Cleveland countered that cities often spend huge sums on development activities, but \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily see the benefits going back to their citizens, in terms of contracts and wages.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t do this willy-nilly,\u201d he said of the city\u2019s hiring law. \u201cThis is just common-sense stuff.\u201dAccording to figures compiled by the mayor\u2019s office, one-fifth of all work hours went to Cleveland residents and 11 percent of those Cleveland hours went to low-income residents.\u201cThere are still a lot of hurdles to navigate this issue, and we haven\u2019t figured any of this out yet,\u201d said Bryan Luellen, vice president for public affairs and communications at IndyGo, the city\u2019s public transportation corporation. Even though the bulk of the project may be financed with city money, he said, \u201cthe you-have-to-hire-locally piece is not something we\u2019re going to be able to do without special permission from the Federal Transit Administration.\u201dIn March, CRRC broke ground on the new factory in Chicago\u2019s Hegewisch neighborhood.

Local news media organizations with ties to Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party have accused the nonprofit of conspiring against him.On the Cambodia page of its website, the National Democratic Institute includes a critical description of the grip Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party has on the country.\u201cThe governing Cambodian People\u2019s Party continues to dominate after 30 years under the same leader,\u201d the site says. \u201cCitizens are limited in their engagement of elected officials, and mistrust between civil society and government impedes a fully inclusive and participatory democracy.\u201dThe action against the National Democratic Institute drew a sharp rebuke from critics of the government.\u201cThere have been multilevel efforts by the government and government institutions to restrict and repress the opposition party, civil society and the media,\u201d said Naly Pilorge, deputy director of advocacy at Licadho, a Cambodian human rights group.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the courts or the tax department or new legislation, all these mechanisms are being used by the government to crack down on its critics,\u201d she said.Also facing a tight deadline is The Cambodia Daily, an independent newspaper that has served as a training ground for local reporters and budding foreign correspondents alike.The newspaper has been issued a tax bill of more than $6 million, which it contests. On Tuesday, while at an environmental event in the capital, Phnom Penh, Mr. Hun Sen implied that the newspaper, which was founded by an American journalist, was a \u201cthief\u201d and said it needed to \u201cpack up and leave\u201d if it failed to pay back taxes.

{"Headline": "European Bank Cuts Funds to VW Because of Emissions Fraud", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen suffered another blow to its reputation on Tuesday after it was barred from receiving European Union research financing over allegations it misused a previous loan to cheat on emissions.The decision by the publicly owned European Investment Bank at least temporarily deprives Volkswagen of low-cost financing it badly needs for research and development during a period of technological upheaval in the automobile business.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.The hold on new loans came after the European Anti-Fraud Office, known as OLAF, concluded that Volkswagen misled authorities about how it used \u20ac400 million, or $472 million, that was meant to be used to develop engines that would be more fuel efficient and pollute less.Volkswagen used some of the money to develop the EA 189 diesel engine, according to the European Investment Bank. That was the same engine at the heart of the emissions scandal.The investment bank, which provides loans to companies for research and other uses, said Tuesday that it would not issue any new funds to Volkswagen while it examined what further action to take.It also issued an unusually harsh critique of Volkswagen management.\u201cVW is an excellent company,\u201d Werner Hoyer, the president of the European Investment Bank, said in a statement, \u201cbut it has not been served well by its top management since the beginning of this affair. The thousands of wonderful people who work for VW must feel betrayed.\u201dVolkswagen denied wrongdoing. \u201cAll funds received by Volkswagen from the European Union were used for the designated purpose,\u201d the company said in its own statement.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Volkswagen has already repaid the \u20ac400 million loan, but the European Investment Bank still has \u20ac700 million in outstanding loans to the company\u2019s heavy truck divisions, as well as to subsidiaries in Latin America and India.The bank is an important source of financing for Volkswagen. The company has received \u20ac5 billion worldwide since 1990, the bank said. About one-third of the money was designated for technologies to reduce the cars\u2019 environmental impact.The Anti-Fraud Office found that Volkswagen misled the European Investment Bank about its use of so-called defeat devices, software that caused pollution controls in diesel motors to work properly only when the engine computer detected that an official emissions test was underway.The Anti-Fraud Office also referred its findings to prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany, near Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg. Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the state attorney\u2019s office, said authorities were reviewing the findings and had not yet decided how to proceed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Knowing Where to Look 10 Years After Start of Financial Crisis", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsJust five minutes before Monday\u2019s solar eclipse, hundreds of beachgoers along Cape Cod National Seashore were donning special glasses and positioning empty cereal boxes with pinholes in them, tittering with anticipation to see the moon begin to blot out much of the sun. As a result, they missed something far more exciting some 10 yards offshore.A hungry great white shark was attacking a harbor seal. It snatched the poor creature in its jaws and hurled it toward the shore, among bodysurfing and boogie-boarding youngsters. Those, like my son, who had been watching the water, saw the seal breach out of a foaming commotion of water and blood and yelled \u201cshark!\u201dBut the majority of people on Nauset Beach, including the lifeguards focused on the safety of swimmers, missed the great white itself. They saw only the dying seal with its blubbery entrails visible as it swam in hobbled fashion along the surf, leaving a thick trail of blood in the water. That was the end of the beach day as the authorities, now in great abundance, prohibited further swimming.As yet another heralded 10-year anniversary approaches, this time of the great financial crisis, the true-life tale of the shark in the eclipse presents an apt symbol for what happened back in 2007. People on the beach straining their necks to peer thousands of miles into space missed the startling event just a few feet away.In retrospect, of course, I should have been more attentive to the water than the sky. Anyone entering Nauset Beach will, aside from the advertisements for Liam\u2019s clam shack, see the ominous signs warning about the preponderance of great whites, and flags hoisted high bearing the likeness of a shark. Nonetheless, the parking lot fills up on most summer days.So it was with the global banking crisis. There were indications everywhere of a system going awry. A decade on, these are the things financial experts and pundits are returning to in a perverse form of celebration. Everyone, it seems, has their view about which of these events from early 2007 and into the first half of the following year foretold the calamities to come. But the truth is more complicated.Though intellectually stimulating to revisit with hindsight, in isolation none really explained the whole picture in ways sufficient to avoid the inevitable attack. Those who experienced the crisis in the trenches of finance, journalism and public policy will continue a healthy debate for as long as they can remember what happened.It\u2019s worth recalling some of them since we are now in the 10-year anniversary cycle \u2014 but with the simple purpose of recognizing that only the sum total of events can provide a real lesson for future avoidance. And even that will be imperfect.Perhaps because HSBC had a few years earlier, and unusually, acquired a lender focused on less creditworthy customers, many saw it as an isolated case. They didn\u2019t need to look much further for other warnings that the shark, to stretch the analogy, would soon devour the seal.Despite these jitters, investors remained calm, even complacent. From the week before HSBC burped to October of that year \u2014 when UBS, Merrill Lynch and Citigroup warned of some $20 billion of subprime losses \u2014 the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rallied some 10 percent.The complacency rolled on until the troubled Bear Stearns was swallowed by JPMorgan Chase in March 2008. That\u2019s an anniversary that will no doubt merit barrels of ink next year, as will the mother of all crisis celebrations with the 10-year mark of the September demise of Lehman Brothers and the bailouts of American International Group and the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Each anniversary is an opportunity not simply to remember what happened, but to recognize that no single event can really be said to have predicted, kicked off or ended the crisis. Like all collective delusions and manias of crowds, the failure of most investors, regulators, politicians, bankers and, yes, we journalists to identify the danger lurking just below the surface in 2007 only becomes evident by examining the full arc of what occurred.And there is a further lesson, one that the history of market bubbles and financial panics \u2014 as well as mideclipse shark attacks \u2014 will confirm: We will almost certainly be looking in the wrong direction when the next attack comes around.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Associate Boasted That Moscow Business Deal \u2018Will Get Donald Elected\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe associate, Felix Sater, wrote a series of emails to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael Cohen, in which he boasted about his ties to Mr. Putin. He predicted that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s savvy negotiating skills and be a political boon to his candidacy.\u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote in an email. \u201cI will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.\u201dThe emails show that, from the earliest months of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, some of his associates viewed close ties with Moscow as a political advantage. Those ties are now under investigation by the Justice Department and multiple congressional committees.American intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 presidential election to try to help Mr. Trump. Investigators want to know whether anyone on Mr. Trump\u2019s team was part of that process.\u201cI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote.Mr. Sater said he was eager to show video clips to his Russian contacts of instances of Mr. Trump speaking glowingly about Russia, and said he would arrange for Mr. Putin to praise Mr. Trump\u2019s business acumen.\u201cIf he says it we own this election,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote. \u201cAmericas most difficult adversary agreeing that Donald is a good guy to negotiate.\u201dThere is no evidence in the emails that Mr. Sater delivered on his promises, and one email suggests that Mr. Sater overstated his Russian ties. In January 2016, Mr. Cohen wrote to Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, asking for help restarting the Trump Tower project, which had stalled. But Mr. Cohen did not appear to have Mr. Peskov\u2019s direct email, and instead wrote to a general inbox for press inquiries.The project never got government permits or financing, and died weeks later.\u201cTo be clear, the Trump Organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in Russia,\u201d the Trump Organization said Monday in a statement. Mr. Trump, however signed a nonbinding \u201cletter of intent\u201d for the project in 2015. Mr. Cohen said he discussed the project with Mr. Trump three times.The Trump Organization on Monday turned over emails to the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election and whether anyone in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was involved. Some of the emails were obtained by The Times.The emails obtained by The Times do not include any responses from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Sater\u2019s messages.In a statement on Monday that was also provided to Congress, Mr. Cohen suggested that he viewed Mr. Sater\u2019s comments as puffery. \u201cHe has sometimes used colorful language and has been prone to \u2018salesmanship,\u2019\u201d the statement said. \u201cI ultimately determined that the proposal was not feasible and never agreed to make a trip to Russia.\u201dMr. Sater said it would be \u201cpretty cool to get a USA President elected\u201d and said he desired to be the ambassador to the Bahamas. \u201cThat my friend is the home run I want out of this,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Sater \u2014 a former F.B.I. informant who is famous for having once smashed a martini glass stem into another man\u2019s face \u2014 has maintained a relationship with Mr. Cohen over the years. The two men have spent decades operating in the world of New York commercial real estate, where the sources of funding can be murky.Through his lawyer, Mr. Sater declined on Monday to address why he thought the deal would be a political win for Mr. Trump. He said he brought the project to Mr. Cohen in late 2015, but that he was not working for the Trump Organization and \u201cwould not have been compensated\u201d by them.\u201cDuring the course of our communications over several months, I routinely expressed my enthusiasm regarding what a tremendous opportunity this was for the Trump Organization,\u201d Mr. Sater said.Mr. Sater was a broker for the Trump Organization for several years, typically paid to deliver real estate deals. A company he worked for, Bayrock, played a role in financing the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York. Mr. Sater and Mr. Cohen even worked together on a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia that they sought to get in front of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser earlier this year.\u201cI arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins private chair at his desk and office in the Kremlin,\u201d he said.Ms. Trump said she had no involvement in the discussions about the Moscow deal other than to recommend possible architects. In a statement, she said that during the 2006 trip she took \u201ca brief tour of Red Square and the Kremlin\u201d as a tourist. She said it is possible she sat in Mr. Putin\u2019s chair during that tour but she did not recall it. She said she has not seen or spoken to Mr. Sater since 2010. \u201cI have never met President Vladimir Putin,\u201d she said.Spokespeople for the House Intelligence Committee had no comment on the documents.Mr. Cohen has denied any wrongdoing, and the Trump Organization turned over the emails to the House as part of his ongoing cooperation with the investigation.Earlier this month, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen M. Ryan, wrote a letter to congressional investigators that contained what he said was a point-by-point refutation of a dossier suggesting that Mr. Cohen colluded with Russian operatives. That dossier, compiled by a retired British spy and briefed to Mr. Trump during the transition, was published online early this year.\u201cWe do not believe that the committee should give credence to or perpetuate any of the allegations relating to Mr. Cohen unless the committee can obtain independent and reliable corroboration,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bridge of Grand Ambitions Is Set to Open at the Tappan Zee", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by21st-Century SpanGov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who set the $4 billion project in motion after previous administrations had hemmed and hawed about whether to pay for continued repairs on the deteriorating Tappan Zee Bridge or to undertake an expensive replacement, stood Wednesday on the helm of a tugboat packed with reporters and photographers. He looked upon the structure\u2019s 40-story sloping concrete towers and a cat\u2019s cradle of cables with the smile of a 10-year-old who had just finished a model airplane.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this every day, but to see it in reality, it takes my breath away,\u201d he said.By a new state law, the replacement bridge, until recently known as the New NY Bridge, is named after the governor\u2019s father, Mario M. Cuomo, who was governor for three terms and died on New Year\u2019s Day in 2015. But names awarded by politicians to existing structures don\u2019t always stick. (Ask champions of the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel and the Joe DiMaggio Highway.)The new bridge is a symphony of statistics. More than 1,000 cylindrical piles were planted into the Hudson riverbed to create 41 pillars to hold up each span. Some 330,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured in construction, including some 6,000 precast concrete road deck panels. The main decks of both spans are held up by 192 cables stretched among eight 419-foot angled towers. The bridge will handle 140,000 cars a day.It cost $4 billion to build, \u201con time and on budget,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, because the state took a new approach to the project, putting both the design and construction out to bid, rather than creating its own designs. The winning bid, by a consortium known as Tappan Zee Constructors, came in $1 billion under what the state feared it would cost.In an interview and in the tugboat news conference, the governor repeatedly declared that the opening of the Tappan Zee replacement \u2014 the first bridge of such scale in the New York area since the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge linked Brooklyn to Staten Island in 1964 \u2014 was a symbol of New York\u2019s daring and ambition, going back to the Erie Canal, which opened the Midwest to the port of New York and its international trade.Its opening comes at a time of skyrocketing construction costs, diminished resources devoted to infrastructure, and deteriorating subways and airports in New York.\u201cWe built the longest bridges, the most sophisticated tunnels,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cBut we lost that daring, we lost that competence.\u201d\u201cWhat the New Tappan Zee says is we can still do great things,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.In a ceremony on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo drove across the bridge in a 1955 Corvette with a noteworthy passenger: Armando Galella, a 96-year-old veteran of the attack on Pearl Harbor who had driven across the original Tappan Zee Bridge on its opening day in 1955.The bridge is being built without any accommodation for a rail line, something transit advocates had pushed for as a way to ease traffic in the region. Opponents said it would add billions to the cost of the project. Park advocates wanted to keep the existing bridge in place and turn it into a park in the manner of Manhattan\u2019s High Line, but that too would have necessitated additional expense.Only the first of the new twin bridges connecting Westchester and Rockland Counties has been completed, though the second is well along and is scheduled to be finished before the end of 2018. Starting this weekend, cars traveling west from Westchester to Rockland County will be able to cross the Hudson on the new 96-foot-wide bridge, with four lanes opened. Cars traveling east to Westchester will use the existing bridge. In two or three months, the governor\u2019s office said, Westchester-bound cars will be moved to the new bridge as well, along four opposing lanes, making eight lanes in all.Then the existing bridge will be closed and the pillars and shoreline roadway leading to it will be demolished to create new \u201clandings\u201d for the second span. Once those are completed, each span will carry traffic bound one way, gaining only one lane over the old bridge, for a total of eight, but with lanes that will be a foot wider than those on the existing bridge. Both spans will have shoulders for car breakdowns, something the current bridge lacks, a failing blamed for frequent and exasperating traffic jams.Though it will not carry rail traffic, the bridge will have a bicycle and pedestrian lane, which will be finished after the traffic lanes are open to the public. The bike path became the subject of controversy because the original plan for the Rockland side terminated in a residential neighborhood of single family houses in South Nyack and residents complained that it would ruin the quiet of their streets. The end point was eventually shifted.One outstanding question is how much people will pay to cross the new bridge. The current toll on the Tappan Zee is $5, or $4.75 with an E-Z Pass, paid by those heading east. By comparison the toll on the George Washington Bridge heading into New York is $15. The governor has promised that the toll would remain the same through 2020, but it is not clear what will happen after that. Rockland County commuters say tolls should remain low because they have few transportation options other than cars.The bridge is largely financed with bonds, which are paid off by the tolls. So far, the federal government has given the project a $1.6 billion loan and the state put in $1.2 billion from settlements with banks and financial companies for violations in lending during the financial crisis. Another $850 million was raised from a bond issued by the New York State Thruway Authority, the bridge\u2019s owner and operator. The remainder will require more bonds \u2014 and it too will affect the cost of the tolls.But that is for the future. For now, on Friday night, workers will be deployed to re-stripe the lanes on the new bridge\u2019s landings. At 9 p.m., as the traffic volume decreases, the state police will begin gradually shutting down lanes on the old bridge until only one lane is open. They plan a complete halt of roughly 15 minutes.Then sometime after midnight, the first cars are expected to drive over the new Tappan Zee bridge.Advertisement"}

It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel.Tesla has just over $3 billion in cash, but it is burning through roughly $1 billion a quarter as it embarks on one of the most daunting gambits in automotive history: taking production of its mass-market vehicle from zero to 400,000 or more a year in just 18 months.Fortunately for Mr. Musk, investors can\u2019t seem to shower his ambitions with too much money. Tesla\u2019s stock has risen by 67 percent this year. The company is valued at some 27 times 2020 earnings, implying the kind of growth that even the most bullish of analysts don\u2019t expect, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations.The textbook financing solution would be to issue more of that high-priced paper. Selling five million shares at a 15 percent discount to market would raise the same $1.5 billion and dilute Mr. Musk\u2019s 20.4 percent stake by only 3 percent, assuming he didn\u2019t pitch in more himself.But he doesn\u2019t have to when the high-yield bond market is on a tear. Investors desperate for income have depressed the yield gap between single-B-rated junk bonds and United States Treasury bonds by nearly 2 percentage points over the past year, to 3.59 points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings affirmed its B-minus rating on Tesla, saying the boost to liquidity should offset the company\u2019s \u201csignificant execution risks.\u201dThe bond sale will raise debt to a lofty 5.5 times forecast 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. But Ebitda is set to more than double next year to $2.2 billion and then almost triple by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Even if Mr. Musk is not as successful as Wall Street estimates, he should sell more than enough cars to make the leverage, and the additional interest bill, easy for bondholders to swallow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Borrower Got Unneeded Insurance, and Ruined Credit", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWells Fargo has promised to make amends to the customers it forced to buy car insurance that they didn\u2019t need. Allan Dunlap, a former Wells Fargo borrower who spent months trying to get the bank to correct an insurance error that marred his credit report, says he\u2019ll believe it when he sees it.Wells Fargo said that it discontinued the insurance practices last September after it had found \u201cinadequacies in vendor processes and internal controls that negatively impacted some customers.\u201d The bank has contended that 570,000 people may be owed refunds.Mr. Dunlap, 55, is one of those affected by the bank\u2019s insurance activities. His experience with Wells Fargo highlights the harm done to actual people and points to the challenges Wells faces in remedying it. More than a year after he started battling with Wells Fargo, Mr. Dunlap said, he is still awaiting confirmation that his credit report has been corrected.\u201cI never missed a payment and I always had insurance,\u201d Mr. Dunlap said in a phone interview. \u201cBut they forced additional coverage on my vehicle and it showed up on my credit report that I was 60 to 90 days late on my payments.\u201d Repeated calls to Wells Fargo to get them to fix the error were unsuccessful, he said.Jennifer A. Temple, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, acknowledged in a statement \u201cthat our customer service and our processes did not measure up and we are working with Mr. Dunlap to make things right.\u201dMr. Dunlap\u2019s story began in March 2016 in Jamestown, N.D., where he worked transporting recreational vehicles.He found his dream car at a local dealership \u2014 a low-mileage, mint-condition Chrysler 300, vintage 2008, selling for around $25,000. Together with a friend who co-signed for the loan, Mr. Dunlap financed the purchase through Wells Fargo Dealer Services. The amount of the loan was almost $21,000.Before he could take possession of the car, he was asked to provide the dealership with proof of existing car insurance. Wells Fargo loan documents prepared by the dealership show that his coverage was with State Farm.For three months, he made his $410 loan payments without a hitch. But in early May, Wells Fargo sent both borrowers a letter saying it had not received the necessary documentation showing that the car was insured. A second notice saying the same thing followed a month later.When the first notice came in, Mr. Dunlap was recovering from a stroke, he said. Still, he began calling Wells Fargo to tell them he already had insurance. He was unsuccessful, he said, because he\u2019d be kept on hold for long periods and often got disconnected.Ms. Temple of Wells Fargo said: \u201cWe recognize there were a number of customers who experienced difficulty verifying with Wells Fargo and our vendor if they had insurance and we are sorry that Mr. Dunlap experienced this challenge.\u201dOn July 1, Mr. Dunlap\u2019s loan statement showed, Wells Fargo charged $1,079 for insurance on the car \u2014 the first time such a charge had appeared. The insurance, a year\u2019s premium, took effect in March when he bought the car.Mr. Dunlap said he didn\u2019t know about the charge and records show he made his regular loan payment in July. But because he owed the additional $1,079 for insurance, he fell behind. Late fees began accruing, and his problems on the loan were reported to credit bureaus.He made more calls to Wells Fargo. \u201cI\u2019d talk to one person in one state, another person in another state; I\u2019d send them papers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were so many different people involved, the information doesn\u2019t get to the right sources.\u201dSome Wells Fargo letters came from Phoenix, Ariz., while others were postmarked Irvine, Calif., and Irving, Tex.He even tried reaching the bank\u2019s board, Mr. Dunlap said.Finally in mid-September, Wells Fargo canceled the insurance it had placed on Mr. Dunlap\u2019s car. But the bank credited his loan account with only $846. That meant he was still behind on the loan.Trying to get another loan to pay off the existing one was impossible, he said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018No, you\u2019re late with Wells Fargo,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dunlap said.Exasperated, Mr. Dunlap decided to sell the Chrysler last November so he could close out the Wells Fargo loan. He sold it for around $19,000, he said, $6,000 less than he had paid eight months earlier. The amount he needed to pay off the loan was $20,250, Wells Fargo records show.But Mr. Dunlap\u2019s battle wasn\u2019t over. Now he had to correct his credit report, an effort that he said was still going on.Earlier this year, he asked the bank for $1,000 in compensation for its mistakes. In a letter dated June 1, the bank declined to provide it.\u201cAt this time we are unable to comply with your request for compensation,\u201d the letter said. Wells also said it was submitting requests to credit bureaus to remove the late payments recorded on Mr. Dunlap\u2019s history. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this matter may have caused,\u201d the letter added.Trying to get assurances that his credit report had been corrected, Mr. Dunlap called Wells Fargo again. He said he told the bank that he planned to contact the Times reporter about his experience. \u201cThey said, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to the reporter, we\u2019ll try to fix this,\u2019\u201d he said.The promise from Wells Fargo came more than a year after his problems with the bank began. It was too little, too late, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ukraine, a Malware Expert Who Could Blow the Whistle on Russian Hacking", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The hacker, known only by his online alias \u201cProfexer,\u201d kept a low profile. He wrote computer code alone in an apartment and quietly sold his handiwork on the anonymous portion of the internet known as the dark web. Last winter, he suddenly went dark entirely.Profexer\u2019s posts, already accessible only to a small band of fellow hackers and cybercriminals looking for software tips, blinked out in January \u2014 just days after American intelligence agencies publicly identified a program he had written as one tool used in Russian hacking in the United States. American intelligence agencies have determined Russian hackers were behind the electronic break-in of the Democratic National Committee.But while Profexer\u2019s online persona vanished, a flesh-and-blood person has emerged: a fearful man who the Ukrainian police said turned himself in early this year, and has now become a witness for the F.B.I.\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d he wrote in one of his last messages posted on a restricted-access website before going to the police. \u201cIt won\u2019t be pleasant. But I\u2019m still alive.\u201dIt is the first known instance of a living witness emerging from the arid mass of technical detail that has so far shaped the investigation into the election hacking and the heated debate it has stirred. The Ukrainian police declined to divulge the man\u2019s name or other details, other than that he is living in Ukraine and has not been arrested.There is no evidence that Profexer worked, at least knowingly, for Russia\u2019s intelligence services, but his malware apparently did.That a hacking operation that Washington is convinced was orchestrated by Moscow would obtain malware from a source in Ukraine \u2014 perhaps the Kremlin\u2019s most bitter enemy \u2014 sheds considerable light on the Russian security services\u2019 modus operandi in what Western intelligence agencies say is their clandestine cyberwar against the United States and Europe.It does not suggest a compact team of government employees who write all their own code and carry out attacks during office hours in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but rather a far looser enterprise that draws on talent and hacking tools wherever they can be found.Also emerging from Ukraine is a sharper picture of what the United States believes is a Russian government hacking group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 or Fancy Bear. It is this group, which American intelligence agencies believe is operated by Russian military intelligence, that has been blamed, along with a second Russian outfit known as Cozy Bear, for the D.N.C. intrusion.Rather than training, arming and deploying hackers to carry out a specific mission like just another military unit, Fancy Bear and its twin Cozy Bear have operated more as centers for organization and financing; much of the hard work like coding is outsourced to private and often crime-tainted vendors.In more than a decade of tracking suspected Russian-directed cyberattacks against a host of targets in the West and in former Soviet territories \u2014 NATO, electrical grids, research groups, journalists critical of Russia and political parties, to name a few \u2014 security services around the world have identified only a handful of people who are directly involved in either carrying out such attacks or providing the cyberweapons that were used.This absence of reliable witnesses has left ample room for President Trump and others to raise doubts about whether Russia really was involved in the D.N.C. hack.\u201cThere is not now and never has been a single piece of technical evidence produced that connects the malware used in the D.N.C. attack to the G.R.U., F.S.B. or any agency of the Russian government,\u201d said Jeffrey Carr, the author of a book on cyberwarfare. The G.R.U. is Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and the F.S.B. its federal security service.United States intelligence agencies, however, have been unequivocal in pointing a finger at Russia.Seeking a path out of this fog, cybersecurity researchers and Western law enforcement officers have turned to Ukraine, a country that Russia has used for years as a laboratory for a range of politicized operations that later cropped up elsewhere, including electoral hacking in the United States.In several instances, certain types of computer intrusions, like the use of malware to knock out crucial infrastructure or to pilfer email messages later released to tilt public opinion, occurred in Ukraine first. Only later were the same techniques used in Western Europe and the United States.So, not surprisingly, those studying cyberwar in Ukraine are now turning up clues in the investigation of the D.N.C. break-in and related hacking, including the discovery of a rare witness.Security experts were initially left scratching their heads when the Department of Homeland Security on Dec. 29 released technical evidence of Russian hacking that seemed to point not to Russia, but rather to Ukraine.He had made it available to download, free, from a website that asked only for donations, ranging from $3 to $250. The real money was made by selling customized versions and by guiding his hacker clients in its effective use. It remains unclear how extensively he interacted with the Russian hacking team.After the Department of Homeland Security identified his creation, he quickly shut down his website and posted on a closed forum for hackers, called Exploit, that \u201cI\u2019m not interested in excessive attention to me personally.\u201dSoon, a hint of panic appeared, and he posted a note saying that, six days on, he was still alive.Another hacker, with the nickname Zloi Santa, or Bad Santa, suggested the Americans would certainly find him, and place him under arrest, perhaps during a layover at an airport.\u201cIt could be, or it could not be, it depends only on politics,\u201d Profexer responded. \u201cIf U.S. law enforcement wants to take me down, they will not wait for me in some country\u2019s airport. Relations between our countries are so tight I would be arrested in my kitchen, at the first request.\u201dIn fact, Serhiy Demediuk, chief of the Ukrainian Cyber Police, said in an interview that Profexer went to the authorities himself. As the cooperation began, Profexer went dark on hacker forums. He last posted online on Jan. 9. Mr. Demediuk said he had made the witness available to the F.B.I., which has posted a full-time cybersecurity expert in Kiev as one of four bureau agents stationed at the United States Embassy there. The F.B.I. declined to comment.Profexer was not arrested because his activities fell in a legal gray zone, as an author but not a user of malware, the Ukrainian police say. But he did know the users, at least by their online handles. \u201cHe told us he didn\u2019t create it to be used in the way it was,\u201d Mr. Demediuk said.A member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament with close ties to the security services, Anton Gerashchenko, said that the interaction was online or by phone and that the Ukrainian programmer had been paid to write customized malware without knowing its purpose, only later learning it was used in Russian hacking.Mr. Gerashchenko described the author only in broad strokes, to protect his safety, as a young man from a provincial Ukrainian city. He confirmed that the author turned himself in to the police and was cooperating as a witness in the D.N.C. investigation. \u201cHe was a freelancer and now he is a valuable witness,\u201d Mr. Gerashchenko said.It is not clear whether the specific malware the programmer created was used to hack the D.N.C. servers, but it was identified in other Russian hacking efforts in the United States.While it is not known what Profexer has told Ukrainian investigators and the F.B.I. about Russia\u2019s hacking efforts, evidence emanating from Ukraine has again provided some of the clearest pictures yet about Fancy Bear, or Advanced Persistent Threat 28, which is run by the G.R.U.Fancy Bear has been identified mostly by what it does, not by who does it. One of its recurring features has been the theft of emails and its close collaboration with the Russian state news media.Tracking the bear to its lair, however, has so far proved impossible, not least because many experts believe that no such single place exists.Even for a sophisticated tech company like Microsoft, singling out individuals in the digital miasma has proved just about impossible. To curtail the damage to clients\u2019 operating systems, the company filed a complaint against Fancy Bear last year with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia but found itself boxing with shadows.As Microsoft lawyers reported to the court, \u201cbecause defendants used fake contact information, anonymous Bitcoin and prepaid credit cards and false identities, and sophisticated technical means to conceal their identities, when setting up and using the relevant internet domains, defendants\u2019 true identities remain unknown.\u201dNevertheless, Ukrainian officials, though wary of upsetting the Trump administration, have been quietly cooperating with American investigators to try to figure out who stands behind all the disguises.Included in this sharing of information were copies of the server hard drives of Ukraine\u2019s Central Election Commission, which were targeted during a presidential election in May 2014. That the F.B.I. had obtained evidence of this earlier, Russian-linked electoral hack has not been previously reported.Traces of the same malicious code, this time a program called Sofacy, were seen in the 2014 attack in Ukraine and later in the D.N.C. intrusion in the United States.Intriguingly, in the cyberattack during the Ukrainian election, what appears to have been a bungle by Channel 1, a Russian state television station, inadvertently implicated the government authorities in Moscow.Hackers had loaded onto a Ukrainian election commission server a graphic mimicking the page for displaying results. This phony page showed a shocker of an outcome: an election win for a fiercely anti-Russian, ultraright candidate, Dmytro Yarosh. Mr. Yarosh in reality received less than 1 percent of the vote.The false result would have played into a Russian propaganda narrative that Ukraine today is ruled by hard-right, even fascist, figures.The fake image was programmed to display when polls closed, at 8 p.m., but a Ukrainian cybersecurity company, InfoSafe, discovered it just minutes earlier and unplugged the server.State television in Russia nevertheless reported that Mr. Yarosh had won and broadcast the fake graphic, citing the election commission\u2019s website, even though the image had never appeared there. The hacker had clearly provided Channel 1 with the same image in advance, but the reporters had failed to check that the hack actually worked.\u201cFor me, this is an obvious link between the hackers and Russian officials,\u201d said Victor Zhora, director of InfoSafe, the cybersecurity company that first found the fake graphic.\u201cIt was the first strike,\u201d Mr. Zhora said of the earlier hack of Ukraine\u2019s electoral computers. Ukraine\u2019s Cyber Police have also provided the F.B.I. with copies of server hard drives showing the possible origins of some phishing emails targeting the Democratic Party during the election.In 2016, two years after the election hack in Ukraine, hackers using some of the same techniques plundered the email system of the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, which had accused Russian athletes of systematic drug use.That raid, too, seems to have been closely coordinated with Russian state television, which began airing well-prepared reports about WADA\u2019s hacked emails just minutes after they were made public. The emails appeared on a website that announced that WADA had been hacked by a group calling itself the \u201cFancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team.\u201dIt was the first time Fancy Bear had broken cover.Fancy Bear remains extraordinarily elusive, however. To throw investigators off its scent, the group has undergone various makeovers, restocking its arsenal of malware and sometimes hiding under different guises. One of its alter egos, cyberexperts believe, is Cyber Berkut, an outfit supposedly set up in Ukraine by supporters of the country\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014.After lying dormant for many months, Cyber Berkut jumped back into action this summer just as multiple investigations in Washington into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow shifted into high gear. Cyber Berkut released stolen emails that it and Russian state news media said had exposed the real story: Hillary Clinton had colluded with Ukraine.An earlier version of this article misstated how a type of malware known as P.A.S. was used in Russian hacking efforts in the United States that included the electronic break-in at the Democratic National Committee. The agencies identified the malware as a tool used in Russian hacking, but they did not specify in which attacks it was used.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get Rich in Trump\u2019s Washington", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "FeatureHis presidency has changed the rules of influence in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and spawned a new breed of lobbyist on K Street.Supported byStryk, who owned a lobbying firm so small it didn\u2019t actually have an office, spent most of his time in California and owned a small vineyard in Oregon, and he had helped out the Trump campaign as a sort of informal West Coast hand. He was still reveling in Trump\u2019s upset win two nights later, over a bottle of wine on the patio of the Four Seasons in Georgetown, when a chocolate Lab padded over to his table to sniff his crotch. Stryk and the dog\u2019s owner got to talking about wine and cigars and finally, like most of the country, about Trump. It turned out that she worked for New Zealand\u2019s Embassy in Washington. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister still hadn\u2019t connected with the new president-elect, she told Stryk \u2014 a diplomatic and political embarrassment. Stryk cocked an eye across the table. \u2018\u2018What if I said I could get you the number of someone to call the president?\u2019\u2019 he asked her.The following afternoon, Stryk found himself in a cab, headed for a meeting with New Zealand\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser. Stryk was more than a little nervous. On the way over, he called a friend named Stuart Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran Trump\u2019s field operation during the Republican primary and spent election night with Stryk at Morton\u2019s. Jolly reached out to someone he knew in the Trump high command and delivered a cell number, but Stryk didn\u2019t know if it would actually work. At the embassy, Groser invited him in, uncorked a bottle of pinot noir and called the prime minister to pass along the number. A week later, President-elect Trump was finally able to accept a congratulatory phone call. But even before the call went through, plans and possibilities were blooming in Stryk\u2019s mind. \u2018\u2018I said to myself: \u2018This could be very, very interesting,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he told me when I first met him this spring. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The world\u2019s going to change.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Stryk, who grew up in Arizona, had bounced around the minor leagues of politics for most of his adult life. At 41, he has the frenetic energy of a serial entrepreneur and the motley r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to match. After dropping out of college to intern on Capitol Hill, Stryk wrote voter-contact scripts for a Republican P.R. firm, helped start a political job-listing website and eventually opened his own Beltway lobbying shop, Sonoran Policy Group. The firm almost collapsed in 2009, after Stryk tried to acquire a troubled Maryland-based security-guard business. Stryk decamped to California, owing thousands of dollars in back rent, and reinvented S.P.G. as a procurement and political-consulting business. He traded tequila shots with the California congressman Dana Rohrabacher, ran for mayor of a town in Napa Valley, handled P.R. for an arms dealer accused of smuggling weapons to Libya \u2014 the case was dropped last fall \u2014 and helped clients sell the government everything from flashlights to missile-guidance software. By the time he hooked up with the Trump campaign, Stryk had hustled his way to a good living, and he knew his way around Washington. But he was no one\u2019s idea of a Beltway insider.When the phone call to Trump went through, Stryk saw the geography of a new world forming before his eyes. Interests that spent millions of dollars studying Washington and shaping it to their liking had been taken totally by surprise by Trump\u2019s win. The rules had changed, and no one was sure what the new ones were. For Stryk, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for. As he saw it, the lobbying old guard \u2014 the guys that threw down black Amex cards at Joe\u2019s Crab and sent fat quarterly bills to clients they barely did any work for \u2014 were on the defensive. New people would have a chance. People like Stryk.New Zealand was a prime example. Groser and his staff had spent months researching Hillary Clinton, calculating who among her vast claque would win positions of power and influence in her administration. The main thing they knew about Trump was that he had sworn to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the complex 12-nation trade deal that Groser helped negotiate. Stryk, offering to work free, had a proposal. New Zealand would throw the biggest party of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Stryk would put the new administration\u2019s leading lights in the room; Groser would do the rest. \u2018\u2018It was about building brand recognition for New Zealand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk explained. \u2018\u2018If we can get them there, then forever, bad or good, Trump and New Zealand are a co-brand.\u2019\u2019In the tumult following Trump\u2019s win, Stryk was discovering that many of his old friends \u2014 most of them fellow Washington backbenchers, B-listers and understudies \u2014 had vaulted to positions of unexpected influence. A guy Stryk knew at the inaugural committee put out the word among Trump alums that New Zealand\u2019s party was the week\u2019s hot ticket. Stryk called a friend at Salem Media, the right-leaning media-and-talk-radio company, which signed on as a party sponsor. Another friend, the actor Jon Voight, agreed to attend as a special celebrity guest.Groser decided to hire Stryk full time. Not long after, Stryk pulled $250,000 out of his savings, moved his family to the Washington suburbs and started hiring.Over the decades, lobbying has evolved from a niche trade of fixers and gatekeepers to a sleek, vertically integrated, $3-billion-a-year industry. A good lobbyist doesn\u2019t go into a meeting asking for legislation; she or he already has the bill drafted, a coalition of businesses and trade groups poised to support it, a policy brief to hand out to reporters and to the officials positioned at dozens of decision points throughout the bureaucracy and relationships with advertising and polling firms to manage the public rollout. Everyone has a lobbyist \u2014 or three, or 50 \u2014 and the lobbyists know everyone. K Street is majestic and immovable, veined through Washington like fat through a prime steak.Like virtually every other candidate for president, Trump campaigned against this thicket of money and influence, positioning himself as an outsider who would \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 This pledge would soon prove more rhetorical than real, but it contained a grain of truth. Trump arrived in Washington with a relatively short baggage train of Beltway relationships and obligations. He didn\u2019t read policy briefs; he barely had policies. His inner circle was a hodgepodge of Breitbart alumni, nominally Democratic financiers, Trump Organization employees on loan, the odd reality-show star and Republicans who would have been unemployable in almost any other administration. The smart money in Washington \u2014 K Street and K Street\u2019s clients, the big corporations and trade associations \u2014 didn\u2019t quite know what to expect. But mostly, they didn\u2019t know whom to call.\u2018\u2018Many companies want to understand: What are the president\u2019s priorities?\u2019\u2019 Corey Lewandowski told me in February, a few weeks after the inauguration. \u2018\u2018But there are so few people in Washington who have a relationship or an understanding of him.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski, the president\u2019s former campaign manager, was happy to tell you that he was one of the few exceptions.Lewandowski\u2019s journey from obscure New Hampshire political operative to celebrity power broker was emblematic of how Trump\u2019s election scrambled Washington\u2019s hierarchies. Much like Stryk, Lewandowski had spent years in the lower ranks of conservative politics and lobbying. Being hired as Trump\u2019s campaign manager moved Lewandowski into the political big time, and being fired, midway through the race, did little to dislodge him. There were speaking gigs, a stint as a reliably pro-Trump pundit on CNN. At one point last year, Lewandowski even tried selling a book, tentatively titled \u2018\u2018Let Trump Be Trump\u2019\u2019; Stryk, introduced to Lewandowski by a mutual friend, helped him shop the proposal. \u2018\u2018Corey had a brand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me, and that brand was valuable. HarperCollins offered Lewandowski $1.2 million, an astounding figure for a campaign manager \u2014 though the deal evaporated when Lewandowski refused to show HarperCollins a copy of his nondisclosure agreement with Trump.Through it all, Lewandowski remained close to Trump and spoke to him often. But after the election, the White House job Lewandowski hoped for never quite materialized. Now Lewandowski, too, was on K Street. He had joined up with another former Trump aide, Barry Bennett, to start a lobbying firm called Avenue Strategies.Unlike other people on K Street, Lewandowski did not pretend to be an expert on the legislative calendar or the fine points of the Administrative Procedure Act. He was an expert on Trump. \u2018\u2018There are just so few people in Washington who know the president,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski told me in February. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a comparative advantage.\u2019\u2019 He was not shy about playing up their friendship. He sometimes tweeted from the White House grounds. When journalists or other visitors came to his office, on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House, he would point out his window to where, he claimed, he could see the president\u2019s bedroom.His mind-meld with Trump was what made him valuable to clients, Lewandowski explained to me. \u2018\u2018I think what I bring is a level of understanding of the president\u2019s thought process,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018only because I had the privilege of being next to him for so long.\u2019\u2019 He was doing as many as nine or 10 meetings a day: Chief executives, prominent Republicans, even other lobbying firms wanted his advice. He offered it freely, Lewandowski told me. He wanted to be helpful. \u2018\u2018You know what a guy said to me the other day?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You\u2019ve got a hot hand. Just remember, that hand\u2019s not going to be hot forever.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019One good source of business was the president\u2019s habit of calling chief executives to the White House for televised meetings. In January, when the chief executive of Whirlpool was summoned by Trump to discuss how to revive American jobs, the company asked Avenue Strategies to advise it. As one lobbyist who shared clients with Lewandowski put it to me, companies like Whirlpool needed to know the lay of the land inside the White House: How much sway did Wilbur Ross have? Was Steve Bannon for real? And what should the company do if Trump started dumping on it on Twitter?Everyone had seen what happened to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed, the federal government\u2019s single biggest contractor, is a powerful presence inside the Beltway. But through the winter, Trump had lashed out at the company over cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet. The company\u2019s shares dropped each time, taking Lockheed\u2019s value down by billions of dollars. These were the kinds of problems that Lewandowski believed others on K Street couldn\u2019t help with. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re a corporate C.E.O. and the president has tweeted at you and your stock has dropped 4 percent, you say: \u2018Why am I paying all these guys so much money?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said. The old model of Washington influence wouldn\u2019t work on Trump, he believed. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t know him, and they don\u2019t know any of his guys, and they don\u2019t understand how he thinks.\u2019\u2019 Eventually Lockheed, too, turned to Avenue.Over the course of a few conversations with the company\u2019s Washington office, Bennett told me, they advised Lockheed on how Marillyn Hewson, its president and chief executive, should approach conversations: \u2018\u2018Short, direct, honest answers,\u2019\u2019 as Bennett recounted it for me later. \u2018\u2018Feel free to educate the president. In the end, it\u2019s going to be transactional.\u2019\u2019 The next time Hewson met with Trump, a week before the inauguration, she came bearing gifts: a potential F-35 price cut and a promise to add jobs at a Texas plant.The Twitter attacks ceased. By the end of February, Trump was praising Lockheed. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve just announced eighteen hundred new jobs,\u2019\u2019 Trump told reporters after a meeting with Hewson and other manufacturing executives. \u2018\u2018I have to say this, Marillyn, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit because what you did was the right thing.\u2019\u2019The demand was so great that would-be Trump-whisperers were popping up in Washington like toadstools after a rainstorm. The former Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, a \u2018\u2018senior adviser\u2019\u2019 to the lobbying practice at Dentons, the world\u2019s largest law firm, was hawking a book titled \u2018\u2018Understanding Trump.\u2019\u2019 Established K Street firms were grabbing any Trump people they could find: Jim Murphy, Trump\u2019s former political director, joined the lobbying giant BakerHostetler, while another firm, Fidelis Government Relations, struck up a partnership with Bill Smith, Mike Pence\u2019s former chief of staff. All told, close to 20 ex-aides of Trump, friends and hangers-on had made their way into Washington\u2019s influence business.Beltway experience was not necessarily required. Squire Patton Boggs formed a \u2018\u2018strategic alliance\u2019\u2019 with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s self-described \u2018\u2018personal attorney\u2019\u2019 from New York, who had scant government experience. There was also Brad Gerstman, a brawny Long Island lobbyist and P.R. man who had done work for Trump in New York over the years. On election night, Gerstman was so sure Trump was going to lose that he got on a plane to Israel. As Gerstman tells it, his business partner called as soon as he landed. \u2018\u2018Why the hell are you in Tel Aviv?\u2019\u2019 his partner asked. \u2018\u2018We have an office to open in Washington.\u2019\u2019 Gerstman hung up and went to his hotel, where he looked out over the Mediterranean, put a cigar in his mouth and listened to the congratulatory messages piled up in his voice mail. In January, he set up an office in downtown Washington. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t want to sell ourselves as just the Trump guys,\u2019\u2019 Gerstman told me. \u2018\u2018But maybe that\u2019s what it takes for the first few years.\u2019\u2019Many of the Trump-connected lobbyists told me they were turning away as much business as they accepted. One person offered Lewan\u00addowski $250,000 just to get the president to tweet about him. A lobbyist who worked on Trump\u2019s inaugural committee told me of a billionaire who, within a week of the inauguration, offered a million dollars if the lobbyist could arrange for his picture to be taken in the Oval Office with the new president. \u2018\u2018You can make $2 million if you want,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me, sounding almost apologetic. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gold mine in Eastern Europe.\u2019 Or: \u2018My client is suing the I.R.S. \u2014 can you help?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Not all of the new arrivals affected to be part of a revolution. One day this spring, I met with Brian Ballard, a veteran Florida lobbyist and top-tier Republican fund-raiser. Ballard had recently opened an office in Washington just a few blocks from the new Trump International Hotel. He had known Trump since the 1980s, and he later started lobbying regulators and state officials on behalf of Trump\u2019s golf courses and his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, but he was practical about the realities of politics. Like most of Florida\u2019s Republican old guard, he started the 2016 campaign backing the state\u2019s former governor, Jeb Bush, before switching to the state\u2019s junior senator, Marco Rubio. Once it became clear that Trump would lead the Republican ticket, Ballard enthusiastically joined the campaign as Trump\u2019s Florida finance chairman.Ballard, who is 56, had a ruddy Florida tan that marked him as new in town, and the serene confidence of a man who saw no way he could lose. At his office, an attractive receptionist led us into a spotless conference room. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not an expert in Washington, D.C.,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me when we sat down. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m an expert in lobbying.\u2019\u2019 In Florida, Ballard had a blue-chip list of corporate clients: Google, pharmaceutical companies, Big Sugar. His business plan was simple: to sign up his Florida clients for Trump-related advice in Washington. \u2018\u2018When I was on the campaign, they didn\u2019t want to pitch in,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of his clients. \u2018\u2018And now they say: \u2018How do I figure out what is going on here?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019By the end of his first 100 days in office, it seemed, Trump had not so much drained the swamp as enshrouded it with a billowing fog of uncertainty. No previous president had changed his mind more often, or contradicted his cabinet so frequently, or permitted such vicious ideological combat under his White House roof. Many clients just wanted to know what they could safely ignore. \u2018\u2018White Houses are always somewhat opaque places of fascination, where you don\u2019t quite know who is up and who is down, or how decisions are ultimately reached,\u2019\u2019 said Bruce P. Mehlman, a prominent Republican lobbyist who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u2018\u2018The added complexity here was there was not a single consistent governing philosophy. It was not clear if the president saw trade the way that Gary Cohn sees it or the way Steve Bannon sees it.\u2019\u2019Moreover, some of the usual paths through the bog were now closed. Hundreds of senior administration jobs were going unfilled, as Trump\u2019s cabinet secretaries battled with his inner circle over potential hires from among the Republican regulars in Washington. One lobbyist at a well-regarded firm with numerous financial clients told me that his problem was less that he didn\u2019t know whom to call than that there was no one to call: Infighting and vetting problems had stymied so many appointments at the Treasury Department that many of the offices were empty.All of this had inadvertently created an entirely new business model for Trump\u2019s friends and former employees. In normal times, K Street did much of its business on Capitol Hill, where the churn of legislation offered unending opportunity to deliver goodies for clients. But the power vacuum in Trump\u2019s cabinet agencies, and the inexperience of his West Wing staff, seemed to offer a different kind of opening. It was easy to imagine that a single phone call, coming from the right person, could redirect a major policy initiative. Some of the old firms would do O.K., Lewandowski thought \u2014 the ones that had relationships in Congress, that understood the intricate ballet of lawmaking. But the real action, he was betting, would be at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018I think this particular administration is really going to be driving the agenda,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Not Congress.\u2019\u2019On a balmy spring day in April, I met Stryk and a few of his colleagues on a terrace at the Army-Navy Country Club, a sprawling and immaculate golf club near the Pentagon; S.P.G. still didn\u2019t have a proper office. Stryk wore cowboy boots and a T-shirt under a rumpled black sport coat. Most of K Street, he told me, was \u2018\u2018a washing machine. Money just goes from one firm to another. No one creates any new wealth.\u2019\u2019 Stryk\u2019s own politics leaned libertarian, he told me; despite his firm\u2019s ties to the Trump team, he didn\u2019t think of himself as particularly Trumpy. One of the new hires, a Democratic foreign-policy veteran, had been good friends with Paul Wellstone, the liberal senator who died in 2002. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re here for the opportunities,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Not for the ideology.\u2019\u2019Stryk was focusing not on nervous companies but on nervous countries. He and his new team had made a list of the governments S.P.G. wanted to work for \u2014 NATO allies mostly, nothing iffy like Ukraine or Pakistan \u2014 and with New Zealand as his calling card, they pitched S.P.G. as the go-to foreign lobbying and advisory firm in Trump\u2019s Washington. Historically, foreign lobbying has been a specialized business dominated by a few big firms. Stryk viewed them as he viewed the rest of the lobbying industry: as a cartel ripe for disruption. Stryk pitched his clients policy expertise, round-the-clock work habits and personalized service.Stryk believed his team could penetrate the uncertainty surrounding the White House. He wanted to be a \u2018\u2018calming resource for foreign countries and businesses,\u2019\u2019 he told me \u2014 and there was a lot of calming to do. Over the course of a few months, the new president had managed to start a trade war with Canada, picked a fight with the prime minister of Australia and hinted that the United States might need to pull out of NATO. He also wanted to slash the State Department budget, and through the spring and summer, many senior jobs at State would remain unfilled. Everyone, even close allies, was looking for Sherpas and back doors. R. Nicholas Burns, the veteran American diplomat, told me that Trump\u2019s denuded State Department had left diplomats from perhaps a hundred countries \u2014 most of them smaller nations \u2014 without their traditional liaison to the United States government. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s never been anything like this, ever,\u2019\u2019 Burns said.Trump\u2019s statecraft had a way of generating new business in other ways, too. The president of the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, was not a popular figure in Barack Obama\u2019s Washington: A right-wing populist who preached closer ties to Russia, he once banned the United States ambassador from Prague Castle, the Czech seat of government. Trump, naturally, invited him to Washington, and Zeman\u2019s government hired Stryk\u2019s firm to help plan the state visit. New Zealand needed to talk to the administration about a new bilateral trade agreement, now that Trump was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Korean trade association wanted help planning a conference in Washington but didn\u2019t know anyone in the Trump White House. Stryk\u2019s people got on the phone, cold-calling around the Commerce Department to find a senior official who would speak at the event. \u2018\u2018Most lobbyists are afraid of a \u2018no,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018A \u2018no\u2019 means you have no juice. I\u2019m not afraid of \u2018no.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019But Stryk\u2019s greatest coup was Saudi Arabia. Gulf-state oligarchs spend tens of millions of dollars a year lobbying in Washington and larding influential think tanks with grant money, and Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest spenders. The country\u2019s then-crown prince and minister of the interior, Mohammed bin Nayef, was an exception: He enjoyed deep ties to the American intelligence apparatus under President Obama and had never needed a lobbyist. This spring, however, Trump invited Nayef\u2019s chief rival \u2014 Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and the king\u2019s son \u2014 to a formal White House lunch. The lunch sent ripples through Riyadh. Did Trump favor Salman? Accidentally or on purpose, Trump had just waded into Saudi Arabia\u2019s treacherous succession politics. Nayef found himself in need of guidance.In May, S.P.G. signed a contract to provide \u2018\u2018congressional and executive branch brand engagement\u2019\u2019 to the Saudi Ministry of the Interior \u2014 Nayef\u2019s domain. Stryk did not want to reveal much about his work for the Saudis, but lobbying records show that the fee was $5.4 million, payable up front.That was the other thing about foreign lobbying: It paid even better than corporate lobbying. Inevitably, Stryk had competition.Basha was the young chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, the country\u2019s conservative party, which was looking to unseat the ruling Socialist Party in elections scheduled for June. Basha borrowed liberally from Trump\u2019s playbook; he had attacked the Socialists for being in bed with crime syndicates and, simultaneously, with George Soros, whose foundation was active in Albania. His slogan was \u2018\u2018Make Albania Great Again.\u2019\u2019 Now, according to Bennett, Basha wanted help beating the Socialists in June \u2014 and who better to advise him than a couple of Trump-campaign veterans? Bennett told me that it was a cordial meeting and that he later sent Basha a proposed contract. \u2018\u2018I told him we\u2019d love to be his political consultant,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said. (Through a representative, Basha declined to comment.)Through an intermediary, the Albanian Democrats also reached out to Ballard, who was making his own push into foreign lobbying. He had brought on board a couple of partners with experience in Eastern Europe and Latin America, including a former Democratic congressman and a former ambassador. \u2018\u2018They called me,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of Basha\u2019s party. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t know Albania in an atlas.\u2019\u2019 Ballard told them he couldn\u2019t help them. He was already working with the Albanian Socialists.When a friend referred the Socialists to him, Ballard told me, he had two questions. \u2018\u2018I asked: \u2018Is it a democracy?\u2019 Yes. \u2018Are they an ally of the U.S.?\u2019 Yes.\u2019\u2019 The Socialists had a story that was becoming increasingly familiar in Washington. After Trump won, most of the American diplomats their government had worked with seemed to vanish, and no one replaced them. One Albanian official, who asked not to be identified by name, told me his government felt that \u2018\u2018we had to increase our presence in Washington.\u2019\u2019 I asked him how his government picked Ballard. \u2018\u2018The internet makes it easy,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018You just Google.\u2019\u2019But as companies and countries vied for Trump\u2019s ear over the spring, the new Trump lobbyists found themselves competing with one another as much as with the established Washington firms. Ballard, for example, had explored working for members of the Venezuelan opposition. (\u2018\u2018I\u2019m no world-peace guy,\u2019\u2019 he told me, \u2018\u2018but I think I can help a little bit.\u2019\u2019) Lewan\u00addowski\u2019s firm, meanwhile, was pitching Citgo, the American subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company. (Avenue eventually signed Citgo, and in August the Trump administration would partly exempt the company from a new round of sanctions on the Venezuelan government.) Ballard was also working out a $1.5 million contract with Turkey \u2014 which put him up against Brad Gerstman, Trump\u2019s old New York guy. Gerstman\u2019s firm, Gotham Government Relations, had signed up a company linked to Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom the Turkish government blames for fomenting last year\u2019s failed coup.Not many lobbyists wanted to represent the Gulenists, partly because Trump appeared to have already picked a side. When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey won a widely disputed referendum in April granting himself expanded powers, Trump called to congratulate him. When Erdogan visited the White House some weeks later, Trump praised the bravery of Turkish soldiers and talked about beating ISIS together.I watched Erdogan and Trump\u2019s joint news conference on TV with Gerst\u00adman, who had been hired to spread the word about Erdogan\u2019s worldwide oppression of Gulenists. When Erdogan referred to the Gulen \u2018\u2018terrorist organization,\u2019\u2019 you could see Trump purse his lips during the translation, then nod a few times. It wasn\u2019t totally clear what the president was nodding about. Gerstman remained hopeful. \u2018\u2018Our view is that six months from now, everything is going to look different,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s fluid. It\u2019s dynamic.\u2019\u2019 He looked thoughtful. \u2018\u2018One thing we know about President Trump is he\u2019s not afraid to change.\u2019\u2019Stryk was having his own qualms. Lewandowski had beaten him on some pitches, Stryk was told by prospective clients, by promising that he could get Trump on the phone \u2014 a promise Stryk felt he could not make. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t sell access to Trump,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know Donald Trump.\u2019\u2019 He was increasingly impatient with the notion that he was simply providing entree to the new administration. He was in negotiations to acquire a small design and branding firm. He saw S.P.G. evolving into something bigger and more stable, a full-service \u2018\u2018advisory\u2019\u2019 company that could compete with the most sophisticated shops on K Street \u2014 and beyond. Stryk saw Lewandowski\u2019s firm, and some of the others associated with the new administration, as short-term plays. They could sell access or surf the disruption, but he aimed to outlast it. \u2018\u2018Do they have business outside of this Trump phenomenon?\u2019\u2019 Stryk mused. \u2018\u2018The talk around town is, how long does this last before the business goes back to the establishment?\u2019\u2019Among the new arrivals, Ballard, at least, was doing pretty well. After only a few months in Washington, he had signed up more than 30 clients: energy companies, insurers, Amazon, American Airlines. The new Washington office would soon be on track to make $15 million in 2017, almost as much as his firm reported making in Florida last year. Ballard, unlike some of his competitors, was at ease in the swamp. He didn\u2019t want to beat the Washington establishment; he was here to join it. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no big firm that should worry about us,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me. \u2018\u2018We augment other people, or they augment us. The Trump guys are not going to take over the town.\u2019\u2019If anything, the Trump guys were learning the downsides of proximity to the president. By spring, the Justice Department had appointed a special counsel to probe Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an investigation that would quickly reach into the president\u2019s inner circle. The various White House factions seemed to spend as much time planting negative press on one another as they did figuring out what the president should do. When the White House got involved in big legislative battles, like the Obamacare repeal effort, it tended to hurt, not help.Proximity was proving an especially mixed blessing for Lewandowski. A stream of news stories had detailed promises he was supposedly making to clients, which he mostly denied \u2014 not just phone calls with Trump but also visits with White House officials and even access to Trump\u2019s Twitter account. In late April, Politico reported that Lewan\u00addowski and Bennett also owned another, separate company called Washington East West Political Strategies. This new firm, a vehicle for overseas consulting, had circulated at least one written proposal promising to arrange meetings with Trump and other administration officials, seeming to undercut Lewandowski\u2019s earlier denials. I later obtained a copy of the proposal, which named the potential client: Edi Rama, Albania\u2019s Socialist prime minister. The new firm \u2014 or as Bennett later explained, a business associate in Europe, acting without authorization \u2014 had pitched opposing candidates in the same campaign.Official Washington professed itself to be aghast at Lewandowski, who did not bother to couch his sales pitches in the Beltway\u2019s customary euphemisms: He was what they pretended not to be. Ethics watchdogs cast him as living proof of the hollowness of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski disagreed. In his view, the swamp was the sprawling, unresponsive bureaucracy, not the people you paid to help you get your phone calls returned. Still, friends of Lewandowski\u2019s told me that White House officials had advised him to keep a lower profile.By that point, it was hard to know exactly how well Avenue was doing. As the summer recess drew near, the firm had disclosed fewer than 10 lobbying clients. Among them were a San Diego-based environmental consulting firm and an Ohio payday lender \u2014 valuable clients, but not quite blue-chip. For every Whirlpool that asked Lewandowski for help, his rivals told me, there was another big company that decided he was too radioactive. Lockheed never actually signed a contract with Avenue; when news leaked of Lewandowski\u2019s role in advising it on Trump, a Lockheed spokesman issued a carefully worded statement that \u2018\u2018Lockheed has not retained Lewandowski, or his lobbying firm.\u2019\u2019 In the same way that most big chief executives turned up their noses at Trump during the campaign but now hoped he would deliver tax reform and sweeping deregulation, they wanted Lewandowski\u2019s help without being too closely associated with him.Then, too, Lewandowski\u2019s clout wasn\u2019t always what he promised. Puerto Rico\u2019s government, for example, hired Avenue to help ease the island\u2019s fiscal crisis. But the job pitted Lewandow\u00adski against a coalition of hedge funds that owned much of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, and whose former lobbyist Trump had installed on his National Economic Council. The swamp\u2019s old guard prevailed: In late April, as Puerto Rican officials were begging Congress for more federal funding, Trump publicly dismissed their cause in his trademark fashion. \u2018\u2018Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars,\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2018\u2018Sad!\u2019\u2019In a sense, Lewandowski\u2019s biggest problem was the president himself. Lewandowski had bet that the White House would be the center of energy and action in Trump\u2019s Washington, but instead the Trump administration was being swallowed by its own chaos. Divided by factions and backbiting, unable to wield full control of the bureaucracy or execute on many of its own ambitions, the administration was in danger of becoming a minor player in the policy debates of the day. Many companies were coming to the conclusion that on complex issues like tax reform, their energies were better directed at lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2014 and their money better spent at the traditional lobbying firms stocked with ex-lawmakers and their former aides.Moreover, despite Trump\u2019s campaign pledges, many of the agencies he now oversaw had proved more than friendly to the legions of longtime Beltway lobbyists working for the energy, telecommunications and other industries. In many cases, Trump had hired them outright: By the summer, he had appointed more than 100 lobbyists to jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Federal Communications Commission and elsewhere. Their old clients didn\u2019t need much help from the new Trump guys on K Street. They already knew exactly whom to call.Perhaps that\u2019s why the traditional lobbying shops were doing just fine. As for protecting clients from Trump\u2019s Twitter howitzer \u2014 well, that had turned out to be easier than it looked, several lobbyists told me: Just show up in person, promise the president you\u2019ll create some jobs and publicly give him the credit. \u2018\u2018You make it about Trump and you link it to jobs, and you could be Russia or China and he will support you,\u2019\u2019 one told me. \u2018\u2018It is that unsophisticated.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There it is,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said, a little halfheartedly, pointing out the window. His day had not gotten off to a great start. That morning, Puerto Rico had filed for a territorial version of bankruptcy. A prominent watchdog group had sent a letter to the Justice Department asking officials there to investigate why Lewandowski had never registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a World War II-era law that imposes stringent disclosure requirements on Americans representing foreign governments in Washington. (Though Bennett and other Avenue employees had registered as lobbyists, Lewandowski insisted that most of his business was advising clients on strategy, not setting up meetings or contacting officials on their behalf, the kind of work that requires you to register.) Politico had struck again, revealing Avenue\u2019s Citgo contract. Technically, the United States-based company was owned by the left-wing government of Venezuela, whose vice president the Trump administration had accused of drug trafficking.Lewandowski told me he didn\u2019t work directly for foreign governments, notwithstanding the stories and documents. Not that he wouldn\u2019t be good at it \u2014 you know, if he wanted to. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t work for foreign governments, but if I were a foreign government, and I wanted to hire people who understood how to get to the president, there are a small number of people I would think of,\u2019\u2019 Lewan\u00addowski said. As he spoke, he seemed to recover his familiar brio. \u2018\u2018The establishment is so afraid of President Trump they will do anything. Which includes hiring individuals who have purported to be tied to the White House who really aren\u2019t.\u2019\u2019The next day, Lewandowski announced he was quitting Avenue. In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg, he explained that Bennett and their employees had been using his name to drum up business he didn\u2019t want, exposing him to criticism and sullying his reputation. He insisted he had never asked Trump for anything. \u2018\u2018People want to see me fail,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski grumbled.\u2018\u2018I feel bad for Corey,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me when I went to see him the following week. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But he\u2019s a lightning rod.\u2019\u2019 Bob Dole, he pointed out, had just signed a $500,000 contract for work on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a violence-racked country run by a kleptocratic strongman. But no one in Washington gave Bob Dole a hard time.\u2018\u2018He thought he could go in\u2019\u2019 \u2014 into the White House \u2014 \u2018\u2018during the second wave,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said of Lewandowski. K Street was just a way station for him, Bennett suggested, while he waited for the only job he truly wanted \u2014 the one he could picture when he gazed out his window, down Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018Looking back on it, he probably should never have owned a chunk of a lobbying firm. In the media\u2019s mind, every client we had was Corey\u2019s client.\u2019\u2019 But even with Lewandowski gone, Bennett said, there was plenty of work. \u2018\u2018All of K Street is doing well right now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Chaos is good for everyone\u2019s business.\u2019\u2019Not long ago, Stryk opened a proper Washington office, right in Georgetown, a stone\u2019s throw from the Four Seasons. The new space was undecorated and unmarked, and there wasn\u2019t much there yet but a couple of laptops. But Stryk was buoyant. He was about to sign two more big foreign lobbying clients, the governments of Afghanistan and Kenya, along with a pharmaceutical firm. Saudi Arabia had canceled its S.P.G. contract after Stryk\u2019s client, the crown prince, was deposed in a palace reshuffle, and New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry had decided that its embassy no longer needed Stryk\u2019s services. But in Stryk\u2019s view, these were just hiccups. Competitors around town \u2014 big firms that had never given him the time of day \u2014 were starting to ask around about S.P.G., wondering who they were and how they were getting so much business.In about a month, Trump\u2019s ham-handed defense of white nationalists and white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville would prompt most of the chief executives serving on White House advisory councils to quit in protest. It would cost the chief executives something, losing their face time with this impressionable, transactional president \u2014 and their loss would be K Street\u2019s gain. Those same companies would now just rely more on their lobbyists, or on the trade associations they belonged to, to drive their agendas.But as we sat down in his new conference room, Stryk was already looking beyond the Beltway. He saw Trump\u2019s disruption spreading beyond Washington, to foreign capitals and overseas markets. The chaos in Trump\u2019s government was creating a vacuum abroad, one that entrepreneurs like Stryk could fill with deal-making and private diplomacy. \u2018\u2018I want to grow a business that\u2019s 200 million a year,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to get that arranging dinners in Washington.\u2019\u2019The new contracts with Afghanistan and Kenya, Stryk explained, were prototypes for the kind of business he wanted to do, an escape from the washing machine. The Afghans and the Kenyans didn\u2019t just want help with the Trump administration. They wanted help with everything: attracting American investment, troubleshooting problems in other foreign capitals, finding companies that could build them roads or manage their health care records.So recently, Stryk had begun pitching investors on a new venture: a $5 billion private-equity fund that would specialize in infrastructure and procurement. One side of the business, the lobbying, would identify government customers abroad; the other side would invest in companies that could deliver what those governments needed. Secure voting systems, border-security hardware \u2014 the opportunities were limitless. \u2018\u2018It is our job, as conservatives and capitalists, to take the chaos and do with it what we can,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Our goal is to take an environment that was created by the president and use it to \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused for a second, thinking. \u2018\u2018To do some good.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "J.C. Aragone Tried Tennis Again, and Landed in the U.S. Open", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAnd then the phone rang,\u201d he said.Aragone, 22, got good news and capitalized, winning all three of his qualifying matches to earn a berth in the main draw as the 534th-ranked player in the world. His run was stirring enough to capture the attention of fans who gathered to watch his first-round match against Kevin Anderson on Monday afternoon.But there was more to the story. The part about how Aragone was comatose for three weeks at age 16. The part about how he was found to have diabetes. The part about how he missed three years of competitive tennis. The part about how he needed a ticket just to attend the Open last summer. And the part about how he was just months removed from playing No. 5 singles \u2014 No. 5! \u2014 for the powerhouse tennis program at the University of Virginia.But there he was on Monday, taking his place on one of the sport\u2019s biggest stages against Anderson, a former top-10 player who ended the party with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 victory.\u201cMy blood sugar was all over the place,\u201d said Aragone, who needed an insulin injection after the first set. \u201cBut that was easy.\u201dAnderson and his enormous serve were the bigger problems. But Aragone came away from the match with experience to build upon \u2014 and also left $50,000 richer for making it to the main draw.\u201cReally, I wasn\u2019t expecting this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came out of nowhere.\u201dAragone, who grew up in Yorba Linda, Calif., was a highly regarded junior player \u2014 talented enough that he was weighing whether to turn professional as a teenager. But in 2011, a respiratory infection brought on by an adverse drug reaction landed him in intensive care. The diabetes diagnosis soon followed. He was in and out of hospitals for nearly two years. He did not pick up a racket for nearly three. His parents, Paula and Facundo, watched him waste away.\u201cHe lost a lot of weight, a lot of muscle,\u201d Paula Aragone said. \u201cAnd he had a lot of problems with his heart because of the complications.\u201dHer son\u2019s return to tennis was gradual, but he displayed enough promise for Virginia to offer him a scholarship. He won consistently, helping Virginia win three straight national championships.But as recently as last summer, with his senior season at Virginia still ahead of him, Aragone had more or less shelved his dream of playing pro tennis. He was working as an intern for JPMorgan Chase in New York, hoping to prepare for a career in finance. His only appearance at the Open was a spectator.\u201cI was in a suit,\u201d he said.Once he returned to college, though, his game and his confidence continued to grow. He graduated this spring with the gnawing feeling that he still had more to give. His parents offered their support.\u201cHe thought he should get a job,\u201d Paula Aragone said. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s too much work to go onto the pro circuit.\u2019 But we told him, \u2018No, you love it. Go do it.\u2019 So he said, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll give it a try.\u2019\u201dSince June, Aragone has crisscrossed the globe to play in low-level tournaments in Spain, Portugal and Canada, in addition to several closer to home. Nothing against Winnetka, Ill., and Binghamton, N.Y., but the sport\u2019s minor leagues are not altogether glamorous.\u201cMy original goal was to give myself a year,\u201d Aragone said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m still sticking with a year because I\u2019ve spent 10 weeks on the road and it\u2019s been the hardest 10 weeks of my life.\u201dBut there have been payoffs, too \u2014 starting with his extended week in Queens.When Aragone learned that he had squeezed into the qualifying tournament here at the Open, his parents monitored his results from home in California. After he won his second match, Paula and Facundo Aragone took a red-eye flight to New York on Thursday night so they could watch his final qualifying match on Friday. After a celebratory lunch, they made their way back to the airport so they could fly home. (Paula Aragone, who works as a real estate agent, had an open house the next day.) They returned to New York on Sunday.\u201cWhat else were we going to do?\u201d Paula Aragone asked. \u201cWe had a kid playing in the main draw!\u201dJ.C. Aragone had a full section of support for his match against Anderson. In addition to his parents, several former teammates and coaches from Virginia made the trip into the city. Another former teammate, Thai-Son Kwiatkowski, the reigning N.C.A.A. singles champion, also had a first-round match on Monday.\u201cYou see the level of play here and you\u2019re like, \u2018Come on,\u2019\u201d Aragone said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve realized that I have the potential and the game to compete.

The mystery of \u201cChief Zabu\u201d has been solved.While admitting to an impish sense of humor, Mr. Norman protested, \u201cI don\u2019t think I was so mean as that.\u201dBut what of the movie itself? \u201cIt\u2019s about a New York real estate developer who has dreams of political influence,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, and not surprisingly, the impetus to finally get back to the project stemmed from a dinner conversation the filmmakers had when Donald J. Trump first began campaigning for office.\u201cTrump reminded us of Sammy!\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s actually a shot of one of Donald Trump\u2019s father\u2019s buildings in Queens, the Trump Pavilion, in the movie.\u201d He told Mr. Norman, \u201cIf we cut 15 minutes from the movie based on what we\u2019ve learned about filmmaking and humanity in the past 30 years and apply that to recutting the movie, we might have something.\u201dAfter unveiling the new cut in Santa Monica, Calif., last fall, then taking it to the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival in Florida, the two decided it would be more useful \u2014 and more fun \u2014 to take the picture on a comedy-club tour. Some of the movie\u2019s scenes were actually shot at StandUp NY, the club where the film will be shown Thursday. (Mr. Norman\u2019s performing career always had at least a foot in stand-up.)It\u2019s not exactly what they envisioned all those years ago. A struggling actor in the early \u201960s, Mr. Norman dropped out of the business and took up real estate. \u201cI became a very rich guy in a couple of years,\u201d he said, but he was miserable. He returned to show business as an actor and producer, adopting the name Howard Zuker for behind-the-scenes work. \u201cBecause I now knew a lot about things such as tax shelters and depreciation, I was able to start financing movies.\u201dIn 1976 he found himself at the Sherry-Netherland hotel, where real-estate sharks, celebrities and other moneyed sorts had assembled to hear a pitch that involved gaining control of Namibia and promoting it as a tourist attraction by fixing an election in favor of a government opponent. Mr. Norman thought there was a movie in this kind of hustle, and worked up a script with his friend Mr. Cohen, then a talent agent and writer. The cast included the great character actor Allen Garfield (\u201cNashville\u201d), and their production was joined by people Mr. Garfield knew through the Actors Studio, including Allan Arbus and Ed Lauter.The film showing Thursday is a newly edited version. It\u2019s a freewheeling, gently funny New York shaggy-dog story in which the avid Sammy teams up with the rather more skeptical Ben (Mr. Garfield) to corner the market in lots on a Polynesian island with the help of the title character (Manu Tupou), whom they intend to make a puppet ruler. Various intrigues, both financial and sexual, ensue.While not necessarily an instant classic, it has an eccentric quality that\u2019s in keeping with the mystique that\u2019s built up around it.Mr. Norman and Mr. Cohen plan to tour the movie more extensively this fall, but already are gratified by the response it\u2019s received at West Coast comedy clubs.\u201cWhen we were making it, we understood that we had one audience, middle-aged guys who understood the world we were making fun of,\u201d Mr. Norman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great surprise to see young audiences getting it now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Wish List for New Restaurants", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookFor poets, autumn may be a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, but for restaurant critics it is time to get cracking. Reading those long lists of new places to eat in New York and around the country, I stare hopelessly at my calendar, trying to figure out if there might be a way to squeeze an extra two or three nights into each week.There\u2019s not. I\u2019ve tried.So when people ask me what I\u2019d like to see in the fall crop of openings, I don\u2019t say, \u201cMore restaurants.\u201d But I do find myself hoping for different restaurants, or restaurants run differently, by a wider and more diverse range of operators.A few years ago I would look at these lists and, if a good number of projects were backed by big restaurant groups with a strong track record, I\u2019d take it as a sign that an interesting season was in the wings. Now I\u2019m less sure. What I see more and more is the way power accrues to chefs who are already powerful, while independent restaurants struggle to get going.Of course, I\u2019ll end up reviewing many projects from the groups at the top of the ladder, and chances are that a lot of those reviews will be positive. (The big groups got big by knowing what they\u2019re doing.) But I\u2019ll also be looking at the lower rungs of the ladder for a chance to celebrate fresh, individual points of view.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.It\u2019s wonderful that all these interesting guys are willing to help. It would be even more wonderful if having a hand in these high-profile projects gave them an appetite for backing other talented chefs and restaurateurs who don\u2019t have such an easy time getting financing. Maybe they will want to start something in neighborhoods that make banks skittish.Real-estate developers can get in on the action, too. They have seized local government incentives to build major projects, creating dense populations almost overnight in areas where there isn\u2019t a lot to eat. Many of these high-rises have restaurant spaces down below, which give the developers an opportunity to nudge gentrification in another direction.The days when female servers were scarce in the dining rooms of formal restaurants should be over, and more people of color should be working at jobs besides busing tables and filling water glasses.Another signal, of course, is keeping the prices low. Expensive restaurants can be a treat, when they\u2019re good. But prestige in the restaurant business has been derived by high prices for too long. Chefs and restaurateurs know all kinds of tricks for keeping costs on a short leash. Now a few are using that knowledge to open places that are truly affordable.Not everybody can run a nonprofit. We all need to earn a living. But the restaurant business has become a cultural obsession, and people who are talented and lucky enough to have had some success in it don\u2019t have to devote their lives to feeding the same sliver of society over and over. The world is too big for that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Leaders Look to Africa to Stem Migration", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Measures intended to stop migrants from trying to cross the Mediterranean were at the center of discussions among four European leaders who met in Paris with the leaders of three African countries on Monday.The meeting, billed as a mini-summit, brought together the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Spain as well as Chad and Niger and one of Libya\u2019s leaders.The proposed measures include European-financed development programs to spur job growth; help for Chad and Niger with border controls; European Union funds to provide \u201chumane care\u201d for migrants in Libya; and a system to allow migrants making asylum claims to receive a preliminary review while they are in Chad or Niger. The goal is to discourage those whose claims are weak from trying to make the journey.Strategies to reduce migrants in the Mediterranean Sea may have made the journey more treacherous.While European leaders repeatedly said the measures were aimed at protecting migrants from the abuses of traffickers, they appeared at least as focused on shifting to African nations some of the burden of halting illegal migration.It is unclear if the proposals outlined Monday will require additional expenditures. Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs and security policy chief, who attended the meeting in Paris, said there was no need for \u201cto invent a new Marshall Plan\u201d for Africa since the European Union and individual European countries together already invest some 20 billion euros (about $24 billion) annually in African development aid and other programs.Any European Union funds or programs might require the approval of other member countries.Another spur for the policies agreed to Monday is the recent success that Italy has had in reducing the number of migrants arriving on its shores, said President Emmanuel Macron of France. He praised the Italian efforts to work with Libya\u2019s coast guard. \u201cWhat has been done by Italy and Libya is a perfect example of what we are aiming for,\u201d Mr. Macron said.Italy\u2019s policies have involved pushing Libya to crack down on traffickers and stopping ships operated by nongovernmental organizations that rescue migrants when their boats sink or capsize unless the organizations meet strict requirements.While the exact reasons for the drop are unclear, Mr. Minniti\u2019s strong hand appears to be paying off. His office released a statement after he met with the African officials expressing satisfaction with the Paris meeting\u2019s Africa-focused agenda. Mr. Minniti has invested heavily in alliances with African power brokers, Libyan tribal leaders and mayors of towns afflicted by trafficking.In a recent interview, Mr. Minniti said that in earlier meetings with Libyan mayors, they discussed \u201ca type of pact.\u201d\u201cYou help us stop human traffickers,\u201d he recounted telling them, \u201cand we will help free you from the blackmail of the human traffickers. Because in this moment, the human trafficking is an economic circuit. It\u2019s perhaps one of the few businesses that works in Libya, and like all business, it pays salaries \u2014 naturally criminal salaries. To challenge this criminal income, you have to create a transparent income. Good money that drives away the bad money.\u201dNot everyone in Italy is comfortable with the tough approach. Last week, the police in Rome used water cannon as they evicted hundreds of migrants, many of whom had been granted refugee status, from an apartment building they had illegally occupied for years in the center of town. Critics called the removals inhumane and unfair, because Italy failed to help provide many of the migrants with housing after they attained legal status as refugees.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Samsung Executive Awaits Verdict, Company Surges", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Samsung Electronics became the world\u2019s most profitable technology company last month, its de facto leader was in jail.Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman and heir apparent to Samsung Group, faces charges that he bribed South Korean government officials to solidify his family\u2019s control of one of the world\u2019s biggest business empires. On Monday, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Lee should be sentenced to 12 years in prison.Samsung, by contrast, appears to be doing just fine without its boss. The conglomerate\u2019s electronics arm made $10 billion in profit last quarter, thanks in part to strong demand for its chips. Samsung has also begun to cast aside the cloud that fell over it last year when its Galaxy Note 7, a high-priced smartphone meant to challenge the Apple iPhone but which showed a proclivity to burst into flames, became one of the technology world\u2019s most spectacular failures.The question is how long Samsung can travel down both of these paths.Should Mr. Lee go to prison, or if his reputation is too badly damaged, experts say it remains unclear whether the cadre of professional managers that reports to the Lees can make the strategic decisions needed to keep Samsung on the rise.\u201cSamsung\u2019s recent performance has little to do with senior management,\u201d said Kim Woochan, a professor of finance at Korea University Business School in Seoul. \u201cIt\u2019s riding on the coattails of a rebounding semiconductor industry.\u201dMr. Lee said that he committed no crime but that as a senior figure at Samsung, he felt \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the scandal.\u201cI used to make a pledge to myself that when I am fully in charge of management, I would do things properly, abide by the law and do things right as well as become a businessman respected by society and people,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cI am filled with many emotions that I stand in court before I could live up to my words.\u201dNone of it seems to have slowed down Samsung in the short term.\u201cIn terms of crisis management, the company has been learning quite fast,\u201d said Yoo-Kyung Park, a specialist in corporate governance at APG Asset Management, a Dutch pension-fund firm that owns Samsung Electronics shares.Ms. Park credited Samsung Electronics managers for quickly cauterizing the wound left by the Galaxy Note 7. Many Korean companies, she said, would have been more reluctant to acknowledge failure \u2014 an approach she characterized as \u201cdelay, and deny, deny, deny\u201d \u2014 but Samsung scrapped the phone, absorbed the cost and moved on.Consumers seem to have moved on, too: The Galaxy S8, the next major product to launch after the Galaxy Note 7, is selling well, helping contribute to Samsung\u2019s rebound.In contrast, Apple, the perennial industry leader, earned $8.7 billion in the same period, though analysts expect Apple\u2019s profit to be larger than Samsung\u2019s for the year.Analysts say Samsung is also reaping rewards from past investments. A decade ago it plowed money into semiconductors and digital displays, crucial components of smartphones and other modern devices, and today it is the world\u2019s leading producer of both, with revenues to match.Even if Mr. Lee is not convicted, South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in, has promised to take steps to weaken dynastic control over the conglomerates, or chaebol, that dominate the Korean economy.The court proceedings, which prosecutors have billed as the \u201ctrial of the century,\u201d lasted four months and have been obsessively followed by the South Korean news media and public. Some of its 53 sessions finished after midnight. Fifty-nine witnesses appeared, including Mr. Lee, other Samsung executives and former cabinet members. Ms. Park refused to testify.Prosecutors on Monday accused Mr. Lee of deflecting blame onto subordinates. Earlier in the trial, Choi Gee-sung, the former chief of Samsung\u2019s Future Strategy Office, testified that he had signed off on donations to foundations controlled by Ms. Choi without informing Mr. Lee.Mr. Kim, the professor, said the trial and surrounding scandal had shown that, at the very least, Mr. Lee was not fit to run Samsung. But he predicted, based on the history of Samsung and other chaebol whose founders have fallen into legal trouble, that Mr. Lee would try to make a comeback regardless.\u201cIf the shares had fallen, they could have made the argument\u201d that Mr. Lee was crucial to Samsung\u2019s performance, he said. \u201cBut this hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201dChaebol leaders rarely spend time in prison, despite a history of convictions. Lee Kun-hee was convicted of breach of trust in connection with business deals in the 1990s that allowed Lee Jae-yong to cheaply accumulate shares in Samsung companies, but he was later pardoned.Mr. Kim said that with political and social scrutiny of chaebol stronger now, the younger Mr. Lee could face a tougher road.\u201cThe entire nation is watching,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Steps Up Warnings Over Debt-Fueled Overseas Acquisitions", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China moved on Friday to curb investment overseas by its companies and conglomerates, issuing its strongest signal yet that it wants to rein in runaway debt that could pose a threat to the country\u2019s slowing economy.In the latest move, a statement published by China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, said the authorities would punish companies for violating foreign investment rules, and establish a blacklist of businesses that did so. The statement was attributed to the National Development and Reform Commission, the commerce ministry, the foreign ministry and the central bank.The statement pointed to acquisitions in sectors ranging from entertainment and sports clubs to hotels, but it was unclear whether or how the government would block deals.It reiterated a warning issued in December that restrictions on overseas investments were being imposed because of \u201cirrational\u201d investment trends.That statement said that the kinds of investments overseas it described were \u201cnot in accordance with macro-control policies.\u201d The government wants to \u201ceffectively guard against all sorts of risks,\u201d it said. The State Council document said the government nevertheless supported overseas investments in sectors such as oil and gas and in China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d program, which aims to promote infrastructure projects along the historic Silk Road trading route.\u201cIt\u2019s the loudest yet of wake-up calls that the government holds the keys to the lockbox of the country\u2019s wealth, public and private,\u201d Peter Fuhrman, chairman of China First Capital, an investment bank, said in an emailed response to questions. \u201cBad M&A is all but criminalized.\u201dA surge in overseas acquisitions by Chinese investors in recent years has ignited fears that soaring corporate debt levels could destabilize the country\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest, and further weaken its currency.Companies like Anbang Insurance Group, Fosun International, the HNA Group and Dalian Wanda Group have capitalized on cheap loans provided by state banks to snap up trophy assets such as the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and AMC Theaters.But while the latest statement from the State Council is likely to have an impact on mergers and deals, a lot of Chinese money is already offshore and thus not easily restricted by the government in Beijing, said Alexander Jarvis, chairman of Blackbridge Cross Borders, which has advised Chinese companies on several soccer acquisitions.\u201cDeals are still going to happen,\u201d Mr. Jarvis said. \u201cThere is plenty of Chinese capital overseas in offshore tax havens, in the U.S., across Europe, Hong Kong. I\u2019m not sure they can fully control that capital.\u201dGeoffrey Sant, a partner at New York-based law firm Dorsey and Whitney, said it is likely that the latest announcement from Beijing will result in a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d in overseas acquisitions.\u201cI think they are thinking there\u2019s a bit of irrational exuberance in the market right now and they just want to cool that off,\u201d said Mr. Sant, who represents Chinese companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to permanently ban some of these areas.\u201dIn recent months, the government has said it would increase scrutiny of companies\u2019 balance sheets, warning that some of the largest companies could pose a systemic risk to the economy.Encouraged by the slew of acquisitions made by some of the country\u2019s most powerful tycoons, many smaller Chinese companies started looking overseas, spurred by China\u2019s slowing economic growth to look for new markets.Many, however, had no experience running the businesses they were targeting. In one such example, Anhui Xinke New Materials, a copper processing company in central China, made a deal to buy Voltage Pictures, an American film financing and production firm, for $350 million. A month later, Anhui Xinke pulled out of the transaction.In other cases, it was not clear whether many of the big trophy acquisitions were actually good deals.\u201cI agree with the Chinese government. A lot of these deals are bad,\u201d said Mr. Jarvis.Companies have already started feeling the pinch of Beijing\u2019s clampdown on overseas investments, which started in earnest in December.Zhang Tiantian and Ryan McMorrow contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putting Art on Wheels and Taking It Back to the Streets", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Jaime Colsa owns a transport company that delivers ordinary consumer goods \u2014 computers, food, drinks. The contents of his trucks aren\u2019t eye-catching, but his vehicles certainly are, adorned with paintings showing cartoonlike faces, dogs, brightly colored geometric patterns, spirals and landscapes.\u201cThanks to people like Banksy, this kind of art has made its way into the gallery,\u201d Mr. Colsa, 45, said here recently. \u201cBut I thought it would be interesting and challenging to do the opposite \u2014 to get artists out of the gallery or the museum and actually back on the street.\u201dAbraham Lacalle, whose work has been shown at the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum here, painted what he called a truck\u2019s \u201cexplosion,\u201d inspired by thoughts of what could happen to the merchandise transported inside.Two years after completing his painting, Mr. Lacalle said in a phone interview that it was strange to see how trucks and vans had more recently also become associated with terrorism, after attacks in Nice, Berlin, London and, earlier this month, Barcelona.\u201cI painted with some sense of humor, imagining what could happen to the content of a truck in movement,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was then thinking about trucks as a tool of terrorism, so a work that was meant to be fun could now unintentionally appear pretty provocative.\u201dThe truck project was born when Mr. Colsa commissioned an artist, Okuda San Miguel, to paint a mural in 2013 on a warehouse for his company, Palibex, on the outskirts of Madrid. When it was done, Mr. Colsa told Mr. San Miguel that \u201cit was a real shame to have this great work on a warehouse that so few people then get to see it.\u201dThe conversation shifted to whether the painting could have been done on a vehicle rather than a wall. So far, Mr. Colsa has spent about \u20ac300,000, or around $327,000, on the truck project, which is overseen by two curators, Fer Franc\u00e9s and \u00d3scar Sanz.In some ways, Mr. Sanz said, the project was \u201ca wink to 30 years ago,\u201d when artists were decorating \u201cthe trains and trucks of New York.\u201d Some of those artists have become more established and also more used to painting on larger areas, like murals on buildings. But painting a truck is different.\u201cMovement makes it something of a fleeting vision,\u201d he said. And, he added, since many of the artists chosen used to tag trucks or subway cars (or had peers who did), they \u201cenjoyed the challenge of returning to where their kind of art started.\u201dAt first, Mr. Colsa said, the response was mixed, both from his drivers and some of his customers. One driver, he said, complained to management, because he believed that his truck had been vandalized and splashed with \u201chorrible paint.\u201d Attitudes, however, have changed.Some of the truckers \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand what kind of idiotic thing had been painted on their truck,\u201d Mr. Colsa said. \u201cBut they now see that people really watch them drive past and often photograph their truck, so they\u2019re delighted.\u201dAs the project has grown, more artists have been drawn to it, to the point that Mr. Colsa said he now has a waiting list of artists. Many of them, he said, were drawn to the project because of their interest in the unusual interaction between the artwork and the viewers.Again it comes down to movement. \u201cPaintings generate a very different experience depending on from where they are watched,\u201d he said. \u201cThe viewer normally does the moving to get to see the art, while we\u2019re bringing the art to him, in a very unexpected manner.\u201dThe artists can paint what they want, and also choose among the models in Mr. Colsa\u2019s fleet of trucks. \u201cSome artists prefer a smaller truck, especially if they work with paint brushes and oil,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile others specifically ask to work on the larger, long-distance trucks, also because they want to imagine how other drivers react when they overtake the truck on a highway.\u201dMr. Sanz, one of the curators, said there was interest in replicating the project overseas, including in the United States and Mexico.In June, Mr. Colsa withdrew the first two trucks that had been painted as part of his project, including Mr. San Miguel\u2019s, because of the wear-and-tear that the paintings had suffered. The more recent artwork, he said, would last longer because the artists were now using a stronger coating to protect their paintings.\u201cThey should last 10 or 12 years without needing any repainting, but not forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kind of work is meant to live, but also die at some stage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Peacekeepers in Lebanon Get Stronger Inspection Powers for Hezbollah Arms", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United Nations Security Council on Wednesday voted to renew the peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for another year after addressing American and Israeli complaints that the force was ignoring a Hezbollah arms buildup near Israel\u2019s border.The force\u2019s presence has helped keep the peace along the Israel-Lebanon border since the war between Israeli forces and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, 11 years ago.The annual renewal of the mandate for the force, known as the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or Unifil, had become a contentious issue in the council. It basically pitted the United States against members led by France, which has made significant troop contributions to Unifil.The United States had insisted that Unifil must be more muscular in policing Hezbollah weaponry, and had suggested that it would not agree to renewing the mandate without significant changes.France, along with other members, objected to any adjustments in Unifil\u2019s role \u2014 authorizing its soldiers to inspect private homes, for example \u2014 that would be seen as infringing on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty.Lebanon opposed any change in Unifil\u2019s role, but wanted the force to remain in the country. \u201cPreserving the mandate of @unifil is necessary for peace and stability, otherwise will jeopardize efforts of @UN,\u201d the foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, said in a Twitter posting on Tuesday.Under compromise language in a Security Council resolution reauthorizing the mandate, Unifil\u2019s soldiers will play a greater role in assisting Lebanon\u2019s military in keeping the border area secure. The resolution requests that Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres examine ways to \u201cincrease Unifil\u2019s visible presence, including through patrols and inspections.\u201dBoth Israel and the United States have grown increasingly strident in recent days over what they have described as a blatant buildup of Iranian weaponry by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon including hidden rockets. They have accused Unifil of turning a blind eye to it.Less than a week ago, Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, publicly criticized the Unifil commander, Maj. Gen Michael Beary of Ireland, accusing him of displaying \u201can embarrassing lack of understanding\u201d in not finding or reporting Hezbollah\u2019s weapons.Unifil has been deployed in Lebanon for nearly four decades but its mandate was widened to patrolling Lebanon\u2019s border with Israel after the 2006 war between Israeli forces and Hezbollah.Israel and the United States regard Hezbollah as a terrorist group, financed and armed by Iran, and sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction.The compromise language of the Unifil mandate renewal appeared to give all sides a way of saying they got what they wanted.\u201cThe status quo for Unifil was not acceptable, and we did not accept it,\u201d Ms. Haley said in remarks after the vote.\u201cThis resolution demands that Unifil step up its efforts at a moment when Hezbollah is stepping up theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cOur action today will help ensure that this peacekeeping mission has the power and the will to do its job.\u201dIsrael\u2019s ambassador, Danny Danon, called the renewed mandate\u201ca significant diplomatic achievement that could change the situation in southern Lebanon and expose the terror infrastructure that Hezbollah set up on the border with Israel.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Houses are spread far apart, thanks to the minimum two-acre zoning, and there are no sidewalks. Commercial development is largely limited to a single plaza in the town center, where the market, pharmacy, hardware store and sole restaurant are housed behind identical brick storefronts. In short, Weston is nothing like Westport. But the more the Finks looked around, the more it felt like home.\u201cWe were looking for more land, for the elbow room, the tranquillity,\u201d said Ms. Fink, 43, a planning consultant. \u201cBut Weston really isn\u2019t on the radar for most home buyers in the area. I think it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t have a train stop, and like we did, buyers look at towns up and down the train line.\u201dMs. Silver, 60, said she doesn\u2019t mind driving to Westport to shop and dine \u2014 she works there as the business manager for a public relations firm. Her husband, who owns restaurants in Manhattan, commutes from the Westport station.Dean Robert, a sales and marketing professional, and his wife, Susan, are on their second home in Weston, after moving there from New York 16 years ago. Its initial appeal was as a retreat from the city, but now that the couple has two children, Mr. Robert said, they have come to prize Weston\u2019s top-notch school system.\u201cThe value is incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe student-teacher ratios are low, the classrooms are designed with high technology. My daughter, who is 12 now, has blossomed in the school system.\u201d\u201cWhen you come into Weston, you breathe a sigh of relief,\u201d Ms. Daniel said. \u201cYou are not in traffic. You have a sense of being away from the hurly-burly of the world.\u201dThe median sales price of a single-family home for the year to date is $795,500, barely changed from the 2016 median of $793,500, according to multiple listing data compiled by Ms. Kelley. Prices tend to be higher in the lower half of Weston, which is closer to Westport and the Merritt Parkway.About 160 properties are currently listed, from $375,000 for a two-bedroom ranch built in 1930 to $2.94 million for a seven-bedroom, lodge-style house on almost eight acres.About a half-dozen new-construction properties are listed, at prices ranging from $1.4 million for a four-bedroom on an acre to $2.2 million for a six-bedroom on 2.5 acres.Weston has no condominiums or rental developments.The resistance to change that has long defined Weston has lessened of late, as newcomers push for various amenities. As first selectman, Ms. Daniel is trying to straddle the divide, agreeing with those who want, for example, sidewalks connecting the school campus with the town center, while reassuring others that the town is not headed for mass commercialization. Also up for discussion: a town green, a community center and cluster-style housing for retirees.Most commuters use one of two Metro-North stations in Westport: Westport and Green\u2019s Farms. The drive is about 10 to 15 minutes. The peak-time trip to Grand Central takes 70 to 80 minutes, and a monthly pass is $388.Advertisement"}

Rechnitz and Jeremiah Reichberg, giving money to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political campaigns offered a backstage pass to city government. They exchanged friendly emails with the mayor and got access to high-level officials to discuss business they had with the city.The emails further the notion that Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, was eager to do favors for campaign donors.Mr. Rechnitz, who owned real estate and aspired to be a developer, contributed the maximum amount to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral campaign in 2013. He and his friend, Mr. Reichberg, were placed on the mayor\u2019s inaugural committee, largely symbolic posts.After Mr. de Blasio took office in January 2014, Mr. Rechnitz made a large donation to the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit group created by the mayor to support his political agenda. In May 2014, Mr. Reichberg hosted a fund-raiser for the group at his home in Brooklyn, attended by Mr. de Blasio, where he raised $35,000.Later that year, Mr. Rechnitz gave $102,300 to back an effort by Mr. de Blasio to raise money for Democratic state senators in an unsuccessful effort to win control of that body.The emails start shortly after the inauguration. In February, the mayor invited Mr. Rechnitz to an event, and he replied that he would bring Mr. Reichberg. In March, Mr. Reichberg invited the mayor to a Purim celebration. In June, Mr. Rechnitz invited the mayor to a bris for his newborn son.On April 1, Mr. Rechnitz wrote to the mayor and said he wanted to recommend a candidate for buildings commissioner.\u201cI\u2019m all ears, Jona,\u201d Mr. de Blasio wrote back. He included his then chief of staff, Laura Santucci, in the email, and told Mr. Rechnitz to send details to both of them. Later emails included a letter and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from the candidate suggested by Mr. Rechnitz, but the person\u2019s name and other information were blacked out in the documents provided by City Hall.Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg also leveraged their access to Mr. de Blasio for their personal interests.At one point, Mr. Rechnitz spoke with top officials with the city and the Police Department about the city buying a property he owned in Brooklyn to create a new precinct station house. It is not clear from the emails what happened with that negotiation.At another point, Mr. Rechnitz asked for help with thousands of dollars in violations levied for using a building he owned on Madison Avenue as an illegal hotel \u2014 violations typically associated with improper use of apartments for online home sharing services.After a series of email exchanges in December 2014, Mr. Rechnitz arranged to meet with Elan Parra, the acting director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Special Enforcement, the agency responsible for investigating illegal hotel violations. Mr. Rechnitz missed the meeting, and Mr. Parra offered multiple dates to reschedule, finally agreeing to meet two days before Christmas.The emails do not reveal the outcome of that meeting.\u201cHis property remained the subject of enforcement action by the city,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cThe request did nothing to the city\u2019s enforcement approach.\u201dIn March 2014, Mr. Reichberg wrote to Dominic Williams, the chief of staff to First Deputy Mayor Anthony E. Shorris, to ask for help with about $650,000 in overdue water bills on a building in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. Mr. Reichberg claimed the building had been overcharged.It was not clear what relationship Mr. Reichberg had to the building or its owners, and the emails released by City Hall did not include a response from Mr. Williams.Mr. de Blasio has played down his contacts with the two men, saying that he did not know them before the fall of 2013.\u201cI had some conversations with them over the course of 2014, but really haven\u2019t had many conversations since the beginning of 2015,\u201d he said at a news conference in April 2016.And he insisted the men received no special benefit. \u201cSomeone who makes a donation, that\u2019s their choice; they should expect nothing in return,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cYou\u2019d like to believe people are making donations because they think someone would be a good leader.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He ran an advertising company in South Carolina in the 1990s, then got into the more lucrative business of running an institutional pharmacy in 2000, selling medications to nursing homes.He built a home on a golf course, the Tournament Players Club in Myrtle Beach, S.C. It was only after he sold the pharmacy business that he decided he liked the view from his windows and bought the course.\u201cThe PGA Tour was attempting to sell a number of properties,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, what a perfect opportunity. So I took some of the proceeds from the pharmacy and purchased the TPC Myrtle Beach,\u201d paying $7.5 million in 2006.\u201cMy backyard grew from half an acre to 369 acres.\u201dOwning a golf course is a luxury akin, for some people, to owning a vineyard or sports team. It may also come with a warning from friends and relatives.This was down 5.9 percent from a peak of nearly 16,000 courses in 2006, the culmination of a 20-year construction boom.But wealthy individuals still are attracted to course ownership \u2014 and some have great success with it. President Trump is one. He owns or manages 18 golf clubs in the United States and abroad, several of which have been host to major tournaments.It\u2019s probably not surprising that clubs, which require millions of dollars a year in upkeep, are not the highest-returning investment. But like vineyards to wine lovers, they are the fulfillment of a dream.Warren Stephens, chairman, chief executive and president of Stephens Inc., a privately held investment bank in Arkansas, came to course ownership with financial capital and knowledge of the country\u2019s best courses. His father, Jackson, was the fourth chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters tournament.\u201cI\u2019d been fortunate to be around a lot of great golf clubs over the years,\u201d said Mr. Stephens, who is a member of six clubs, including Cypress Point Club in Pebble Beach, Calif. \u201cIt was something I thought I could do.\u201dBut he needed time to do it. He bought 1,300 acres of wooded, rolling land in Roland, Ark., outside of Little Rock, in 2001. He began clearing land the next year and hired Tom Fazio, a well-known course architect, to design the club. In 2004, the Alotian Club opened, and the clubhouse opened the next year.Today, the Alotian is ranked the 27th best course in the United States by Golf Digest. It has only 200 members and remains dedicated to golf alone. It has attracted professional golfers like Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.In Mr. Stephens\u2019s case, he was building a course where he could buy all the land he needed. Eric Bergstol had a different challenge in his quest to put a high-caliber golf course close to Manhattan.Mr. Bergstol, who started as a residential developer, had already built several clubs in the New Jersey and New York suburbs and had learned from his mistakes. The biggest lesson, he said, was to make sure he had financing before he started construction.With Bayonne Golf Club, four miles by boat from Manhattan, Mr. Bergstol struck a deal to take and clean the fill being dredged from New York Harbor. That took some bite out of what he said was $130 million to build a golf club on top of a former waste dump \u2014 albeit one with views of the New York skyline and strong winds to challenge golfers.The club opened in 2006, and he said he was fortunate to have a number of members committed before the financial crash. Initiation fees then, he said, were $100,000.While not as many helicopters shuttle executives across the Hudson these days, he said the club still runs a boat to bring members and guests across. \u201cThis was a moment in time,\u201d said Mr. Bergstol, who also designed the course. \u201cThis type of project can never happen again.\u201dBuying an existing course can be a better deal. Mr. Smith said he made improvements to the TPC Myrtle Beach when he bought it, even though the club was only seven years old. He wanted it to stand out in the crowded Myrtle Beach golf market, which has over 100 courses. When he sold the course to a group of Chinese investors in 2014, he said, he made a good profit, which he wouldn\u2019t disclose.But last year, when he and a partner, Doug Marty, bought a course in Florida, Wellington National, he said he realized just how much money it could cost to turn around a course and make it profitable.\u201cWe went into that one and evaluated the facilities and the golf course,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt was by far the worst one I\u2019d ever seen in terms of being open and playable but being in awful condition. Doug likes to say we went in with an unlimited budget and exceeded that.\u201dThey shut the club for a year of renovations. It has now reopened and started to attract members. The two partners are betting that it can attract members from the surrounding equestrian community and nearby Palm Beach.But recouping their investment will take time. The initiation fee is $7,500 and annual dues are $6,750, comparatively modest in an area where $50,000 and $100,000 initiation fees are common.Pure resort courses are a different challenge. They need to rely on a steady stream of people visiting them.Jay Cashman, who runs a marine construction and dredging business in Boston, bought Kilkea Castle outside of Dublin in 2013. He said he had spent about 20 million euros (about $23.7 million) renovating the 12th-century castle and reviving the golf course that surrounds it. The annual payroll is \u20ac4 million ($4.7 million).But Mr. Cashman, who rarely plays golf and doesn\u2019t keep score when he does, said he did not expect to profit from the course. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make money but it sells the rooms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a casino in the old days when they gave away the rooms and the entertainment. The golf course is a loss leader. But we make money in some other parts.\u201dPaul Schock, a top amateur golfer and successful private equity investor, doesn\u2019t have that luxury.In 2004, after one of the companies he had invested in went public and \u201cgave me a big pile of money,\u201d Mr. Schock went to Nebraska to play Sand Hills Golf Club, a well-known destination for serious golfers. Through that trip, he discovered land 70 miles away on the Snake River in Valentine, Neb., population 2,803.He bought 1,700 acres at first and another 800 acres over time with the idea of creating a golf destination. With an initial investment of $25 million from himself, friends and investors in his private equity ventures, he built two 18-hole courses and a quirky short course.In 2010, with the effects of the recession lingering, the Prairie Club opened to widespread acclaim from golf writers, but in the first two and a half years, Mr. Schock said, the club lost $5 million.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you that the third time I went to my own well and the well of my investor group, I kept asking myself, and they kept asking me, \u2018Is this really going to work?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut we felt like we were getting there.\u201dNow, he has a thriving golf destination, with members and guests from across the country, and it has helped the local economy.And fortunately, ownership hasn\u2019t ruined his golf game. While he said he had probably played each course only 10 times in the eight years since the club opened, he recently shot a six-under-par on the tougher of the two courses. \u201cBut I will tell you this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wind wasn\u2019t blowing 35 miles per hour that day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Another adds, \u201cKids in Year 7 are being asked to role-play being in a same-sex relationship.\u201d The text onscreen reads: \u201cIn countries with gay marriage, people have lost their right to choose.\u201d The final message is \u201cit\u2019s O.K. to say no.\u201dWhat does this reveal about the \u201cno\u201d campaign\u2019s arguments against same-sex marriage?Basically, the ad shifts the debate from marriage itself to the possible consequences for children.Critics have called the ad a \u201cred herring,\u201d wondering why the debate on consensual adult marriage is being conflated with cross-dressing.\u201cThe people behind this ad know that Australians believe everyone should have the same opportunity to marry, so they are deliberately resorting to misleading people,\u201d said Tiernan Brady, the executive director of the Equality Campaign in Australia, which supports same-sex marriage.After the television ad was released, Safe Schools Coalition Australia issued a statement stressing that participation in these programs was voluntary. \u201cNo schools are forced to join Safe Schools or use any of the resources,\u201d the coalition said. \u201cAnd schools looking to become formal members need to have parental consent.\u201dOn 3AW, Mr. Shelton said he believed that if same-sex marriage were legalized, such programs would be made compulsory.

In other words, legalization would catalyze an assault on parental freedom.In that referendum, 62 percent of voters supported amending the Irish Constitution. The nonbinding, voluntary postal survey in Australia gets underway in mid-September and runs to early November. We\u2019ll know then whether the television ad and other campaign materials helped sway enough minds to determine the outcome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Service Union Plans Big Push to Turn Midwest Political Tide", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChallenging the Republican ascendance in states where labor once carried enormous sway, a prominent union plans to spend tens of millions of dollars during the 2018 campaign cycle to reverse the trend.The Service Employees International Union, one of the largest and wealthiest unions in the United States with roughly 2 million members, will fund an extensive campaign over the next 14 months to elect politicians with labor-friendly stands on the minimum wage, unions and health care.The effort will primarily aim at the traditionally industrial states of the Midwest and Rust Belt, where labor\u2019s political influence has come under a furious assault from conservative forces in recent decades, culminating in President Trump\u2019s electoral sweep of the traditionally Democratic states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u201cIf you think about what the No. 1 job of an elected official ought to be, it\u2019s raising the standard of living of citizens they\u2019re elected to represent,\u201d said Scott Courtney, an executive vice president of the union, which will formally unveil the initiative on Labor Day. \u201cBut if you look at what has been happening in battle ground states in the Midwest, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201dThe high-profile involvement of S.E.I.U., whose membership in the Midwest has steadily increased over much of the past generation, is in some sense a reflection of the changing economic landscape of the region, where health care has replaced manufacturing as the top employer in many states.Some public opinion experts believe that Republicans have overreached on the narrower issue of unions in particular.\u201cIn Midwestern states, the battlegrounds, people really like unions,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has done work for unions, including the service employees. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re uncritical, but they like them, they cannot imagine a world without unions.\u201d\u201cIf the issue Big Labor plans on raising is right to work, then that should be a winning debate for candidates who have voted to oppose forced union dues,\u201d Mr. Semmens said in an email.One of the S.E.I.U.\u2019s biggest initiatives in recent years has been the Fight for 15 campaign, an effort to raise wages and win union rights for low-paid workers that began in the fast-food industry and has helped win minimum wage increases across the country. Mr. Courtney, an architect of that effort, said the Fight for 15 would join the new initiative and that the idea was to combine two projects in which the union has considerable expertise: organizing workers and mobilizing voters.He said that door-to-door canvassing for issues like a $15 minimum wage, union access and universal health care in the coming months would give way to electoral canvassing as next year\u2019s voting approaches. Even then, issues will remain at the forefront, he said: the union and the Fight for 15 will continue to emphasize their agenda and only tout candidates who strongly support it.\u201cYou learn every time you do stuff about how to do it differently, better,\u201d Mr. Courtney said.The key to the union\u2019s program for 2018, Mr. Courtney added, will be to expand the universe of voters who turn out on Election Day.The S.E.I.U. conducted a pilot project during the 2016 campaign in which it canvassed groups of voters largely in two heavily African-American wards of Detroit using a small-scale version of the campaign it plans for the year ahead.Over all, about 62 percent of voters the union talked to during the pilot project cast ballots in the presidential election, versus turnout of about 38 percent of voters who it did not talk to, according to data provided by the union.Applying the same percentage to all of Detroit\u2019s voters would have produced about 40,000 more total votes in 2016, an amount that would have almost certainly secured the state for Mrs. Clinton.Two people briefed on the initiative said the overall budget would approach $100 million, though that figure includes a substantial portion of money that the union was already likely to spend in these states. Even so, the initiative ensures that the political spending will primarily support outreach to voters on key issues, which would not necessarily have been the case.By comparison, the union spent about $70 million on all federal political activity in 2012 and again in 2016, though the sums rose considerably once spending on local candidates and other nonfederal costs was included. Beyond the Midwest, the initiative will be aimed at a small number of competitive states elsewhere in the country, like Colorado, Florida and Nevada.It was \u201challucinatory,\u201d Mr. Rolf wrote, to believe that \u201cthe hundreds of millions of dollars the labor movement spent just on Wisconsin gubernatorial elections between 2010 and 2014 couldn\u2019t have been better used to build new forms of worker power.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified one traditionally Democratic state carried by President Trump in November. He won Michigan \u2014 not Illinois \u2014 along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Advertisement"}

The nonprofit advocacy group is financed by the industrialist brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, and their allies.The Koch brothers steer a network of groups that spent between $720 million and $750 million to bolster conservative policy positions and politicians in the run-up to the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the spending. Yet the groups withheld support from President Trump\u2019s campaign out of distaste for his populist and protectionist rhetoric, which clashed sharply with the Kochs\u2019 support for free-market policies.But in recent weeks, the Kochs\u2019 groups \u2014 as well as other deep-pocketed conservative outfits \u2014 have expressed increasing support for Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to overhaul the tax code.While there isn\u2019t any specific tax-reform legislation yet, the Koch network was pleased with a broad blueprint released by the Trump administration. It would slash corporate tax rates but, notably, did not include an import tax that the Kochs opposed.Americans for Prosperity, or A.F.P., and the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce are the two lead groups in the brothers\u2019 network. They have begun what they describe as a \u201cmultimillion-dollar\u201d campaign to build public support for tax reform.It was a stark contrast from the Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an effort that never had full buy-in from conservative groups, and ultimately collapsed amid disagreements within the party. That failure has added urgency to the tax reform push.\u201cWith tax reform, we\u2019re coming out of the gate far more united,\u201d said Mr. Short, who also for years worked as an aide to Mr. Pence. \u201cThere is a lot more support for the tax plan in the conservative movement and with business groups, and certainly A.F.P. will be a big part of that.\u201dWhile tax reform has been a top item on Republican wish lists for decades, it has been elusive \u2014 in part because of the array of interest groups that have won special treatment for their industries in the tax code.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Donors Put Their Money Where the Memes Are", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftImagine you\u2019re a millionaire or billionaire with strong political views and a desire to spread those views to the masses. Do you start a think tank in Washington? Funnel millions to a shadowy \u201csuper PAC\u201d? Bankroll the campaign of an up-and-coming politician?For a growing number of deep-pocketed political donors, the answer is much more contemporary: Invest in internet virality.As TV, radio and newspapers give way to the megaphonic power of social media, today\u2019s donor class is throwing its weight behind a new group of partisan organizations that specialize in creating catchy, highly shareable messages for Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms. Viral media expertise is emerging as a crucial skill for political operatives, and as donors look to replicate the success of the social media sloganeers who helped lift President Trump to victory, they\u2019re seeking out talented meme makers.Stand Up America, a new progressive outfit run by Sean Eldridge, the husband of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, is emblematic of the union between big-money donors and social media organizing. Mr. Eldridge, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2014, started a Facebook page in the week after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, and began writing posts and linking to anti-Trump stories.\u201cThere was a ton of anger on the left and many progressives looking for something to do,\u201d Mr. Eldridge told me in an interview. \u201cParticularly on social media, the existing political media was pretty slow to respond.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve spent in the low six figures to reach, on average, 10 million people a week,\u201d he said.Donor excitement about social media organizing, he added, is a \u201cnatural evolution toward a skepticism of TV and paid media, where you can spend a lot of money very quickly and not be sure what you\u2019re getting for it.\u201dNimble America has since folded, according to a representative who responded to an email sent to the group.What distinguishes the current wave of donors is a focus on social media \u2014 Facebook in particular \u2014 and a willingness to fund newcomers without ties to the media establishment.John Sellers, a left-wing organizer and former Greenpeace activist, started a Facebook page called The Other 98% several years ago to promote his views on environmentalism, corporate greed and other progressive causes. The page has five million followers, and its nonprofit affiliate has received funding from donors including Open Society Foundations, a group backed by the progressive billionaire George Soros.Civic Ventures, an organization founded by the Seattle venture capitalist Nick Hanauer, has paid partnerships with several popular left-wing Facebook pages, including The Other 98% and Occupy Democrats.Zach Silk, the president of Civic Ventures, credited these pages with building support for some of the organization\u2019s key issues, including the \u201cFight for 15\u201d movement, in which fast-food workers advocated a higher minimum wage.\u201cThere\u2019s real soul-searching going on\u201d among donors, Mr. Silk said, \u201cand a real interest in finding these other mediums to communicate.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need a complicated website with hundreds of white papers,\u201d he added. \u201cYou need quick, memeable, shareable content.\u201dWhile some social publishers are structured as nonprofits, many are for-profit businesses that more closely resemble internet start-ups. Milo Inc., which has nearly 20 employees cranking out content for Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s 2.2 million Facebook fans, claims to have raised $12 million from a group of investors in order to \u201ccultivate an entire next generation\u201d of conservative internet personalities.Conservatives, it is generally acknowledged, have so far had the upper hand in the viral content wars. Mr. Trump spent many millions less than his opponents did on traditional TV advertising, but benefited from an army of amateur creators who flooded social media with pro-Trump messages.Donor funding is no guarantee of success for partisan publishers \u2014 as with all viral internet content, there are limits to what money can buy. But given the outcome of the presidential election, Democrats may have no other choice than to enter the meme wars.\u201cThis was the missing piece of the progressive infrastructure,\u201d said Jess McIntosh, Shareblue\u2019s executive editor, who worked as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s director of communications outreach during the 2016 campaign. \u201cEveryone understands that what gets shared online matters now.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the surname of the right-wing commentator behind Milo Inc. He is Milo Yiannopoulos, not Yiannopolous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Used Personal Email for City Matters, Memo Says", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio and four top aides often used personal email accounts to conduct city business \u2014 in some instances in violation of city guidelines \u2014 according to a new document that also provides previously undisclosed details about the mayor\u2019s efforts to assist a donor embroiled in a multimillion-dollar lease dispute with the city.The document prepared by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation says the agency found the mayor\u2019s personal email address appeared more than the addresses of any of his aides in the conduct of city business \u2014 a total of 1,850 times.The document, obtained under the state Freedom of Information Law, focuses on the city agency\u2019s work as part of a federal investigation into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising. The agency took part in a review of the mayor\u2019s extensive and longstanding efforts to assist a campaign donor, Harendra Singh, a restaurant owner whose Long Island City wedding venue, Water\u2019s Edge, was located on land it leased from the city.The mayor has repeatedly said that he had conducted his fund-raising appropriately. After Mr. Kim\u2019s announcement, Mr. de Blasio defended his regular requests to subordinates in City Hall and at city agencies that they respond to the concerns of campaign donors, and said he would continue the practice.The July 7 document, known as a closing memorandum, summarized the city agency\u2019s assistance in the federal investigation. Among its other disclosures was that a telephone call the mayor made urging Stacey Cumberbatch, the commissioner of the agency overseeing city leases, to assist Mr. Singh \u201cwas the first and only time that the mayor ever called her directly.\u201dThe memorandum also said that several officials at that agency, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, were repeatedly told by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s staff to \u201cresolve this matter\u201d because Mr. Singh was \u201ca friend of the mayor.\u201d Those directions came both during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure as mayor and, before that, when he served as public advocate and also sought to assist Mr. Singh.The wider investigation into the mayor\u2019s fund-raising examined his 2013 campaign; his efforts to raise money for his now-defunct political nonprofit group, the Campaign for One New York; and his efforts to raise money for a bid by Democrats to retake control of the State Senate in 2014 that proved unsuccessful.During that inquiry, in addition to scrutinizing Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts on behalf of Mr. Singh, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and prosecutors examined his involvement with a number of other donors, zeroing in on several who had sought favorable treatment from the city. (Mr. Singh was later arrested on unrelated corruption charges just as he was concluding negotiations that would have resulted in a much more favorable settlement of the lease dispute. He subsequently cooperated with the fund-raising inquiry.)The inquiry overshadowed the mayor\u2019s administration and left it hamstrung for more than a year.The section of the memorandum that details the use of personal email accounts by the mayor and his aides refers only to the number of times their personal email addresses appeared, but does not make clear whether those numbers refer to emails sent, emails received, or emails on which each person was copied \u2014 or all of the above.Whatever the case, a spokesman for the mayor did not take issue with the memorandum or a letter from an official at the investigation agency to the head of the city agency that oversees technology and email recommending the creation of a citywide policy on the use of personal emails. (The letter was released with the closing memorandum.)Indeed, the spokesman, Eric F. Phillips, acknowledged that the city had no formal policy on the use of private email accounts.\u201cD.O.I. is right,\u201d Mr. Phillips said in a statement. \u201cEmployees are supposed to use their government email for government work. That\u2019s always been the protocol and we remind City Hall and agency staff of that frequently. We consider personal email and documents in someone\u2019s personal possession subject to FOIL when they relate to government business,\u201d he said, referring to the Freedom of Information Law.The use of personal email accounts and text messages on personal devices to conduct government business has long come under fire from advocates of open government and historians, who argue that such electronic communications are public record and should be preserved and accessible to the public and the news media.In addition to the mayor, the personal email addresses of four other senior aides were also used to conduct city business, the memorandum said. The address of Ms. Wolfe, his director of intergovernmental affairs, appeared 1,296 times; the address of Henry Berger, special counsel to the mayor, appeared 34 times; the address of Anthony Shorris, the first deputy mayor, appeared 682 times; and the address of Dominic Williams, Mr. Shorris\u2019s chief of staff, appeared 579 times. (Emails from Ms. Wolfe\u2019s personal account close with a line noting it is her private email and advises those with official business to contact her at her city email address.)The memo also said that the federal investigation into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising sought to determine not only whether Mr. Singh received favorable treatment, but also whether his lobbyist, Neal Kwatra, received such treatment \u201cas a result of their connections with the city.\u201dA footnote in the memo says Mr. Kwatra \u2014 who did work for United for Affordable NYC, a nonprofit group created by the mayor \u2014 is a well-known lobbyist and that Mr. de Blasio appointed his mother, Pam Kwatra, to the board of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation.A spokesman for Mr. Kwatra declined to comment.An earlier version of this article misstated who sent a letter from a New York City agency recommending a citywide policy on the use of personal email accounts. The letter was sent by an official of the Department of Investigation, but not by its commissioner, Mark G. Peters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Investigations Intensify, Israel Imagines Life After Netanyahu", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 A black curtain went up a few months ago near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s official residence on Jerusalem\u2019s leafy Balfour Street. It screened pesky protesters from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s view \u2014 and prevented the public from seeing lawyers and detectives come and go as criminal investigations of the prime minister intensified.For the past eight years, Mr. Netanyahu has dominated the Israeli political scene and become nearly synonymous with the state on the world stage. Long called \u201cthe magician\u201d for his survival skills, he has quashed rivals from right and left despite never enjoying particular popularity in the street.Yet Mr. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister since Israel\u2019s first, David Ben-Gurion, suddenly appears not so invincible after all.\u201cAll the alliances, discussions and thinking about the day after have taken on much more significance,\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, the chairman of the Institute for Zionist Strategies, a right-leaning research group, and a former spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cFor the first time, people are thinking that Netanyahu won\u2019t be the prime minister next time around, whether elections take place in a few months\u2019 time or a year and a half.\u201dMr. Netanyahu has fought off swirling scandals for much of his public life, but experts say that Friday\u2019s signing of a state\u2019s witness agreement by Ari Harow, who served as Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff and directed his 2015 re-election campaign, could be a game changer.Mr. Harow was offered a light sentence in an unrelated matter in return for information about Mr. Netanyahu in what the police have called Case 1000 and Case 2000.The police came across recordings of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s talks with the newspaper while searching Mr. Harow\u2019s belongings, the Israeli news media has reported.Mr. Hendel, who worked in the prime minister\u2019s office during the first of Mr. Harow\u2019s two stints there, said Mr. Harow worked in the \u201cvery broad, gray area\u201d between Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s personal, familial and national obligations.He added, \u201cSomeone like Ari would see it all.\u201dMr. Netanyahu has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and on Tuesday he made a statement about terrorism after a hospital visit to the victim of a recent attack, with no mention of the criminal investigations. He and his office have repeatedly lashed out at the news media and his critics, asserting that the focus on the investigations is meant to topple him under the weight of baseless accusations, rather than at the ballot box.There is, as yet, no clear contender to replace Mr. Netanyahu, who is serving his third consecutive term and fourth over all. An Israel without Mr. Netanyahu at the helm would, in any case, be an unfamiliar place for its inhabitants, the Middle East and the world.Mr. Netanyahu has had abrasive relationships with some international leaders, including President Barack Obama, particularly over his championing of settlement expansion and his efforts to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear program. President Trump\u2019s victory came as a great relief to Mr. Netanyahu and his coalition \u2014 the most right wing in Israel\u2019s history \u2014 alleviating the pressure from Washington.In May, Mr. Trump paid a bonding visit to Israel. But Mr. Netanyahu has not been given totally free rein on settlement building, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election promise of moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv remains unfulfilled.Mr. Netanyahu has also built strong alliances with other leaders, including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and has expanded Israel\u2019s global reach based on its prowess in intelligence, counterterrorism and technology.His tenure has been one of impasse in the Palestinian peace process. But inside Israel, he is credited with having maintained stability as Arab neighbors descended into chaos. A departure would leave Israel, its allies and its enemies in uncharted terrain.It could take many months for Mr. Harow\u2019s information to be substantiated. Any police recommendation for an indictment would have to be approved by the state prosecutor and attorney general; there is no precedent in Israel for a sitting prime minister to be charged.But one or more of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners may bolt before that to protect their own reputations. There are already some signs of unease from within his own Likud Party.On Friday, when Mr. Harow signed his deal, the anchor of Israeli public radio\u2019s noon news program said that the only one of Likud\u2019s 30 Parliament members willing to discuss the case was David Amsalem, a novice elected in 2015.A Likud rally in support of Mr. Netanyahu is scheduled for Wednesday evening.Late Monday, Israeli news outlets reported that the attorney general would soon announce charges against Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, on accusations that public funds were misused in the family residences. And, responding to a journalist\u2019s freedom of information request, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has given Mr. Netanyahu two weeks to disclose the call logs of his conversations with executives of Israel Hayom, a newspaper widely considered to have been established to support him.Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that recent political polls showed \u201ca degree of erosion in the support\u201d for Mr. Netanyahu, but that \u201cthere are no indicators at this moment that his position has been dealt a fatal blow.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s durability can be attributed at least in part to the fractured field of potential rivals.Naftali Bennett, leader of the far right Jewish Home party, and Avigdor Lieberman, of the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, would like to contend for the premiership but have relatively small parties that make it difficult.The Likud has several people jostling for the top spot, including Yisrael Katz, the minister of transportation and intelligence affairs; Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security; and Gideon Saar, a former education minister who recently returned to public life.Dahlia Scheindlin, a political analyst, said all the chatter was not so different from what she heard before the election two years ago. \u201cThen, too, people were complaining that Bibi had been in for too long, that it was time for change,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname. \u201cBut in the same breath they would say, \u2018But there\u2019s nobody else.\u2019 It\u2019s the same thing now.\u201dGadi Wolfsfeld, a professor of political communications at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said, however, \u201cAt some point, people in his party are going to say enough is enough.\u201dThe notion that there is nobody to replace Mr. Netanyahu holds \u201cuntil it happens,\u201d Professor Wolfsfeld said. \u201cThey said nobody could replace Ben-Gurion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sharp Tones, de Blasio and Albanese Spar Over New York\u2019s Future", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith cross talk, barbed remarks and few moments of camaraderie, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his main Democratic opponent, Sal F. Albanese, engaged in a bitter debate on Wednesday before an occasionally rowdy audience less than three weeks before the primary election.Their encounter, at a packed theater space on the Upper West Side, was the first of two Democratic debates to be held before the vote on Sept. 12. It provided the most contentious moments of a 2017 race for City Hall that, with few established political figures running and only one Republican candidate, has at times struggled to find a pulse.Each dispensed with formality and frequently referred to the other by his first name as they tussled over issues of affordable housing, transit funding, homelessness and whether contributions to political candidates create conflicts of interest. Mr. de Blasio found himself repeatedly deflecting questions stemming from state and federal investigations into his fund-raising activities, which earlier this year resulted in no charges.\u201cSal, it would be nice if you wanted to talk about the issues facing everyday New Yorkers,\u201d the mayor said, addressing one round of such questions. Mr. de Blasio, when asked about his aspirations beyond the city, said he would not run for president in 2020, and would serve all four years of a second term if re-elected.For much of the debate, however, the two Democrats remained locked in a back-and-forth that appeared to elevate the little-known Mr. Albanese, a former City Council member who first ran for mayor in 1997. The crowd included large numbers of his supporters, who noisily laughed and cheered for him.\u201cVintage de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Albanese said of the mayor\u2019s plan to close Rikers Island in a decade, a time period he suggested was, like other proposals, conveniently far in the future. Mr. de Blasio responded frequently that Mr. Albanese did not have his facts straight.Some in the crowd shouted over the mayor at times, forcing the moderator, Errol Louis of NY1, to admonish the audience.A boisterous atmosphere reigned outside the venue, Symphony Space, on Broadway. Scores of de Blasio supporters in red shirts brought a New Orleans-style jazz band. A handful with Mr. Albanese held signs. Protesters demanded a quick shutdown of Rikers Island.Mr. Albanese had prepared for the debate in mock sessions with a long-shot Democratic candidate for public advocate, David Eisenbach, playing the role of Mr. de Blasio. For his part, the mayor held preparatory sessions before and after his vacation in Rhode Island last week, with a legislative aide, Jon Paul Lupo, playing Mr. Albanese.But if the mayor came into the night intending to keep the focus on his record and avoid contentious arguments, as his campaign aides indicated, Mr. de Blasio instead went on offense, repeatedly and dismissively responding to Mr. Albanese\u2019s attacks. The image on television presented a stark contrast: the 6-foot-5 mayor literally speaking down to his much shorter opponent.Mr. Albanese, for his part, entered the debate enthusiastic to have a full 90 minutes with the mayor on stage to articulate his criticisms and vision for what he called \u201ca more livable city.\u201dBut for much of that time, he struggled to articulate a positive message for what he would do if elected mayor. At one point, Mr. Albanese adopted an idea he appeared to have first heard moments earlier from a journalist on the panel of questioners, WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer, to address affordable housing by forcing developers to only create such housing. He stumbled as he explained his plan for \u201cdemocracy vouchers,\u201d to reduce the influence of donors, and did not fully explain a proposal for a \u201cpied-\u00e0-terre tax\u201d on real estate owned by non-city residents.Perhaps the most pointed moments came on the subject of policing.\u201cIf we had Mickey Mouse as the mayor, we\u2019d still have crime going down,\u201d Mr. Albanese said, before crediting the mayor for reviving a form of community policing. He said Mr. de Blasio had politicized the Police Department by criticizing the shooting of an unarmed woman in her home.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the sentence where you have your facts straight,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cShe had a name: It was Deborah Danner.\u201dThe two candidates met before, during the 2013 election, but the atmosphere then could not have been more different from Wednesday night. Four years ago, Mr. Albanese struggled to make an impression on the crowded debate stage, in a field packed with marquee political figures from city politics. On Wednesday, though, Mr. Albanese, a 67-year-old lawyer in private practice, found himself alone alongside the incumbent.Democratic elected officials, such as the city\u2019s comptroller, Scott C. Stringer, decided not to give up their current jobs and risk a primary challenge. Mr. Albanese forced the one-on-one debate with Mayor de Blasio by way of a last-minute push to meet the Campaign Finance Board\u2019s threshold of raising and spending $175,000 in contributions.Robert Gangi, a criminal justice reform advocate, appeared outside the debate on Wednesday to protest his own exclusion and argued with a Boston Red Sox hat perched atop a stick. (Mr. de Blasio is a Red Sox fan.) Bo Dietl, a former police detective and independent mayoral candidate, also railed against the mayor outside the debate venue, accompanied by a person dressed as Big Bird, an allusion to an insult he has often hurled at the mayor.Mr. de Blasio on Wednesday night defended his record of creating a free universal prekindergarten program, embarking on an ambitious plan to create or preserve affordable housing and keeping crime low during his first term. While he offered no new plans for a second term, he repeated pledges to build on those endeavors, with a free schooling program for 3-year-olds and a goal of creating tens of thousands of \u201cgood paying jobs\u201d in the private sector.\u201cThe mayor has great macro views,\u201d Mr. Albanese said at one point, before attacking him for spending too much time outside of New York City.Mr. de Blasio complimented Mr. Albanese for a 1986 legislative effort on behalf of gay and transgender New Yorkers.Mr. Albanese, a relative unknown who served from 1982 to 1997 on the Council, has spent much of the campaign so far focused on transit issues, with regular posts on his Twitter account from his rides on the city\u2019s beleaguered subway system.The two differed on many issues, including whether to take down a statue of Christopher Columbus in Manhattan (Mr. Albanese said no; the mayor said he would not \u201cdo the name game here\u201d), and if identity politics had damaged the Democratic Party (Mr. Albanese said it created \u201ca schism\u201d; the mayor said the party should focus on economic issues).A key for Mr. de Blasio in the primary election, on Sept. 12, and in the general election in November will be turnout. Political consultants anticipate far fewer voters will go to the polls than four years ago, when a record-low number voted in the November election.An earlier version of this story misspelled the given name of a legislative aide for Mayor Bill de Blasio. He is Jon Paul Lupo, not John Paul Lupo.William Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Thursday was a \u201ccraft jam\u201d \u2014 terra cotta pot painting amplified by ros\u00e9 and salty snacks \u2014 at Node in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. A few weeks earlier, I had made a terrarium at Jersey City Urby \u2014 bromeliads, plastic critters and rum punch, with the Marshall Tucker Band on the Sonos \u2014 and joined a bar crawl through the Lower East Side with a group from Quarters, open since mid-June on Grand Street. I slept in an adorable plywood cubby on Wall Street and on the 68th floor of the tallest residential building in Jersey City, in a flashy model apartment from which you could see all the way up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge, a view so vertiginous I dropped to my knees and crawled into bed on my elbows, special-ops-style. (Happily, at such a height, there were no neighbors to see me do so.)These were some of my adventures in co-living, a housing model that draws inspiration from the single-gender residence hotels of the early 20th century and postwar intentional communities, along with modern co-working spaces and hacker hostels.Using architecture, design and so-called community programming (craft jams and bar crawls, say) co-living aims to push people together. It\u2019s housing buoyed by and addressing a collision of attendant themes: the sharing economy and a yearning for connection, social and professional, among overworked millennials and a work force that\u2019s increasingly freelance.15 PhotosEventually, Mr. Fix added 25 Brooklyn apartments to his Pure House portfolio. He recalled organizing dinner parties and morning raves, weekend jaunts to upstate New York and Burning Man, and the overall emotional cost of being a mentor to 65 people, some of whom fell in love, went traveling and started new businesses, he added \u2014 juicy alliances he is proud to have overseen.In the sky-lighted mailroom, bright blue metal mailboxes look like mini high school lockers; above, ferns and vines erupt from canvas bags. Though Jersey City Urby, like its sister property on Staten Island, is not quite co-living \u2014 it is, essentially, a conventional apartment building with 762 units that rent with conventional leases \u2014 its community features are right out of the co-living playbook. (Rents start at $2,500 for a studio.)You won\u2019t find much of that outside the building, which is why this Urby is essentially a vertical \u2014 and interior \u2014 neighborhood. Though the place is 85 percent rented, I was terrified alone in my posh, helicopter-high apartment, missing the street, empty though it was, far, far below. And I marveled at the stamina of my fellow terrarium-creators, who after a long day at their nonprofits and their finance and tech companies could still muster conversation and fine handiwork.Four attendees appeared at poolside yoga early the next morning, seemingly fast friends, chatting and cheerful in their downward dogs. (In my own faraway youth, after 18 hours or more at work on the equivalent, then, of a start-up \u2014 a poorly funded local print product \u2014 I could do no more than fill a plastic tray with sesame chicken at the Vietnamese salad bar on Bleecker Street and shuffle home, alone, with a beer.)Up on the roof (squashy canvas beanbags), we could see a gaggle of yoga practitioners who swayed and dipped a few buildings away. \u201cIs this \u2018The Matrix\u2019?\u201d Ms. Evans wondered, before clapping her hands and gathering up the group. \u201cShould we say hello to our future selves?\u201d\u201cThat just meant that we weren\u2019t making out, though we were seeing each other every day,\u201d he said. Regular apartment life is boring, he continued, but there are challenges to co-living. \u201cPeople getting drunk and hooking up, there\u2019s more potential for drama to happen. And in a normal apartment you don\u2019t have 30 people who know what\u2019s going on in your relationship. If we have a fight,\u201d he said of Ms. Zhao, \u201ceverybody wants to know what it\u2019s about.\u201d\u201cScooby, scooby, guys,\u201d said Ms. Evans, \u201ccome along!\u201d It was time for the next port, the bistro Dirty French across the street, followed by one more: Max Fish, the beloved, art-inflected 1990s-era hangout on Ludlow Street that closed there in 2013 and reopened a year later on Orchard. I decided to skip that stop. I\u2019d been there before, after all.I liked my cubby bed, but apartments tucked into office buildings can be grim, despite the ferry terminal outside this one, the literary embellishments and the free coffee.Floors are organized into \u201cneighborhoods,\u201d with open staircases and unifying decorative schemes. There\u2019s a B.Y.O. whiskey bar, a library, and common kitchens are stocked with coffee and fruit water. The laundry room has a pool table. You can buy snacks there with the WeLive app, which also alerts you to group events, like family dinners, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d nights or kickboxing classes.

{"Headline": "$16 Billion Bond Sale Shows Amazon\u2019s Power to Pursue Deals", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAmazon\u2019s aggressive salesmanship now extends to its own debt.Its blowout $16 billion bond sale suggests almost unlimited potential for Amazon, the retailing juggernaut, to consider even more shopping. Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market, Jeff Bezos\u2019s company is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will, too.Mr. Bezos built his online empire by investing cash flow into the business and eschewing conventional corporate finance tools like debt and dividends. A result is a $472 billion goliath \u2014 the fifth-largest American enterprise by market capitalization \u2014 that has store owners and technology companies quaking over its ambitions.Amazon could have financed the Whole Foods deal by issuing stock with only minimal dilution of his 16.6 percent stake. But as Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk did last week, Mr. Bezos took the cheap money available in the fixed-income market. Investors submitted nearly $47 billion in bids, and the company was able to sell its paper at razor-thin margins, including a premium to comparable United States Treasury bonds of just 1.45 percentage points for $2.25 billion of 40-year bonds. A need for yield and a belief that Amazon will triumph from the retail shakeout that it is provoking created a powerful cocktail.The deal will nearly triple Amazon\u2019s outstanding debt, to slightly more than $23 billion. That is about a billion dollars less than the consensus estimate for its 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda.Given the company\u2019s cash pile, net debt will be even lower at less than $10 billion. That leaves the underleveraged Amazon with enough financial firepower to consider acquisitions that would make Whole Foods look like an appetizer.Whether that would be good for the company\u2019s stock is less clear. Belief in the Bezos vision has pushed Amazon shares up nearly 31 percent this year, and they are trading at 120 times 2018 estimated earnings as calculated by Thomson Reuters Eikon. Walmart Stores, by contrast, fetches 17.6 times earnings. As Amazon begins to more closely resemble peers in its physical footprint and its balance sheet, that gap will inevitably narrow.Advertisement"}

The once sleepy fishing community, on the Pacific Coast about 200 miles south of Panama City, is becoming increasingly popular as a vacation and retirement destination.The white concrete structure with a terra-cotta tile roof has two stories and 15,812 square feet of interior space. It sits on nearly 1.3 acres with direct access to more than a mile of private beach and numerous resort-style amenities within its property, including an infinity pool, a dining pavilion and a rooftop terrace with a thatched covering. The furniture is included in the price.The house has six spacious en-suite bedrooms, each with walk-in closets. There is also a media room, an art studio that was converted from guest quarters, a breakfast bar in the kitchen and two partial baths.A grand foyer with double-height ceilings opens to a central courtyard with direct water views. Oversize windows and numerous balconies and terraces look out over the ocean and lush tropical gardens, providing an almost seamless connection to the outdoors.The foyer is flanked by two large living rooms, each outfitted with contemporary furnishings. The formal dining room also flows into the courtyard.Pedas\u00ed, a town of about 4,000 people, is known for its pristine beaches, sport fishing, diving and surfing, and is close to several national parks and preserves, including the Isla Iguana Wildlife Refuge. The development of the area has increased in recent years, with new homes and hotels steadily cropping up.The real estate market began to rebound after 2012 as buyers, many of them foreigners, returned from the sidelines with more confidence and in search of deals. Mr. Gangi of Sotheby\u2019s said he expects sales over all to rise around 6 percent this year.Luxury homes near the beach in Pedas\u00ed start at around $800,000. But there are plenty of less expensive options away from the water, Mr. Davis said. Two-bedroom, two-bath houses farther inland can often be purchased for below $200,000, he said.Most luxury properties are acquired by buyers and investors from the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America, agents say.Buyers come to Pedas\u00ed, in particular, looking for vacation or retirement homes. \u201cRetirees love it there,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThe area is super-safe, and there\u2019s a small-town community feel.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cThe retirees there aren\u2019t the type to play golf all day. Many of them run businesses or start businesses.\u201dForeign buyers generally do not face restrictions on real estate purchases in Panama. The government has tried to encourage investments and new developments with incentives such as property tax exemptions.Local financing, however, can be challenging to secure, according to Berta A. Sanchez, a real estate lawyer with offices in Pedas\u00ed and Panama City, and loan terms may be less attractive than those in the United States.\u201cThe buyer must have Panamanian residency,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said, adding, \u201cPanamanian banks are very cautious granting mortgages.\u201dAgents recommend that buyers hire a real estate lawyer to guide them through the process, which usually takes one to three months to complete. \u201cDue diligence is crucial in any real estate transaction,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said, noting that buyers will need to ensure clear title to a property and verify any applicable property tax exemptions, among other things.Real estate purchases may be made individually or through a corporation established in Panama, she said. Ownership is usually finalized once a deed is recorded at the Public Registry Office.Spanish; Panamanian balboa, American dollar (1 balboa = $1)Sellers typically pay the sales commission, which ranges from 4 to 8 percent of the purchase price. They also pay a 2 percent transfer tax and 3 percent tax on capital gains, according to Ms. Sanchez.She said buyers are responsible for any notary fees and registration fees at the Public Registry, which are 0.3 percent of the sales price.This house was exempted from property taxes for 20 years, with 13 left, according to Mr. Gangi, as part of Panama\u2019s tax exoneration program.Rafael Gangi, Panama Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, (011) 507-226-5704; rgangi@panamasothebysrealty.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo to Give Colleges $7 Million for Courses in Prisons", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Moving ahead with a plan that has drawn criticism from conservatives, the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is awarding more than $7 million in grants to a variety of colleges around the state to offer courses to prisoners.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Vance said that such classes were part of a \u201cpublic safety strategy\u201d to reduce recidivism, calling that goal the \u201cfirst premise of penal law.\u201dInmates in New York are already eligible for classes in about half of the state\u2019s 54 prisons, but they are largely funded by private sources. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his second term who is said to have presidential ambitions, has been eager to expand educational programs in prisons, saying that only about 1,000 inmates currently take college-level classes.Those colleges include an Ivy League institution \u2014 Cornell University \u2014 whose faculty members will teach at four upstate prisons, as well as New York University, whose instructors will travel to Wallkill Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in the Hudson Valley.Mercy College will serve Sing Sing, the famed maximum-security institution in Ossining, while teachers from Medaille College will instruct at Albion Correctional Facility.Prisoners in the program could conceivably qualify for bachelor\u2019s or associate\u2019s degrees, though many inmates with long sentences would not be eligible. Only inmates with five years or less remaining on their sentences will be allowed to take classes.The courses will begin in September and will be held in classroom settings at the 17 prisons, administration officials said. The curriculum will cover a wide range of subjects, including science, mathematics, social sciences and philosophy.In a statement, the governor said he believed that his college plan would help prevent inmates from feeling they have few alternatives to a life of crime.\u201cIncarceration is supposed to be about rehabilitating those who may have lost their way in the past,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time that we get back to embracing that principle as a society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Two bidders came forward over the last two years for its crown jewel, the transmission utility Oncor, but Texas regulators never agreed to terms, saying the proposals didn\u2019t sufficiently protect consumers\u2019 interests. Berkshire heeded that lesson, approached regulators first and got a provisional nod of approval.Seeking to avoid the debt haircut implicit in Mr. Buffett\u2019s plan, Elliott is proposing an alternative restructuring it claims puts a higher value on Energy Future and its subsidiary. The hedge fund has been trying to cobble together financing for a deal that would pay off creditors and leave Elliott with an equity stake in Oncor. Threatening to veto the Berkshire offer suggests the fund doesn\u2019t have the financing sewn up and is stalling for time.Elliott has nothing to lose by flexing its muscles ahead of next week, when a bankruptcy judge is to rule on Berkshire\u2019s bid and its $270 million breakup fee.A positive verdict would present it with a real dilemma, however. If the fund voted to reject the offer, it would create risks for all creditors. Financing for Elliott\u2019s alternative plan seems like a long shot, and there are no other bidders on the horizon.Mr. Buffett, a bridge devotee, is playing a mean hand. Berkshire on Wednesday reiterated that its offer was final. If Elliott tries to call his bluff, he\u2019s likely to walk away given his aversion to competitive bid situations.Even for a distressed debt expert like Mr. Singer, holding a stake in a bankrupt utility with unhappy regulators would be a sticky outcome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawrence Pezzullo, Broker of Somoza\u2019s Abdication in Nicaragua, Dies at 91", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawrence A. Pezzullo, an American diplomat who in 1979 negotiated the abdication of Anastasio Somoza DeBayle as leader of Nicaragua and the demise of the dictatorial dynasty that had led the country with Washington\u2019s sponsorship for four decades, died on Wednesday in Baltimore. He was 91.The cause was heart failure, his son Ralph said.Mr. Pezzullo also tried, though less successfully, to negotiate a return to civilian rule in Haiti in the 1990s, and he ran the international Catholic Relief Services for a decade. But he is best remembered as a voice of the Carter administration\u2019s commitment to human rights, an effort that culminated in Somoza\u2019s departure.As the incoming United States ambassador, Mr. Pezzullo was sent to Nicaragua with a challenging mission: to persuade Somoza to avoid further bloodshed in his country\u2019s protracted civil war with the leftist Sandinistas by relinquishing power to them and fleeing into exile, initially in Miami.Somoza, whose family had led Nicaragua since the mid-1930s, was first elected president in 1967 and gained a reputation for widespread corruption and brutal repression of dissenters. But he was supported by the United States because he was fervently anti-Communist.A blunt, Bronx-born former teacher and fluent Spanish-speaker, Mr. Pezzullo began almost daily negotiations with Somoza in late June 1979.\u201cI said that the only way we could begin the process of putting the house together again was for him to go,\u201d Mr. Pezzullo told The New York Times in 1981. \u201cHe then played the role of the injured party, that history had played him a bad turn. But eventually he went.\u201d\u201cFaced with the inevitability of change here,\u201d Mr. Pezzullo said in Managua, the capital, in 1981, \u201cwe began to build a relationship with the new regime without agonizing too much about what the future would bring.\u201dThe new envoy symbolically abandoned the ambassador\u2019s home, a palatial, white hilltop emblem of Washington\u2019s dominion over Nicaragua. He chose more modest quarters.Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to advance his administration\u2019s human rights agenda, Mr. Pezzullo worked with the United States special envoy William D. Bowdler to win the respect of the Sandinistas by accepting the political reality of their military and political success.He repeatedly went to Washington to lobby the administration and Congress for American humanitarian and economic support for the new government \u2014 aid that could provide leverage over the Sandinistas. But as the Sandinistas emulated Cuba\u2019s agenda in advancing a regional socialist revolution against authoritarian governments, his arguments were greeted with growing skepticism in Congress.\u201cOur problem with the revolution is not that it wants to bring change to a society that sorely needs change,\u201d Mr. Pezzullo was quoted as cautioning Sandinista leaders. \u201cBut if that policy parallels Cuban policy, this is going to be very difficult for us to accept.\u201dAfter being retained for several months by the incoming Reagan administration, he was recalled to Washington in 1981 after the White House accused the Sandinistas of smuggling arms from the Soviet bloc to leftist guerrillas in nearby El Salvador and of terrorizing dissident Nicaraguans.On leaving Managua, Mr. Pezzullo drew praise from the revolutionary junta.\u201cPezzullo has been the best U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in this century,\u201d Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, the foreign minister, said. \u201cHe tried to help his government understand the irreversibility of the process here and seek a modus vivendi with us.\u201dThe White House later secretly financed a rightist counterrevolutionary militia, the Contras, in its effort to overthrow the Sandinista government in another civil war. That conflict ended with a government promise of free elections, in 1990. In the first peaceful transition of power in five decades, the Sandinistan incumbent president, Daniel Ortega, was defeated. (He returned to the presidency in 2006 and was re-elected in 2011.)Mr. Pezzullo, who had left the government by 1990, said the Reagan administration\u2019s support for the Contras had actually prolonged Sandinista rule. \u201cWith an internal threat supported by a foreign power,\u201d he said then, \u201cthey could justify their continuance in power.\u201dPresident Bill Clinton named Mr. Pezzullo the administration\u2019s special envoy to Haiti in 1993, with the aim of brokering a transition from the military government to a democratically elected one. Two years earlier, the Haitian president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown in a military coup.Mr. Pezzullo and his United Nations counterpart, Dante Caputo, drafted an accord in July 1993 on Governors Island in New York between Mr. Aristide and Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the leader of the Haitian military.The agreement granted amnesty to government soldiers who had tortured Mr. Aristide\u2019s supporters and allowed the military to remain in power until Oct. 30, when Mr. Aristide was to create a broad coalition intended to temper what was viewed as his Marxist-leaning radical liberation theology.But General Cedras refused to quit, and Mr. Pezzullo, accused by critics of coddling the military and tolerating its human rights abuses in an ambivalent effort to restore Mr. Aristide to power, was forced to step down. The junta capitulated in 1994, faced with the threat of a United Nations-sanctioned invasion by United States troops.Lawrence Anthony Pezzullo was born on May 3, 1926, to Lorenzo Pezzullo, who owned fruit stands and butcher shops, and the former Josephine Sasso. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, served in the Army from 1944 to 1946, part of the time in Italy, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in history from Columbia University in 1951.He taught school for six years in Levittown, on Long Island, then joined the foreign service and earned a master\u2019s degree from the National War College in Washington.Over the years the State Department assigned him to Mexico, South Vietnam, Bolivia, Colombia and Guatemala. He was deputy assistant secretary of state for congressional relations before serving as ambassador to Uruguay from 1977 to 1979.Besides his son Ralph, Mr. Pezzullo is survived by his wife, the former Josephine DiMattia; another son, David; a daughter, Susan Pezzullo Johnston; and seven grandchildren.He was named executive director of Catholic Relief Services in 1983 and ran it for 10 years. He left amid concerns that the agency was not funneling aid fast enough to drought-ravaged Ethiopia, though he said that his critics, mainly former employees, had not taken into account the agency\u2019s long-term efforts there.Mr. Pezzullo advocated a pragmatic, flexible foreign policy during his years in government. In 1980, he expressed concern that the incoming Reagan administration would reflexively treat all revolutionary movements as Soviet-sponsored vehicles for world communism.\u201cThe moment you pigeonhole someone, you start building your argument to fit your conclusions,\u201d he said in 1981.\u201cMy basic feeling about a revolutionary movement is that you\u2019d better move with it and live with it,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to exert influence, exert it in the process of living with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump\u2019s Turmoil Slowing Economic Growth?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterAt the end of last month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for economic growth in the United States. Where the I.M.F. previously predicted the economy would grow at a rate of 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2.5 percent in 2018, it now expects 2.1 percent growth in both years.The reason? An uncertain and insufficiently expansionary economic environment linked to the chaos in Washington. Yes, the stock market has been strong and unemployment is down. But Donald Trump, friend of business, may be costing us growth, a key indicator of economic health.The I.M.F. forecast is a reminder that ill-advised policy isn\u2019t the only way politics can interfere with growth. Instability can also slow things down.Macroeconomists have long pondered how growth might be affected by features of the political system. Mostly an issue \u2014 until now \u2014 in the developing world, instability is thought to hinder growth by generating uncertainty that scares off investors and makes firms risk-averse. Instability also gives politicians a short-term view of things: If they can\u2019t be sure they or their parties will be involved in governance in the future, they won\u2019t commit to economic policies with long-term yield.In a 1992 paper, the economist Alberto Alesina and colleagues tested these suppositions by looking at data on 113 countries from 1950 to 1982. A challenge in estimating the effect of instability on economic growth is that causality may run in the opposite direction: Low growth, and the accompanying sense of economic malaise, can lead to political disruption, rather than vice versa. After addressing this problem statistically, the researchers discovered that growth does tend to be slower when nations are politically unstable \u2014 when governments verge on collapse or pinball from one ideological extreme to another.More recently, the economists Ari Aisen and Francisco Jos\u00e9 Veiga examined 169 countries from 1960 to 2004. They gauged political instability by how often a new head of government was installed or more than half of the cabinet was changed out (or both). The greater the frequency of these changes, they found, the less overall investment there tended to be in physical capital like factories, and the lower the rate of growth.The United States isn\u2019t an unstable Third World republic. But with a White House plagued by remarkably high staff turnover, and with constitutional crises lurking around every corner, the country and economy aren\u2019t exuding predictability either. If you were a judicious chief executive, you might be more restrained in pushing to expand amid the political turmoil, whatever the administration\u2019s interest in cutting regulatory red tape and slashing corporate taxes.If the United States achieves the growth rate now projected by the I.M.F., it won\u2019t be terrible. But it won\u2019t be anything like the productivity spurts that policy makers and the public grew accustomed to in the second half of the 20th century. A vigorous, expanding economy meant jobs, reliably filled tax coffers, real recovery from downturns and continual improvement in the quality of life. Today, more modest growth rates have become the new normal.There are several schools of economic thought on why growth has been in the doldrums \u2014 but unfortunately, few offer solutions that are viable in an atmosphere of political instability.Mr. Summers points out that it costs a lot less to start a company in the internet age than when the only way to make money was through manufacturing. So there\u2019s less investment demand.With a nod to the New Deal economist Alvin Hansen, who wrote about the relationship between population size and interest rates, Mr. Summers notes as well that population growth in Europe and the United States has steeply declined. Without new workers and consumers coming onto the rolls, there\u2019s an upper limit to domestic profit-making opportunities.Mr. Summers believes there\u2019s a way out of the low-growth trap. He argues for a major debt-financed infrastructure spending program, coupled with tax reform, policies to address rising inequality (since when income gains go almost entirely to those at the top, it\u2019s hard to get a broad-based rise in consumer demand) and efforts to counter protectionist trade practices.The thing is, nothing like what he proposes will be possible so long as we have a president whose inflammatory language, egregious actions and administrative incompetence continue to alienate voters and members of Congress. President Trump campaigned for infrastructure spending, but at this point neither Democrats or Republicans are likely to get completely on board. As for the other pro-growth suggestions, the president and his cabinet of billionaires couldn\u2019t care less about inequality and seem to be gunning for a trade war with China. And it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether Mr. Trump has the discipline to negotiate corporate tax reform.The bottom line is that while Wall Street is happy for the moment, the United States economy isn\u2019t reaching its full potential. A tumultuous Trump administration will have a hard time getting us there.Neil Gross is a professor of sociology at Colby College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Some Executives Made for Sticking With Trump", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs corporate chieftains on a White House advisory panel debated on Wednesday on whether to disband, a few spoke up in favor of sticking with President Trump.They made their case in terms of business self-interest, patriotism and pragmatism.Jack Welch, the retired leader of General Electric, said the business leaders should not abandon the president, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak about it.W. James McNerney Jr., the former head of Boeing, reminded the corporate executives that they wanted a business-friendly administration. Mr. McNerney, the person said, told the group that he was in favor of condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks but that the pro-business agenda was too important to justify dissolving the council and losing influence.But they were lonely voices.The group ultimately decided to disband to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s equating far-right hate groups with the groups opposing them in Charlottesville, Va.The apparent retreat from Mr. Trump by many corporate executives has added to concerns that chaos in the White House and the president\u2019s propensity to inflame crises as opposed to tamping them down are jeopardizing his agenda to overhaul taxes and put in place an infrastructure plan.Stocks slid on Thursday in part on worries that the president\u2019s ruptured relations with business would damage his plans to jump-start economic growth. The decline steepened after the terrorist attack in Barcelona.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index closed the day down 1.54 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1.24 percent. The closely watched VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, better known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, soared more than 30 percent.On Thursday, the White House announced that a presidential advisory group on infrastructure policy and investment was also disbanding.A number of companies, including Merck, Under Armour, Intel, Pepsi, G.E., IBM and Johnson & Johnson, made public statements this week condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks that \u201cmany sides\u201d were responsible for the violence in Virginia as being at odds with their corporate values.Some of his supporters in the business world and several corporate members of the advisory groups, meanwhile, have not said anything publicly about Charlottesville.One of the more vocal supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group, has condemned the events in Charlottesville.As the one who conceived of and, at the president\u2019s request, led the most prominent of the shuttered White House councils, he has felt the recent tensions between corporate America and the president most keenly. Mr. Schwarzman, of all the council members, maintained the most consistent contact with the president.According to people who have spoken with him, Mr. Schwarzman was disappointed that the panel was not able to fulfill its ultimate function, which was to help the president deliver on his pro-growth promises by offering tips and advice from the front lines of business and finance.Now that the panel has disbanded, it remains unclear if Mr. Schwarzman will continue to discuss policy with the president.Mr. Schwarzman declined to comment.The unfolding corporate response to Mr. Trump \u2014 and the varied reactions by companies \u2014 reflects the constellation of outside pressures top corporate executives face today, management experts say.\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she said.That is more the case these days than back in the 1960s and 1970s, when business leaders like Irving S. Shapiro of DuPont, Reginald H. Jones of G.E. and Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM often led public opinion, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.Some business leaders, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, were advocates for the creation of federal environmental protection programs, and Mr. Jones of G.E. popularized the phrase \u201ccorporate social responsibility.\u201dBut their contemporary counterparts, he said, are under much greater pressure to deliver quarterly profits, travel constantly and work almost round the clock.\u201cThey don\u2019t have the time or the support in their boardrooms to be corporate statespeople,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said.The modern C.E.O., said Michael Useem, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, holds a job that calls for \u201cgreat pragmatism\u201d under scrutiny from shareholders, consumers, employees and advocacy groups, all of which is amplified by the instantaneous communication of social media.In dealing with Mr. Trump, corporate executives had to weigh speaking out against the risk of being the target of a presidential tweetstorm or the potential loss of lucrative government contracts.Mr. Trump may be mercurial and unpredictable, but access to the White House can put a favored executive or investor in a position to influence policy.Peter Thiel, who was the only major figure in Silicon Valley to endorse Mr. Trump, has parlayed that endorsement and a last-minute $1.25 million donation to the candidate\u2019s campaign into an unofficial role as his top tech adviser.In March, Mr. Thiel\u2019s chief of staff, Michael Kratsios, became the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer. Mr. Thiel recently participated in administration discussions that resulted in a harder line toward China over possible intellectual-property violations.Mr. Thiel has given no indication he is backing off from his support for Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment Thursday.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies in business come from the private precincts of Wall Street investors, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. They face few of the pressures that the chief executives of public companies must juggle.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in the hedge fund industry have included Paul Singer, Steven A. Cohen and John Paulson. And Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, is an unpaid adviser to Mr. Trump on regulatory matters. (All did not respond to requests for comment.)Mr. Trump has long relied on a close and informal circle of advisers to give him a quick read on economic and financial matters. Among the more prominent in this regard is Thomas J.

{"Headline": "Taliban Leader Feared Pakistan Before He Was Killed", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was on his way home from a secret visit to Iran in May 2016, driving across a remote stretch of southwestern Pakistan, when he called his brother and relatives to prepare them for his death.\u201cHe knew something was happening,\u201d a former Taliban commander, who is close to Mullah Mansour\u2019s inner circle, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was telling his family members what to do and to stay united.\u201dIt is rare for a Taliban commander to sit for an interview, but this one spoke on the condition that his name or location not be made public, because he had recently defected from the insurgents\u2019 ranks and his life was under threat.His account offered previously unreported insights into the final hours of Mullah Mansour\u2019s life, and why and how he was killed, revealing a dangerously widening rift with his Pakistani sponsors.The account was complemented and supported in interviews with two senior Afghan officials who have conducted their own investigations into the Taliban leader\u2019s death \u2014 Haji Agha Lalai, presidential adviser and deputy governor of Kandahar; and Gen. Abdul Raziq, the police chief of Kandahar Province.More than a year after the event, Afghans on both sides of the war and a growing number of Western security analysts say that Pakistan most likely engineered Mullah Mansour\u2019s death to remove a Taliban leader it no longer trusted.\u201cPakistan was making very strong demands,\u201d the former commander said. \u201cMansour was saying you cannot force me on everything. I am running the insurgency, doing the fighting and taking casualties and you cannot force us.\u201dAfter Mullah Mansour\u2019s death, Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada, an Islamic cleric with no military experience, was selected as leader of the Taliban. Yet Afghanistan has seen little reprieve with his death, as hard-liners within the movement took over and redoubled their offensive to take power.There is little chance of anyone speaking out, the former commander said. \u201cNinety percent of the Taliban blame the Pakistanis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they cannot say anything. They are scared.\u201dHe relied on Pakistan\u2019s Intelligence Service and donors from Arab gulf states, as well as Afghan drug lords, for the main financing of the Taliban, but he was also seeking weapons and other support from Iran, and even Russia. He met officials from both countries on his last visit to Iran.Mullah Mansour\u2019s outreach to Iran was also aimed at getting the Taliban out from under Pakistan\u2019s thumb, according to his former associate and Afghan officials, so he could maneuver to run the war, but also negotiate peace, on his own terms. That was where his differences with Pakistan had grown sharpest.Mullah Mansour had resisted orders from Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency, the ISI, to destroy infrastructure \u2014 schools, bridges and roads \u2014 to increase the cost of the war for the Afghan government. He opposed the promotion of Pakistan\u2019s hard-line prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Sirajuddin Haqqani to be his deputy, and he had dodged Pakistan\u2019s demands to push its agenda in negotiations.Critically, he wanted to devolve more power to regional Taliban commanders, allowing them to raise their own funds and make their own decisions, in order to own the Afghan nationalist cause and loosen Pakistan\u2019s control over the insurgency.Others with close knowledge of the Taliban, including the former Taliban finance minister and peace mediator Agha Jan Motasim, said that Mullah Mansour was ready to negotiate and had sent top representatives to successive meetings in Pakistan.While on his way to Iran, Mullah Mansour had stopped in the Girdi Jungle refugee camp, a hub of Taliban activity in Pakistan, where he called on Taliban commanders and elders to gather for a meeting.\u201cTen days before he was killed he sent messages to villages and to commanders asking them to share their views on peace talks,\u201d said General Raziq, the police chief of Kandahar Province, a fierce opponent of the Taliban, who knows the movement well.He says that Mullah Mansour was looking for new protectors as his disagreements with Pakistan were growing.\u201cThere were reports that he may have wanted to escape,\u201d General Raziq said. \u201cWe knew one month before that Mansour was ready to make peace.\u201dGeneral Raziq also said Mullah Mansour feared assassination by Pakistan. \u201cHe told his relatives that \u2018relations with Pakistan were very bad and they might kill me.\u2019\u201dThe day he was killed, Mullah Mansour was alone.The trip to and from Iran was one he had taken before. He always traveled on a Pakistani passport, under a fake name, with the full knowledge of Pakistani intelligence.His fake identity, Muhammad Wali, was known in intelligence circles, according to a former Afghan intelligence chief, who did not want to be identified while discussing sensitive aspects of relations with neighboring countries.This time, however, unusually, when Mullah Mansour reached the Pakistani side of the border with Iran, 300 extra guards were posted at the crossing and along the highway. Mullah Mansour was detained inside the border post.He emerged after two hours, and climbed into a taxi about 9 a.m. for the eight-hour drive to Quetta. Traveling alone in an ordinary taxi was typical of the Taliban leader: low-profile, but at the same time casually confident in a familiar terrain.The Taliban had freedom of movement in the border regions with the tacit agreement of Pakistani security forces, the former Taliban commander explained. Anyone armed with a Kalashnikov, or just a walkie-talkie, could pass where ordinary civilians could not, he said.But his reception at the border had worried Mullah Mansour.He called his brother and spoke to him and family members for 45 minutes, the former Taliban commander said. He also called a close friend in Quetta and asked him to go around to his brother\u2019s house with a message to expect guests that night.He was doing what is known in Islamic Law as \u201cwasiyat,\u201d passing on his last wishes and taking leave.\u201cHe was very worried about his safety,\u201d said Mr. Lalai, the Afghan presidential adviser, who also knew of the long telephone call. \u201cHe had a conversation with his family and he gave last instructions to educate his children, on his money, most of the talk was instructions in the case of his death.\u201dWorkers farming watermelons nearby rushed to the burning wreck and shoveled dirt on the flames but could not save the men inside, General Raziq said.Members of Pakistan\u2019s Frontier Corps arrived suspiciously fast.\u201cHis car was followed,\u201d said General Raziq, who conducted his own investigation into the strike. \u201cThe Frontier Corps were following him, and within five minutes of him being hit they reached him, with the media.\u201dThe Pakistani police showed journalists Mullah Mansour\u2019s passport, undamaged, beside the charred wreck. Afghan officials and Western security analysts say it was most likely planted there after the blast since everything else was burned beyond recognition.For many in the Taliban, Mullah Mansour\u2019s death represented a devastating betrayal by their longtime patron and sponsor, Pakistan, that has split and demoralized the ranks.About two dozen senior commanders from Mullah Mansour\u2019s Pashtun tribe have defected to the Afghan government or moved into Afghanistan in fear of further retribution from Pakistan.The strike against Mullah Mansour was the first time a top Afghan Taliban leader had been killed inside Pakistan, which has provided a sanctuary for Taliban leaders throughout their 16-year insurgency against Afghanistan.\u201cHe was a prime target for the Americans and the Afghan government,\u201d General Raziq said. \u201cHe was a terrorist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 90.His death was confirmed by Michael Roach, the co-executor of his estate.Mr. Oliver first heard black American music as a teenager in England during World War II. While he was gathering crops for the war effort at a harvest camp in Suffolk, not far from an American military base, a friend asked him if he wanted to hear something unusual.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t quite right, really,\u201d Mr. Oliver added, \u201cbecause we were actually listening to field hollers, but nevertheless I found it quite extraordinary.\u201dMr. Oliver, a scrupulous researcher with a fluent writing style, opened the eyes of readers in Britain and the United States to a musical form that had been overlooked and often belittled.\u201cHe possesses broad sympathies and deep insights lacking in most American writing on the blues,\u201d the folklorist Benjamin A. Botkin wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1960, reviewing Mr. Oliver\u2019s second book, \u201cBlues Fell This Morning,\u201d one of the first efforts to examine closely the music\u2019s language and subject matter.After taking a trip through the American South in 1964, interviewing and recording blues singers, Mr. Oliver wrote \u201cThe Story of the Blues.\u201d Published in 1969, it was the first comprehensive history of the genre and remains an indispensable work.\u201cHe provides a complete factual panorama from field hollers to Chicago electronics,\u201d the jazz historian Stanley Dance wrote in Saturday Review. Mr. Oliver, he added, \u201crelates people, time and place in a way that has not been done before.\u201dBrett Bonner, the editor of the magazine Living Blues, said in an interview: \u201cPaul was one of the founders of blues scholarship. He and Sam Charters set the template for everything that followed. They also set the stage for the blues revival of the 1960s. Without them, people like Mississippi John Hurt, Son House and Skip James would not have had second careers.\u201dDespite its importance, Mr. Oliver\u2019s work on the blues was a sideline to his principal occupation, as an architectural historian. He wrote extensively on local forms of architecture around the world, a field he extended to include suburban housing tracts and squatters\u2019 camps, which he regarded as forms of cultural expression worthy of study, like the blues.Paul Hereford Oliver was born on May 25, 1927, in Nottingham, to W. Norman Oliver, an architect, and the former Dorothy Edmunds. The family moved to north London when he was young, and he attended the Harrow County School for Boys.He trained as a painter and sculptor at the Harrow School of Art, but switched to graphic design because most art materials aggravated his asthma and various allergies. At the school he met Valerie Coxon, whom he later married. She died in 2002. He leaves no immediate survivors.After earning a diploma in 1948 from Goldsmith\u2019s College in London, Mr. Oliver returned to the Harrow County School to teach art. There he founded the Harrow Jazz Purist Society; played mandolin in the Crawdads, a skiffle band; and in 1951 wrote his first scholarly article, on gospel songs, for Jazz Monthly.Dissatisfied with the quality of the cover art on records released by the British Decca label, he wrote to the company to complain and was hired as an illustrator. His first assignment was the cover for \u201cBackwoods Blues,\u201d a collection of songs by Bobby Grant, Buddy Boy Hawkins, King Solomon Hill and Big Bill Johnson, released in 1954.He later illustrated and wrote the liner notes for dozens of albums. In 1955 he earned an art-history degree from the University of London.Mr. Oliver was at work on \u201cBlues Fell This Morning\u201d when an editor at Cassell approached him to write a biography of Bessie Smith for its Kings of Jazz series. Pleased with the result, Cassell then brought out his second book.Encouraged by librarians at the United States Embassy, Mr. Oliver won a grant from the State Department and received financing from the BBC to travel to the United States and record blues artists. His journey through the South led to an enormously popular exhibition at the embassy that was attended by the singer and guitarist Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, whom Mr. Oliver had interviewed at his house in Houston.The exhibition became the starting point for \u201cThe Story of the Blues,\u201d which was accompanied by a double album tracing the music\u2019s development from its African roots to the 1960s.Mr. Oliver edited nearly a hundred interviews from his trip for \u201cConversation With the Blues\u201d (1965), an oral portrait of the music and the American South that included indigenous musical artists of every description.He wrote in the introduction: \u201cBarrelhouse pianists and juke-joint guitarists, street singers and traveling show entertainers, jazz musicians and jug band players, sharecroppers and millworkers, vagrants and migrants, mechanics and laborers \u2014 these were amongst the speakers. Some had secure jobs, some had none; some were on relief and some in retirement; some played for themselves, some played for others, some had once ridden high and others were going down slow, some were famous, some unknown, some were young and others venerable: all had played their part in shaping the pattern of the blues.\u201dHe explored the myriad influences on the development of the blues in \u201cScreening the Blues: Aspects of the Blues Tradition\u201d (1968) and \u201cSavannah Syncopators: African Retentions in the Blues\u201d (1970).His other books on the subject included \u201cSongsters and Saints: Vocal Traditions on Race Records\u201d (1984), \u201cBroadcasting the Blues: Black Blues in the Segregation Era\u201d (2006) and \u201cBarrelhouse Blues: Location Recordings and the Early Traditions of the Blues\u201d (2009). His liner notes were collected in \u201cBlues Off the Record: Thirty Years of Blues Commentary\u201d (1984).He left in 1973 to lead the art and design department at Dartington College of Arts, in Dartington Hall, Devon, and in 1978 he joined the architecture department at Oxford Polytechnic in Headington, near Oxford. It was renamed Oxford Brookes University in 1992.His many books on architecture included \u201cShelter and Society\u201d (1969), \u201cEnglish Cottages and Small Farmhouses: A Study of Vernacular Shelter\u201d (1975), \u201cDwellings: The House Across the World\u201d (1987) and \u201cBuilt to Meet Needs: Cultural Issues in Vernacular Architecture\u201d (2006).Texas A&M University Press is scheduled to publish it in fall 2018, with essays by Alan Govenar and Kip Lornell, as \u201cThe Blues Come to Texas: Paul Oliver and Mack McCormick\u2019s Unfinished Book.\u201dAn obituary on Friday about the blues historian Paul Oliver misspelled the given name of a blues artist.

{"Headline": "A Game You Can Control With Your Mind", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "A number of companies are working on ways to control machines simply with a thought. But they are likely to be met with skepticism.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When you pull the headset over your eyes and the game begins, you are transported to a tiny room with white walls. Your task is to break out of the room, but you cannot use your hands. There is no joystick or game pad. You must use your thoughts.You turn toward a ball on the floor, and your brain sends a command to pick it up. With another thought, you send the ball crashing into a mirror, breaking the glass and revealing a few numbers scribbled on a wall. You mentally type those numbers into a large keypad by the door. And you are out.Designed by Neurable, a small start-up founded by Ramses Alcaide, an electrical engineer and neuroscientist, the game offers what you might call a computer mouse for the mind, a way of selecting items in a virtual world with your thoughts.Incorporating a headset with virtual reality goggles and sensors that can read your brain waves, this prototype is a few years from the market. And it is limited in what it can do. You cannot select an object with your mind unless you first look in its general direction, narrowing the number of items you may be considering.But it works. I recently played the game, which has the working title Awakening, when Mr. Alcaide and two Neurable employees passed through San Francisco, and a few hundred others tried it this month at the Siggraph computer graphics conference in Los Angeles.The prototype is among the earliest fruits of a widespread effort to embrace technology that was once science fiction \u2014 and in some ways still is. Driven by recent investments from the United States government and by the herd mentality that so often characterizes the tech world, a number of a start-ups and bigger companies like Facebook are working on ways to mentally control machines. They are also looking for smoother ways to use virtual reality technology.\u201cNeurotechnology has become cool,\u201d said Ed Boyden, a professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at the M.I.T. Media Lab who advises one of those start-ups.\u201cWith the smartphone, we\u2019re starting to reach the limits of what we can do,\u201d said Doug Clinton, the founder of Loup Ventures, a new venture capital firm that has invested in Neurable. \u201cThese companies are the next step.\u201dAt Neurable, which is based in Boston, Mr. Alcaide and the members of his team are pushing the limits of EEG headsets. Although sensors can read electrical brain activity from outside the skull, it is very difficult to separate the signal from the noise. Using computer algorithms based on research that Mr. Alcaide originally published as a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, Neurable works to read activity with a speed and accuracy that is not usually possible.The algorithms learn from your behavior. Before playing the game, you train them to recognize when you are focusing your attention on an object. A pulse of light bounces around the virtual room, and each time it hits a small colored ball in front of you, you think about the ball. At that moment, when you focus on the light and it stimulates your brain, the system reads the electrical spikes of your brain activity.After you do this for a few minutes, the game learns to recognize when you are concentrating on an item. \u201cWe look at specific brain signals,\u201d Mr. Alcaide said, \u201cand once we understand them, we can use them.\u201dWhen you play the game, the same light bounces around the virtual room. When it hits the item you are thinking about, the system can identify the increase in brain activity.The technique works with equipment that already exists. Neurable\u2019s prototype uses virtual reality goggles from HTC, a consumer electronics company, and seven EEG sensors placed at specific spots around your head. But given the physical limits of what these sensors can read, an EEG-based game is unlikely to do more than slowly and simply select digital objects.Some companies are working to move beyond that. Facebook, for example, is exploring methods for optically reading brain activity from outside the skull. Such a system would shine light into the brain to directly read chemical changes.\u201cWhat if you could type directly from your brain?\u201d Regina Dugan of Facebook said this spring as she unveiled the company\u2019s efforts to build this kind of optical interface. \u201cIt sounds impossible, but it\u2019s closer than you may realize.\u201d In a few years, she said, Facebook hopes to have a system that allows people to type with their thoughts five times faster than they now type using a smartphone keyboard.That is well beyond the realm of current research, and a number of neuroscientists question whether it will ever be possible, arguing that such speed will only come with devices planted inside the skull.Several start-ups are now working to do just that. But some, including a Silicon Valley start-up called Paradromics, hope to do this as a way of treating people with medical conditions like blindness, deafness and paralysis.Implanting hardware in the brain is dangerous, but the reward for patients could outweigh the risks. For companies like Paradromics, the goal is to significantly refine and expand the current methods, providing a faster and more complete way for patients to operate machines with their thoughts.Mr. Musk\u2019s Neuralink is moving in a similar direction, but the company\u2019s ambitions appear to stretch much further, to eventually implanting chips in healthy people\u2019s brains.The dangers of brain surgery make this unlikely. But Mr. Boyden said there were some possibilities.\u201cI do find it implausible that an implant would go directly into the brain of someone with zero health problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if companies take the right approach in helping people with the greatest need, then there may be a way for this to spread into people with less severe conditions, and then eventually become a kind of brain augmentation.\u201dCertainly, many of these projects will be met with skepticism. And Silicon Valley\u2019s enthusiasm does not always mesh with the physical limitations of medicine and the human body.\u201cIn the physical sciences, there are physical boundaries,\u201d said Matt Angle, a neuroscientist and the founder of Paradromics. \u201cTo think that you\u2019ll be able to blow through fundamental laws by sheer ambition and enthusiasm is na\u00efve.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Sues to Have Puerto Rico\u2019s Bankruptcy Case Thrown Out", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lawsuit filed in United States District Court in San Juan, the hedge fund, Aurelius Capital, cited the \u201cappointments clause\u201d of the United States Constitution, which calls for all principal officers of the federal government to be appointed by the president, and then confirmed by the Senate.That did not happen when the seven members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico were selected, Aurelius said in its motion to dismiss the bankruptcy-like proceedings. The board members were instead \u201chandpicked by individual members of Congress,\u201d it said, through \u201can intricate system of Balkanized lists, designed to severely constrain the president\u2019s appointment powers.\u201dNo Senate confirmation proceedings occurred, although senators of both parties were among the members of Congress who made recommendations last year to President Barack Obama for the board.A spokesman for the oversight board said the members were reviewing the lawsuit and could not comment.The oversight board was established last year, when Puerto Rico was sinking under $123 billion of public debt and pension obligations that it amassed by years of borrowing to plug deficits. The federal bankruptcy code bans Puerto Rico from declaring bankruptcy, and by 2016, it was defaulting haphazardly on payment after payment, without any way to take shelter from the many resulting creditor lawsuits.Aurelius sued just days after the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, defied the oversight board for his own reasons. He said on Friday that the board\u2019s five-year fiscal reform plan was excessively harsh and that he would not shut down much of the government two days every month for the rest of the fiscal year, something the board saw as necessary to save money and streamline operations.Aurelius Capital sued in its capacity as a holder of Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds. When those bonds were issued, over many years, Puerto Rico\u2019s Constitution in effect guaranteed them, saying that if money ever became tight on the island, the bondholders would have first call on the \u201cavailable resources\u201d of the territory\u2019s government.Some of Puerto Rico\u2019s bondholders argue that they bought the bonds on the understanding that their repayments and interest were by law the government\u2019s first priority. They were surprised when they found that Puerto Rico\u2019s five-year plan called for deep cuts in all bond payments, including payments to the holders of general-obligation bonds. The oversight board wants to use the savings to finance government operations for the five-year recovery period. But creditors say this approach is at odds with the Puerto Rican Constitution.To make matters worse, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said on Friday that he was not willing to honor yet another provision of the fiscal plan: pension cuts averaging 10 percent for certain retired public workers. The five-year plan calls for the cuts to be phased in over the next three years, with the biggest pensions being cut the most.Puerto Rico\u2019s pension funds have almost exhausted their assets, and all retirees are being shifted to a pay-as-you-go system, in which the central government will pay pensions directly from its budget. That means some of its \u201cavailable resources,\u201d will be used for pensions instead of debt service.On Monday, Aurelius also asked the federal court in San Juan to lift the \u201cstay\u201d of Promesa, which keeps Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors from suing the government. Aurelius said it wanted to seek declaratory and injunctive relief to keep the oversight board from operating until it could be reconstituted in compliance with the appointments clause.\u201cWhether or not one agrees with the policy positions of the board, foundational legal principles require that it be constituted in compliance with the Constitution,\u201d Aurelius\u2019s lead lawyer, Theodore B. Olson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, said in a statement.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s stance on shutting down much of the government for two days every month for the rest of the fiscal year. He was against that action, not in favor of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe of Japan Reshuffles Cabinet, Hoping to Shore Up Falling Support", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan appointed a new cabinet on Thursday, hoping to breathe new life into his conservative government, whose support among voters has plunged after a series of scandals and missteps.\u201cI want to unite and move forward by returning to the early spirit we had when we took back the government in 2012,\u201d Mr. Abe said.After winning office in December 2012, Mr. Abe initially went to work on the economy, seeking to lift Japan\u2019s sluggish growth rate with a stimulus program known as Abenomics. The approach won him high approval ratings.But more than four and a half years later, only about a third of voters say they support his administration, according to opinion surveys by the Japanese news media.For the post of defense minister, Mr. Abe chose Itsunori Onodera, a longtime lawmaker who held the same job in the first cabinet Mr. Abe formed after his 2012 victory.Mr. Onodera succeeds Tomomi Inada, who resigned under pressure last Friday over allegations that she had withheld information from Parliament about dangers faced by Japanese soldiers on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. The episode added to the problems faced by Mr. Abe, who was already dealing with accusations of showing favoritism toward friends and conservative sympathizers, which he has denied.The post of foreign minister went to Taro Kono, one of the most liberal voices in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Kono is known for his vocal opposition to nuclear power after the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011, a position that has put him at odds with his pronuclear party.Mr. Kono\u2019s father is Yohei Kono, a former foreign minister who, as chief cabinet secretary in 1993, issued a landmark apology to women from Korea and elsewhere who were coerced into working in Japanese military brothels during World War II. The so-called Kono Statement has long been resented by the nationalist right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party.Mr. Kono succeeds Fumio Kishida, a moderate rival to Mr. Abe who is considered a potential successor as prime minister, and who did not receive a spot in the new cabinet. Mr. Kishida was instead given a top executive role in the Liberal Democratic Party, as chairman of its policy research council. Mr. Harris noted that members of Mr. Kishida\u2019s faction of the party were given more posts than in the previous cabinet \u2014 five, up from three \u2014 strengthening his position.Mr. Abe\u2019s second term as the party\u2019s president expires next year. The party changed its term-limit rules this year to allow for a third term, but without a sharp turnaround in his public support Mr. Abe is unlikely to convince party members to let him stay on.Mr. Abe selected another rival, Seiko Noda, to be his new minister of internal affairs and communications. Ms. Noda challenged Mr. Abe for the party leadership when his first term ended in 2015. She is one of only two women appointed to the 20-member cabinet, along with the justice minister, Yoko Kamikawa, a ratio that could open Mr. Abe to criticism that he is retreating from a pledge to promote more female leaders.Two of Mr. Abe\u2019s most important allies, the finance minister, Taro Aso, and the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, retained their positions.Toshihiro Nikai, the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s secretary general, will also stay on. In remarks on Thursday morning, he suggested that the government would slow its drive to amend the Constitution to remove restrictions on the military. Mr. Abe has proposed enacting such changes, which the party has long sought, by 2020, but surveys show that a majority of the public remains opposed to them.\u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to a wide array of opinions and pile caution on top of caution,\u201d Mr. Nikai said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly term-limit rules of the governing Liberal Democratic Party. The party allows its president to serve a maximum of three three-year terms, not a maximum of two three-year terms.Advertisement"}

But Tony Saich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and a director of Wanda\u2019s AMC Entertainment arm, said Mr. Xiao\u2019s work with the authorities and Wanda\u2019s problems might be connected.\u201cI think virtually all these things that are unfolding now are possibly related to Xiao\u2019s trip across the border,\u201d Mr. Saich said.Mr. Saich has played host to Wanda\u2019s chairman, Wang Jianlin, at Harvard and knows Mr. Xiao because of his donations to the university.Mr. Saich said that Mr. Xiao might be laying out for government regulators the complex and interlocking web of debts and shareholding ties among many companies that could pose a danger to China\u2019s financial stability. In the months ahead of an important Communist Party meeting this autumn, the Chinese leadership \u2014 led by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president \u2014 has placed an even bigger emphasis on stability, leaving an impression that the government is tightening its grip.\u201cMy sense is this has gone up the system to Xi and they are just staggered by what is going on,\u201d Mr. Saich added.Neither Wanda nor Mr. Xiao has ever publicly discussed whether they have a relationship. But a review of documents indicates that business associates of Mr. Xiao were involved both in the process leading up to Wanda\u2019s 2014 initial public offering in Hong Kong and its privatization less than two years later, according to numerous corporate filings in China and Hong Kong.It is not clear whether Wanda actively sought his help or whether Mr. Xiao\u2019s connections in the Chinese business world are so extensive that they could be difficult to avoid. Mr. Xiao, 45, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Wanda would not comment when asked about ties between Mr. Xiao and the company.Wanda involvement with companies connected with Mr. Xiao goes back more than eight years.A business partner of Mr. Xiao, Yang Hongwei, held a senior position at an investment firm that helped oversee a Wanda private share sale in 2009. That deal brought in politically powerful investors, including the older sister of Mr. Xi, Qi Qiaoqiao, and her husband, Deng Jiagui, as shareholders in Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties, Chinese corporate records show. That Wanda unit, the company\u2019s flagship, owns shopping malls across China.Mr. Yang at the time ran the China operations of the investment banking arm of China Construction Bank, a huge state-run lender, and that investment bank was itself once one of Wanda\u2019s biggest shareholders.Mr. Yang also had extensive ties with Mr. Xiao. The two founded an internet company in 2000, then Mr. Yang went on to run another technology company that counted one of the companies in Mr. Xiao\u2019s fleet as a top investor.Wanda later took the commercial properties business public, in 2014. Then, when Wanda took it private again less than two years later in a $4.4 billion deal, a business connected to Mr. Xiao played a crucial role.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio Will Push for Tax on Wealthy to Fix Subway", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio plans to push for a tax on wealthy New Yorkers to pay for improvements needed to address the crisis engulfing New York City\u2019s subway, city officials said on Sunday.The proposal is the latest move in the battle between Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over who bears responsibility for repairing the deteriorating transit system. The plan would also pay for half-price MetroCards for low-income riders \u2014 part of a national movement that has gained momentum in New York.Mr. de Blasio will announce a so-called millionaires tax on Monday for wealthy New York City residents to pay for subway and bus upgrades and for reduced fares for more riders, an idea that has been successful in Seattle.Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, who are Democrats and have long had a strained relationship, have engaged in an acrimonious public skirmish over financing for public transit. Mr. Cuomo controls the transportation authority, but he has called on Mr. de Blasio to help fix the system. Both leaders have been under pressure to address the crisis, with worsening subway service hurting Mr. Cuomo\u2019s approval rating among voters, and with Mr. de Blasio being targeted by a harsh television ad campaign by the subway workers union.\u201cRather than sending the bill to working families and subway and bus riders already feeling the pressure of rising fares and bad service, we are asking the wealthiest in our city to chip in a little extra to help move our transit system into the 21st century,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.The tax changes would require approval from state lawmakers in Albany \u2014 a difficult hurdle, with Republicans in control of the Senate, though the urgency of the subway\u2019s decline has raised the stakes and captured the attention of both parties.On Sunday, the authority\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, responded to the mayor\u2019s proposal by saying that the agency needed emergency financing immediately.\u201cThere\u2019s no question we need a long-term funding stream, but emergency train repairs can\u2019t wait on what the State Legislature may or may not do next year,\u201d Mr. Lhota said in a statement.Mr. Lhota, who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. de Blasio for mayor in 2013, also took a jab at Mr. de Blasio, saying he was glad the mayor had \u201creversed himself\u201d after arguing that the authority did not need additional money. Mr. Lhota recently proposed a roughly $800 million plan for immediate subway repairs and called on Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio to split the costs evenly.Mr. Cuomo echoed Mr. Lhota, saying that waiting to approve a new revenue stream when the next legislative session began in January would take too long.\u201cThe city should partner with us and match the state funding now so we can begin Chairman Lhota\u2019s overhaul plan immediately and move forward,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot ask New Yorkers to wait one year to start repairs.\u201dMr. Cuomo faces a re-election campaign next year and is thought to be considering running for president in 2020.Mr. Gianaris said state lawmakers should not wait until the next session to take up the mayor\u2019s proposal.\u201cI would argue that the M.T.A. is in a full-blown crisis and that would justify our return to Albany to enact this measure in an emergency session,\u201d Mr. Gianaris said.Scott Reif, a spokesman for Senate Republicans, said the city should not discuss raising taxes when it had a large surplus.\u201cIf the city wants to up its contribution to help shore up the subways for commuters and their families \u2014 which we support \u2014 it certainly has the means to do that,\u201d Mr. Reif said in a statement.The proposed new tax would raise about $700 million to $800 million a year, with more than $500 million going toward capital costs for subways and buses and about $250 million for the half-price MetroCard program, city officials said. It would increase the city\u2019s highest income tax rate by about half a percentage point, to 4.4 percent from about 3.9 percent, for married couples with incomes above $1 million and individuals who make more than $500,000.City officials estimate that the tax would be paid by about 32,000 New York City tax filers, or fewer than 1 percent of those who file their taxes in the city. New Yorkers already contribute to the authority through various taxes and fees, and the city has committed $2.5 billion for the agency\u2019s current capital improvement plan.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan comes with several demands, including that Mr. Cuomo keep his promise for the state to pay $8 billion toward the authority\u2019s current capital plan and an additional $1 billion Mr. Cuomo committed for the subway in June. The new funding would also be separate from the authority\u2019s short-term subway rescue plan, which city officials said should be paid for by returning money to the authority that the state had previously diverted.The mayor\u2019s embrace of half-price MetroCards for poor New Yorkers comes after months of lobbying from transit activists and could be a popular proposal as Mr. de Blasio runs for re-election in November. About 800,000 people in New York City who are at or below the federal poverty level \u2014 about $24,500 for a family of four \u2014 could qualify for half-price MetroCards, city officials said. Women are more likely to live in poverty in New York City, and the poverty rate is higher among black, Hispanic and Asian residents, according to the city\u2019s statistics on poverty.Under the program in King County in Washington, which includes Seattle and its suburbs and has a population of more than two million, residents with household incomes of less than double the federal poverty level \u2014 about $49,000 for a family of four \u2014 can qualify for a special discount card to ride buses and light rail. Riders must apply in person at an enrollment center and provide documentation to verify their income.John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, a New York City advocacy group that has called for reduced fares, applauded the mayor\u2019s push for new revenue and his support for half-price MetroCards.\u201cWe need to get the subway system working again so that New Yorkers can get to work,\u201d Mr. Raskin said, \u201cbut we also need to make the system accessible for the poorest New Yorkers so they can find jobs, education and economic opportunities in the first place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Diverse City, but Most Big Museum Boards Are Strikingly White", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cultural organizations are starting with a mixed record. In a city known for its racial and ethnic diversity, the percentage of people of color serving on boards remains strikingly low at most institutions, and some elite Manhattan museums and arts groups employ overwhelmingly white staffs even as they try to attract a broad cross-section of visitors, according to data collected by The New York Times.Becoming more diverse is clearly possible, the results also show. At the Studio Museum in Harlem, 82 percent of the board members are people of color, compared with 25 percent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and 10 percent at New York City Ballet. Minority staff members also account for 66 percent of employees at the Brooklyn Museum, which prides itself on reaching a diverse audience, while they make up about 41 percent at MoMA PS 1.The Times asked for the information from the cultural groups to get a snapshot of where they are starting. City officials, in assessing diversity, are also looking at categories like people\u2019s gender, sexual orientation, age, and whether they have a disability. The Times focused on data specifically about racial diversity because increasing it is perhaps the biggest challenge for many of these institutions.The information reflects findings in a study last year that city officials called \u201ctroubling\u201d: While 67 percent of New York City residents identify as people of color, only 38 percent of employees at cultural organizations describe themselves that way.That survey, undertaken by the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs, also found that 26 percent of senior staff members identify as people of color, compared with 32 percent of midlevel staff, and 45 percent of junior staff.\u201cThe whitest job in arts and culture? Curator,\u201d the study said. \u201cThe jobs with fewest white workers: maintenance and security.\u201dTom Finkelpearl, the commissioner of Cultural Affairs, said in an interview that the city has not set specific percentages or benchmarks for diversity for arts groups, and that the goal was more generally aimed at having them demonstrate meaningful plans for progress.\u201cIt\u2019s not just who you hire,\u201d he said. \u201cAre people then actually involved in the decision making? Is it tokenism or is it something that\u2019s fundamental? In what categories are people\u2019s careers being nurtured and are people being included?\u201dAn additional 1,000 cultural organizations, which compete for the remaining city funds, will face a new question in the application process this February along the lines of, \u201cHow does your organization address diversity and inclusion in its staff, board and program?\u201dSo far, arts groups say they welcome the city\u2019s dictum. At the Museum of the City of New York, where people of color make up 35 percent of the staff and only 10 percent of board members, officials said they were committed to becoming more diverse.\u201cOur goal is to have 25 percent of our board include people of color over the next five years,\u201d said Whitney W. Donhauser, the museum\u2019s director.Several arts organizations say they have already been working on improving diversity in their ranks and several have made progress. MoMA PS1 said it has added more than 25 minority staff members over the last five years, in positions including chief operating officer, maintenance technician and installer.In the last five years, the Museum of Natural History added five minority board members. \u201cWe spend a lot of time on this and we will continue to,\u201d said Ellen V. Futter, the museum\u2019s president.Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, which funded the research for the cultural plan, said arts groups are becoming more proactive not just because of political pressure, but because of economic necessity: They need to build a broader audience by better reflecting a broader audience.\u201cTo fulfill your mission you\u2019ve got to be credible,\u201d he said, \u201cand in order to be credible, the community needs to see themselves represented among you.\u201d\u201cThe hardest nut to crack is going to be the boards,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said, adding that executives need to think about ways besides money that trustees of color can add value, namely through their art collections, personal connections or professional expertise.Mr. Walker said there is still the persistent problem of insularity; boards are clubs that tend to be homogeneous. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because trustees are limited by their own networks,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThe places they look are the places they\u2019ve always looked and those places generally have very few people of color.\u201dThe Brooklyn Museum has long developed a diverse team, and just last week announced the appointment of two new minority curators: Aysin Yoltar-Yildirim in Islamic Art and Ashley James in contemporary. But the museum also recently lost Rujeko Hockley to the Whitney Museum of American Art.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem we\u2019re going to have to address,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said. \u201cSmaller organizations invest a number of years of training, then a bigger institution gets a fully trained person.\u201dStill, Thelma Golden, the director of the Studio Museum, said that part of its mission was developing the expertise of staff members in the work of artists of African-American descent so that they can take that knowledge to other museums.\u201cWe have actively trained curators and enthusiastically sent them out into the world,\u201d Ms. Golden said. \u201cWhen I have a curator, I\u2019m thinking that from the beginning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I turn my back for one second. I said don\u2019t stop. One, two, don\u2019t stop! All your co-workers \u2014 they\u2019re spending their day the wrong way. You\u2019re with me.\u201d After consistently encouraging Ms. Uwera through a handful of rounds, Mr. Kelly relented a bit, but by the end of the hour, Ms. Uwera was a puddle.\u201cSo,\u201d Mr. Kelly playfully asked, \u201cyou\u2019re coming back at 6 tonight, right?\u201d A panicked look flashed across her face; for a second, she thought he was serious. Instead he said: \u201cThat\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough, you got to get back to work. You gonna miss me?\u201dSouthBoX is the latest step in the unusual career of Mr. Kelly, a two-time Golden Gloves-winning boxer notorious for being a foul-mouthed, no frills trainer.His presence in this part of the South Bronx, however, is complicated. The waterfront neighborhood of Mott Haven is in the midst of a revival, and SouthBoX is part of the first wave of new businesses attracted by a multimillion dollar development. The gym is backed financially by Keith Rubenstein, the owner of the building and the primary developer of luxury apartment towers, and while membership is in line with Mott Haven prices, Mr. Kelly does have a stable of private clients who pay a premium for his personal sessions.Still, he maintains that he has no intention of undermining the character of South Bronx. \u201cYou want to keep it authentic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m offering something that is not gentrification. I\u2019m not gentrification.\u201dMr. Kelly grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in the 1980s. He was the nation\u2019s No. 1 amateur boxer in 1998, and was an alternate on the 2000 United States Olympic team in Syndey. His career was cut short by a pool hall fight \u2014 Mr. Kelly offended a hustler who then lodged a pool cue in Mr. Kelly\u2019s left eye socket, leaving permanent nerve and muscle damage. \u201cI got caught up in the streets,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cI never really wanted to get my eye fixed because it shows me where I\u2019ve been, what I\u2019ve lost and how I got to that point, and I don\u2019t want to lose anymore. This is a reminder, a keepsake, a token, but it keeps me honest, and the ladies say it adds character.\u201dWhen Mr. Kelly\u2019s boxing career ended, he moved from the University of Northern Michigan Olympic Training Center, where he had been on scholarship studying English, back to Brooklyn. In 2007, he had the first of his four children and realized he had to parlay his boxing and teaching skills into a career.\u201cDo your uppercut again,\u201d Mr. Kelly says. \u201cDo your uppercut again.\u201dKelly mimicked his style by wildly throwing haymakers in the air.\u201cIs it good or bad?\u201d the trainee asked.\u201cTerrible,\u201d Mr. Kelly says. \u201cThe worst thing in the world.\u201dAnd yet the finance guys seem to love him all the more for it, and his brash coaching style led to improbable success. He was on \u201cThe Chris Rock Show\u201d and was featured on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Jon Stewart. There were a few offers to develop TV shows, but nothing came of it. Mr. Kelly kept training at Church Street, where one of his clients was the real estate developer Keith Rubenstein.\u201cThe reason I got this facility today is because I cussed out Keith Rubenstein,\u201d he said in an interview at his new gym. Now, five years after the video was produced, Mr. Kelly has opened up SouthBoX in partnership with Mr. Rubenstein.\u201cI love Eric\u2019s style of motivation,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said recently. \u201cNot everybody can achieve what he achieves with that style. He\u2019s fought the fight and he\u2019s done it, he can get away with it. What\u2019s great about a gym like this is everybody\u2019s equal when you put the gloves on.\u201dMelissa Mark-Viverito, councilwoman for the district, tweeted about the party at the time: \u201cLack of empathy & basic awareness are signs of an ailing society. Who thought \u2018Bronx is Burning\u2019 theme a good idea?\u201d and \u201cNope. It\u2019s beyond bad taste. Our community, my constituents, deserves respect, not that.\u201d When asked now about the party, Mr. Rubenstein said: \u201cWe tried to move on from the party, the party was a misunderstanding from what we were trying to achieve. I take responsibility for it.\u201dFor Mr. Kelly, the only people who didn\u2019t get the party were \u201chaters.\u201d\u201cIt was an amazing party,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re mad at what\u2019s going on, how come you didn\u2019t do anything to change it? How bad did you want it to change? If you wanted it to change for the good, you would have done something about it.\u201dSouthBoX is a spare 3,000 square-foot space with a concrete floor and a large mural of Muhammad Ali. The ring is small, just 12 by 12 feet, but big enough for sparring. Mr. Kelly is always holding court with the people training \u2014 shouting instructions and telling clients which bags to pummel and for how long. Michael Gonzalez, 46, owner of Verde Flowers on Lincoln Avenue was shadowboxing on a recent afternoon. He has lived in the South Bronx for 15 years and has owned Verde for the past nine years. He comes to SouthBoX four times a week to train. In the 1990s Mr. Gonzalez competed in the Golden Gloves and trained at two boxing gyms in the South Bronx that both recently closed. \u201cThis is perfect,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cEric makes sure all my punches are thrown the right way. He\u2019s sharpening me up.\u201d\u201cThe Bronx is one of the few places that hasn\u2019t been built up in this city, but it has a rich history of boxing,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. It\u2019s no accident that SouthBoX is about a mile and half away from the original Gleason\u2019s, which opened in 1937 \u2014 Jake LaMotta, Roberto Dur\u00e1n, and Cus D\u2019Amato all passed through there during the heyday of New York boxing.\u201cThis is not a white collar boxing gym. If you come to me you\u2019re going to get rough, hard-core boxing,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIf you come to spar, we\u2019re going to spar. And you\u2019re going to get cussed out regardless.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Titans of American industry and finance revolted against a man they had seen as one of their own, concluding Wednesday morning they could no longer serve on two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory panels.Five armed services chiefs \u2014 of the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines and the National Guard Bureau \u2014 posted statements on social media condemning neo-Nazis and racism in uncompromising terms. They did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but their messages were a highly unusual counter to the commander in chief.Republicans, too, issued new denunciations of the hatred on display in Charlottesville, although some remained vague about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.Vice President Mike Pence abruptly cut short a trip in South America as his aides announced he would return home early to attend meetings on Friday and through the weekend at Camp David. The White House insisted that the topic of the meetings would be South Asia. During his travels, Mr. Pence stood by the president but declined to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s comments at Trump Tower on Tuesday that \u201cboth sides\u201d in Charlottesville were to blame.The president\u2019s top advisers described themselves as stunned, despondent and numb. Several said they were unable to see how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency would recover, and others expressed doubts about his capacity to do the job.In contrast, the president told close aides that he felt liberated by his news conference. Aides said he seemed to bask afterward in his remarks, and viewed them as the latest retort to the political establishment that he sees as trying to tame his impulses.Mr. Trump\u2019s venting on Tuesday came despite pleas from his staff, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Instead of taking their advice to stop talking about the protest, the president eagerly unburdened himself of what he viewed as political correctness in favor of a take-no-prisoners attack on the \u201calt-left.\u201dOn Wednesday, even Fox News, a favorite of the president\u2019s, repeatedly carried criticism of Mr. Trump. One Fox host, Shepard Smith, said that he had been unable to find a single Republican to come on-air to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.No one from the president\u2019s team has resigned as of yet, but some spoke candidly on Wednesday about whether they could continue to work much longer for a man who has expressed such sentiments. Most incensed among Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers, according to three people familiar with the situation, was Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, who told people around him that he was offended, as a Jew and as an American, by the president\u2019s reaction to the violence in Charlottesville.The relationship between the president and Mr. Cohn, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the news conference, seems to have suffered a serious blow. Although White House aides denied that he was planning to quit, they acknowledged that Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, was upset with the president\u2019s lack of discipline.Many in the White House said they still held on to the hope, however slim, that the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, could impose order on the disarray even as Mr. Trump hopscotches from one self-destructive episode to the next.Mr. Kelly, who watched the president\u2019s performance on Tuesday with his head hung low, grimacing at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, is frustrated, according to people inside the White House.Several people who participated in White House conference calls over the weekend said Mr. Kelly initially did not seem to fully grasp the effect of the controversy about the president\u2019s remarks. But as a former Marine, Mr. Kelly is determined to try to bring order to the White House, the officials said.\u201cThey tried to kill my child to shut her up, but guess what, you just magnified her,\u201d Ms. Bro said.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, denounced \u201chate and bigotry\u201d in a statement on Wednesday but made no mention of Mr. Trump or his comments \u2014 an example of the careful line that some Republican officials are treading as they hope to work with the president on a conservative agenda in the months to come.Leaders of the Republican Jewish Coalition were more direct, calling on Mr. Trump to \u201cprovide greater moral clarity in rejecting racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism.\u201d They added: \u201cThere are no good Nazis and no good members of the Klan. Thankfully, in modern America, the K.K.K. and Nazis are small fringe groups that have never been welcome in the G.O.P.\u201dDavid Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, delivered an emotional statement to reporters on Wednesday at Mr. Trump\u2019s private golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where the president is vacationing. Treading carefully without chiding Mr. Trump, Mr. Shulkin said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m speaking out, and I\u2019m giving my personal opinions as an American and as a Jewish American. And for me in particular, I think in learning history, that we know that staying silent on these issues is simply not acceptable.\u201dParaphrasing famous words from Martin Niem\u00f6ller, a German pastor and a vocal critic of Adolf Hitler, Mr. Shulkin said, \u201cFirst, they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I wasn\u2019t a trade unionist, so I didn\u2019t speak out. Then they came for the Jews. I wasn\u2019t a Jew so I didn\u2019t speak out. Then they came for me, and there was no one to speak for me.\u201dSteven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury, who is also Jewish, stood silently behind Mr. Trump on Tuesday as the president said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d in Charlottesville. Mr. Mnuchin has not said anything publicly about the president\u2019s remarks.Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, who is Jewish, denounced hate groups but defended Mr. Trump in response to a reporter\u2019s question on Wednesday.\u201cI know President Trump and his heart,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote. \u201cHe is a good man and doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body.\u201dAn article on Thursday about tensions between President Trump and military and business leaders over his remarks about protesters in Charlottesville, Va., misidentified, in some editions, the location of a statue of Robert E. Lee that was the focus of the protests. It is in a public park in Charlottesville \u2014 not on the University of Virginia campus, where protesters first gathered. The article also referred incorrectly to a military leader whose post on social media condemned racism. The post was by the chief of the National Guard Bureau, not the Coast Guard.Michael D. Shear and Glenn Thrush reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York and Bedminster, N.J.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron Vowed to Be Business Friendly. Now He Faces a Protectionist Uproar.", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Two weeks after taking office, President Emmanuel Macron, donning a white hard hat, stood before hundreds of employees at the nation\u2019s largest shipyard, promising to protect a French jewel from falling into foreign hands.Mr. Macron campaigned to make France more business friendly by luring foreign investment and easing regulatory complexities. But blocking the deal for STX, along with a series of other maneuvers in recent weeks, is prompting concerns that Mr. Macron may follow the tried and true French tradition of dirigisme \u2014 an interventionist approach that his predecessors have employed time and again to promote French interests.France is finding itself in the middle of debate over protectionism, as a backlash against globalization deepens around the world. President Trump is championing a more nationalistic stance in the United States, while Europe is generally calling for freer trade to stoke growth.Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s economy minister, on Tuesday traveled to Rome to meet with Italy\u2019s economy and industry ministers, who criticized what they called an \u201cincomprehensible\u201d decision over STX, and accused France of lapsing into economic nationalism. Mr. Le Maire said the seizure of STX was temporary and designed only to buy time to renegotiate an accord more favorable to the French government, which owns a third of the company.\u201cEven if it is temporary, it\u2019s part of the French way of doing things,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, the head of research at OpenCitiz, a political risk consultant firm in Paris. \u201cMacron says he\u2019s going to do things differently, but he also has to work with existing institutions and the culture, and that won\u2019t just go away in a few months.\u201dSuccessive presidents have declared France \u201copen for business,\u201d only to get intimately involved in corporate takeovers, especially when a foreign company is making a play.Despite declaring he would make France\u2019s economy more liberal, Mr. Macron has shown a willingness to involve the state in industrial policy.More recently as president, Mr. Macron has exerted that power in the name of saving jobs. When GM & S, a struggling French auto parts supplier, veered toward bankruptcy this summer, his government demanded that the partly state-backed carmakers, Renault and Peugeot, order tens of thousands of euros worth of new parts from the plant.The 277 workers had booby-trapped the factory and threatened to blow it up unless a buyer was found. Mr. Macron sought to entice a savior by pressuring Renault and Peugeot to also invest millions more in modernizing the plant, on a remote and polluted parcel of land in central France.A French buyer finally sealed a deal this week. Fewer than half the jobs will be kept.While Mr. Macron\u2019s early actions set a distinct pattern, it is not clear how much further he will go. He is still hoping to lay the groundwork for growth, in part by lightening the French state\u2019s hand in companies, which could make such economic intervention less possible.\u201cIt looks bad for France\u2019s image right now,\u201d said Patrick Artus, the chief economist at the French bank Natixis. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think his mission is to increase the activism of the state.\u201dMr. Macron has pledged to revamp France\u2019s costly pension system, to invest in education and to build up France\u2019s technology and renewable energy sectors. To pay for it, he has hinted at privatizing billions of euros worth of the French government\u2019s holdings in a swath of French firms.\u201cIn five years, the French state\u2019s presence will be much lower than today,\u201d Mr. Artus said. Meanwhile, he added, Mr. Macron\u2019s interventions are \u201call political marketing.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s poll ratings have slumped recently from near record highs as he prepares to push through steep budget cuts and painful changes to French worker protections and labor laws. French unions have called for street protests in September.But the decision to temporarily nationalize the STX shipyard, in Saint-Nazaire, has proved popular with the French public, which generally wants the French state to preserve national interests.\u201cMacron is picking his fights right now in French public opinion, and dropping the tool of nationalization is not one of them, given what he has to do in terms of cutting budgets and implementing labor market reforms,\u201d Ms. Krumbm\u00fcller said. \u201cNot nationalizing STX would have been too expensive for him in terms of popularity.\u201dIn the case of STX, Mr. Macron\u2019s government said its concerns went beyond jobs. Under the contract signed by former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the Italian state-backed shipbuilder Fincantieri was to take a two-thirds stake in the French shipyard held by a now-bankrupt South Korean owner.Fincantieri had pledged to keep thousands of jobs and orders for the next five years at Saint Nazaire. The hulking operation makes many of the world\u2019s mega-cruiseships and has the capacity to build aircraft carriers and other naval vessels.The French government said the deal could jeopardize the Saint-Nazaire operations in part because Fincantieri holds stakes in Chinese shipyards, raising concerns about a transfer of technology to China. The deal would also effectively give the Italian state, which owns Fincantieri through a finance company, sway at a strategic French site.Last week, as the contract was about to take effect, the Macron administration tried to renegotiate a 50-50 split. When Fincantieri balked, the French government seized control by exercising its right to buy out existing shareholders.On Tuesday, Mr. Le Maire sought to smooth tensions with Rome, where officials questioned why it was acceptable for a South Korean shipbuilder to hold a majority stake, but not an Italian one. Italians are also incensed that French companies have spent billions on takeovers of its own major businesses in sectors like dairy and luxury, without the Italian state putting up a fuss.Mr. Le Maire, in his talks with Italian officials, offered to work with Italy to create a \u201cEuropean naval shipbuilder champion,\u201d in which the two countries would collaborate on building civilian and naval vessels.Should the Italians reject a deal, he told a French newspaper, \u201cwe will stick with the current situation and look for other potential buyers.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title held by Bruno Le Maire. Mr. Le Maire is the economy minister in France, not the prime minister.An article on Wednesday about France\u2019s economy erroneously attributed a distinction to the Meraviglia cruise liner, built by the shipyard STX France, which an Italian competitor is trying to take over. At 171,598 tons, the Meraviglia is the world\u2019s biggest luxury cruise ship built in 2017; it is not the biggest over all. (The 226,963-ton Harmony of the Seas, also built by STX France, holds that distinction.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From President Macron, a Lesson in Style", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookAmerican politics needs a makeover, and Emmanuel Macron might be the man to do it. Sure, the technocrat-turned-president has a lot on his plate right now \u2014 compelling stuff like recasting France as an innovative tech hub, rejiggering his country\u2019s archaic work rules and reviving its flagging economy. But if he ever has a moment to spare away from the demands of international diplomacy and arm-wrestling President Trump, the mediagenic politician who came out of nowhere to win a hotly contested race could give his counterparts in the United States a master class in playing the image-manipulation game.For a start, he could offer pointers on how to use clothes to political advantage, as he did throughout his canny presidential run. Before this novice of the campaign trail became, at 39, the youngest man ever elected president of France, Mr. Macron had been a banker and a minister of economy and finance, one who dressed in the chic, uptight uniform of the power elite: pinstripe suits, white shirts with modest spread collars, anonymous silk ties.Back when he was dressing in outfits that cost 1,200 euros (about $1,400), Mr. Macron found himself vulnerable to criticism from those in his former (Socialist) party. Just by losing the hand-stitched buttonholes and the smart silk linings, he saved himself roughly $800 a suit and simultaneously gained himself a measure of voter approval \u2014 appreciation for a cost-value proposition being as deeply Gallic a quality as a love of Serge Gainsbourg.It doesn\u2019t hurt that Mr. Macron is a youthful piece of brainy eye candy. Still, one gets the sense a politician shrewd enough to outmaneuver the American president \u2014 as he did Mr. Trump during a Bastille Day state visit \u2014 could manipulate his imagery just as deftly if he had two heads.And here is where he has something to teach his American friends. Dip a toe into the unceasing torrent of news from inside the Beltway and it becomes obvious that, in United States politics, image management plays little part in anyone\u2019s job description. Sure, there are more pressing matters at hand in Washington right now than lapel widths. Yet a steady HDTV diet of senators with comb-overs and insurance-agent sack suits can sometimes exaggerate the ways in which the political establishment appears out of touch with a country growing younger and more urban every day.Smarten up, Senators Tom Carper (Democrat of Delaware), Mike Crapo (Republican, Idaho), Angus King (Independent, Maine), Sherrod Brown (Democrat, Ohio) and Ron Johnson (Republican, Wisconsin). Those folksy button-down shirts in your official portraits are neither authoritative nor casual enough. No one says you have to aim for the Jupiterian heights Mr. Macron aspires to. But either dress up or dress down.And hire a stylist, Senators Jerry Moran (Kansas), Steve Daines (Montana) and John Hoeven (North Dakota), all Republicans, someone who can help you out of those big-shouldered power suits that look as if they were run up by an upholsterer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even for Philanthropists, Museums Can Make Art a Tough Give", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersIn 1988, William Jordan saw a portrait in a catalog from a London auction house. The work was attributed to Justus Sustermans, a Flemish painter in the Medici court in Florence. But as an art historian, Mr. Jordan was sure it was actually a work by the 17th-century master Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.He bought the painting for 1,000 pounds \u2014 much less than a Vel\u00e1zquez would have cost \u2014 and had it shipped to his home in Dallas, where it was cleaned and reframed. And there it hung for nearly 30 years.Last year, his hunch was validated. The Prado Museum in Madrid, which owns a third of all of Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s works, said Mr. Jordan\u2019s painting was the real thing.If this seems like the way collectors typically sail through donations of art, think again. Mr. Jordan\u2019s tale sounds like some supercharged episode of \u201cAntiques Roadshow,\u201d but most collectors struggle to donate their art, even valuable art, to museums.\u201cThere\u2019s this natural feeling that you can walk up to the Met and they\u2019ll take your work,\u201d said Steve Schindler, chairman of the art law committee of the New York City Bar Association and a partner at Schindler Cohen & Hochman. \u201cIt\u2019s not so.\u201dOr as Evan Beard, national art services executive for U.S. Trust, put it: \u201cIf you have a Picasso worth $6 million or $7 million, every museum in the country will say thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d For other works, particularly collections of mixed quality, there is likely to be a negotiation.It\u2019s a lot easier to donate art when the museum asks for it first. \u201cMy clients who have donated to museums have had really long-term relationships with the museums,\u201d said Nilani Trent, an art adviser in Manhattan. \u201cThey\u2019ve been part of the museum for many, many years. Usually, the museum has approached them and said, \u2018This is a weak part of our collection.\u2019\u201dThe process was fairly painless because the museum did not have a piece of art by such a significant artist, Ms. Ingrassia said.\u201cIt\u2019s a piece that I loved, but my family didn\u2019t really understand,\u201d she said of the work, which is a photo of a vagina carved in sand. \u201cIt was very well received. It\u2019s often on view.\u201dSince then, Ms. Ingrassia, 52, has donated about 10 works, and contributed money with other trustees toward additional pieces. But she said her interest \u2014 contemporary art \u2014 dovetailed with an area where the museum was expanding.Other donations have a more difficult time getting approval. \u201cWe\u2019re being very careful with what comes into the collection,\u201d Ms. Ingrassia said. \u201cWe used to be a place where Grandma\u2019s furniture ended up.\u201dBeing turned down is a reality, though, for any collector. Ms. Trent has been trying to help a client donate his art to museums so that he can change the nature of his collection. His offers have been rejected.\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re bad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that they don\u2019t fill a hole.\u201dIf a museum is on the fence about a donation or collection, it might ask for additional money in the form of an endowment to accept the art.\u201cThe first thing people are surprised with is when the museum comes back and says, \u2018I\u2019ll take your painting if you give us an added endowment to care for the work of art,\u2019\u201d Mr. Beard said. \u201cUsually, a museum will want one or two specific items in your collection to fill gaps, and they look at everything else as cost because they\u2019re going to have to store it.\u201dBeing asked for money after offering works of art may sound ungrateful. But museums are bound to maintain \u2014 and not sell off \u2014 their collections, and storing all the pieces they cannot show can cost thousands of dollars a year.Yet Mr. Beard said the request for a significant sum could also be a signal to collectors that they should look elsewhere. \u201cIs it better to go for a midsize regional museum where your works will be a focus,\u201d he asked, \u201cor an encyclopedic museum where your works will see the light of day every five years?\u201dOf course, museums are not the only place to donate art. Collectors can donate to charities where the art may be displayed or sold to finance projects. Jane Wilton, general counsel of the New York Community Trust, said the organization was given hundreds of works by Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda in 1992.The collector who donated the art wanted it to be used to pay for research into AIDS and H.I.V. And it did, though it took the community trust nearly 15 years to sell it all.Institutions may push back on gifts for another reason: fear of provenance or authenticity. Antiquities are particularly fraught, given patrimony laws that protect artifacts.\u201cYou may have some great Egyptian artifacts and you\u2019d love to have them in the museum when you die, because who else is going to take them?\u201d Mr. Schindler said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have good proof that they came out of the ground before 1970, good luck.\u201dAnd there is the risk that cherished works of art are not real. Ms. Wilton said one such piece hangs in her office as a reminder to be diligent in evaluating bequests. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be by Winslow Homer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt turned out to be a Homer Simpson.\u201dOne big benefit is whether the institution provides a tax deduction. If the work goes to a museum, the donor gets the full deduction. If it goes to a nonprofit where art is not central to the mission, the donor is eligible only for the value of the piece when it was purchased.In 2014, a group of Spanish-art enthusiasts set up the American Friends of the Prado Museum, which promotes the museum in the United States. But it has the added benefit of ensuring that donors get a tax deduction for their gift, which they are technically donating to an American nonprofit organization that in turn lends it to the Prado. (The Louvre and the Vatican Library have similar 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations in the United States.)Mr. Jordan, who was the deputy director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth when he bought the Vel\u00e1zquez, is not, by his own admission, a wealthy man. But he said he had known every director of the Prado since the 1970s and wanted the museum have the piece.\u201cThe museum has had a long relationship with Bill Jordan,\u201d said Miguel Falomir, director of the Prado. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a collector. He\u2019s a scholar. He\u2019s collaborated with us. He\u2019s created exhibitions. He\u2019s an old friend of the museum.\u201dVel\u00e1zquez\u2019s artwork is \u201cimportant to understand his early development in Madrid,\u201d Mr. Falomir added. \u201cIt provides a lot of detail for us. It\u2019s something we\u2019d like to display in our permanent collection.\u201dThat\u2019s the type of validation every collector wants to hear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Neighborhoods That Play Hard to Get", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRichmond Hill, in southwestern Queens, can be an eye-opener for the uninitiated home buyer. Neck rolls may even be in order. They\u2019ll help with the double take: Victorian houses with verandas and grassy lawns a few blocks from the subway; locals gallivanting on horseback in Forest Park; street parking on a Saturday.Perhaps the most unusual sight in this tree-lined neighborhood: a for-sale sign.\u201cI really lucked out,\u201d said Ernest Gutierrez, 39, who, with his wife, Jennifer Deeb, 41, bought a seven-bedroom Victorian house in the area for $780,000 last year \u2014 in an off-market deal.Mr. Gutierrez, a finance director for a media company who already owned a house two blocks away, got wind of the listing about a month before it was to hit the market for $800,000. He and Ms. Deeb met the sellers, whose family had lived in the house since 1961, and made the first and only offer entertained, promising to keep the house\u2019s historic character intact, and to someday pass it on to their three children. The sellers accepted the next day, despite the prospect of getting more on the open market, and the buyers became only the third owners in the house\u2019s 110-year history.Such is the art of the deal in some of New York\u2019s most impenetrable markets, where new inventory is tight, homeowners seldom sell and word of mouth is gold. Across the city, in mostly blue-collar neighborhoods, farther out than many Manhattanites are used to treading, demand is on the rise, but hardly anyone leaves. House hunters may find architectural gems or money-pit makeovers, or nothing at all in these inventory-starved markets. Still, the lure of reasonably priced homes in tight-knit communities has buyers itching to get in.To find the most difficult neighborhoods to crack, we asked the real estate website StreetEasy to analyze residential sales turnover in New York City since 2010, based on city Department of Finance records. StreetEasy excluded the borough of Staten Island, because it had insufficient data. We used neighborhood boundaries as defined on StreetEasy\u2019s website. The data included repeat sales of the same properties between 2010 and mid-2017.By contrast, the neighborhood with the most sales activity was Downtown Brooklyn, where 51 percent of residential inventory sold. The turnover rate in the four boroughs overall was 15 percent in that period.Prices in many of the low-turnover neighborhoods are climbing, spurred by lack of inventory. That\u2019s part of the problem, said the real estate appraiser Jonathan J. Miller.\u201cIt\u2019s money on paper,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause, where are you going to go?\u201d Higher prices across the city, he said, encourage longtime owners to stay put.For buyers trying to break into these neighborhoods, browsing online listings may not get you anywhere. Many of these properties are not formally listed, while others are shopped around quietly before making a public debut. Sometimes, you just have to know \u201cthe guy\u201d \u2014 the broker in the neighborhood, who may or may not be a guy, whom everyone trusts.\u201cI don\u2019t need signage,\u201d said Joseph Milone, the owner of Joseph Milone Realty, who relies on word of mouth, and eager buyers, to sell homes in Morris Park, the Bronx, where he has lived since 1979.\u201cIf I put a house on the market, it will not take two weeks to get it done. There\u2019s nothing available,\u201d he said. Morris Park has had 6 percent turnover since 2010, with just 26 sales last year.Dan Scaglione, 51, an owner of Scaglione Brothers\u2019 Bakery & Deli on Morris Park Avenue, became a part-time salesman with the Pantiga Group realty three years ago, because patrons kept asking him for real estate leads. \u201cSellers just tell their friends and neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the neighborhood, you won\u2019t see the listings.\u201dAdvertising is not his problem. \u201cA couple months ago,\u201d he said, \u201cI put a sign up, I walked back a block and a half to my business, and I had three calls already.\u201dThe neighborhood, about an hour\u2019s subway ride from Midtown, has a bustling Little Italy, and has attracted a large Albanian population, as well as Hispanic and Chinese buyers. It\u2019s appealing to first-time buyers, who spent a median $485,000 on a home here last quarter, according to StreetEasy. That\u2019s up almost 13 percent from last year, but still a relative steal in a community filled with spacious brick rowhouses.Erik Caiola, 36, and his wife, Carly, 35, bought one of those rowhouses, a two-family with a backyard, for $579,500 in April.\u201cWe\u2019re the youngest on the block by a good 20 years,\u201d said Mr. Caiola, who works in commercial development. Ms. Caiola is a nursery school administrator. They bought the house from the late owner\u2019s adult children, whose family bought the house in the 1980s.They first tried to buy a large three-family house; it was listed for only a week, and they were outbid, Mr. Caiola said. The house they ultimately bought had been lingering on the market for a few months, in part because of the dated interior, he said, with shag carpet, glossy finishes and a small kitchen. But it was nevertheless a find, and they put in an offer the same day they saw it.\u201cIf this one wasn\u2019t available, there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019d still be looking,\u201d he said.Renovations are underway, with Mr. Caiola gutting the kitchen and replacing 1970s design faux pas. Next up: getting to know the neighbors.\u201cThere\u2019s a cafe we go to, where it\u2019s all old Italians sipping espressos,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a joy for Mr. Caiola\u2019s father, a second-generation Italian-American with roots in Calabria, who chats up locals on the block when he visits.On the other hand, Mr. Caiola said, \u201cthere\u2019s very little anonymity,\u201d which took some getting used to after living in Brooklyn rentals. \u201cIf you\u2019re new to the neighborhood, they\u2019ve just got their eye on you. People actually say \u2018hi\u2019 to you.\u201dAs climbing prices push home buyers farther from the city core, some are finding hidden gems \u2014 and unexpected competition.With the help of Jay Molishever, an associate broker at Citi Habitats, they found a new listing for a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a low-rise co-op, right on Sunset Park, for $550,000.\u201cI knew this was home, before we even saw the whole place,\u201d said Ms. Jancuska, who was impressed by the bustle of activity in the park \u2014 neighbors practicing tai chi, couples dancing to Chinese pop and folk songs, early-morning soccer games. Other buyers felt the same \u2014 there were already three above-asking-price bids.\u201cThe list time is getting shorter and shorter,\u201d said Peter Bracichowicz, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, who represented the sellers, an older Polish couple moving upstate.Mr. Allen said they \u201cput everything, and then some\u201d down to seal the deal, outbidding the other buyers. Only two other units sold in the 69-unit building this year, and the next most recent sale was in 2012, according to StreetEasy.For their effort, they got a 750-square-foot prewar apartment with vistas of the park. They join a building with about 20 children under 10, he said. The residents of the building, originally a Finnish co-op, still abide by the tradition of talkoot, a community exercise in which everyone works on beautification and maintenance projects.\u201cIt\u2019s a magical place,\u201d Mr. Allen said, reflecting on an impromptu Monday concert in the courtyard, with a standup bass, trombone and drum set.\u201cIt\u2019s so much more diverse,\u201d said Caroline Bailey, 49, a copywriter who bought in a nearby co-op in March, after renting in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, where she said, \u201cwe had diversity, but it was all white people from different countries \u2014 like France.\u201dIn her new building, the board meetings are conducted in both Chinese and English. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of waving, and gesturing, and smiling, too,\u201d she said. She estimates that about 80 percent of the owners in her 36-unit co-op are of Chinese descent, plus a mix of Latinos and South Asians. That echoes the neighborhood\u2019s two main streets, Eighth Avenue, a hub for Chinese immigrants mostly hailing from Fujian province, and Fifth Avenue, with many storefronts bearing signs in Spanish.Securing a new home in low-turnover neighborhoods can take more than getting there first or waving a big wad of cash.In Richmond Hill, some residents are appalled by new owners who destroy historic elements of the mostly Victorian-style houses. In their case, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Deeb appealed to the seller\u2019s love for the house. The couple vowed to keep the house intact, including stained-glass windows, original oak and maple floors and dentil molding. They hope their children, Chloe, 16, Amelia, 12, and 8-month-old Elliot, will take up the mantle one day.It didn\u2019t hurt that their agent, Regina Schaefer Santoro, an associate broker at Parkside Realty and a longtime resident, got Mr. Gutierrez in to see the house before it hit the market. Ms. Santoro is a friend of the seller, she said.To buy their new home, Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Deeb had to sell their old Richmond Hill house. The buyers: Aaron and Alexandra Leeder, former renters in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.\u201cThey wanted somebody who cared about the house,\u201d said Mr. Leeder, 34, who works for TwentyPine, a job recruitment firm. Ms. Leeder, 32, is a preschool teacher who now cares for their daughter, 7-month-old Vivienne. They bought the Gutierrez-Deeb home, a 1920s detached three-bedroom, for $580,000 last year, in a deal arranged by Ms. Santoro.\u201cIt was kind of a nice passing of the baton,\u201d Mr. Leeder said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better, Safer Battery Could Be Coming to a Laptop Near You", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A start-up company is trying to turbocharge a type of battery that has been a mainstay for simple devices like flashlights and toys, but until now has been ignored as an energy source for computers and electric cars.Executives at Ionic Materials, in Woburn, Mass., plan to announce on Thursday a design breakthrough that could make solid-state alkaline batteries a viable alternative to lithium-ion and other high-energy storage technologies.Alkaline batteries can be made far more cheaply and safely than today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries, but they are not rechargeable. That issue, along with the superior power of lithium-ion batteries, has meant that alkaline batteries are not used in personal computers, smartphones or electric vehicles.Cheaper and more powerful batteries are also considered by many to be the driver needed to make the cost of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar competitive with the coal, gas and nuclear power that support the national energy grid.Ionic said it had developed prototypes of a rechargeable alkaline battery that can be made using continuous manufacturing processes similar to the making of plastic wrap. So far, the company, which is backed by William Joy, a pioneering Silicon Valley computer designer, has demonstrated up to 400 recharge cycles for its prototypes. Ionic executives say they believe they will be able to triple that.The alkaline batteries that Ionic has developed would initially be heavier than today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries, said Mike Zimmerman, a materials scientist who is the founder and chief executive of Ionic. But the new batteries would more than compensate for that handicap with their cost advantage and, in time, their ability to store more energy.There are other advantages besides cost and safety. Lithium-ion batteries rely on cobalt, and using that element comes with a human cost. Cobalt mines in Africa, for example, have been accused of using child labor while leaving behind a toxic mess.Alkaline batteries, on the other hand, use relatively abundant zinc and manganese. \u201cIonic can help us get lithium-ion past cobalt and completely eliminate it with alkaline,\u201d said Mr. Joy, who is a member of Ionic\u2019s board.He also said that the company had made progress toward an alkaline battery design that would replace zinc with more affordable aluminum. In the past, aluminum has not been usable because of issues like corrosion. Alkaline batteries based on aluminum would potentially weigh less than lithium-ion batteries and would be even cheaper to produce than today\u2019s alkaline designs.Ionic will make its announcement in Colorado at a conference for the 35th anniversary of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainable-energy research group founded by the physicist and environmentalist Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins, his former wife.\u201cThey started with a very sensible set of criteria,\u201d Dr. Lovins said of Ionic. \u201cThey use an unusual electrolyte to come up with a battery that uses common cheap materials and is benign.\u201dBut he added a note of caution: \u201cBatteries are very difficult and I want to see what they have and what can be measured and proven and whether it will get to market.\u201dTechnological progress in battery technology has been glacial compared with the exponential advances in processing speed and data storage capacity that have been staples of Silicon Valley\u2019s growth. In the last 150 years, only a handful of rechargeable battery chemistries have reached mass adoption.Tesla, in partnership with Panasonic, is building a factory in Nevada with the intent of greatly expanding capacity to make lithium-ion batteries and lower production costs. Tesla officials said they wanted to create enough capacity to produce batteries for 1.5 million cars a year.There is growing interest in pursuing such so-called solid-state battery technologies for both consumer and transportation applications. Last fall, the United States Department of Energy\u2019s agency for supporting research in next-generation energy technology announced 16 research awards aimed at accelerating development of solid battery technologies, including a $3 million contract to Ionic Materials. The company said it had signed several licensing deals to produce commercial versions of its design, but it would not identify its partners.The United States Advanced Battery Consortium, an auto industry group, wants to greatly reduce the cost of lithium-ion production. Analysts, however, say they believe the new facilities and technology from auto and battery manufacturers will help bring costs down, but still fall short of industry goals.In contrast, Ionic executives said they had found a way to achieve energy production costs that would be less than a fifth of the auto consortium\u2019s target.Bloomberg New Energy Finance, an energy research group, has forecast that mass-market adoption of electric vehicles will not occur until operating costs fall to match those of internal combustion engines. That is expected to happen in 2025, according to the group.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China, Like U.S., Struggles to Revive Industrial Heartland", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENYANG, China \u2014 The hulking, brown-brick industrial plants lining the roads were once the backbone of this gritty city. Today, they are outdated and unwanted, and the region is one of the Chinese economy\u2019s most troubled.A short drive away, however, a newly minted industrial park offers reasons for optimism. Liu Qi, the chairman of PQI Industrial Technology Group, opened an $18 million factory there last year, equipped with whirring robots that pound out car parts for the German automaker BMW.The factory, and the more than 200 jobs it has created, is just one small part of a grand plan led by China\u2019s government to rejuvenate Shenyang, a city of eight million, by replacing stumbling state industries with modern manufacturing and start-up companies.\u201cWhen things hit bottom, there is an opportunity for things to go up,\u201d Mr. Liu, 46, said.Whether the rejuvenation happens will shape not just the future of Shenyang, but also, potentially, the entire Chinese economy. The city\u2019s woes represent a broader problem: There are too many unproductive, debt-laden factories that are losing business as China\u2019s growth slows. If Beijing fails to overhaul those crumbling industries and revive the communities that rely on them, Shenyang and the surrounding area \u2014 and other similar regions \u2014 could weigh heavily on the country\u2019s economic progress.The story of Shenyang will probably sound familiar in places like Midwestern towns in the United States that have seen important industries decline or depart. During China\u2019s go-go years, when factories, roads and housing were constructed with wild abandon, the city\u2019s heavy industrial companies, many of them owned by the state, boomed.A rush of wealth was plowed into new apartment towers and shopping malls in Shenyang. The city still has an industrial air, with central office blocks designed in a near-uniform drab brown, matching its factory complexes.But as China\u2019s investment binge fizzled, Shenyang and its factories sputtered. Last year, the economy of the northeastern province of Liaoning, of which Shenyang is the capital, shrank 2.5 percent \u2014 a shocking figure in a country accustomed to seemingly endless expansion. Other major cities have sped ahead of Shenyang in the development of the high-tech and service companies expected to propel China\u2019s future growth.The entire northeast of the country, where much heavy industry has been concentrated, runs the risk of being left badly behind. The decay of this factory zone has left Beijing with a similar knotty problem to the one that has plagued Washington for decades: how to resurrect down-on-their-luck areas.In the United States, President Trump plans to streamline regulation, cut corporate taxes and renegotiate trade pacts to bring factory jobs back to troubled towns.Around the world, state intervention to attempt to stimulate a domestic economy is not unusual. But officials in China, as is often the case, have adopted a much more hands-on approach. With lavish incentives and initiatives, they are trying to attract investment to the region and to upgrade its industries.Shenyang is a crucial test case. The city has set up a $7 million fund to support high-tech industries, promised a $30,000 bonus for some technology firms, and offered to pare the corporate tax rate for companies in favored sectors.Mr. Liu\u2019s factory opened inside the China-Germany Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park, introduced in late 2015 to try to attract advanced production in robotics, automotive components and other industrial sectors. The government offers a 30 percent discount on land, streamlined regulations and other perks for companies that set up in the facility. PQI is now negotiating for rent breaks and cheap land for his current factory, as well as for future investments.Zhang Yanzan, the park\u2019s deputy director, says that, since its opening, more than 140 factories have been completed or are underway, hauling in a total investment of nearly $6 billion. \u201cWe hope this park can be an example for other areas,\u201d he said.The city authorities are also striving to persuade local college graduates to start companies in Shenyang by offering subsidies. The effort is focused on a shopping arcade of fast-food restaurants and computer outlets that had Start-Up and Innovation Street added to its name in 2015.On the top floor of one office tower in the area is an incubator called Phoenix Valley, founded by two Shenyang-born businessmen. One room is a cafe, where budding entrepreneurs swap tips over cappuccinos and browse shelves of books on business building. Next door, desks can be rented in a communal office for 300 renminbi, or about $45, a month. The incubator has more than 100 members and will soon open a second office in the city.\u201cThe development in Shenyang is not as fast as in Beijing and Shenzhen, but if start-ups are really good at what they do, they will have more potential to grow,\u201d said Hong Qifan, who founded Phoenix Valley with his business partner, Ma Ke, citing China\u2019s capital and one of its southern boom towns.Shenyang\u2019s taxpayers are contributing to the effort. Some entrepreneurs are eligible for subsidized housing, with rent costing the equivalent of $30 a month. This year, Phoenix Valley received a cash handout from the central and municipal governments worth more than $70,000. Local officials also helped the incubator\u2019s founders negotiate a below-market rent for its headquarters.Occupying one of the Phoenix Valley desks recently was Tao Qiuchen, 25, a Shenyang native who has founded a company called Hong Mo Fang Enterprise Management, which plans parties. In less than a year, Mr. Tao has hired 20 employees, thanks in part to the local government, which pays the interest on the $24,000 bank loan he took out to start the business.The government programs \u201care definitely helping the economy,\u201d he said.Still, Innovation Street pales in comparison to the efforts in hot spots like Beijing and Hangzhou, a city in the east, which have not only higher salaries, but also entire neighborhoods of start-up centers. And the residents of Phoenix Valley complain that venture capital and talent are scarce in Shenyang.Other initiatives in the city seem to be generating more buzz than business. In April, Shenyang opened a branch of the provincial free-trade zone, in which companies can benefit from reduced red tape, discounted land and other advantages. At its offices, in the corner of a gargantuan, columned hall worthy of a Star Trek set, dozens of businesspeople and their agents lined up to register companies.But the zone\u2019s rules do not require these businesspeople to start any actual operations there. Tian Jiawei, a manager at an agricultural company based near Shenyang, registered an export-import firm, but has no plans to open an office or hire workers.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of tax break I might enjoy, but I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity,\u201d he said.More problematic: Shenyang\u2019s incentive programs are not unique. \u201cEvery province and city in China has policies to encourage investment and start-ups,\u201d said Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIf northeast cities just do the same, they won\u2019t be able to compete with those who are already ahead of them.\u201dThe result is that, even with its active officials, China may find reviving its troubled industrial towns every bit as challenging as Western countries like the United States do.\u201cShenyang still has a long way to go,\u201d Mr. Liu, the factory owner, said. \u201cIt is like grass that you burn to the ground. It is going to grow back. You just don\u2019t see it at the moment.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Notorious B.I.G., Brooklyn Street Bard, Gets Official City Tribute at Last", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1990s, before Brooklyn was a brand, there was a singular bard of the borough, and his name was Christopher Wallace.At 6 feet 2 inches and nearly 400 pounds, Mr. Wallace, known as the Notorious B.I.G., was a larger-than-life figure in the rap scene. A masterful raconteur with a forceful flow, he chronicled neighborhood street life in stylized, almost cinematic detail, from corner drug deals to fractured family negotiations.Now, after several failed efforts to secure official recognition for Mr. Wallace, who also went by Biggie Smalls, New York City\u2019s parks department has renamed the basketball courts at Crispus Attucks Playground, roughly on the border between Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant, in his honor. The dedication of the Christopher \u201cBiggie\u201d Wallace Courts was part of a $2.5 million renovation that overhauled the playground\u2019s athletic equipment, fencing, flooring, garden and security features.\u201cThis is about preserving the legacy of Biggie and hip-hop in a community that\u2019s quickly gentrifying,\u201d said Councilman Robert E. Cornegy Jr., a Democrat who helped secure financing for the project and led the drive to name the courts for Mr. Wallace. \u201cNow, no matter how much this community changes, there will always be a record of the culture that lived here.\u201dOn Wednesday, more than 100 local residents gathered at the playground for a jubilant, sweat-soaked ribbon-cutting. The crowd included Mr. Wallace\u2019s daughter, T\u2019yanna; the D.J. Mister Cee, one of the earliest champions of the rapper\u2019s work; and the music video director and producer Ralph McDaniels, who is known as Uncle Ralph. Dozens of children formed lines for layups and games of knockout on the freshly paved courts.\u201cIn a way, this was Biggie\u2019s first stage,\u201d Mr. McDaniels said. \u201cWe were all just lucky to be his audience.\u201dMr. Wallace was not a particularly skilled athlete, but he visited the courts regularly to watch games and entertain fans on the sidelines with his own rap interludes. Over the years, basketball became a frequent point of references in his rhymes, as he compared himself to Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, among others. In \u201cI Got a Story to Tell,\u201d he even recounted the tale of his affair with the girlfriend of a Knicks player.Around the city and beyond, Mr. Wallace\u2019s scowling, chubby-cheeked visage graces more than a few graffiti murals. \u201cSpread love, it\u2019s the Brooklyn way,\u201d an oft-quoted line from his song \u201cJuicy,\u201d has become an unofficial motto for the borough.For Mr. Cornegy, the dedication of the court felt like a fitting coda to his own relationship with Mr. Wallace. The councilman grew up in the same building as the rapper, at 226 St. James Place, and came to admire the lyrical prowess he displayed on the court that now bears his name.\u201cBig was a funny kid, a little chubby with a bubbly personality and a whole lot of smarts,\u201d Mr. Cornegy recalled. \u201cHe was a wordsmith; he could\u2019ve written novels.\u201dAfter Mr. Wallace was killed, there was a vigil outside of Mr. Cornegy\u2019s first-floor window, with mourners coming from around the world to contribute candles, cash, bottles of Hennessy Cognac and other offerings. Mr. Cornegy made a ritual of collecting the items and taking them to the rapper\u2019s mother, Voletta Wallace.\u201cI promised her then I\u2019d do everything I could to keep her son\u2019s legacy alive,\u201d Mr. Cornegy said.\u201cGentrification hasn\u2019t just taken over the homes but also the culture,\u201d said Tyrone Harris, 36, a D.J. from Bedford-Stuyvesant, who attended the ceremony on Wednesday. Although he was thrilled to see Mr. Wallace recognized by the city, he said he had already formed his own personal remembrances of the rapper: Tucked beneath the right sleeve of a T-shirt emblazoned with the rapper\u2019s face was a tattoo of a Biggie lyric.And then there was the memory of the time that Mr. Harris met the man himself, from behind the counter at Wendy\u2019s. \u201cHe ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, mayo, lettuce, no cheese, hold the tomato,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cDamn, I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both feature myriad anecdotes of job searches, all with happy endings, but the journey there invariably proves daunting, circuitous and chancy. Moreover, the reality that apparently favors liberal arts majors is precisely what makes the current job market so forbidding: extreme precariousness. Trained to be flexible and adaptable, these students are well equipped, according to Anders, to navigate an unstable job market, where companies, fields and sometimes whole industries rise and fall at a nauseating clip, where automation is rendering once coveted skills redundant and where provisional short-term jobs, freelance assignments, part-time gigs, unpaid internships and self-employment are replacing long-term, full-time salaried positions that include rights and benefits protected by unions. While Anders, a contributing writer at Forbes magazine, clearly wants the best for recent liberal arts graduates, his pep talk often consists of rebranding the treacherous market conditions of the 21st century as part of a thrilling new frontier. Instability can promote \u201cquirky-job-hopping\u201d and greater \u201cautonomy.\u201d Recent liberal arts graduates who find these conditions less than inviting, Anders says, simply need to discover the proper spirit of adventure \u2014 the same spirit that led them to their chosen field of study. But somehow it seems unlikely that his analogy to white-water rafting will get them excited to send out yet another batch of cover letters and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.The two books also raise hard questions about who exactly can turn a liberal arts degree into a successful career. In almost all of the stories, job candidates must survive a significant lag time before finding a position that pays the bills, during which they are often forced to pursue additional training or accept poorly compensated work while relying on financial support from their parents. Moreover, in just about every case, they end up tapping into an extensive network of family and friends. Ominously, Stross, a professor of business at San Jose State University, chooses to restrict his study to Stanford graduates in order to ensure that he has a sufficient number of success stories. And even these individuals end up struggling along the way. How much harder must it be for those with fewer connections and with B.A.s from less prestigious schools? No wonder first-generation, working-class and foreign students are so often drawn to technology and business majors, which appear to provide a more direct line between credentials earned and career opportunities secured. When Anders observes that Etsy wants employees who can \u201cbanter about Jenny Holzer\u2019s conceptual artwork and turn theory into praxis,\u201d this sounds like code for people who can speak the language of privilege. It is possible, of course, for a B.A. in the liberal arts to help working-class students acquire the cultural fluency that generally develops out of being raised amid the affluent and the highly educated, but it also seems likely that an elite background, not a degree in theater or art history, is the most reliable gateway into the career fields Anders is plugging. Anders does cite a 2015 study indicating that students with liberal arts degrees from lower-ranked schools entered the tech sector at only a slightly reduced rate compared with students from highly ranked schools (7.5 percent to 9.9 percent).

Besides Mr. Washington, other figures whose images are cast in bronze, gold and silver within the single-room show on Wall Street in the financial district include Joe Louis, Bessie Coleman and the Tuskegee Airmen.A few of the objects, like a 2016 Harpers Ferry National Historical Park quarter, representing Washington, D.C., and another from Washington, featuring the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, issued in 2017, are currently in circulation. But most, like two for President Barack Obama from his first and second terms in office, and Rosa Parks\u2019s 1999 bronze medal, were pressed strictly to honor the subject, not to be used as money. Still, they represent what Ms. Williamson called a funky twist in how people think about the United States Mint.Ms. Thomas and Ms. Williamson opened their online museum, which has all the usual elements of the brick-and-mortar kind, including a gift shop with T-shirts and coffee mugs, as a way of celebrating their blackness and their mutual love of 1970s black culture. \u201cFat Albert and the Cosby Kids\u201d cartoon cels and blaxploitation movie posters can be viewed at the museum site.

By about a year later, they had about 30, and now the collection has ballooned to around 12,000 objects, including black advertising tins and black postage stamps, and all of it is self-funded. In the late \u201990s, they opened a gallery in Summit, N.J. But the aftermath of 9/11 forced them to close.\u201cThe community was in mourning,\u201d Ms. Thomas said, and foot traffic slowed so much it didn\u2019t make sense to stay open.\u201cHaving the gallery space, just the physicality involved in moving stuff and hanging art, was hard enough, and something I would rather not do again,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cSo I said, \u2018How about we put our stuff online first, and maybe we can have a physical space later?\u2019\u201dThe move from physical to digital worked so well that they never looked back.Hundreds of thousands of people have now visited the site, including representatives of colleges, libraries and institutions like the Museum of American Finance.If the online address sounds like a destination for the nostalgic or the lighthearted, it is. \u201cWe\u2019re basically stuck in the \u201970s, and we know other people are, too,\u201d said Ms. Williamson, who works on the site full time. Ms. Thomas is a preschool teacher \u2014 she limits her funky endeavors to after-school hours.\u201cWhen we were kids growing up eating cereal in front of cartoons on Saturday mornings, we saw some of the first positive representations of black people on television,\u201d through shows like \u201cThe Jackson 5ive,\u201d Ms. Williamson said.Ms. Thomas said, \u201cWe were the first generation that benefited from that, and we know other people appreciate those memories and want to relive them too.\u201d But they recognize that the UnCut Funk museum is also becoming a place for serious scholarship. This is by design.\u201cWe sort of realized that things have come full circle, with happy slaves being depicted picking cotton on Confederate currency just before the Civil War, to Obama\u2019s bronze medals for being the first African-American president, to Harriet Tubman being on the new 20 and Sojourner Truth having a turn on the 10 and Marian Anderson being on the 5 in 2020 \u2014 which I hope still happens,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.The plan is to keep expanding the collection, and to keep curating and lending it.

{"Headline": "Red Sox Renew Push to Rename Yawkey Way Amid Monument Debate", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 A dark blue banner with red letters reads \u201cWelcome to Yawkey Way,\u201d and on Friday morning it still hung over a street lined on one side by shops selling Boston Red Sox gear and souvenirs, and on the other by the brick facade of the team\u2019s century-old home, Fenway Park.The question was, how long would the banner, and the name, remain?Yawkey Way, just two blocks long, is a narrow and unremarkable roadway, but it is familiar to Red Sox fans because it transforms into a pedestrian promenade on game days, with much of it cordoned off to allow thousands of fans to gather to drink beer, eat grilled sausages and buy souvenirs before entering the ballpark.By noon on Friday, before an important weekend series against the visiting Yankees, fans had already begun filtering onto the street, lining up to take tours of Fenway Park and wandering in and out of the shops.Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh supports changing the name, members of his staff said, although he declined to address the topic with reporters on Friday, saying he was focused on the demonstrations in the city planned for Saturday.Debate exploded on local radio, however, with callers to several stations objecting to a potential name change. One man, identifying himself as \u201cJohn from Quincy,\u201d said on WGBH that changing the name was \u201cfoolish\u201d because no one thinks about Yawkey when they go to games at Fenway.\u201cIf you want to do something for whites and blacks,\u201d he added, \u201clower the ticket prices.\u201d\u201cWe are honored to have the Yawkey name on so many organizations and institutions that benefit Bostonians of all races,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are disheartened by any effort to embroil them in today\u2019s political controversy.\u201dYawkey owned the Red Sox for more than 40 years until his death in 1976, and the team remained in his family until it was sold to a group headed by Henry in 2002.The Red Sox were the last major league team to integrate, when they promoted infielder Pumpsie Green in 1959, a dozen years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball\u2019s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Yawkey had owned the team for more than two decades by then, and he would continue to control it for 17 more.\u201cFor me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multicultural, but stand for as many of the right things in our community as we can,\u201d Henry wrote Thursday in an email to the Herald. While the makeup of the team\u2019s roster changed long ago, Henry said he was \u201chaunted\u201d by the team\u2019s complicated racial past.Yet Henry\u2019s mere suggestion that the team would press for the renaming of the street made the Red Sox the latest organization or figure in sports to enter the kind of polarizing political discussion that athletes and teams have long avoided.In Boston, the feelings about Yawkey, who died in 1976, are not nearly as polarizing. Tim Frost and his friend Michael Douglas, who attended an event for season-ticket holders Thursday night at Fenway, said they were in favor of the name change. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re trying to erase him; it\u2019s not like they\u2019re taking down a statue,\u201d said Frost, 51. \u201cBut Henry is very aware of the perception of Boston as a racist city, and that\u2019s the last thing they want.\u201dHenry noted to The Herald that changing the name of Yawkey Way would require the approval of another business that shares the street. One solution, he suggested, might be to simply honor a different Red Sox figure. He even floated an idea: David Ortiz Way.Katharine Q. Seelye and Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump insulted Mr. Stephanopoulos personally in Phoenix while singling out his news organization.As usual, CNN got the worst of it, facing chants that included \u201cCNN Sucks,\u201d although ABC and CNN both reported that none of their personnel had been threatened physically.But to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric would be to disregard the risk of violence that comes with the kind of presidential incitement we saw Tuesday night.It would also mean disregarding an element of presidential leadership that we are all taught in grammar school: its broad influence \u2014 how it can set a tone for others to follow.\u201cIt\u2019s providing cover for repression around the world,\u201d said Courtney Radsch, the director for advocacy at the Committee to Protect Journalists.Financing for the site came partly from $50,000 that Representative Greg Gianforte, Republican of Montana, donated to the committee as part of his settlement with Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian whom Mr. Gianforte body-slammed this year when Mr. Jacobs approached him with questions. (Mr. Gianforte pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge in June.)Some of the most disturbing moves against the press this year stem from a new brand of anti-media vigilantism. And this has been a particularly bad week for that, too.Allow me to direct you to Martin Shkreli, whom a Brooklyn jury convicted this month of security fraud related to a stock scheme involving a pharmaceutical company he co-founded, Retrophin. But you probably know Mr. Shkreli from his company Turing Pharmaceuticals\u2019s outrageous increasing of prices on a drug that helps people with compromised immune systems fight parasitic infections.The attacks on ProPublica were so intense that they caused the entire staff to lose access to incoming email for five or six hours on Tuesday, the journalism organization\u2019s president, Richard Tofel, told me.\u201cI assume something like this is designed to prevent these people from doing their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have every intention to continue to do our jobs.\u201dAnd that was the answer, of course; it has been all year, the year before that and so on.\u201cAt some level,\u201d as Mr. Stephanopoulos told me, \u201cthat\u2019s all we can do.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou have to trust that if we do our job and do it well and do it with integrity and don\u2019t make mistakes, that in the end, the sort of fundamental idea behind the First Amendment \u2014 that the truth will out \u2014 will actually take place.\u201dWhat seemed to particularly sting on Wednesday was the way that Mr. Trump had impugned journalists\u2019 patriotism.\u201cClaim bias.

Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor in New Jersey, it would have prevented her husband\u2019s firm from getting any state contracts under a potential Murphy administration, the result of New Jersey\u2019s strict pay-to-play laws. She also would have been able to give only $4,300 to Mr. Murphy directly.In a brief phone interview, Ms. McPherson confirmed she made the donations and that she is an \u201canti-Christie\u201d voter, but declined to comment further.Sending the money to the governors association is legal. And with just two statewide elections this year, the national group can use that money to support Mr. Murphy in New Jersey.The donations have come largely from a mix of pharmaceutical companies, unions, construction companies, law firms and corporations that would have been barred from obtaining government contracts if they had donated directly to Mr. Murphy or local candidates.In the primary, Mr. Murphy spent more than $20 million of his own money to fend off challenges from Jim Johnson, John Wisniewski and Raymond Lesniak. Now, he will not be able to tap his personal wealth to support his candidacy and instead will be limited to spending $13.8 million in the general election.The Democratic Governors Association is not limited to simply supporting Mr. Murphy; it can use the money however it wants, within federal guidelines, and that includes sending money to county political parties. This year, the group has sent more than $415,000 to county parties in New Jersey, sending the maximum amount of $37,000 each to 10 counties.One New Jersey union, the Operating Engineers Local 825 PAC, which represents heavy equipment operators, mechanics and surveyors, made a $300,000 donation this year to the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association, its first to the group and the largest single contribution from New Jersey.\u201cWe wanted to make a statement on how important control of the statehouses is to us,\u201d said Greg Lalevee, a business manager at the union. As an example of why donating to the association was crucial, he noted that in Kentucky, after legislative control switched from Democrats to Republicans, lawmakers tried to limit the power of unions.Some global companies based in New Jersey, including Johnson and Johnson, AT&T, Novartis and Merck, often give similar amounts every year to both the Democratic Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association, a political investment intended to ensure access to events held by both groups.But the prospect of victory by Mr. Murphy, who leads Ms. Guadagno by nearly 20 points in many polls, has attracted new donors to the Democratic organization.A hotel group known as Jersey City Hospitality donated $37,500 this year, the first time it has appeared on the donor rolls of the Democratic Governors Association. G.R. Robert Construction Company, another first-time donor, contributed $27,500. Mount Construction Company gave multiple donations this year totaling $52,943.Jeff Brindle, the executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission, said the one restriction on national donations from New Jersey is that businesses are not allowed to form political nonprofits to circumvent the state\u2019s pay-to-play laws.\u201cOtherwise, business entities with state contracts must limit their contributions to $300 or less only to gubernatorial candidates, county parties, state parties, municipal parties and legislative leadership PACs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cContributions larger than $300 to federal committees are not explicitly prohibited in the law except for the one exception listed above.\u201dBut the practice has led many critics to argue that it is an easy way for contractors seeking favorable treatment to funnel money to candidates.\u201cThis is a Laundromat for contractor money,\u201d said Mr. Holman, who works for Public Citizen, a liberal research group. \u201cAnd contractors know it.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo, Awash in Scandal, Faces Violations Over Car Insurance Refunds", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWells Fargo, the scandal-plagued bank, is facing new regulatory scrutiny for not refunding insurance money owed to people who paid off their car loans early, according to people briefed on the inquiry.The latest inquiry, by officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where the bank has its headquarters, involves a different, specialized type of insurance that is sold to consumers when they buy a car. Called guaranteed auto protection insurance, or GAP, it is intended to protect a lender against the fact that a car \u2014 the collateral for its loan \u2014 loses significant value the moment it is driven off the lot.GAP insurance, also known as guaranteed asset protection, makes up that difference for a lender if, for instance, a car is stolen before the loan is paid off. Regular car insurance typically covers only the current market value.Because Wells Fargo is a large auto lender, tens of thousands of customers may have been affected by the bank\u2019s actions on GAP insurance.It is not mandatory for car buyers to carry GAP insurance, which typically costs $400 to $600. But car dealers push the insurance, and lenders like it because of the protection it provides. When borrowers pay off the loans early, they are entitled to a refund of some of the GAP insurance premium because the coverage they paid for is no longer needed.Laws in nine states require that customers get unused insurance money back. They are Alabama, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon and South Carolina.Jennifer A. Temple, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, provided a statement saying: \u201cDuring an internal review, we discovered issues related to a lack of oversight and controls surrounding the administration of Guaranteed Asset Protection products. We are reviewing our practices and actively working with our dealers and have already begun making improvements to the GAP refund process. If we find customer impacts, we will make customers whole.\u201dMs. Temple declined to say when the problem began. She said the bank was trying to assess how many customers had been affected. Wells Fargo improved controls on the refund process in 2014, she said. The unit of the bank that makes car loans is called Wells Fargo Dealer Services.Asked about the regulatory inquiry into GAP insurance at Wells Fargo, Darren Gersh, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington said, \u201cWe are focused on ensuring that the root causes of a firm\u2019s compliance and controls breakdowns are understood and addressed.\u201d He declined to comment on the specifics, adding that \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board will take any regulatory and supervisory steps we feel are necessary to ensure the firm\u2019s attention to compliance.\u201dA failure to refund the insurance money harmed borrowers whose cars were repossessed by increasing what they owed, a figure that the bank reports to consumer credit bureaus. All 50 states require that the amount of unused insurance be credited to those borrowers\u2019 accounts, reducing the amount owed.The bank alluded to the new problem briefly in its quarterly financial statement issued Friday. \u201cThe company has identified certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed auto protection waiver or insurance agreements between the dealer and, by assignment, the lender, which may result in refunds to customers in certain states,\u201d Wells Fargo said in the filing.\u201cThese and other issues related to the origination, servicing and/or collection of indirect consumer auto loans, including related insurance products, may subject the company to formal or informal inquiries, investigations or examinations from federal, state and/or local government agencies, and may also subject the company to litigation.\u201dGAP coverage is similar to home mortgage insurance, which shields lenders against a default if a borrower loses his or her job and cannot make the payments.\u201cDealer Services is on a journey to strengthen its business, fix problems and help build a better Wells Fargo,\u201d Ms. Temple said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken huge proactive steps to improve the customer experience.\u201dThe new problem raises questions about Wells Fargo\u2019s internal controls and its board\u2019s oversight of company operations.More recently, after the disclosure that the bank had forced auto insurance on customers who did not need it, several Democratic lawmakers asked that hearings be convened to learn more.In its regulatory filing on Friday, Wells said its directors had undertaken actions to enhance governance and oversight.\u201cThe board recognizes that there is still work to be done, and, in response to feedback received at our annual stockholders meeting in April 2017, the board is engaging in an ongoing comprehensive review of its structure, composition and practices,\u201d it said. The bank expects the review to result in changes to be disclosed in the coming months, it added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nations Will Start Talks to Protect Fish of the High Seas", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 More than half of the world\u2019s oceans belong to no one, which often makes their riches ripe for plunder.Now, countries around the world have taken the first step to protect the precious resources of the high seas. In late July, after two years of talks, diplomats at the United Nations recommended starting treaty negotiations to create marine protected areas in waters beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 and in turn, begin the high-stakes diplomatic jostling over how much to protect and how to enforce rules.\u201cThe high seas are the biggest reserve of biodiversity on the planet,\u201d Peter Thomson, the ambassador of Fiji and current president of the United Nations General Assembly, said in an interview after the negotiations. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in an ungoverned way if we are concerned about protecting biodiversity and protecting marine life.\u201dWithout a new international system to regulate all human activity on the high seas, those international waters remain \u201ca pirate zone,\u201d Mr. Thomson said.In this series on lawlessness on the high seas, Ian Urbina reveals that crime and violence in international waters often goes unpunished.And so, the negotiations need to answer critical questions. How will marine protected areas be chosen? How much of the ocean will be set aside as sanctuaries? Will extraction of all marine resources be prohibited from those reserves \u2014 as so-called no-take areas \u2014 or will some human activity be allowed? Not least, how will the new reserve protections be enforced?Several countries, especially those that have made deals with their marine neighbors about what is allowed in their shared international waters, want regional fishing management bodies to take the lead in determining marine protected areas on the high seas. Others say a patchwork of regional bodies, usually dominated by powerful countries, is insufficient, because they tend to agree only on the least restrictive standards. (The United States Mission to the United Nations declined to comment.)The new treaty negotiations could begin as early as 2018. The General Assembly, made up of 193 countries, will ultimately make the decision.Not least, creating protected areas can also allow vulnerable species to spawn and migrate, including to areas where fishing is allowed.Some scientists fear that West Antarctica\u2019s immense ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.Fishing on the high seas, often with generous government subsidies, is a multibillion-dollar industry, particularly for high-value fish like the Chilean sea bass and bluefin tuna served in luxury restaurants around the world. Ending fishing in some vulnerable parts of the high seas is more likely to affect large, well-financed trawlers. It is less likely to affect fishermen who do not have the resources to venture into the high seas, said Carl Gustaf Lundin, director of the global marine program at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In fact, Mr. Lundin said, marine reserves could help to restore dwindling fish stocks.High-seas fishing is not nearly as productive as it used to be. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the effort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve knocked out most of the catches.\u201dWhy is such a treaty necessary? At the moment, a variety of regional agreements and international laws govern what is permitted in international waters.

{"Headline": "Sprint, Looking to Get Bigger to Survive, Weighs Deal-Making", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reason is clear. Sprint, controlled by Mr. Son\u2019s SoftBank, has long lagged behind the two titans of American wireless, Verizon and AT&T, each of which has more subscribers than Sprint and T-Mobile combined. Mr. Son has never let go of the idea that Sprint needs to get bigger to survive, and has had on-again, off-again discussions with T-Mobile.Now, SoftBank is busy exploring a complex takeover of Charter Communications, the cable giant whose empire stretches from New York City to Los Angeles.During a quarterly earnings call last week, Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, said that a final announcement about any deal \u201cshould be coming in the near future.\u201d He did not elaborate.Sprint has had to acknowledge that it would have a tough time thriving on its own. From the company\u2019s perspective, combining with Charter would make sense.Broadband providers have been eager to find other ways to drive up revenue, and wireless has been one avenue that cable operators have dived into. Charter and Comcast formed an alliance this spring to explore wireless opportunities. Already, Comcast has begun offering its subscribers mobile service through Verizon, with Charter expected to follow suit.From Sprint\u2019s perspective, a cable company would help give the telecom company the wired backbone it needs to upgrade its wireless service to 5G. While Verizon and AT&T have been investing billions into bolstering their networks, Sprint has had far fewer resources to do so.\u201cThe potential additional synergies that you have in doing a strategic transaction will always be significantly better than having a stand-alone entity,\u201d Mr. Claure said on the earnings call.But Mr. Son does face some hurdles, starting with a recalcitrant Charter. The cable operator\u2019s chief executive, Tom Rutledge, holds options that come into the money when his company\u2019s share price reaches $564. Right now, Charter trades at about $385, meaning that SoftBank would need to pay dearly to bring him to the table.And even with banks willing to lend to SoftBank to finance a deal, the amount of debt involved would be breathtaking. Sprint carried roughly $34.5 billion of long-term debt on its books as of March 31, while Charter had $63 billion. SoftBank itself held some $135 billion in long-term debt.Then there is Comcast. Under the terms of the pact between the two cable operators, each must assent to a deal that the other strikes with a wireless company.Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson, warned that, ultimately, Sprint\u2019s repeated and public attempts to make a deal could prove costly if it doesn\u2019t end up with a partner.\u201cLike an unsold house that has sat too long on the market, an asset that has been shopped too often without success\u201d takes on an unsavory air, he wrote in a research note last week. \u201cEquity investors might reasonably ask why each company that has had access to even a cursory due diligence has so quickly said \u2018no\u2019 and moved on.\u201dAn article on Monday about deals being considered by Sprint misstated the timing of two statements about possible deals. Charter Communications said last week \u2014 not this week \u2014 that it had no interest in buying Sprint. And Sprint\u2019s chief executive also said last week \u2014 not this week \u2014 that an announcement on any deal could be coming in the near future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lenin\u2019s Eco-Warriors", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyNEW HAVEN \u2014 Atop a granite cliff in Siberia this past winter, I stood gazing at what became, 100 years ago, the first in the world\u2019s largest system of most protected nature reserves. To my west glistened mile-deep Lake Baikal. To the east rose snowy mountains, including one that reminded me of sharp-cut Half Dome, an icon of America\u2019s Yosemite National Park. I was looking across Barguzinsky Zapovednik, a conservation area protecting more than 600,000 acres so free from human impact that visitors may not enter.Barguzinsky began a chain of 103 zapovedniks, or nature reserves, that protect 68 million acres of Russia. Most zapovedniks date from the Soviet era and provide the world\u2019s highest level of protection to the most land within any nation, under the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s designation of \u201cstrict nature reserves.\u201dHow did Russia \u2014 hardly considered a cradle of environmentalism, given Joseph Stalin\u2019s crash program of industrialization \u2014 become a global pioneer in conservation?Much of the answer begins with Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. In 1919, a young agronomist named Nikolai Podyapolski traveled north from the Volga River delta, where hunting had almost eliminated many species, to Moscow, where he met Lenin. Arriving at the Bolshevik leader\u2019s office to seek approval for a new zapovednik, Podyapolski felt \u201cworried,\u201d he said, \u201cas before an exam in high school.\u201d But Lenin, a longtime enthusiast for hiking and camping, agreed that protecting nature had \u201curgent value.\u201dTwo years later, Lenin signed legislation ordering that \u201csignificant areas of nature\u201d across the continent be protected. Within three decades, some 30 million acres (equal in area to about 40 states of Rhode Island) from the European peaks of the Caucasus to the Pacific volcanoes of Kamchatka were set aside in a system of 128 reserves.The roots of the zapovedniks were holy. Priests for years had sanctified forests by proclaiming a zapoved, or commandment: Thou shalt not cut. By the early 20th century, the sacred was resonating with the scientific: Mankind was exterminating \u201cprimordial nature,\u201d a Moscow biology professor, Grigorii Kozhevnikov, told a conference in 1908. He argued that anthropogenic dominance would soon leave humanity unable to see nature except through man-made imitation, \u201cobscuring the image of the vanished past.\u201dHe proposed that Russia preserve vast lands where \u201cnature must be left alone.\u201d Each would serve not as a \u201cpleasuring-ground\u201d for people (the words of the law that created the first of America\u2019s national parks, about which Russians were aware) but as a baseline established by observation of natural systems untrampled by people.In the early 1920s, the Moscow Zoo began training a \u201ccircle of young biologists,\u201d many of whom became leaders in the Communist conservation movement, establishing zapovedniks as far-flung as the Pacific coastal reserve created in 1935 to save the Siberian tiger.Joseph Stalin, however, was not one for obeying anyone else\u2019s commandment. In the 1940s, he initiated a \u201cgreat transformation of nature\u201d in the U.S.S.R. To open the country for a huge expansion of farming, logging, mining and hunting, he slashed the zapovednik system by 89 percent in 1951, leaving just 40 reserves comprising about 3.5 million acres.After Stalin died in 1953, brave scientists fought back in defense of the reserves. By 1961, the system had rebounded to 93 zapovedniks on 15.7 million acres, with some additions and many restorations.Stalin\u2019s successor, Nikita Khrushchev, was no friend of conservation, but the defenders were organizing. The reserves owe their survival, in part, to a 1960 law inviting the \u201cparticipation of non-governmental organizations in the protection of nature.\u201d Within days, a group of biology students at Moscow State University took up the challenge. They called their movement Druzhina, after the medieval warriors who defended their homeland against invaders seeking to destroy Russia\u2019s Christian faith, and began to fight poachers and create nature reserves.The students\u2019 motto resounded with ironic romanticism: \u201cFor the success of a hopeless cause!\u201d By the 1980s, about 140 brigades of Druzhina had sprung up across the country. As the years passed, Druzhina activists became leaders on university faculties, and in environmental organizations and Russia\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources.On my hike up the bluff that lies just outside the protected vastness of Barguzinsky Zapovednik, the researcher leading me was a Druzhina named Irina Kurkina. This reserve was Russia\u2019s first, created in January 1917, before the Bolsheviks seized power (the Volga delta zapovednik proposed to Lenin by the young agronomist was the second to begin). Ms. Kurkina came here in 1986, fleeing a poultry farm to which the Soviet system had sent her to work, straight from college. She lives in this remote part of southern Russia far beyond the reach of any road.\u201cI would not do this job, be this kind of person,\u201d she told me, if not for the inspiration of fellow students in the Moscow Druzhina, whose names she recited as we climbed.Their activism carried risks. To combat poaching, Druzhina teams gained legal authority to make citizens\u2019 arrests. At least three Druzhina were shot dead by poachers in different regions \u2014 near the Black Sea, the Ural Mountains and Lake Baikal \u2014 between the early 1970s and mid-1980s.When the threat wasn\u2019t physical, it could be political. One leader of the anti-poaching teams, Vsevolod Stepanitskiy, told me some years ago about a time when he and his university colleagues, on patrol near Moscow, caught some illegal duck hunters. One, they learned, was a \u201cdeputy minister of finance.\u201d Worried at how their report would be received, the students presented their evidence to the Communist Party.The minister got away with a reprimand, Mr. Stepanitskiy recalled. But the students went unpunished, and felt victorious. Druzhina became, in the words of another warrior who later joined the biology faculty at Moscow State, \u201ca prototype of civil initiatives\u201d and, as she put it, \u201ca sign of democratization in conditions of totalitarianism.\u201dLike many Druzhina, after graduating Mr. Stepanitskiy became a zapovednik researcher, starting in 1982 on Russia\u2019s Pacific coast. In late 1991, when the U.S.S.R. dissolved, Mr. Stepanitskiy found himself heading the Zapovedniks Administration for the new Russian Federation. Despite economic hard times, he and his colleagues seized the initiative and created 18 new reserves in four years, including the spectacular Commander Islands, Russia\u2019s Aleutians in the Pacific.Nature conservation in Russia remains challenging. Three times in the first two decades of his post-Soviet leadership, Mr. Stepanitskiy resigned to express his opposition to management problems, including efforts to turn protected resources into financial resources. His second resignation came in 2002, when an official in the Ministry of Natural Resources ordered zapovednik directors to start making money by cutting down forests in their reserves. \u201cGoing to work,\u201d Mr. Stepanitskiy announced, had become \u201clike going behind enemy lines.\u201dEach time, Mr. Stepanitskiy went to work outside the government, helping environmental organizations and providing support to conservationists. But each time, apparently in tacit acknowledgment of Mr. Stepanitskiy\u2019s judgment and leadership, the Russian government invited him to return to directing the zapovednik system.In 2015, President Vladimir Putin, who famously enjoys photo opportunities in nature with tigers, bears and whales, announced that the centennial year for Russia\u2019s zapodneviks, 2017, would be the \u201cYear of Protected Areas.\u201d His government pledged to increase Russia\u2019s protected acreage by 18 percent over the next eight years.But storm clouds have gathered. Ranger salaries, which Mr. Stepanitskiy has fought to raise, are only about $4,300 a year. New ski resorts, supported by wealthy corporations that Russian conservation groups believe have lobbied the government, seem likely to threaten Caucasus Zapovednik. While Mr. Stepanitskiy has encouraged educational tourism in small sections of the nature reserves, he has criticized ski construction as \u201cnot eco-tourism\u201d and as likely to jeopardize a leopard reintroduction project that has had Mr. Putin\u2019s backing.Russia\u2019s first zapovednik in the Arctic, Wrangell Island, is threatened by a new military base. After polar bears had been fed illegally, a construction worker tossed toward a bear an explosive device that detonated in its mouth, a horror shown by Russian TV. Proposed legislation would authorize Russia\u2019s president to strip protection from zapovedniks for any reason, including \u201cto ensure the security of the state.\u201dIn April, Mr. Stepanitskiy resigned for a fourth time. Conservationists across Russia are following his now unbridled commentaries, including that the ministry views Russia\u2019s nature reserves as \u201ca resource that can be used for personal recreation and entertainment.\u201d He has attacked the government for failing to uphold the system\u2019s century-long \u201csacred idea.\u201dFor now, at least, Lenin\u2019s legacy is preserved and Russia remains the world leader, ahead of Brazil and Australia, in protecting the most land at the highest level. Russian naturalists continue to advance their not-yet-hopeless cause of keeping free a few vast landscapes on this planet where humans do not tread.Fred Strebeigh is a senior lecturer at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the department of English.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Real Tax Reform Could Be", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter their protracted failure to repeal Obamacare, congressional Republicans have indicated that taxes will be next on their agenda. It\u2019s a misnomer to call their plans \u201ctax reform,\u201d though, because they have proposed little more than the same deep cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals that they\u2019ve always wanted.Real reform would honestly confront the fact that in the next decade we will need roughly $4.5 trillion more revenue than currently projected to meet our existing commitments without increasing the federal debt as a share of the economy. Even more would be needed if the government were to make greater investments to lift productivity and living standards through education, infrastructure and scientific research. Real reform would do this by diversifying methods of taxation while targeting individuals and sectors best able to pay.While the wages of most Americans have stagnated for years, incomes of the wealthiest have soared. So it would make sense to increase the top rates on them and eliminate a break on income from investments.And dividends and capital gains from investments are taxed at a total top rate of only 23.8 percent. It would be reasonable to tax wages and investments at the same rates.Over all, the richest 1 percent pay 33 percent of their total income in taxes; if rates were changed so they paid 40 percent, it would generate $170 billion of revenue in the first year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.There is rare bipartisan consensus that closing loopholes in order to lower the top corporate rate of 35 percent would help American businesses compete globally. But there is no agreement on which loopholes to close or where to set the rate.But even before lawmakers get into the weeds of corporate write-offs, they should agree to close a single huge loophole: the ability of corporations to defer tax on profits earned abroad or placed in overseas entities through accounting maneuvers. Intended to allow companies to more easily invest the profits abroad, this benefit has morphed into an abusive tax shelter that now shields $2.6 trillion.To tax the untaxed sums, Democrats should give up their opposition to granting corporations a discounted tax rate for the profits they bring home. Republicans should give up their support for only a voluntary repatriation at a near-zero rate. A compromise would give corporations a modest discount but require them to pay the tax and prevent them from stashing untaxed profits abroad anymore.A value-added tax would be akin to a national sales tax, but harder to evade than traditional sales taxes and thus an efficient revenue raiser well suited to a consumer-oriented economy. Since it would unduly burden low-income people, who spend most of their income, a VAT would need to be paired with measures like an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for the working poor.Real reform entails more than just cutting taxes, and will require hard work. But the net result could be a fairer and more productive system.Advertisement"}

Lampert, Sears borrowed heavily to buy back shares. But Mr. Lampert also appears to be building a moat around his investment. Last year, Sears sold much of its property to another publicly traded company, Seritage Growth Properties. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage.

Sydney Carton nobly delivered that vision in the finale to \u201cA Tale of Two Cities.\u201d Four years ago, Bill de Blasio repurposed the title of Charles Dickens\u2019s classic as the crux of a mayoral campaign waged largely against income inequality.Carton was an invention of Dickens, who had witnessed New York City\u2019s poverty firsthand in the mid-19th century. Bill de Blasio is the product of self-invention: a mayor who might yet prove better at governing than at politics (and that rare liberal blessed by an economic boom).In two weeks, Mr. de Blasio is all but certain to be renominated for a second term (as every elected Democratic mayor of New York City, except for Abraham D. Beame in 1977, has been for a more than a century).Each author cogently places Mr. de Blasio in context, if from slightly different perspectives (as suggested by their titles): \u201cReclaiming Gotham: Bill de Blasio and the Movement to End America\u2019s Tale of Two Cities\u201d by Juan Gonz\u00e1lez; and \u201cThe Pragmatist: Bill de Blasio\u2019s Quest to Save the Soul of New York\u201d by Joseph P. Viteritti.Despite Mr. de Blasio\u2019s disappointing lack of promised transparency, his electoral coalition and his record represent, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez persuasively argues, \u201cthe maturing of a new grassroots urban political revolt in America.\u201dMr. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at Hunter College, part of the City University of New York, is more circumspect in exploring whether a mayor who values a transcendent agenda over a transactional one has managed to balance progressivism and pragmatism.\u201cWhat other politician do we know who promises to bring jails and homeless shelters to communities on the eve of his re-election campaign?\u201d Professor Viteritti asks. (One answer: a mayor who is passionately committed to his platform and faces no palpable opponent.)Facing a challenge that is unique neither to New York nor the United States, Mr. de Blasio has become more dependent on innovative self-help, rather than handouts from the nation\u2019s capital (especially when the redistribution of wealth by Washington seems to favor the well-to-do and what was once described loftily as a national urban agenda has again reverted to a state and local government responsibility).Professor Viteritti generously says of the mayor\u2019s dubious dodging of campaign financing laws: \u201cIf you decide to be above it all and don\u2019t have enough money of your own, you will be at a disadvantage, and will probably lose.\u201dMr. de Blasio probably won\u2019t lose, but his war on income inequality is far from won.Despite some progress, by 2015 the overall poverty rate \u2014 and the proportion of the very poor \u2014 remained virtually where they were in 2010. New York probably has more poor people today than when the mayor was inaugurated.The final verdict on whether Mr. de Blasio can deliver on his vision of a beautiful city \u2014 a less unequal one \u2014 is still to be delivered.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tax Reform America Needs (and Probably Won\u2019t Get)", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCanada\u2019s tax rate on corporate profits has fallen by more than 14 percentage points since the turn of the century, to just 15 percent this year. In Denmark it has shrunk to 22 percent from 32 percent over the period; Britain\u2019s has declined to 19 percent, from 30 percent; Ireland\u2019s to barely 12.5 percent, from 24 percent. Hungary\u2019s is even lower.What happened was globalization. As multinational corporations have hopscotched around the globe to find the most profitable base from which to run their affairs, they have set off furious competition among governments hoping to lure investment by slashing tax rates to the bone.Smaller countries like Ireland or Hungary have been the most aggressive in this race. But big industrial powers have followed, too. Among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the policy think tank of the world\u2019s industrialized countries, almost every one has reduced its corporate tax rate over the last 17 years.There are two exceptions: Chile and, alone among the world\u2019s wealthy nations, the United States.Once one of the lowest among economically advanced countries, the American tax rate on corporate profits is by now the highest. And still, corporate tax revenues amount to only 2.2 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, half a percentage point less than the O.E.C.D. average. Even Ireland collects more as a share of its economy.While this is probably the most blatant shortcoming of the American tax code, it is hardly the only one. By the standards of most economists, the United States has one of the most counterproductive tax regimes among advanced nations \u2014 one that raises little money yet vastly distorts decisions on investing and saving, and encourages all sorts of trickery to avoid the Internal Revenue Service. That shortcoming is keeping the American state from raising the money it needs.Indirect taxes, such as a sales or consumption tax, or \u2014 even better \u2014 taxes on immovable property, don\u2019t reduce people\u2019s incentive to save or invest, as direct taxes on personal or corporate income do.And yet when designing the tax code, Washington eschewed indirect taxes. Instead, the American political system chose the most economically counterproductive tax structure available. On average, indirect taxes amount to 38 percent of tax revenues across the O.E.C.D. In the United States they account for 27 percent. And that is only because of high property taxes, which are levied mostly at the municipal level.(Here, too, Washington skews investment behavior by making property taxes, and mortgage interest, deductible from federal income taxes, pulling money into housing that would generate a bigger economic return elsewhere.)That makes American tax revenues uniquely vulnerable. Corporate profits have soared, rising to 13 percent of the nation\u2019s income in the years of the new millennium, from 9 percent. And yet the I.R.S. just hasn\u2019t been able to touch the stash.\u201cIt is something we need to confront,\u201d said Alan J. Auerbach, a tax expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cI\u2019m a little skeptical that we will be able to come up with something.\u201dThey, too, will most likely fail, and for the same reason. Rewriting the tax code \u2014 cutting rates on corporate profits, say, and switching to a system in which only domestic profits are taxed \u2014 would cost money. Plugging the shortfall would require raising revenues somewhere else.That is something the United States political system and its inefficient tax structure find extraordinarily difficult to do.Consider how other industrialized nations managed the decline in corporate tax rates. For starters, they expanded the tax base \u2014 removing some incentives to investments, trimming exceptions, loopholes and the like. But they also had a big pot of money that the United States did not: revenues from a value-added tax, which is levied on the consumption of goods and services.Taxes on consumption \u2014 raised mostly through a V.A.T. \u2014 add up to one-third of total taxes in O.E.C.D. economies, on average. In the United States, sales taxes \u2014 levied by states rather than the federal government \u2014 amount to just 17 percent of total taxes.Congressional Republicans understand that tax reform requires money. They originally proposed raising $1 trillion with a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax \u2014 a levy on sales that would confer tax-free status on exports but would bar businesses from taking imports as an expense.But now the border adjustment is off the table, opposed by retailers whose businesses rely on imports. So the options for meaningful reform have fizzled, too.\u201cThe revenue loss from the corporate rate reduction is about $100 billion per point over 10 years, so going from 35 percent to 20 percent will cost $1.5 trillion,\u201d Professor Graetz told me. \u201cWhere are you going to find the money?\u201dProfessor Auerbach suggests that without new revenues, President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul may amount to nothing more than a big tax cut with nothing to pay for it, which would require some political legerdemain to become law with no Democratic votes. (That was the case with President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts, designed to \u201csunset\u201d after 10 years.)But this is not what the country needs. What it needs, looking into the future, is to acknowledge both demographic change and globalization.Globalization is unlikely to slow much. Governments\u2019 efforts to lure investment with low taxes are unlikely to be over. \u201cCorporate tax rates will probably continue to decrease in the near future,\u201d the O.E.C.D. said. \u201cMoreover, tax revenue is put under pressure at an increasing rate as corporations in a globalized world engage more and more in tax-minimizing strategies.\u201dMaybe this combination of pressures will ultimately push the American political system to embrace an efficient tax system \u2014 one that inflicts less damage on the economy. Then it might be able to raise the money that the American government needs.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about tax reform, referred incorrectly to consumption taxes in the United States and for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Those taxes represent one-third of the total taxes \u2014 not of gross domestic product \u2014 in the O.E.C.D. economies, and 17 percent of the total taxes in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Thank-You to Taylor Swift", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed Contributor\u201cShe couldn\u2019t believe that after he grabbed her, that she thanked them for being there,\u201d Andrea Swift said. \u201cIt was just destroying her that she said that.\u201d Breaking down in tears, she went on to say, \u201cAs a parent, I questioned why I taught her to be so polite.\u201dFor women, being polite often goes hand in hand with self-doubt and subservience. At its root, the very notion of politeness is so gendered in our unequal society that it can simply translate into an overwhelming pressure for women to self-censor or self-flagellate. Often what we euphemistically describe as \u201cpoliteness\u201d ends up sounding like an apology for taking up space, for asking anything of others, for even existing at all.This imperative not to rock the boat is partly reflected in the huge number of survivors of sexual assault who question whether an attack was their own fault, who don\u2019t want to upset friends and family members by telling them and who don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious enough to bother the police.Pressuring girls into putting courtesy first suppresses their ability to resist or protest both discrimination and abuse. We should ensure that every girl knows that politeness is less important than her career, her rights and her ability to decide who touches her body. Taylor Swift\u2019s court win may have yielded only a single dollar, but to prove this point was invaluable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steven Soderbergh Quit Movies. Now He\u2019s Back. What Gives?", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere would heist movies be without the Big Score \u2014 that payoff so irresistible it can lure the most jaded desperado out of hiding?Now that he seems to be going back on his word, Mr. Soderbergh is as gleeful as he is humbled. At various times in his career, he\u2019s been an art house auteur, a must-have director of the moment, a renegade and a recluse. But he\u2019s found what he wants to do is make movies that, whatever genre they fall into, can be seen by as many people as possible.\u201cI\u2019ve been shooting my mouth off for a long time about aspects of the movie business I\u2019m frustrated with,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI make declarative statements a lot that I then have to walk back. But I think the country\u2019s used to that.\u201d\u201cLogan Lucky\u201d is not his splashy re-emergence from any retirement, nor any statement on present-day America. It\u2019s just the kind of story he likes to tell, perhaps because he sees the moviemaking process \u2014 when it\u2019s executed correctly \u2014 as its own perfect crime.As Mr. Soderbergh explained, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a crazy idea. Odds are, it\u2019s not going to work out, or at least not going to go the way you think. You put a team together, things go wrong, you come out the other end and hopefully you survive.\u201dSitting in his TriBeCa office one late July morning, the wiry Mr. Soderbergh, 54, was an inconspicuous man in an inconspicuous room. He wore horn-rimmed glasses and a T-shirt that read \u201cA Mike Nichols Film,\u201d and the small work space was decorated with knickknacks like a Peabody Award for \u201cThe Knick\u201d and a sagging cat balloon (\u201cWishing You a Purr-fect Birthday\u201d).When he talks about his movies, in his enthusiastic, quietly intense way, it is a therapy where he makes on-the-fly realizations he missed during the filmmaking process.\u201cOn set, people are intuiting what I\u2019m doing by following me and seeing where I stop,\u201d he explained. \u201cSometimes, until somebody asks me, I don\u2019t even know how it works.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve really lost my interest as a director \u2014 not as a producer or viewer \u2014 in anything that smells important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t appeal to me at all anymore. I left that in the jungle somewhere.\u201dThat film was a scramble to finance \u2014 European investors ended up footing its estimated $58 million budget \u2014 and a slog to shoot; Mr. Soderbergh spent about two and a half months on it and still found himself wishing he\u2019d had more time. \u201cChe\u201d ended up a critical success but a commercial dud, and it soured Mr. Soderbergh on so-called prestige films. \u201c\u2018Che\u2019 beat that out of me,\u201d he said.Mr. Soderbergh said he was lured back to theatrical features in fall 2014, when he received the screenplay for \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d credited to Rebecca Blunt. Though Mr. Soderbergh intended only to produce the film and find another director for it, he was drawn to what he felt was the script\u2019s empathy for working-class characters who get to be more than caricatures.\u201cThey surprise you with their thought process and their worldview,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trick is to use stereotypes to set the table and then hopefully surprise people.\u201dMr. Tatum, who worked with Mr. Soderbergh on \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and other movies, said the director had a talent for \u201cthe art of problem-solving,\u201d but added that anyone in his position can be susceptible to \u201cproblem fatigue.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re the director, everyone looks to you for everything,\u201d Mr. Tatum said. \u201cWhat color is the pen going to be, Steven? What time do you want to wrap today, Steven? It\u2019s all eyes on you, all the time.\u201dBy taking a break from film, Mr. Tatum said, \u201che just wanted to change the radio station for a minute, off of something he was so used to \u2014 to shake things up.\u201dOn the set last year, Mr. Driver said, Mr. Soderbergh worked quickly and decisively. \u201cNothing seems to really distract him,\u201d Mr. Driver said. \u201cHe trusts his instincts and knows when he\u2019s comfortable with moving on. It feels like kind of a protest, about how films are conventionally made.\u201dEven when Mr. Soderbergh doesn\u2019t articulate his intentions, \u201che is actually speaking loud and clear, but he\u2019s just not talking to anybody,\u201d Mr. Driver said with a laugh. \u201cYou get the sense of, what does he need to say? He\u2019s doing it.\u201d\u201cYou could argue that it\u2019s the perfect fake story, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds plausible.\u201d He acknowledged he had met with Ms. Foy and knows Ms. Temple through friends.He does not spend much time mourning projects that he feels lost their momentum, like \u201cThe Knick,\u201d the critically acclaimed series that starred Clive Owen as a surgeon in early 20th-century New York. Mr. Soderbergh had directed 20 episodes over two previous seasons, and there were scripts prepared for a potential third season, written by its creators, Jack Amiel and Michael Begler. Even so, Cinemax canceled \u201cThe Knick\u201d in March.Many factors played into this decision, Mr. Soderbergh said, including the overall cost of the show \u2014 \u201cwhen you get up into the $6 million an hour range, that\u2019s not cheap,\u201d he said \u2014 and Cinemax\u2019s decision to focus on action-oriented programming.Ultimately, he did not lay the blame for the show\u2019s cancellation at anyone\u2019s feet. \u201cExternal forces were at play that had nothing to do with the show itself,\u201d he said.Ms. Keough, who also appeared in \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and starred in a TV adaptation of Mr. Soderbergh\u2019s film \u201cThe Girlfriend Experience,\u201d said he is \u201calways trying to do things that are a little bit risky.\u201dShe added, \u201cI could imagine that would be really stressful. But he definitely doesn\u2019t show me that side of him.\u201dNearly every other director she has worked with, she said, has asked her what it is like to work with Mr. Soderbergh. \u201cI get asked about Steven Soderbergh more than I get asked about my grandfather, honestly,\u201d said Ms. Keough, who is a granddaughter of Elvis Presley.Mr. Soderbergh does not see himself this way, and hardly expects that promoting \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d as his return to movie theaters will compel anyone to see it.Pointing to filmmakers like Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese, he said, \u201cThere are some directors whose names mean something to the general public. Mine\u2019s not one of them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to make a movie that five people understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make something that a lot of people understand, and yet is not obvious, still has subtlety and ambiguity, and leaves you with something to do as a viewer.\u201dAmong the contemporaries whose work excited him, he singled out M. Night Shyamalan, the oft-derided suspense director. He has reinvigorated himself with recent movies like \u201cThe Visit\u201d and \u201cSplit,\u201d Mr. Soderbergh said, adding, \u201cHe went back to his roots and has rebuilt himself, and is right back where he was.\u201dGiven the choice, Mr. Soderbergh has no interest in being a personality and would much rather let his work speak for himself. Anonymity, he said, suits him just fine.Looking ahead to next year\u2019s release of \u201cOcean\u2019s Eight,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Rihanna to see the movie and it says \u2018Produced by Steven Soderbergh,\u2019 and she\u2019s like, \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019 Because I\u2019ve never met her. I\u2019ve seen her, but I\u2019ve never met the woman.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Groups Court White House Even After C.E.O. Defections", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast Wednesday, even as top executives were abandoning President Trump\u2019s business advisory councils after his remarks on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., other industry leaders were busy making their interests known to a business-friendly White House.Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group, traveled to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to meet with Mark Calabria, the chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence. The men talked tax reform, and Mr. Howard pressed for incentives including the mortgage interest deduction.Now, with some signs that the worst fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville has passed \u2014 and with the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s volatile strategist \u2014 some in the business community are voicing hope that the administration can tackle tax reform.\u201cEveryone is similarly motivated to reach some version of success, to get a tax bill to the president\u2019s desk that he can sign,\u201d said Rohit Kumar, a tax specialist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cOn tax, there\u2019s a lot of business community support, there\u2019s a lot of similar incentives.\u201dEfforts to overhaul the tax code are expected to begin in earnest this fall. Already, big business groups are lining up to support the White House\u2019s efforts.The Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of the largest companies, has started an advertising campaign calling for a tax overhaul that is supported by the White House, the Treasury Department and Republican congressional leadership.Such coordination between industry groups and the White House stands in contrast to last week\u2019s unraveling of the business advisory groups, but confirms what many in the corporate world say: Behind the scenes, there is still active dialogue between business groups and the administration.\u201cWe have had broad access to the administration and cabinet members,\u201d said Mr. Howard, who has been in associations and lobbying groups for 30 years. \u201cOur access, and their receptivity to our requests for meetings, has been better than I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dFour people in particular have emerged as go-to contacts for executives and lobbyists seeking to sway the debate: Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell; and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.All four are familiar faces to business leaders. Mr. Cohn, Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Powell are alumni of Goldman Sachs, the powerful investment bank, and Mr. Ross ran a private equity firm.Expectations of a more stable partnership with business appeared to hearten investors. The major stock market indexes rose sharply on Tuesday, in part buoyed by investor hopes that with the departure of Mr. Bannon, more pragmatic voices within the administration will gain strength, possibly resulting in a tax overhaul bill. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up nearly 1 percent, its biggest gain in a week.\u201cI think investors are picking up on this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, a stock market strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis. \u201cWe now have people around the president who are more moderate and pro-business, like Gary Cohn.\u201dMr. Paulsen also suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s measured speech on Monday about sending more troops to Afghanistan could be seen by those still willing to bet on the Trump economy that there is now \u201cchange within the administration.\u201dThere was a mass exodus of executives from presidential advisory councils as they opposed stances taken by President Trump.Still, repairing relations with the White House itself will take time. While the Business Roundtable is supporting efforts for tax reform, its chairman, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has joined the chorus of leaders criticizing Mr. Trump last week.The schism between Mr. Trump and top chief executives is real, and could have meaningful implications.Former White House officials and executives said that while it is useful for executives to interact with cabinet-level officials and members of the vice president\u2019s staff, such relationships are no substitute to a working relationship with the Oval Office.\u201cYou will see a lot of connecting points at the cabinet level, and that\u2019s natural and good,\u201d said Mack McLarty, President Bill Clinton\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president is going to make the final decision on policies and how legislation is approached. So there has got to be some ability for businesses, hopefully large and small, to engage with this administration, as there was such great promise going in.\u201dThere are even questions about whether or not the executives who once made up his advisory councils will be willing to speak out in support of causes they shared with the White House, including a tax code overhaul.\u201cFor this president, losing both councils is terrifically challenging,\u201d said Richard Levick, founder of the Washington public relations firm Levick. \u201cThey were more than symbolic. These C.E.O.s were going to be the ambassadors for the administration to talk about tax reform, about health care reform, about infrastructure.\u201dAnd there are other issues where business interests and the wishes of the White House diverge.Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Export-Import Bank, which supports American exports, is facing stiff opposition from business groups.The nominee, Scott Garrett, a former congressman from New Jersey once said Ex-Im, as it is known, \u201cembodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.\u201dThat has rattled big companies such as Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar, which rely on Ex-Im to help finance their overseas sales.Now, as the prospect of hearings and a confirmation vote on Mr. Garrett\u2019s appointment draw closer, big business groups have stepped up their efforts to quash his nomination. The National Association of Manufacturers is leading a campaign to drum up opposition to Mr. Garrett.And the Business Roundtable spoke out against Mr. Garrett on Twitter, writing \u201cBRT cannot support Scott Garrett or any #ExIm nominee who does not demonstrate strong support for the bank and commitment to get it promptly back to work, fully executing its mission.\u201dIt is not clear if Mr. Garrett will lead Ex-Im, or if the efforts to derail his nomination will succeed. But even if big companies are able to sway the administration on the Ex-Im leadership, and even if a tax overhaul is enacted, it may be some time before corporate chieftains want to sit alongside Mr. Trump again.\u201cOur clients were coming to me eight months ago and saying, \u2018What if we are the victims of a nasty Trump tweet?\u2019\u201d Mr. Levick said. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying, \u2018What do we do if the president wants a photo op?\u2019 You don\u2019t want to be seen with this president.\u201dLandon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Derek Jeter\u2019s Group Is Said to Have Deal to Buy Marlins", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe owner of the Miami Marlins has agreed to sell the team for $1.17 billion to an ownership group led by the venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, with the former Yankees star Derek Jeter serving as a partner and the head of baseball operations.The sale, first reported by The Miami Herald, was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the deal who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly about it.The Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria engaged in an unusually lengthy and public bidding process before settling on Sherman and Jeter. Jeter would achieve a longstanding goal of owning a team \u2014 at least part of one, in this case.Until recently, Jeter had insisted on being the leading bidder despite not having the largest amount of money invested, the source said. But Jeter assented to Sherman\u2019s being the so-called control person, allowing the deal to move forward.Jeter is expected to control the player-development side of the organization. He becomes one of the few former players to own a professional sports team after retirement. Michael Jordan, who owns the N.B.A.\u2019s Charlotte Hornets, is also a part of the ownership group.Major League Baseball owners will meet next week in Chicago but are not expected to vote on the agreement because they will not have had enough time to evaluate it. Their next opportunity to vote on it will be in October.But since then, Jeter and Bush had a falling out, leading Bush to join Romney\u2019s group. Jorge Mas, a Miami businessman and a leader of the movement against the Castro regime in Cuba, also entered the bidding, complicating baseball\u2019s efforts to get the team sold.It appears that the rival bidders were unsuccessful against the lure of Sherman\u2019s money and Jeter\u2019s prestige.Sherman, 69, co-founded the asset management firm Private Capital Management, based in Naples, Fla., in 1986. He retired in 2009, after Private Capital lost large sums from its bets on newspaper stocks and in Bear Stearns\u2019s collapse.Loria, 76, has owned the Marlins since 2002. He had previously owned the Montreal Expos, but in a complicated and controversial move, he sold the team to the 29 other M.L.B. owners and bought the Marlins for $158.5 million from John Henry. Henry then bought the Boston Red Sox.The Marlins won the World Series in Loria\u2019s second year of ownership but have not returned to the playoffs since. The team consistently ranks near the bottom of the league in both payroll and attendance.But the team is still an attractive target, because of the growing value of teams across professional sports and because it moved into a new stadium in 2012, financed primarily by Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami.Ken Belson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Still, he felt he had much more to learn about business.\nFor Pope, who lives in Philadelphia, enrolling in Columbia Business School\u2019s executive M.B.A\n program was a no-brainer. He\u2019s always loved New York and thought the school\u2019s stellar\n reputation, along with the opportunity to learn from top business minds, would give him the\n edge he needed.\nLike teammates on the gridiron, his classmates at Columbia Business School have pushed him to\n improve in many ways. \u201cThey\u2019ll get on the phone with me and say, \u2018This is my opinion. Here\u2019s\n what I think. This is what you can do to make what you\u2019re doing better,\u2019\u201d he explains.\nHe believes this kind of interaction has already made him a better leader and manager. \u201cYou\n can see the difference in my conversations with clients,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to focus on the\n client\u2019s business and what programs we can implement to reduce risk. Now my conversations are\n centered around industry and market trends, which is unlike other brokers in the region.\u201d\nBusiness school also gave him other opportunities that he hoped would make him stand out. And\n after two years in the program \u2014 he graduated in May \u2014 he\u2019s confident that he is a\n better-rounded businessman. He recently finished a white paper on the impact that interest rates\n have on insurance premiums, real estate valuations and capital expenditures with one of his\n Columbia Business School professors. \u201cMy hope is that this paper, as well as other projects,\n will help me differentiate myself as an insurance professional in a rapidly changing\n industry,\u201d he says.\nIn 2012, Casserino moved from Rochester to New York City to join TAD Associates, a design\n firm that focuses on the intersection of digital content experiences and architectural space.\n Initially, business school wasn\u2019t part of the plan \u2014 he always thought of himself as the\n creative guy \u2014 but the more his role expanded, the more he realized the importance of having\n strong business knowledge.\n\u201cI needed to know where and how I should focus my energy,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to learn how to\n turn ideas into reality by understanding the process of taking a creative thought and testing\n it against the variables that can prove or disprove merit.\u201d\nHe chose Columbia Business School because he wanted to learn from other successful\n entrepreneurs and executives, and he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get in front of as\n many high-caliber faculty and speakers anywhere else.\nCasserino, who graduated in May, knew business school would be valuable, but he never\n anticipated just how life changing it would be. Early on in the Executive M.B.A. program,\n he heard fellow classmate Raphael Ison, a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, give an overview\n in class about an idea for a new app. Ison wanted to create an internal networking tool for\n groups to help individuals better understand who\u2019s around them and how they can work\n together.\nCasserino was intrigued by the idea and approached Ison with thoughts on how they could move\n forward. They immediately saw the potential of working together. \u201cWe have a shared passion\n for solving the same problems,\u201d Casserino says. The two initially hit it off after taking one\n of Columbia Business School\u2019s weeklong international seminars together in Tel Aviv. \u201cI saw\n that our goals and values were aligned,\u201d he says.\nThe two developed the app, called Within, during the second half of the program, and now that\n they\u2019ve both graduated, they\u2019re ready to release it. They\u2019ve been testing iterations with\n their fellow students and plan to release the full version this summer. \u201cWe\u2019d then love to\n open it up to different groups,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help a lot of people find each other\n based on shared interests and goals for the future.\u201d\nCasserino\u2019s M.B.A. education has helped in his current job, too. At TAD, he\u2019s been able to\n combine his creative and business skills in ways he\u2019d never imagined. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the\n business school curriculum would be as applicable as it is,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a\n complete mind-set shift \u2014 the curriculum makes you aware of the complexity of a broad range\n of issues but at the same time teaches processes to help you clearly analyze, strategize and\n solve for them.\u201d\nWhile in the Marine Corps Reserve, Ison completed his undergraduate degree. He then began his\n corporate career as a first year staffer at Deloitte & Touche, working his way up to be a\n manager who reviews clients\u2019 financial statements and makes sure they are in compliance with\n applicable standards. \u201cInstead of identifying issues with my client\u2019s financial statements\n and reporting process, I wanted to help them on the front end to think strategically about how\n to avoid those issues,\u201d he says.\nSo in 2015, Ison applied to the Executive M.B.A. program at Columbia. He chose the Executive M.B.A. program\n because it gave him the flexibility to continue working in the industry while also getting a\n quality education. \u201cThe reputation of the program, culture of the community and location of\n the school were reasons why I did not apply anywhere else,\u201d he explains. Ison notes\n similarities between the rigor of Columbia and the Marine Corps, and the need to lean on\n your team for help to achieve more: \u201cThe program was intense, but there were people and\n resources to turn to,\u201d Ison says.\nLearning how to solve problems strategically and to be entrepreneurial were on top of Ison\u2019s\n priority list. And he wasted no time in applying lessons learned during his studies. \u201cThinking about\n how I could maximize this special opportunity at Columbia, I realized there was a need and\n opportunity to create an exclusive collaboration platform specific for this program and\n others similar to it,\u201d he says.\nSince Casserino and Ison partnered on Ison\u2019s idea, two other students have joined them. The\n four now are excited to release their product to the Columbia Executive M.B.A. community. \u201cLooking back\n at my time in Columbia, the stars could not have aligned any better,\u201d Ison says. \u201cI met some\n of the best people who challenged my thinking and helped me turn an idea into a real product.\n I am better able to connect the dots and better equipped in realizing opportunities.\u201d\nThe school fosters and nurtures connections to help students succeed in the business world.\n During the first week on campus, students are deliberately broken into small groups based on\n their professional and personal diversity, which supports the foundation of the learning\n experience.\n\u201cThese relationships develop quickly and last well after school ends \u2014 the knowledge gained\n from these peer-learning groups never disappears,\u201d Blanco says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s guest lecturers\n or fellow students, you\u2019re often going deep into these relationships,\u201d she adds. \u201cPeople go\n into business together, and they\u2019ve helped each other advance in their careers.\u201d\nAs successful as Tse, Pope, Casserino and Ison have been, they know their stories are only\n getting started. They plan to take what they\u2019ve learned and the connections they\u2019ve made to\n grow their companies \u2014 and themselves.\nFor Tse, the payoff from her schooling has manifested itself in various ways. \u201cWhat I\u2019m\n learning is so crucial to what I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my outlook on\n everything, professionally and personally. I\u2019m a better executive and a better person because\n of it.\u201d\nThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is the Godfather of a Democratic Renaissance", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2009, Democrats controlled both the state senate and house in 27 states, the Republicans 14. After the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled both branches of the legislatures in 32 states to 14 for the Democrats.The importance of these trends cannot be overstated. State legislatures not only control redistricting in most states \u2014 a key to determining which party will control the House after the 2020 census \u2014 but also serve as a training ground where politicians learn the ropes of winning elections and governing. In this respect, state legislatures are a key source of new talent.Andrea Dew Steele, the organization\u2019s president and founder, describes Emerge as \u201cthe beginning of the food chain,\u201d performing basic training for women, many of them seeking office for the first time.Indivisible has played a leading role in turning out voters at congressional town halls to voice their opposition to Trump\u2019s plan to repeal Obamacare \u2014 a tactic explicitly copied from the Tea Party\u2019s organizing drive in 2009-2010.While support for these relatively new groups on the left is growing, the track record of some of the more established organizations is mixed.Money is not the only factor in politics \u2014 if it were, the efforts of these progressive groups would be doomed.Republicans and conservative organizations have had the financial advantage in the fight for state legislatures, and they will continue to have it during the 2018 election cycle.If we look at enthusiasm, however, Democrats have the clear advantage this year. Take special legislative elections.Malbin compared the data to prior years and his findings are noteworthy: So far this year, there are already 209 Democratic challengers, more than in any of the previous seven election cycles \u2014 and more than double the 78 Republican challengers in 2009, the year that led up to the Republican wave election of 2010.While motivation is high on the left, there is no guarantee that it will be well directed. Many of the newly involved enthusiasts are political neophytes.In a phone interview, Skocpol said the quality and effectiveness of Indivisible chapters \u201cran the gamut\u201d in terms of efficacy, with only some developing structured organizations. There are groups, she said, that are equipped to mobilize members to act on specific issues and to get voters to the polls, while others are far less prepared to engage on either front.Along similar lines, a Democratic operative with extensive experience in grass-roots organizing \u2014 who asked not to be identified \u2014 told me thatWe are working with many of these new organizations in a variety of ways. As we have non-disclosure agreements with all of the organizations we work with, details have to come from them. The growth in activism that these groups have both spurred and harnessed outstrips anything I have seen in decades previously. That said, this activism is pushing against strong structural headwinds and entrenched power. Further, still unknown is whether the geographic distribution of this activism will be aligned with and find the political fulcrum points.By geographic distribution, this operative means that the renewed vitality on the left is most heavily concentrated in New York, Massachusetts and California, which are already Democratic.Resilience in the face of setbacks will be a key test of the long-range viability of activist liberal organizations across the country.Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats.The combination of Republican gerrymandering and the clustering of Democratic voters in urban centers \u201chas moved the median House seat well to the right of the nation,\u201d Wasserman notes.The result is what Wasserman calls a structural \u201cpartisan bias\u201d favoring Republicans in Congressional elections:Trump lost the national popular vote by 2.1 percentage points, but Republicans won the median House seat by 3.4 points and the median Senate seat by 3.6 points.In the past, Republican commitments to building strength at the local level have been sustained by trade associations and corporations with a financial stake in decisions made at the county and state level. There is every reason to believe these interests will continue to invest time and money to protect their profits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Make America a Little Better", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOne of the few practical job-building promises of the Trump presidential campaign \u2014 a $1 trillion investment in repairing the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure \u2014 is turning out to be as hollow as a pothole. Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to push for passage of the plan in the first 100 days of his presidency is sliding off the calendar amid the daily chaos of his incumbency and the Republican obsession with crippling Obamacare.Infrastructure repair should be a bipartisan no-brainer. But Republican lawmakers now concede that a fully detailed plan might not surface from the administration until next year, if ever. The White House heightened the sense of flatlining last month in announcing creation of a 15-member infrastructure study commission that will have until the end of 2018 to work on advisory proposals.While Congress has refused to raise the federal gasoline tax since 1993, depleting the Highway Trust Fund as a basic resource for road repairs, states and cities have been raising local gas taxes and approving initiatives to face transportation problems. But these are far short of the full need.Voters in 23 states passed $225 billion worth of transportation initiatives last year, accepting 55 of 77 proposals. Some states, like Connecticut and Washington, are pursuing multiyear transportation initiatives. But many are pulling back from ambitious plans, awaiting word from Washington. In February, the National Governors Association forwarded a list of 428 \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects to the Trump administration, but no new federal money has materialized, and the states stress that they can\u2019t afford to pick up the difference.In fact, there has been a falling trend in the states\u2019 investment in infrastructure as a share of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, falling from 3 percent in the 1960s to about 2 percent recently, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Clearly, major federal support is needed beyond state and local efforts, if the nation\u2019s eroding infrastructure is to be modernized.\u201cSo even though the economy is about six times larger than it was in 1955,\u201d the report noted, \u201cWe are investing no more in our critical infrastructure today than our grandparents did.\u201dThe challenge begs for the bipartisanship currently shunned by Republican congressional leaders. Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cmillions\u201d of jobs in a repair plan \u201csecond to none\u201d has fast faded into a campaign fantasy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Texas Bathroom Bill Dies Again, Raising Republican Acrimony", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 A bill to restrict which bathroom transgender people can use in public buildings and schools died in the Texas Legislature on Tuesday evening, a rare defeat for social conservatives in a state they usually dominate.The failure of the so-called bathroom bill at the end of a special legislative session was the second time in three months that the bill had fallen short, and it deepened the ideological discord within the Texas Republican Party. But it did not kill the issue entirely.The Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, who pushed for the bill\u2019s North Carolina-style restrictions on transgender bathroom use, virtually guaranteed that the issue would arise again in future legislative sessions. And it is still possible that Gov. Greg Abbott, who supported the bill, will recall lawmakers for a second special session to give the bill another chance at passage.\u201cYou know why it\u2019s going to be back next session? Because the people will demand it,\u201d Mr. Patrick told reporters Tuesday night. \u201cThe issue is not going to go away.\u201dOpponents of the measure, including gay rights activists, corporate executives, transgender Texans and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, hailed the bill\u2019s demise in the special session as a significant achievement, even if it proves to be short-lived. The Legislature had previously failed to pass it during the regular session that ended in May.\u201cDefeating this discriminatory and dangerous legislation in Texas is a huge victory that will have an impact far beyond the Lone Star State,\u201d Kasey Suffredini, the acting chief executive of Freedom for All Americans, a national gay rights and transgender rights group, said in a statement.The bills would effectively have required transgender people to use bathrooms, locker rooms or showers corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates, not their gender identity, in government buildings and schools.The debate over the bill illustrated the increasingly rightward tilt of Texas politics in recent years.Mr. Patrick, Mr. Abbott and other Republican leaders pushed for the bill over the objections of many of the state\u2019s corporate leaders and large companies. The state\u2019s political and business leaders typically align on policy issues.The willingness of social conservatives to break with business interests on the bill showed how far to the right they want to push Texas, while the success of moderate Republicans in killing the bill showed that they still retain some power to pull Texas back toward the center-right.Business leaders played a pivotal role in persuading moderate Republicans to stand up to the lieutenant governor, the governor and other influential social conservatives. The Texas Association of Business mounted a large and well-financed lobbying campaign against the bathroom legislation, and released studies that forecast billions of dollars in economic losses if it were to pass. IBM took out full-page ads opposing the bill in major Texas newspapers, and corporate giants like American Airlines, AT&T and Texas Instruments warned Mr. Abbott in a letter that the bill \u201cwould seriously hurt the state\u2019s ability\u201d to attract jobs and investment.\u201cFor me, having the business community weighing in as strongly as they did to say this would have a chilling effect on the business climate and opportunity in this state is a huge factor,\u201d said Byron Cook, the Republican chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, who refused to hold a hearing on a House version of the bathroom bill during the special session.Supporters of the bill warned that Mr. Straus, Mr. Cook and others who opposed the measure would pay a price in the 2018 Republican primaries. Grass-roots social conservative activists and voters hold tremendous sway in Texas\u2019s low-turnout primary elections.Jonathan M. Saenz, president of Texas Values Action, which helped lead the push for the bathroom bill, said that his organization would make the issue a top priority next year and that Mr. Cook and other opponents of the bill \u201care going to be vulnerable when it comes time for re-election.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Abbott, Matt Hirsch, put it even more bluntly: \u201cThis is why we have elections.\u201dMr. Cook defended his position, pointing out that his committee held a marathon hearing on the bill during the regular session that ended in May. \u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent on officeholders to do what\u2019s right, period,\u201d Mr. Cook said.The governor convened the special session that began on July 18 and set the agenda for it. The bathroom bill was one of 20 items of business, most of them social conservative priorities that the Legislature failed to pass during the regular session. That regular session devolved into bitter intraparty squabbling toward the end, and the special session ended the same way Tuesday night.The special session was originally expected to last 30 days and wrap up on Wednesday, but the House abruptly adjourned Tuesday night over a dispute with the Senate on a property tax bill. The Senate followed suit later in the evening.In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr. Abbott said he had not ruled out ordering a second special session for the property tax bill, one of his top priorities. If he does so, he could add the bathroom bill to the agenda.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that all 20 items that I put on the agenda did not receive the up-or-down vote that I wanted, but more important, that the constituents of these members deserved,\u201d Mr. Abbott said in an interview on KTRH radio. He said the Legislature \u201chad plenty of time to consider all of these items, and the voters of the state of Texas deserved to know where their legislators stood.\u201dThough only half of the governor\u2019s agenda items were passed, Mr. Abbott\u2019s supporters and aides called the session a success. \u201cOur office believes this special session has produced a far better Texas than before,\u201d said John Wittman, a spokesman for the governor.But Mr. Abbott\u2019s failure to get the Republican-dominated Legislature to enact his whole social conservative agenda has opened him up to a new round of criticism that he is strong in rhetoric but weak in influence.\u201cLike his tenure in office, Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s first special session was bad for Texas,\u201d State Representative Eddie Rodriguez, Democrat of Austin, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this charade at a cost of over $1 million to Texas taxpayers, and we must not make the mistake of coming back for a second.\u201dMr. Abbott and Mr. Patrick had strong words for Mr. Straus. The governor, in a series of radio interviews, accused Mr. Straus and the House of moving slowly on his agenda and \u201cwasting time.\u201d Mr. Patrick criticized Mr. Straus for adjourning the House early, a move that helped kill the property tax legislation.Mr. Straus took a different tack, issuing a statement that refrained from any sharp criticism.\u201cWe considered every idea carefully, listened to constituents and acted on a number of critical issues, such as helping retired teachers,\u201d Mr. Straus said. \u201cHouse members voted for new limits on property tax growth and significant school finance reforms, but in the short time available, we did not reach final agreement with the Senate on those issues.\u201dDavid Montgomery reported from Austin, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great Wall Motor of China Sets Its Sights on Jeep", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is trying to clamp down on overseas acquisitions by its companies. Hostility is growing in the United States toward Chinese deals. And the auto industry faces substantial change in the form of battery-powered vehicles and autonomous cars.None of that deterred one Chinese automaker, Great Wall Motor Company, from saying on Monday that it was interested in buying the Jeep brand \u2014 a quintessentially American car that is known for its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, but that also has a strong resonance in China.Fiat Chrysler is an obvious target because its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, has signaled interest in finding a buyer. It would also be relatively cheap, valued at $19 billion on the stock market.The automaker owns the Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep brands, as well as the Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands in Europe.The seriousness of Great Wall\u2019s interest in a deal could not immediately be determined, and a company spokeswoman declined to say whether the two parties had even met. The Chinese carmaker, controlled by the billionaire Wei Jianjun, has struggled in recent years to find success with new models in China, but it has since enjoyed faster-growing revenue and profit from freshened-up models of S.U.V.s.In a statement on Monday, Fiat Chrysler said it had \u201cnot been approached by Great Wall Motors in connection with the Jeep brand, or any other matter relating to its business.\u201d The carmaker\u2019s shares were nevertheless up 4 percent in Milan.Gerald C. Meyers, at the time the chairman and chief executive of American Motors, which owned the Jeep brand, has said that he initially saw China as a low-cost place to build vehicles for the Australian market, and never anticipated that the country would grow into such a major well of customers.The brand\u2019s experience is far from unique, as a long list of Western companies have seen Chinese companies absorb their technology and become global competitors in sectors like diesel freight locomotives, high-speed electric trains and power station turbines.Tariffs and other taxes shielded the domestic automotive industry in particular from international competition and allowed companies like Great Wall to grow into strong competitors. Chinese manufacturers now hold not only much of their home country\u2019s market for sport utility vehicles, but also large shares of emerging markets in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, where cost-conscious buyers like Chinese producers\u2019 deeply discounted prices and don\u2019t mind the basic designs and sometimes uneven quality.More recently, Fiat Chrysler has been expanding Jeep manufacturing in the past two years in China, starting production in Changsha and Guangzhou, two big manufacturing centers in the country\u2019s southeast. But it now faces well-financed domestic competitors with highly developed supply chains and considerable economies of scale.Great Wall\u2019s expression of interest might prod other suitors to come forward and start a process that could lead to Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sale or breakup. Companies such as Volkswagen might be interested in parts of Fiat Chrysler such as Alfa Romeo, a maker of small and midsize passenger cars known for their Italian styling.But any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Great Wall would face considerable obstacles.A major issue for Chinese automakers is a lack of brand recognition overseas. Even at home, most Chinese car buyers prefer Chevrolets, Fords and Volkswagens made by foreign companies working with local partners.Geely Holding established a template when it acquired Volvo. Volvo\u2019s revenue has grown, in part because of rising sales in China, and Geely has provided funds that have allowed Volvo to invest more in new products and expansion, including at a new factory in Berkeley County, S.C.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet the Rare Designer Who Debuted With Couture", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosRather than produce clothes on the fast-paced ready-to-wear schedule, the designer Christine Hyun Mi Nielsen, who launched her brand last year, chose an unconventional path: She shows her collections on the official haute couture calendar.Her first collection, which she presented in January, was sold only to private clients through made-to-measure. Last month, she showed a fall 2017 collection that will be sold through a multi-brand Paris-based designer showroom in September. (Pieces begin at around $600.)Gaining entry to present during haute couture week in Paris can be immensely difficult for unestablished brands, let alone major fashion houses. All applications must go through the exacting Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, the governing body that requires brands to submit information on points of sale and annual turnover, as well as previous lookbooks. Nielsen had none of those when she applied, and instead submitted work-in-progress sketches and photos from fittings. She was accepted as a guest designer in late 2016 \u2014 and last month presented her second collection alongside other guest labels, including Iris Van Herpen, Proenza Schouler and Rodarte, in addition to permanent members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture such as Chanel and Dior.The Danish-Korean designer, 40, wears her straight, dark hair parted down the center and often dresses in a uniform of minimal clothes. She graduated from Royal College of Art in London in 2003, and went on to work at Burberry Prorsum before joining Alexander McQueen. (She worked under McQueen himself, and then served as Sarah Burton\u2019s right hand.) She went on to became the studio director at Givenchy and head designer at Balenciaga before she launched her own line last year.Nielsen keeps her team in the atelier extremely small: She works with only an assistant and an intern (with the exception of specialists she hires shortly before the show to help complete pieces), which she describes as \u201csomething along the lines of subversive poetic realness.\u201d She often sources inspiration from folklore and fairy tales, as well as childhood memories. Growing up in South Korea and Denmark with a mother who worked as a children\u2019s librarian and a father who was a professor in political science, Nielsen says different aspects of her upbringing and Scandinavian midsummer nights have always inspired her. Her latest collection featured a surprising structured dress made entirely out of denim \u2014 and an asymmetrical yellow gown with an A-line silhouette. \u201cAt some point during this season I became obsessed with the idea of bright yellow,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reminded me of summer in Denmark, playing in the field as a child. Picking flowers, braiding crowns of dandelions.\u201dAn unexpected illustration tacked to her research board in her atelier also provided inspiration for the recent collection, which featured structured dresses, cotton poplin jackets with latticework, coats with hand-cut leather spikes, dresses trimmed with ermine and outerwear constructed of gathered tulle \u2014 all extremely technically challenging details. \u201cI was working with weave-like patterns in various materials and textures,\u201d she explains. \u201cI found an illustration by the Japanese artist Tetsunori Tawaraya. It was really weird and amazing, somehow it was perfectly in tune with what I was working on, black and white: graphic texture and volume.\u201dContinuing to show on the haute couture calendar as a guest designer is one of Nielsen\u2019s goals. While she admits it\u2019s extremely rare to be accepted as a guest designer on the official calendar \u2014 especially with a debut collection and as a new brand \u2014 there\u2019s a reason why she prefers it: There are only two seasons a year, and thus it\u2019s easier for her to take a more seasonless approach. Of course, the process hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. \u201cBeing self-financed has limitations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is very different from working in-house in a luxury group with huge teams and budgets. Starting a new season is always sweet, you hope and dream and have total freedom and no limitations,\u201d she says, then pauses. \u201cBut then later the reality kicks in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Czar of Infrastructure\u2019 Embraces Role as Pillar for Port Authority", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo needed someone to take responsibility for rebuilding several of the New York area\u2019s crumbling transportation hubs, he did not have to look far. Rick Cotton had been by the governor\u2019s side for nearly three years.The puzzle is why Mr. Cotton, who has been a partner at a prestigious Manhattan law firm and the chief counsel for a major television network, would forgo a cushy retirement to run the troubled bistate agency.The simple answer, Mr. Cotton said over lunch last week, is that there are big projects to be completed and that he is someone who gets things done. The simpler answer may be that Mr. Cuomo asked him to do it.But after a few years at Mr. Cuomo\u2019s side, Mr. Cotton is no stranger to ambitious campaigns to conquer seemingly intractable transportation muddles. He has overseen the opening of the first segment of the Second Avenue subway, the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge and the financing of the long-stalled development of the James A. Farley Post Office into a train hall for Pennsylvania Station.\u201cHe\u2019s doing this only because he believes in public service and wants to make a difference,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said last week. \u201cWhile he\u2019s been here, he single-handedly has been managing our toughest projects.\u201dThe governor, who does not give credit lightly, went on to say about Mr. Cotton that \u201cwe would not have made the progress we made but for him.\u201d He said that at a groundbreaking last week at La Guardia, he told Mr. Cotton that the airport would not shed its \u201cthird world\u201d image without his efforts.So at 73, when he could be spending his days playing tennis and traveling the world with his wife, Betsy Smith, he instead will occupy the hot seat at an agency with a history of cronyism and political infighting.Mr. Cotton will be succeeding Mr. Foye, who escaped the scandal surrounding the Port Authority\u2019s politically motivated closing of bridge access lanes in New Jersey with his reputation enhanced. It was Mr. Foye who sounded the alarm in September 2013 about the lane-closing scheme concocted by allies of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Two Port Authority officials were convicted of crimes connected with that scandal, which is often referred to as Bridgegate.Another ally of Mr. Christie, David Samson, pleaded guilty this year to abuse of his power as chairman of the Port Authority, for coercing United Airlines to operate regular flights between Newark Liberty International Airport and an airport near Mr. Samson\u2019s weekend home in South Carolina.In the past few years, Mr. Foye feuded publicly with Mr. Samson\u2019s successor as chairman, John J. Degnan. Mr. Degnan\u2019s supporters saw him as a bulwark against Mr. Cuomo\u2019s grasping for undue influence over the Port Authority\u2019s vast resources.But as Mr. Cotton enters the agency, Mr. Degnan is leaving, replaced through an agreement between the governors by Kevin O\u2019Toole, a former state senator in New Jersey.Given Mr. Cotton\u2019s low-key demeanor, people who have worked with him do not expect to see hostility among the agency\u2019s leaders.\u201cHe has established a terrific reputation over the past three years for getting stuff done that had been sort of sitting and not happening for years in the infrastructure area,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, which represents private employers.\u201cRick\u2019s a problem-solver,\u201d said Gail Grimmett, a travel industry executive who previously managed operations in the New York area for Delta Air Lines. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who is constantly looking for solutions and constantly looking for resolution.\u201dIn negotiations that led to Delta\u2019s agreeing to tear down and rebuild the terminals it occupies at La Guardia, Mr. Cotton drove a hard bargain without leaving people feeling steamrollered, Ms. Grimmett said.He \u201ctakes deep dives into the details\u201d and challenges people with strict deadlines and high expectations, she said. But the tough conversations occur face-to-face, \u201cnot after you have left the room,\u201d said Ms. Grimmett, president of Travel Leaders Elite.Between bites of edamame salad in a Midtown restaurant, Mr. Cotton said he endorsed the Port Authority\u2019s plan to reduce the influence of the two governors by hiring a chief executive to replace the appointed executive director \u2014 a move that would eliminate his position.In the interim, he said, he intends to work \u201chand in glove\u201d with Mr. O\u2019Toole. He said they had already begun visiting Port Authority facilities, including the three major airports the agency controls. Last week, they also toured the bus terminal and operations of the PATH train, which connects northern New Jersey and Manhattan.\u201cThis region deserves to have world-class infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Cotton said. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way from that goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Another Silicon Valley Start-Up Faces Sexual Harassment Claims", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Finance, a hot financial start-up, is the latest prominent Silicon Valley company to face accusations that it turned a blind eye to sexual harassment.A former employee of Social Finance, better known as SoFi, said in a lawsuit filed Friday in a California state court that he had witnessed female employees being harassed by managers and was fired after he reported it.The former employee who filed the suit, Brandon Charles, worked at SoFi for only a few months this year. But the lawyer handling the case, Robert Ottinger, said that he expected to file another lawsuit next week claiming broader mistreatment of other SoFi employees and seek class-action status.\u201cThere appears to be a large groundswell of intense employee dissatisfaction at SoFi,\u201d Mr. Ottinger said.A spokesman for SoFi, Jim Prosser, said that the claims by Mr. Charles were \u201cinvestigated in depth by the company and found to have no merit. We will vigorously defend ourselves against any claims otherwise.\u201dThe last few months have brought a wide array of complaints about unethical behavior within the technology industry, which was previously known for its friendly working environments and generous employee perks.Big start-ups like Uber and venture capital firms like 500 Startups have been forced to part ways with top executives after their companies dealt with accusations of sexual harassment.SoFi is best known for refinancing student loans and offering mortgages to young borrowers who are referred to within the company as Henrys \u2014 an acronym for High Earners Not Rich Yet.That focus has helped turn SoFi into one of the most successful financial start-ups of the last decade, and investors have valued the company at more than $4 billion, according to Fortune.As it has grown, SoFi has gained a reputation for its aggressive business and marketing approach. Many financial start-ups have been eager to play down their competition with traditional financial firms, but SoFi has taken them on with its tagline \u201cDon\u2019t Bank. SoFi.\u201dMr. Cagney himself was a trader at Wells Fargo before he went to Stanford Business School and founded SoFi in 2011 with three partners.Mr. Charles, the plaintiff in the lawsuit filed Friday, worked at the company\u2019s loan processing office in Healdsburg, Calif., north of San Francisco.In addition to the claims about sexual harassment, the lawsuit said that Mr. Charles saw managers improperly recording loans in order to bolster their pay. The suit says that in some cases, managers canceled loan applications rather than report internal errors and hurt their performance metrics.In the current atmosphere in Silicon Valley, though, the claims about sexual harassment and mistreatment of employees could resonate more widely.Mr. Charles said that he saw his manager inject \u201cexplicit sexual innuendo and statements into normal workplace communications,\u201d and that he would also refer to one female employee \u201cby way of lewd, sexualized gestures intended to emphasize her physical appearance.\u201dThe lawsuit says that Mr. Charles emailed three supervisors about the harassment he had witnessed in May.A few weeks later, the suit says, the managers fired him after telling him that they viewed his complaints as \u201cdevoid of merit\u201d and that alerting his supervisors was outside his \u201cappropriate duties.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Choosing a Down Payment Over a Fancy Wedding", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCarrie Graham, a Protestant minister from Austin, Tex., was out for an afternoon stroll about four years ago when she passed a house under construction that she fell in love with instantly. It was in Mueller, her neighborhood, in the city\u2019s northeastern section. She was renting a garage apartment there, and liked so much about the area: its community garden, farmers\u2019 market and a pub within walking distance. She was attracted to the house because it had a front porch and an open layout that would allow her to hold gatherings for her congregation.Ms. Graham, who is 35, knew back then that buying the home would be difficult on a minister\u2019s salary, but she had learned that she qualified for an affordable housing program being offered by the builder. All she needed was a down payment.She then remembered a conversation with her father as a teenager about a five-figure sum he was saving for her wedding. Because she had never been married and wasn\u2019t discussing marriage with her boyfriend at the time, that money was just sitting in the bank unused. After Ms. Graham had a long talk with her parents, they decided to use the money for her down payment.\u201cI took it as a real gift, as something that was wise and a good use of my resources,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was about 10 years away from even approaching that type of purchase.\u201dAcross the country, many singles who don\u2019t know when, or if, they will ever marry are using money once earmarked for wedding dresses or caterers for other purposes. Some, like Ms. Graham, use these funds for a house; others take an extended trip or pay off college debt.Pahini Lampart, 30, of Baltimore, put the $150,000 her parents had saved for her wedding toward a condominium in Washington\u2019s trendy U Street neighborhood. She made that decision about four years ago after watching her older sister plan a lavish affair lasting several days in Atlantic City.\u201cShe was amazing at planning her whole wedding, but that\u2019s my sister,\u201d said Ms. Lampart, a strategic operations manager for a nonprofit organization. \u201cThe idea of me having to do that was, \u2018Oh, my God, no.\u2019 I would hyperventilate at the thought of it.\u201dMs. Graham says she\u2019s still open to the possibility of getting married. \u201cBuying the home wasn\u2019t me saying, \u2018I\u2019m never going to get married or I am going to get married,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy own home had way more than equity benefits. It was a real gift to have a home in an extremely desirable neighborhood in a city that I love. It\u2019s brought me a lot of joy.\u201dKimmie Greene, a consumer finance expert and spokeswoman for Mint, a financial planning website and app, said that for single women in their 30s, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly empowering to be smart with your money and do things for yourself and not just wait for the next milestone.\u201dBut it\u2019s not just singles who are diverting wedding money to other life goals. When Hannah Graham, 27, an assistant office manager from Thousand Oaks, Calif., got engaged last year, her parents revealed that they had $30,000 saved for her wedding. But even with that significant budget, she and her live-in fianc\u00e9, Jesse Davis 28, who runs a dog-grooming business, found that it likely wouldn\u2019t be enough. \u201cWe looked at different venues and catering and it was adding up so quickly,\u201d she said.So the couple decided to fulfill another dream instead: visiting Italy. They booked a three-week trip last fall, traveled throughout the country, and included a stop in the medieval town of Montepulciano, where they were married. Their trip cost $15,000, and they put the other half of the wedding fund into a savings account.\u201cIt was perfect, and I\u2019m glad it went the way it went,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so stress-free, and we were able to not just use the money for one day.\u201dJonny Marsh, 28, who works in public relations in the San Francisco area, and his wife, Alison Donzanti, 29, who works for a cybersecurity company, came to a similar conclusion about their honeymoon. Before they were married, in July 2014, they included a note in the invitations asking guests to contribute to a fund for a trip to Hawaii. But when it came down to planning it, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to spend that much money on one experience. The resort alone was going to cost around $4,000.They opted for a cheaper honeymoon in Napa, Calif., and instead used the cash gifts toward the purchase of a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath townhouse in Foster City, Calif.\u201cWe had just been given all of this money and it seemed slightly frivolous to spend it on one big holiday, which when you boil it down, that\u2019s what a honeymoon is,\u201d Mr. Marsh said. \u201cEveryone thought we were very adult about it.\u201dOf course, parents may feel differently about the money they worked hard to save going to another purpose, said Ms. Greene, the personal finance expert. \u201cYou have to consult the stakeholders. What if your mom has been saving since you were 5 years old and has dreamed of a big wedding?\u201dIndeed, Ms. Graham\u2019s mother, Lori Graham, had mixed feelings. \u201cWhen Carrie decided she was going to buy a house with the funds instead of holding out for later, as a mom, I was sad \u2014 I wanted the wedding,\u201d she said. But she noted that home values in her daughter\u2019s neighborhood have risen sharply and \u201cit\u2019s been a good investment for her.\u201dFor Kaustubh Pandya, Ms. Lampart\u2019s father, it was easier to give his daughter the money for a condo because he already had an elaborate wedding for another daughter. \u201cIt was nice that we were able to afford such a lavish festivity for one child, but I know there are always better uses for money,\u201d he said.\u201cSince I spent that money for one daughter,\u201d he added, \u201cit was important to me that I should put the same money on the side for the other.\u201dMs. Lampart ended up meeting her husband, Matthew Lampart, a few days after closing on her condo. The couple had their wedding this past May at the Annapolis, Md., courthouse, followed by a lunch with immediate family. A few weeks later, Ms. Lampart had an open-bar party with friends.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have 200 people to enjoy your wedding,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, you will look at photos, but you can look at photos of a small wedding where you were able to spend time with the people you love.\u201dOthers have also found a way to have it all. Ms. Graham, the minister, has already started saving for the small wedding that she still hopes to have one day. As for Mr. Marsh, he and his bride are finally going on a dream honeymoon to French Polynesia in October.\u201cWe\u2019ve got the house, we\u2019re in a good position financially after knowing what the expenses are to owning a home and getting used to it, so we\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be the honeymoon that never was.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Essex County College Teeters, a Call to End Turmoil", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of New Jersey religious leaders is calling for change at a public community college in Newark that is teetering on the brink of losing its accreditation after years of mismanagement and turmoil.The religious leaders, outraged by the disorder at the school, Essex County College, plan to hold a news conference and rally before a board of trustees meeting Thursday night calling for an end to what they say is political interference by entrenched officials at the school that has undermined efforts to save it.Essex County College has about 15,000 mostly black and Hispanic students, and serves as a bridge to four-year institutions like Rutgers University and New Jersey Institute of Technology. But its leadership has been roiled with controversy since the 2010 resignation of its longtime president, A. Zachary Yamba.The first leader appointed to succeed Mr. Yamba, Edythe Abdullah, left in 2013. The next president, Gale Gibson, was fired in 2016. She and her general counsel, Rashidah Hasan, are suing the college, alleging that they were retaliated against for pointing out potentially criminal levels of financial mismanagement. The ministers allege that the college\u2019s new president, Anthony Munroe, the former president of Malcolm X College in Chicago, is being blocked in his reform efforts by the same internal forces.\u201cWe cannot and will not sit idly until the truth of these shenanigans, which are designed to destabilize this president and his service to the community, finally reveal themselves,\u201d the group of eight leaders, representing about 20,000 congregants in Essex County, wrote to Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., the Essex County executive, in a letter on Aug. 25.At the center of the controversy is Joyce Harley, the school\u2019s vice president of administration and finance. She was formerly the Essex County administrator, appointed by Mr. DiVincenzo. Prior to 2013, Mr. DiVincenzo publicly backed Ms. Harley to be president of the college, but she lost that bid. The ministers charge that the support of the county executive gives Ms. Harley outsize influence at the college despite her middle-management title.Controversy has swirled around Ms. Harley since at least 2015, when the former head track and field coach at the college, Michael Smart, was investigated by the state for stealing more than $150,000 in school funds between 2012 and 2015, a crime for which he ultimately pleaded guilty. An internal college investigation found that Ms. Harley had failed to exercise proper oversight over financial matters, and called for disciplinary action against her, according to the lawsuit filed by Ms. Gibson, the former president. Instead, Ms. Gibson and Ms. Hasan were fired. At least seven former college employees are suing the school over their 2016 firings, some calling for whistle-blower protection.As a result of the turmoil, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which grants accreditation to area colleges, warned in November that the college\u2019s accreditation may be in jeopardy because of concerns over the school\u2019s governance, conflict of interest rules, and student retention policies, among other issues. The college\u2019s official reply to the commission is scheduled to be adopted at Thursday\u2019s board meeting, and submitted to the commission on Friday. In October, the commission will send monitors to the school.If the school were to lose its accreditation, it would be at risk of closure, as the degrees would not carry official weight. As the risk looms, local officials have begun to speak out. On Tuesday, the president of the county Board of Freeholders, the local legislative body, wrote to the president of Essex County College\u2019s board of directors demanding answers to the ministers\u2019 allegations.\"The freeholders have received numerous complaints, letters of concern, and grievances from citizens at our board meetings,\u201d Britnee N. Timberlake, the Freeholder president, wrote. \u201cEach citizen has been deeply unsettled about the future of the college.\u201dThe college officially operates independently, but Mr. DiVincenzo, who has been county executive since 2003, selects most of the members of the board of trustees and controls some funding for the college, Ms. Timberlake said.In a statement, Mr. DiVincenzo said, \u201cWe are in complete support of President Dr. Anthony Munroe and the board of trustees and look forward to them making Essex County College a model educational institution.\u201dHe did not respond directly to the ministers\u2019 allegations.Ms. Harley did not return a request for comment.The ministers also allege that Ms. Harley and members of the board of trustees that support her are blocking Mr. Munroe from hiring a competent chief financial officer, a key demand of the accreditation commission. They say that Ms. Harley is insisting that the chief financial officer report directly to her, instead of to the president, as would be expected.On Monday, as the school year got underway, the faculty met to discuss the current state of affairs at the college, according to a letter from the faculty provided by the ministers. The leaders of the faculty association wrote that morale at the school is improving slowly but steadily since Mr. Munroe\u2019s appointment about three months ago. The meeting concluded with a unanimous vote of confidence in Mr. Munroe\u2019s ability, the letter stated.Mr. Munroe was hired unanimously by the board because of his reputation as a turnaround leader.\u201cI recognize the challenges involved and we are working as a team to address and resolve any accreditation issues we may have. We are confident that we will exceed the expectations of Middle States,\u201d Mr. Munroe said.\u201cYou will be amazed at how much the community does not know concerning this community college, and the plight thereof,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zuma to Face No-Confidence Vote, This Time by Secret Ballot", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 Over his eight increasingly embattled years in power, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa has fended off five parliamentary no-confidence motions that would have forced him from office. On Tuesday, he is to face another, with a difference: Lawmakers will vote anonymously.The speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete, announced late on Monday afternoon that a vote of no confidence would take place by secret ballot, following a request from a coalition of opposition parties.Mr. Zuma has come under increasing pressure as evidence of high-level corruption in his administration has mounted, most recently with a trove of leaked emails that appeared to expose the extent of links between senior A.N.C. officials and an influential family, the Guptas.The motion requires only a simple majority to pass South Africa\u2019s 400-member Parliament.If the motion passed, Mr. Zuma and his entire cabinet, including deputy ministers, would have to step down, with Ms. Mbete becoming interim president, though he would remain president of the A.N.C.The party\u2019s chief whip in Parliament, Jackson Mthembu, said on Friday that voting against Mr. Zuma would be \u201ctantamount to throwing a nuclear bomb\u201d at South Africa, and that only a \u201cbewitched\u201d party would vote against its own president.The family\u2019s relationship with the presidency has introduced a new portmanteau term into the South African political lexicon \u2014 \u201cZupta\u201d \u2014 and prompted a critical report last year from the public protector, a national anti-corruption figure.Somadoda Fikeni, a political analyst, said the no-confidence motion was unlikely to succeed, even in a secret ballot. \u201cThe A.N.C. doesn\u2019t want to be seen changing its leadership on the back of pressure from the opposition, even though half the party believes that Mr. Zuma has become a serious political liability,\u201d he said.A more serious challenge to Mr. Zuma may come in December, when the A.N.C. is to hold its national conference and elect its next leader.\u201cThe President\u2019s opponents in the A.N.C. \u2014 and there are many \u2014 have clearly decided to wait until December to try and get rid of him,\u201d said a political analyst, Steven Friedman. \u201cThe fight that matters is taking place within the party. Until we have millions of people marching on the streets, instead of merely thousands, the A.N.C. is going to remained focused on this internal struggle.\u201dProtesters gathered in Cape Town on Monday afternoon, led by a coalition of civil society and religious leaders called #UniteBehind. A brief but spirited counterprotest by members of the A.N.C.\u2019s Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association, numbering some 50 people, was disbanded by police.The protest, organized by a coalition of more than 20 civil society organizations, was a \u201ccall for accountability from A.N.C. members,\u201d said its organizer Mandisa Dyantyi, deputy secretary general of the Social Justice Coalition, which helped organize the protest. \u201cThey\u2019re in Parliament to represent the people who elected them, not their party,\u201d she said.Mr. Jonas \u2014 who has accused a member of the Gupta family of offering him a bribe, a claim the family has strongly denied \u2014 told the protesters: \u201cWe cannot allow our freedom to be sold so cheaply. We have to fight. We\u2019re gathered here to shape the future of this country.\u201d\u201cThis march is a distraction from the real issues in South Africa,\u201d said Banzi Siwe, 23, a student, who added: \u201cCompared to what the white people stole before, this is nothing.\u201dKhaya Yozi, a spokesman for the A.N.C. in Cape Town, said that the party\u2019s members \u201cwould not be provoked\u201d by opposition protesters. \u201cWe need to set aside the divisions within our party and protect the A.N.C.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a spokesman for the African National Congress, Zizi Kodwa.

{"Headline": "A Deal for an Australian Dairy Wrapped in Layers of Chinese Loans", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt looked like a good match. Australia was hungry for Chinese money. And the businessman, Lu Xianfeng, presented himself as a well-heeled investor, promising to protect existing jobs and add even more.Like much of the splashier overseas spending by Chinese conglomerates, the acquisition of the dairy was financed by layers upon layers of debt, the type of financial complexity and opaque deal making that worry regulators in China and around the world.Mr. Lu paid for the purchase with three loans, one from a lender in Australia and two from Chinese lenders, including the biggest state-run bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to the filings of his publicly traded company. He then pledged shares in the public company, Ningbo Xianfeng New Materials, to raise even more money. Lately, his businesses have been on shaky financial footing, with Ningbo Xianfeng halting trading in its shares in China, citing a restructuring.The acquisition of the Tasmanian dairy, known as Van Diemen\u2019s Land Company, or VDL, is spurring questions about whether the Australian government is fully assessing the risks.Major purchases by overseas buyers are vetted by Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board. While the board analyzes deals for threats to the country\u2019s national interests, its mandate does not require deep due diligence on the buyers\u2019 finances.\u201cThe Australian assumption has been that Chinese business operates like Australian ones,\u201d said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \u201cBut they operate in ways that don\u2019t fit with how we do business in the Australian economy.\u201dThe review process, he said, appears to lack basic due diligence on potential foreign buyers. \u201cIf they have the capacity, they are very good at hiding it,\u201d he said.Mr. Lu is not the only Chinese buyer with precarious finances.Mr. Lu did not respond to requests for comment sent through his Chinese and Australian companies. A spokeswoman for his Chinese company, Ningbo Xianfeng, declined to comment.A spokesman for the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, said in a statement that \u201cthe government considers a broad range of factors against the national interest when assessing foreign investment proposals,\u201d including financing arrangements and impact on the economy.The Tasmanian government has been courting Chinese investors since it hosted President Xi with fanfare in 2014. Bolstered by an Australia-China free trade agreement, Tasmanian exports of fresh produce to China have soared.From the outset, the deal for the lush land perched high above the southern Pacific Ocean attracted attention. The roots of VDL, Australia\u2019s most prestigious dairy, stretch back to the settlement of Tasmania by the British in the early 1800s. The British owned it for more than a century; the dairy was owned by a New Zealand company before Mr. Lu bought it.\u201cHere was a proposal from a savvy Chinese investor,\u201d said the chief executive of VDL Farms, Evan Rolley, a former state government official. \u201cHe could take the Tasmanian product right into the consumer markets in China.\u201dTo help gain acceptance in tight-knit Tasmania, where the population is just 500,000, Mr. Lu chose a well-connected former politician, David Crean, as the deputy chairman of Moon Lake. Mr. Lu impressed officials with his pledge to honor the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people on the property, Mr. Rolley said.\u201cThey have a na\u00efve fixation\u201d with China, Mark Harrison, associate professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Tasmania, said of the state government.\u201cMr. Lu\u2019s financial problems were well covered in the Chinese press and in financial filings,\u201d he said. \u201cI know about them. Why doesn\u2019t the government?\u201dAfter striking an agreement to buy the dairy in late 2015, Mr. Lu established Kaixin Investment, a Ningbo-based company, to acquire the assets. That company obtained loans of $74 million from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and $22 million from the China Zheshang Bank to finance the purchase.The loans were guaranteed by Ningbo Xianfeng, which in turn was backed by all the dairy farm\u2019s assets, according to corporate filings. Separate public filings showed that a $56 million loan from Rabobank in Australia also funded the deal, debt that was also backed by the dairy\u2019s assets.The Chinese loans were not presented to the review board, according to the managing director of Moon Lake, Sean Shwe, who helped prepare documents for the board. Mr. Shwe said he was not aware of the loans from the Chinese lenders.Such loans are generally extended at high interest rates. They can sour quickly if shares plunge in value, a possibility in China\u2019s seesawing stock market.In an interview, the spokesman for Mr. Morrison, the Australian treasurer, said that Mr. Morrison was \u201ccomfortable with the advice provided by the review board on the dairy acquisition.\u201dThe Australian review board said the documents presented by the Chinese buyer were confidential.Rabobank declined to comment.Mr. Lu\u2019s businesses have been struggling. Ningbo Xianfeng has not traded since April. It announced in July that profits were expected to drop at least 70 percent in the first six months of 2017.The window-shade business Mr. Lu owns in Perth, Australia, has failed to turn an annual profit since Ningbo Xianfeng acquired it in 2014.Last month, Ningbo Xianfeng announced it would sell an online auto-parts business in Shanghai. Employees had staged a revolt, saying Mr. Lu didn\u2019t live up to his pledges, according to press reports and public filings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Shrink Jail Population, a Bail Program Is Expanding", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent afternoon, Charlene Davis sat in a dimly lit room across from the holding cells on the lower level of Bronx Criminal Court. A phone on her desk lit up with calls from family members, often frantic, asking about relatives who had been arrested.\u201cA lot of people say \u2018It\u2019s my first time calling, I don\u2019t know how this works,\u2019\u201d she said.They were trying to bail out their relatives, and quickly, before their loved ones ended up on the bus bound for jail.Ms. Davis, who works for a criminal justice nonprofit contracted by the city, was their best hope. One by one, she helped the relatives navigate the intricacies of paying bail.But relatively few people manage to make bail right away, and as the city steps up its efforts to reduce the jail population, the efforts of Ms. Davis and the group she works for, the Criminal Justice Agency, are seen as a way to decrease the number of people who end up in the jail in the first place.Judges citywide set bail in roughly 45,000 cases each year, and only 12 percent of defendants can pay in time to be released from court. Another 46 percent end up going to jail for up to a week because they cannot pay in the narrow window of time between their arraignment and when the next bus leaves.Currently, the Bail Expediting Program, or BEX, helps people whose bail is less than $3,500 by contacting relatives and guiding them through the payment process. Under the city\u2019s expansion plan, people with bail amounts of up to $5,000 will be eligible for the program.If bail is to be paid imminently, workers like Ms. Davis can place holds with the Department of Correction to delay transporting defendants to jail.The expansion of program is an effort by the city, in the absence of sweeping reforms in Albany, to chip away at a bail system that officials, researchers and activists say amplifies inequities in the criminal justice system. Elizabeth Glazer, the director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice, said the Bail Expediting Program, which has been around since the 1980s, was an attractive way to reduce jail time for defendants \u201cwho shouldn\u2019t have ended up there at all.\u201d\u201cThis issue of what do we do about people who are in for under a week has been a big focus\u201d of the administration, Ms. Glazer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re putting up an online bail system, we\u2019re making sure there are cash machines in all the courthouses. All of these things that you would think, how important can they be, end up being quite important for someone to make bail as quickly as they can and from a courthouse.\u201dFor its part, the City Council passed legislation in June increasing the length of the hold the Criminal Justice Agency can request from two hours up to 12 hours. Rory I. Lancman, one of sponsors of the bill, said it was necessary to help people work through a bail system that is \u201cKafkaesque.\u201dCritics say the changes focus on granular details and people charged with low-level, nonviolent offenses. Reform advocates say the city should also go after big-ticket reforms that help those charged with violent crimes, like Mr. Browder, who was charged with robbery.Glenn E. Martin, the president and founder of JustLeadershipUSA, a nonprofit that aims to cut the nation\u2019s prison population in half, said incremental changes were \u201cBand-Aid fixes on a cancerous issue.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re the mayor, you can afford to do big things,\u201d he said.Greg Berman, the director of the Center for Court Innovation, a nonprofit that documented the bail payment system in a 2015 report prepared for the mayor, said small changes were as necessary as big fixes. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you can do in the here and now,\u201d he said.The Bail Expediting Program has a help desk in the Bronx, where Ms. Davis answered a call from a woman pleading for more time to get to court to pay bail for her boyfriend on Friday. His hold was expiring before she could get to court, so Ms. Davis promised to request an extension.But Ms. Davis was told that the man had been put on a 3 p.m. bus to Rikers. \u201cI was four minutes too late,\u201d she said.Robert J. Mongelli, 89, had better luck posting bail quickly in Queens when his grandson, 39, was arrested in June and charged with stealing $8 in shaving cream. Mr. Mongelli rushed to the Criminal Court, where bail was set at $1,000. He was given 15 minutes to pay before his grandson would be put on a bus to jail, an impossible feat for a man who is legally blind, has a pacemaker and uses a walker, he said.Fortunately, a worker from the Bail Expediting Program, was sitting near him in court and escorted him to the front of a long line at the bail payment window before it closed for lunch. Within an hour, he and his grandson, were walking out of the courthouse.\u201cHe kissed me when he came out of jail because I put up the bail,\u201d Mr. Mongelli said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Exxon Mobil Didn\u2019t Say About Climate Change", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsScrutiny is mounting on the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil and gas company. On multiple legal fronts the question is being asked: Did Exxon Mobil\u2019s communications about climate change break the law?The question dominating these cases is whether the company misled consumers, shareholders or the public about the environmental or business risks of climate change, or about the risk that oil and gas reserves might become stranded assets that won\u2019t be developed, affecting shareholder value.\u201cRead the documents,\u201d the company said, \u201cand make up your own mind.\u201dOur findings are clear: Exxon Mobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications. Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what Exxon Mobil\u2019s scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private and in academic circles, and what it presented to the general public.In total, we analyzed 187 documents generated between 1977 and 2014. We coded each document to characterize its positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious and solvable. (Research has shown that these four factors are key predictors of public support for climate policies. Not coincidentally, they also underpin most narratives of climate skepticism and denial.) We found that, from as early as the 1970s, Exxon Mobil (and its predecessors Exxon and Mobil) not only knew about emerging climate science, but also contributed research to it. Scientific reports and articles written or cowritten by Exxon Mobil employees acknowledged that global warming was a real and serious threat. They also noted it could be addressed by reducing fossil fuel use, meaning that fossil fuel reserves might one day become stranded assets.For the most part their research was highly technical, hidden behind the walls of Exxon Mobil offices, or reported in academic publications with access only through a paywall.In 1997, for instance, in an ad titled \u201cReset the Alarm,\u201d the company argued: \u201cLet\u2019s face it: The science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet.\u201dSome advertorials conflicted with Exxon Mobil research published the very same year.In short, Exxon Mobil contributed quietly to climate science and loudly to raising doubts about it. We found that, accounting for reasonable doubt given the state of the science at the time of each document, roughly 80 percent of the company\u2019s academic and internal papers acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. But 81 percent of their climate change advertorials in one way or another expressed doubt.Of course, any analysis of words is subject to interpretation. It\u2019s for this reason that we used established social science methods and subjected our analysis to peer review, to verify that our claims are supported by evidence, were analyzed according to tested methods and are not just a matter of our opinion.Exxon Mobil will no doubt challenge our peer-reviewed study, just as it has challenged three decades of peer-reviewed climate science. (In a comment, Exxon Mobil disagreed with our conclusion and said that its statements on public policy and climate science \u201chave always reflected the global understanding of the issue.\u201d) But while we can debate the details, the overall picture is clear: Even while Exxon Mobil scientists were contributing to climate science and writing reports that explained it to their bosses, the company was paying for advertisements that told a very different tale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Washington, a Truly Underground Arts Scene", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Roaming the streets of the Dupont Circle neighborhood about 20 years ago, Julian Hunt spotted a grimy staircase leading down from the pavement to a boarded-up door.He spent many hours on the phone and in the city\u2019s archives, which led Mr. Hunt to crawl through filthy tunnels with a flashlight to discover an old trolley tunnel inhabited by a small group of homeless people.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those spaces in the city that becomes mythical because it just hasn\u2019t been open to the public for so long,\u201d said Brianne Nadeau, a member of the City Council.Washington is often portrayed as the staid bureaucratic center of the United States, where a transient young population is drawn only by the job market, and where rocketing property prices limit the fringe art scene. Artists earn their spot at a Smithsonian exhibition only when they have proved themselves elsewhere.\u201cWe\u2019re this intermediate opportunity,\u201d said Noel Kassewitz, director for arts programming at Dupont Underground. \u201cWe\u2019re a young nonprofit so we have the flexibility to host more experimental works here while at the same time having the space that is often not available.\u201dThe Dupont Circle neighborhood has developed as part of the spread of gentrification across the capital over the decades and now is home to fashionable bars and restaurants surrounding a circular park with an imposing fountain. In decades past, those same streets were known for crime and drug use.The tunnels belong to the District of Columbia government. But after much haggling with the authorities, delayed further by the turmoil of the global financial crisis, Mr. Hunt won a five-year lease in 2014.His nonprofit has since spent about $300,000 \u2014 raised through crowdfunding and private donations as well as ticket sales \u2014 to clean the space and install basic lights and ventilation. Local officials are watching its success closely after an attempt to draw people to the tunnels with a food court on another platform failed in the 1990s.For Mr. Hunt, the project is a form of activism in a city where, when people think of beautiful architecture, they think mostly of the preservation of historic buildings.\u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of activism where you actually do things, new things and where you experiment,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s not here. This is not an entrepreneurial city.\u201d\u201cWe needed our public to make the public art,\u201d said Craig Cook, who led the exhibit. \u201cThere was really this whole play on democracy and cooperation.\u201dSince then, programming has ramped up from seven events last year to 144 events planned for the 16 months between January 2017 and April 2018, including visual art, theater and even film accompanied by musical improvisation. The space remains relatively bare, with graffiti art along its gritty walls and worn-out street signs punctuating the length of the tunnel where exits once were.Dupont Underground has ambitious plans, with talk of building stairs between the tunnels and the park above it, partnering with local schools to showcase student work and extending the exhibition space along the trolley tunnel to another platform across the street.That will come only after the organization slashes through layers of red tape. Raising the money to clean up a disused tunnel is one thing, but when regulations require fire sprinklers, emergency exits and access for the disabled, the bills add up.According to Mr. Hunt, much of the problem is the politics in the District of Columbia.Lacking statehood, the district has one delegate in Congress, who cannot vote on the House floor; there is no representative in the Senate. The unique administration in the capital has complicated fund-raising and negotiations for the nonprofit, which is nestled under Dupont Circle, a National Park Service property.\u201cWe have had people from other parts of the country come look at what we are doing,\u201d Mr. Hunt said.\u201cThey talk to their congressmen, they talk to their senators and the public money flows in and they get their projects up and running,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re self-financed. We don\u2019t have any representation.\u201dFor those in Washington\u2019s established art institutions, spaces like Dupont Underground are seen as a much-needed addition. Adriel Luis, curator at the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center, said the capital lacked \u201ca bridge between the galleries and the museums\u201d to foster local talent.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly casting such a wide net, the artists and creatives in our own backyard are often missed, and that often contradicts the way so many of us interact with so many parts of our lives,\u201d he said, pointing to the rising demand for locally sourced food and small local businesses.Stephanie Stebich, director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, described the range of art institutions in the capital as an \u201cecosystem,\u201d where fringe spaces like Dupont Underground grow organically like weeds with little support, larger galleries are the purposefully cultivated crops and federally funded behemoths like the Smithsonian are the grand greenhouses that loom large.\u201cThere is always a funny tension between the established museums and the local art scene,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is something sad about having art buried underground,\u201d Ms. Frank said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Reaches Deal With Renault Despite New U.S. Sanctions", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 The French carmaker Renault signed a multimillion-dollar deal in Tehran on Monday, agreeing to raise vehicle production in Iran just days after President Trump signed into law new sanctions against the country.The roughly $780 million agreement to produce as many as 150,000 additional cars a year is the largest foreign auto deal in Iran\u2019s history, state-run PressTV said. It was a victory for President Hassan Rouhani, who was sworn into office on Saturday after being re-elected this year promising to revitalize an economy hurt by sanctions.Iran, an Islamic republic, is increasingly attracting foreign investors, despite restrictions imposed by the United States over its missile program and its military activities in the region.Its economy has limped along, surviving mainly on oil sales in recent years, with youth unemployment topping 40 percent and the state controlling many sectors. American restrictions stop most international banks from providing financing or credit to Iran, and the country is cut off from international payments systems for using debit and credit cards.Still, the agreement to establish a joint venture with a government-run conglomerate is welcome news for Iran.Renault has pledged to open two factories with Iranian partners.One partner, the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization, a government conglomerate known as IDRO and which controls 117 companies, was long under sanctions by the United States and Europe which accused it of supporting Iran\u2019s missile program. Those sanctions were lifted under Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement with world powers last year, which allowed Renault and other foreign companies, including the American plane manufacturer Boeing, to do business with the country.Sanctions lawyers in the United States said Renault\u2019s decision to proceed with the joint venture indicated it was confident that the nuclear deal would survive, despite the Trump administration\u2019s threats to withdraw from it.Farhad Alavi, managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group in Washington, said Renault\u2019s decision also signaled that it had \u201clikely undertaken a great deal of care to ensure that it is fully compliant.\u201dBut despite the various agreements, Iran remains a difficult and opaque place to do business. Corruption is widespread, and political opposition to foreign investment can raise obstacles.The French company will hold a 60 percent share in the joint venture, according to Mansour Moazzami, the chairman of IDRO. The rest will be split evenly between the conglomerate and the other partner, Negin Khodro, a private company that represents Renault in Iran.Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

He was 74.Costco Wholesale of Issaquah, Wash., announced his death but gave no cause. The company said Mr. Brotman had attended a dinner for its warehouse managers on Monday night in nearby Seattle.He had been a reluctant retailer at first. After working in his family\u2019s chain of 18 men\u2019s stores during college, Mr. Brotman sought to escape a retail career by applying for law school. But his business acumen proved too compelling.After his father suggested that he replicate Price Club, a pioneering San Diego-based chain of warehouse stores for small businesses, Jeff Brotman teamed up with James Sinegal, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sol Price, the chain\u2019s founder and a retailing genius himself.Mr. Brotman went on to obtain critical financing from a venture capitalist, Fred Paulsell, whom he had met when their plane was struck by lightning and made an emergency landing.Their first Costco warehouse store opened in Seattle in 1983 (the same year Sam Walton opened Sam\u2019s Club); the company merged with Price Club a decade later.It soon became a global retailing juggernaut by offering consumer goods at rock-bottom prices (from 20-cent diapers in boxes of 198 to rotisserie chickens that it sold at a loss for $4.99), sticking to a no-frills inventory, and encouraging customer loyalty with annual membership fees.Costco was the world\u2019s largest retailer of a wide range of products, including organic foods and wine, in recent years. The company took in about $120 billion last year, its revenues second only to Walmart (although Costco was recently bumped to third place by Amazon).\u201cJeff understood immediately that there was an opening there,\u201d his brother, Michel, told The Seattle Times this week. \u201cThe Price Club idea appealed even to people with money \u2014 the idea of being able to buy value at the right price. It wasn\u2019t about buying cheap. It was about buying good value.\u201dWhile Mr. Sinegal was largely the public face of the company as its chief executive until 2012, Mr. Brotman served as its less visible chairman from the beginning. He became expert in scouting the most profitable locations for Costco\u2019s warehouse stores, which now number 736 worldwide.The two partners shared a feel-good philosophy, epitomized by their motto, \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d The company\u2019s unusually generous salaries and benefits for workers rankled Wall Street stock analysts, and the partners publicly characterized their retail rivals as Scrooges (although the company settled discrimination suits by women who said they had been passed over for promotions).Jeffrey Hart Brotman, a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Romania, was born on Sept. 27, 1942, in Tacoma, Wash., to Pearl and Bernard Brotman. His Canadian-born father owned Seattle Knitting Mills and, with his brothers, a chain of haberdashers called Bernie\u2019s in Washington and Oregon.Mr. Brotman earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science at the University of Washington in 1964 and graduated from its law school in 1967.After practicing law only briefly, he and his brother opened a women\u2019s jeans store named Bottoms and later a chain of men\u2019s clothing stores called Jeffrey Michael. Jeff Brotman was also an early investor in other retail ventures, including Starbucks, which went on to build a coffee empire from its base in Seattle.Mr. Brotman married the former Susan Thrailkill, an executive for Nordstrom department stores, whom he met on a blind date. Besides his brother, Mr. Brotman is survived by his wife; their son, Justin; their daughter, Amanda Brotman-Schetritt, and two grandchildren.Mr. Brotman also drew attention as a campaign fund-raiser for Democratic candidates and, with his wife, as a philanthropist whose beneficiaries included the University of Washington and the Seattle Art Museum.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated the subject of an anecdote and misattributed a quotation that was part of it. It was Mr. Brotman\u2019s father, not Mr. Brotman, who \u201cwas against impulse buying,\u201d and it was the elder, not the younger, Mr. Brotman\u2019s wife who said her husband had disliked shopping.Advertisement"}

That makes a difference.\u201dCompared with most large venues around the country, Merriweather also has a minimum of corporate brands on display. Aside from some beer logos by the bars and a few tiny Geico geckos peering out from the trees, almost no corporate signs are visible, and Mr. Hurwitz said he had turned down big offers for naming rights on the theater.\u201cI just don\u2019t want to remind people that we\u2019re here to take their money,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we are, but we don\u2019t need to remind them of that.\u201dThe renovations to Merriweather, which is owned by the Downtown Columbia Arts and Culture Commission, a nonprofit organization, are being financed by government grants in Maryland and a $16 million loan by I.M.P.

But the Department of Justice approved the merger, with conditions, and he lost a lawsuit in which he accused Live Nation of antitrust violations.A Live Nation spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Hurwitz.Still, he has lasted. When asked how, Mr. Hurwitz said he had no choice but to do the best job he could.\u201cI\u2019ve come to accept the idea that when an act gets to a certain level, they become a brand name, and they\u2019re gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201dBut later, Mr. Hurwitz followed up with an email saying that while he continues to disapprove of that merger, he focuses instead on booking bands for his own venues.

It\u2019s a sociology term derived from \u201cprecarious\u201d that describes the growing class of people \u2014 \u201cthe 99 percent\u201d invoked by the Occupy movement \u2014 left behind by the rise of global capitalism. \u201cPrecariat\u201d would certainly apply to two of Cohen\u2019s main characters, Yoav Matzav and Uri Dugri, Israeli Defense Forces veterans who have immigrated to New York City, where they\u2019ve taken off-the-books jobs at King\u2019s Moving, a company that enlists them in evicting delinquent tenants and homeowners who\u2019ve defaulted on their mortgages. The term would also apply to Imamu Nabi, born Avery Luter, a Vietnam veteran and drug addict who is one of those in default.Israeli veterans, an African-American veteran who has (at least in name) converted to Islam: As a premise for a novel, this conflict between evictors and evicted seems built for thematic complexity, as it brings to mind gentrification, the Israeli occupation of Palestine and much more. Indeed, the suspense in \u201cMoving Kings\u201d derives not from traditional narrative momentum but from our wondering how Cohen is going to take these dangerous ingredients and make meaning out of them. What is he going to say about Jews evicting blacks, for example, or, to drill down further, about Israeli Jews evicting African-American Muslims, or veterans evicting veterans? What will come out of the vexed dynamic between Yoav, Uri and Imamu? Something to do with the word \u201cprecariat,\u201d I thought, when I came across that striking word 170 pages in.I was grasping, in other words. In its initial long section, the novel slogs through the story of Yoav\u2019s middle-aged cousin, David King, the \u201cMoving King,\u201d an American Jew and Republican Party donor whose economic status is the opposite of precarious. We first encounter David at a Fourth of July fund-raiser in the Hamptons, \u201cwhich had required attendees to donate upwards of $4K for the privilege of drinking diluted booze and eating oversauced BBQ.\u201d (Here, in a sign of things to come, both \u201cdiluted\u201d and \u201coversauced\u201d seem more close-to-hand than precise.) Unsurprisingly, David turns out to be impotent and in poor shape: \u201cThe booze and red meat and dairy. The pills ostensibly for bloodpressure and the pills ostensibly for cholesterol and the pills he wasn\u2019t sure what they did: for anxiety.\u201d This broad smirking at a milieu that\u2019s made for easy mockery also includes \u201cskinny flagpole women flying dresses in red, white and blue,\u201d conversations about \u201cstocks, about realestate \u2026 about renovations and how draining it was to open a house for the season,\u201d and an aside about \u201cjazz that turned the whole world into an elevator.\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d could muster a more astute caricature of the Fox News crowd than this.David Foster Wallace, one of Cohen\u2019s conspicuous influences, lived and wrote in terror of solipsism, though no matter how hard he strove to imagine characters unlike himself (and he had huge range), you always saw Wallace, almost his actual face, through the unmistakable style. This struggle gave him pathos. By contrast, Cohen\u2019s stance seems to be deliberately against any idea of \u201clikability.\u201d Almost everyone in his book is loathsome, though in a facile way that says as much about the portrayer as the portrayed. David\u2019s daughter, Tammy, because she goes to N.Y.U., naturally toys with heroin and also \u201cdabbled in anorexia and bulimia, her head like a brunette plunger in the toilet.\u201d Uri\u2019s girlfriend, with whom he remains obsessed throughout the novel, nevertheless is described in their single love scene as having \u201ctiny hairs on her ass like browned grass\u201d and \u201cgangling nipples like carob pods.\u201d Imamu, before becoming a drug addict, frequents a bodega where he buys \u201chis minty Cope dips and all the three ingredients of Robitussin Wine, the third ingredient being the pineapple Jolly Ranchers.\u201d Perhaps this is funny to the kind of person who thinks it\u2019s funny to make sexually or racially disparaging jokes when you\u2019re aware that it\u2019s in bad taste. Or perhaps the message here is that these characters and whatever they represent don\u2019t even deserve the attentiveness of actual satire.After the David section, in a kind of nadir, we get the strange interpolation of a letter from a handicapped widow on Staten Island who has lost her son and home, either so that Cohen can make fun of her broken English, or present her as some kind of holy fool, or imply that she\u2019s lying \u2014 it\u2019s unclear. And so it\u2019s a relief when we finally get to the story of the Israelis, Yoav and Uri, wherein the novel leaves off with its reflexive contempt and shows an almost human heart. Cohen does an able job of evoking the torpor and drift of the squadmates\u2019 lives after combat. \u201cHe\u2019d miscalculated, apparently,\u201d Yoav broods, \u201cby thinking that to leave Israel he could avoid Israel, could evade the Jews, the news \u2014 by thinking, like nearly all the customers he\u2019d moved, that just by changing the walls around him he\u2019d be changed within, as if all that junk that\u2019d been pumped into his head would come tumbling out in the transit.\u201d The squalid poetry of convenience stores is one of Cohen\u2019s fortes, and among the many memorable descriptions of them, one of particular note is of Yoav becoming attuned to \u201cthoughts or intimations or taints of impatience that might come from being stuck in line behind a grubby slow salaaming human of another race who kept changing his mind about his Powerball digits at the deli \u2014 he\u2019d have to break with those thoughts. He couldn\u2019t stay in America without breaking those thoughts and dealing with the guilt.\u201dThis sense of displacement and the wish to begin a new, better life chimes in a moving way with our recollection of David King\u2019s shallow, dubious fealty to Israel. In the first section, King has a heart attack, which causes in him the surge of Zionism that leads to his reconnecting with his distant cousin Yoav and bringing him to the United States to work (eventually with Uri) for King\u2019s Moving. \u201cWhile being treated, he\u2019d been infected with sentiment, nostalgia, a nasty nosocomial case. Out of nowhere, David had found himself yearning, but not for the immediate, for the far. Distance gave a grandeur to the emotions, expanded the dwindling self, expanded its purchase, by imbuing each desire with an ancestry, a mystery, a primitive significance.\u201dSeen through this passage, the book\u2019s thematic logic is that spoiled losers like David King finance devastation in distant places \u2014 the Palestinian Territories, the outer boroughs \u2014 carried out by members of the precariat like Yoav and Uri against other members of it like Imamu. Jews evicting blacks, Israeli Jews evicting African-American Muslims, veterans evicting veterans: I see this schematic, but Cohen\u2019s book has no capacity for real outrage, sorrow or grief. In this way, like its antihero David, it\u2019s a victim of its own safe distance.Zachary Lazar\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cI Pity the Poor Immigrant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Threats on Health Law Hide an Upside: Gains Made by Some Insurers", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has not been a market for the faint of heart.Supporters of the Affordable Care Act achieved a major victory this past week when, thanks to cajoling and arm-twisting by state regulators, the last \u201cbare\u201d county in America \u2014 in rural Ohio \u2014 found an insurer willing to sell health coverage through the law\u2019s marketplace there. So despite earlier indications that insurance companies would stop offering coverage under the law in large parts of the country, insurers have now agreed to sell policies everywhere.But a moment of truth still looms for the industry in the coming weeks under the law known as Obamacare. Companies must set their final plans and premiums by late September, even as the Trump administration continues to threaten to cut off billions of dollars in government subsidies promised by the legislation. Insurers are also awaiting Senate hearings set to start on Sept. 6 for a hint of what steps, if any, lawmakers may take to stabilize the market.With congressional Republicans\u2019 yearslong quest to dismantle the Affordable Care Act dead for now, the fate of the landmark law depends in large part on the health of the insurance marketplaces and the ability of insurers to make a viable business out of selling coverage to individuals. When the law passed seven years ago, insurers saw a potential bonanza: tens of millions of brand-new paying customers, many backed by generous government subsidies and required by the new law to have health coverage. Now, about four years after the law\u2019s marketplaces opened for business, most of the industry\u2019s biggest players have pulled out.\u201cOutside of the noise,\u201d the surviving companies \u201care seeing a path forward in this marketplace,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s who has examined the financial results of more than two dozen Blue Cross insurers.\u201cIt is still a new market,\u201d he added, \u201cand everyone is adjusting to it.\u201dThe healthier business outlook has been achieved at a big cost to consumers. To stanch their losses, many companies raised their prices substantially for this year while narrowing their networks of providers to hold down costs. In Phoenix, for example, a typical plan\u2019s monthly premiums more than doubled. Although people with incomes low enough to qualify for federal subsidies were shielded from the brunt of the steep increases, the higher prices prompted Republicans to blame the law for plans that were out of many people\u2019s reach.In some cases, companies will seek even higher rates for 2018; the lone insurer left in Iowa is asking for a nearly 60 percent increase, on average.A New York Times analysis of insurance market data.Under the health law, in exchange for the wellspring of new customers, insurers agreed to operate using a fundamentally different business model. As the law required, they offered coverage to everyone, including people with existing medical conditions, and no longer charged people in poor health sharply higher prices.But the industry\u2019s enthusiasm gave way to misgivings as insurers lost billions of dollars in the law\u2019s first years. Eager to enroll as many people as possible, many companies set prices too low because they had no experience covering these new customers. Some people, especially if they were young and healthy, complained about higher premiums, even though the prices were often below the actual cost of providing medical care. Insurers had a hard time managing people with the biggest medical expenses, and fewer healthier people than expected signed up.Some of the nation\u2019s largest and best-known companies, including Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group, lost tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars each. Aetna said it has lost roughly $900 million since 2014.\u201cThis market proved to be quite cutthroat,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cSome of the big, old-time, insurers couldn\u2019t compete on cost.\u201d The companies modeled their plans on those they offered in the employer market, where there were broad, and expensive, networks of hospitals and doctors.Most of the insurance start-ups inspired by the Affordable Care Act, including Northwell\u2019s CareConnect and the so-called co-ops created under the law, could not survive.Pointing to what he described as the failures of the federal government and Congress, Michael J. Dowling, Northwell\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that it had become \u201cincreasingly clear that continuing the CareConnect health plan is financially unsustainable.\u201dThe individual market is estimated to encompass around 20 million people, including those who buy coverage directly from a broker or insurance company and do not qualify for a subsidy. In contrast, about 155 million Americans get coverage through their jobs. The large insurers abandoned the individual market under the health law because it was not worth the energy required to make it work, said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners. \u201cThey were losing money, and they have other businesses that are very profitable.\u201d Those businesses have helped push many insurers\u2019 stocks to record highs.But among the insurers that are still in the game, Centene, a for-profit company, is now making money in the individual market and expanding. Some of the Blue Cross insurers, including Health Care Service Corp., which operates plans in multiple states, including Texas and Illinois, and Independence Blue Cross, which has 300,000 customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, began to turn a profit in the market this year.\u201cIt does take a couple of years, and our membership has climbed steadily,\u201d said Daniel J. Hilferty, the chief executive of Independence Blue Cross. The company is currently seeking to raise rates around 8.5 percent next year but the increases could be sharply higher, especially if the administration decides to effectively end the penalty people face for not enrolling, Mr. Hilferty said. He worries about what could happen next in Washington.The company is \u201cmoving in the right direction,\u201d said Joel Klein, a senior executive with Oscar, one of whose founders is Joshua Kushner, the brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.The health law has also provided insurers, including major players, with another opportunity to make money: the expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal government program for low-income people that now covers nearly 75 million people, according to the Kaiser foundation. About 14 million people enrolled in the program in states that accepted federal funding.The insurers that stayed in the individual market have come to realize that the individual market was more like Medicaid than the employer business. Some customers have chronic conditions that have been poorly treated in the past, and insurers need to manage their care more closely. People shopping for a plan are very concerned about price, making it essential for insurers to find hospitals and doctors that provide care at the lowest cost.Companies in a position to offer low-cost plans have thrived. Centene made use of its experience, including setting up networks of hospitals and doctors that care for Medicaid patients, to sell coverage. The company now insures about 1.1 million people in the individual market, and almost half of the counties left bare by its competitors. \u201cFor 2018, we intend to grow this profitable segment of our business,\u201d Michael Neidorff, the company\u2019s chief executive, told investors last month.The lack of clarity over both the market\u2019s future and the efforts to stabilize it could also lead to much higher prices next year. Some insurers are requesting rate increases of 20 to 30 percent or more. \u201cJust as they\u2019re getting their footing, they have the worst thing that can happen to an insurance company: uncertainty about the business model,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ondra, a former insurance executive who worked in the Obama administration.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to stop reimbursing insurers for plans that waive deductibles and co-payments for low-income people are particularly worrisome. Under the law, insurers must offer these more generous plans, and they priced their policies assuming they would receive about $7 billion from the government this year to cover the costs. The companies are paid monthly, and Congress has not appropriated the money. Mr. Trump could stop the checks.Insurers can still choose to leave in the coming weeks if they decide there is too much confusion about what will happen next year, especially if they are asked to lock in prices that assume government funding without a guarantee, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThere are so many unknowns,\u201d she said.Follow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DeVos Abandons Plan to Allow One Company to Service Federal Student Loans", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cBy starting afresh and pursuing a truly modern loan servicing environment, we have a chance to turn what was a good plan into a great one,\u201d Ms. DeVos said.Most students who borrow for college use loans from the federal government to finance their studies. The Education Department outsources the work of servicing those loans \u2014 sending monthly bills, collecting payments and dealing with borrowers\u2019 questions \u2014 to nine outside contractors. Their contracts expire in 2019.But the department\u2019s winner-take-all plan prompted a broad outcry from consumer advocates, lawmakers, and even the industry itself, which is accustomed to splitting up the government\u2019s lucrative contracts for student loan collection among a number of entrenched vendors.Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said that legislative action was needed to \u201cprevent any one student loan servicer from becoming so large it poses a risk to taxpayers.\u201d He was joined by another Republican, James Lankford of Oklahoma, and two Democrats, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\u201cMaintaining choice and competition amongst student loan servicers is the best way to ensure they will continue improving services for student borrowers,\u201d Mr. Blunt said in a statement. He called the department\u2019s change of course \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201dAfter canceling the contract solicitation, Ms. DeVos said that her department would still have a new system in place by 2019, when the existing servicing contracts expire, but she offered few specifics. A detailed plan, she said, will be developed under A. Wayne Johnson, the new leader of the agency\u2019s Federal Student Aid office.Mr. Johnson, who now oversees the federal loans held by 42 million borrowers, was until recently the chief executive of a company that makes private student loans.The new loan service system his office is developing will be \u201ca customer support system that is as capable as any in the private sector,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe will take the best ideas and capabilities available and put them to work for Americans with student loans.\u201dFour vendors, all among the department\u2019s current servicers, had remained in the running for the now-canceled contract: Navient, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (known as P.H.E.A.A.), and Nelnet and Great Lakes Educational Loan Services (which submitted a joint bid).Keith New, a spokesman for P.H.E.A.A., said that the company supported \u201cany changes to the process that results in better services to borrowers, students and families.\u201d A Navient spokeswoman said that the company was looking forward to participating in the new process.Any new system that the Education Department devises would affect millions of people. Loan servicers have tremendous power to guide borrowers through an often bewildering thicket of federal loan repayment options. Some plans stretch payment periods out as long as 30 years, and others help qualifying students get a portion of their debt forgiven.Twitter: @StacyCowleyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Passes F.D.A. Funding and \u2018Right to Try\u2019 Drug Bills", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to finance the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the measure for President Trump and tapping drug manufacturers once again to help pay for the federal review of prescription drugs and medical devices.The 94-to-1 vote came just hours after the Senate passed a separate bill expanding access to experimental treatments for people with terminal illnesses. This bill, the Right to Try Act, will now go to the House, where more than three dozen lawmakers have endorsed similar legislation.Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill reauthorizing user fees to pay for the review of medical devices, brand-name drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars, which are copycat versions of costly biologic drugs made from living organisms.The House approved the user fee bill by voice vote on July 12.The vote on Thursday capped an often frustrating seven months for Republicans, who had hoped to churn out reams of conservative legislation with their control of both chambers and the White House.Since the failure of the Senate\u2019s health care repeal bill last week, lawmakers have seemed resigned to more incremental successes.\u201cWe\u2019re passing critical legislation, we\u2019re confirming nominees to important positions,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said from the Senate floor on Thursday, citing a series of veterans bills and the confirmation this week of a new F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.In a late burst of activity before a monthlong summer break, the Senate on Thursday confirmed more than 60 of President Trump\u2019s nominees.They included former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas to be the next ambassador to NATO, David J. Kautter to be the top tax policy official at the Treasury and Dr. Jerome M. Adams to be surgeon general of the United States.Yet, even on their final day in session, lawmakers were reminded of the often uncomfortable marriage between Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress.Mr. Trump lashed out over a bill \u2014 which he signed grudgingly this week \u2014 to sanction Russia for meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election and for its aggression toward its neighbors.The legislation also limits Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to lift or suspend the sanctions himself.The measure, which the administration sought to block as it moved through the Capitol in recent weeks, is among the most significant accomplishments of this Congress.Some senators are also maneuvering in response to White House criticism of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into ties between people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit and Russia.On Thursday, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, introduced legislation that would allow for judicial review if a special counsel were removed.The F.D.A. bill, which passed overwhelmingly in both houses, was a struggle.Lawmakers spent more than a year forging a consensus among Republicans, Democrats, F.D.A. officials and drug and device companies.\u201cThis is a bill that\u2019s been done the right way,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, in a subtle dig at Republican leaders who bypassed the committee and Democrats in a failed push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of the way the Senate is supposed to work.\u201dThe food and drug agency depends on user fees to finance more than a quarter of its budget and to speed the approval of drugs while maintaining strict safety standards.The bill includes a proposal by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, intended to prevent huge, unjustified price increases on decades-old prescription medicines that have no competition.The legislation directs the agency to speed the review of generic drug applications when products on the market have little or no competition.The F.D.A. bill also includes new requirements that could increase the number of cancer drugs for children.Under the bill, manufacturers of new drugs for adult cancer must provide data to the government on how the drugs could also be used to treat cancer in children.\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen, for example, that a drug developed for lung cancer in adults is also effective in treating a cancer of the nervous system in children under age 10,\u201d said Nancy F. Goodman, the executive director of Kids v. Cancer, an advocacy group.Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, said: \u201cOver the last 20 years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved roughly 190 new cancer treatments for adults but just three new treatments for children. The F.D.A. saw that gap, and they have asked us to close it.\u2019\u2019The \u201cright to try\u201d bill, introduced by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, aims to establish a new pathway for terminally ill patients to gain access to experimental drugs that have not been approved by the F.D.A.These patients are often extremely ill and unable to participate in clinical trials, or have no other treatment options.Under current law, drug companies can already provide access to patients outside of clinical trials under a program known as expanded access or compassionate use.The F.D.A. says it approves about 99 percent of compassionate use requests.But companies sometimes refuse, fearing that the results could be used against them by the F.D.A.In some cases, drug makers fear they could be sued by patients who say they have been injured by unapproved drug products.The bill would establish national standards and rules to help channel drugs still under development to terminally ill patients.It would also shield pharmaceutical companies and doctors from some of the legal risks of providing drugs that have not been approved by the agency.Companies that manufacture such drugs and doctors who prescribe them would generally be protected unless they engaged in \u201creckless or willful misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence\u201d or intentionally harmed a patient.\u201cThese are real people facing their mortality with no hope,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Opponents of the bill say there is a difference between dying comfortably and dying horribly, suffering pain and other side effects of an unapproved drug.Public Citizen, a consumer group, said the bill would \u201cprovide false hope to patients\u201d and undermine the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to supervise the use of experimental drug products.Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Follow @NYTHealth on Twitter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alice Waters on Sex, Drugs and Sustainable Agriculture", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Alice Waters took LSD only once. She spent most of the night floating near the ceiling, ignoring the molecules moving in the wood grain of the floorboards.Of course it was the best. This is Alice Waters, for whom the provenance of everything she puts in her mouth is paramount.Ms. Waters wrote the book, which Clarkson Potter will publish on Sept. 5, reluctantly. It is the last in a three-book deal she signed more than a decade ago, and the least collaborative of the dozen books that bear her name. To produce it, she spent a year telling stories to Bob Carrau, a writer and longtime family friend. Cristina Mueller, a writer who once worked as her assistant, took dictation.Sprinkled with photographs, the book traces Ms. Waters\u2019s years as a European backpacker smitten with France and as a young radical cooking for the Bay Area\u2019s antiwar intelligentsia. It ends the night the enthusiastic but very green cook opened her tiny, fixed-price French restaurant.But for Ms. Waters, now 73 and still flitting through the kitchen at Chez Panisse to snag bites of prosciutto and ordering that the dining room shades be lifted to better capture the late afternoon California light, the book is something of a mike drop.Although she has never been afraid of ridicule, Ms. Waters says she has entered a phase in which neither praise nor criticism mean all that much to her.\u201cI feel reassured about the content because it is what I experienced,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t not be honest.\u201dShe drives an Audi (the cover to the center console is missing), often calling her assistant to determine the best route through the Bay Area\u2019s brutal traffic. Her few concessions to fame include a prime parking spot on Saturdays at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about making money,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was never the goal.\u201dStill, Ms. Waters has not set foot in a conventional grocery store for 25 years. She remains devoted to the idea that all food should be organic, beautiful and eaten communally.That approach, which once seemed strident and economically tone deaf, has seeped into everyday food culture. Ms. Waters\u2019s image has softened into that of a grandmotherly sage whose wisdom young people especially seem eager to hear.Ms. Waters is the reason restaurants started naming farms on menus and serving mesclun salads and American-made goat cheese.Yet she continues to play a kind of small ball that, over the years, has proved powerful. She has never expanded Chez Panisse to other cities, or jumped fully into celebrity in ways that could have promoted her agenda. Rather, she prefers to personally cajole every politician, journalist and philanthropist she meets.But even in Berkeley, Ms. Waters\u2019s ideas haven\u2019t been realized. Although her foundation paid for a chef to engineer a radical change in the district\u2019s food program, Berkeley schools still don\u2019t serve food that meets her standards.Ms. Waters hates the word \u201cscaling,\u201d calling it a fast-food-culture term.\u201cI leveraged myself in the best of all possible ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI have given a philosophy of food which I learned from the French to everybody who works at the restaurant, and they take those values and make them their own.\u201dShe remains singularly focused on what seems impossible in the current political climate: giving all American children free organic food at school and tying it into the curriculum. \u201cFeeding children is a moral issue,\u201d she said.To that end, she is pondering new ways to raise money through taxes, or from investors like Jeff Bezos. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a letter to him,\u201d she said.She sees parallels between the state of politics today and the battles of 50 years ago, but her strategy is not to fight directly.\u201cNow is not the time,\u201d she said over dinner in the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. \u201cWe\u2019re like the French underground. We are passing notes to each other. But soon there will be something, an event, and we will come forward together. No one knows how powerful we are. We are vigilantes.\u201dMs. Waters ordered a couple of salads, one built with arugula and prosciutto and another of purslane, cucumbers and Charentais melon. A dish of roasted Monterey Bay squid came to the table, along with a tangle of hand-cut, herbed noodles with chanterelles and thyme.She asked a waiter to fill her glass with ros\u00e9 and then not bring any more. More than a glass or two makes her too sleepy, she said. Not as in the old days, which she writes about in the book with lighthearted relish.Ms. Waters describes drunken high school romps in the back seats of cars and subsequent pregnancy scares, a love of men and drink so powerful it got her kicked out of a college sorority on morals charges, and trips across Europe that did as much to provoke her culinary awakening as her sexual one.She approaches other revelations with more sobriety.

{"Headline": "A Storm Forces Houston, the Limitless City, to Consider Its Limits", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Not long after a pair of New York real estate speculators founded this city on the banks of a torpid bayou in the 1830s, every home and every business flooded. Though settlers tried draining their humid, swampy, sweltering surroundings, the inundations came again and again, with 16 major floods in the city\u2019s first century.And yet somehow, improbably, Houston not only survived but prospered \u2014 and it sprawled omnivorously, becoming the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city and perhaps its purest model of untrammeled growth.But Harvey\u2019s staggering flooding is raising very un-Houstonian questions about whether there are, in fact, limits to the Houston model of perpetual growth, and whether humans can push nature only so far before nature pushes back with catastrophic force.Though its breakneck development culture and lax regulatory environment have been lauded for giving working people affordable housing \u2014 and thus a shot at the American dream \u2014 many experts and residents say that the developers\u2019 encroachment into the wetlands and prairies that used to serve Houston as natural sponges has inevitably exacerbated the misery that the city is suffering today.\u201cThere could have been ways to have more green space and more green infrastructure over the years, and it just didn\u2019t work that way, because it was fast and furious,\u201d said Phil Bedient, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Rice University. Many developments were not built with enough open land or enough detention areas to take in floodwaters, Dr. Bedient said. \u201cIt\u2019s been known for years how to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cit just costs the developers more money to do it that way.\u201dGreater Houston has always been a precarious place for a boomtown. It sprawls across a flat coastal plain, crisscrossed by slow-moving bayous, with clay soils that do not easily absorb water. The average annual rainfall is 48 inches. For years, locals kept track of the hurricanes brewing in the Gulf of Mexico with magnetic maps hung in their kitchens.In fact, it was a bold spate of post-storm improvisation that helped truly put Houston on the map. In 1900, a Category 4 hurricane virtually leveled Galveston, the nearby coastal port city. At least 6,000 people were killed. The fear of another direct hit like that helped spur the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel, a 50-mile waterway completed in 1914 that allowed ships to come up from the Gulf of Mexico to Houston, a relatively safer inland port.But Houston continued to go underwater again and again, with a particularly costly flood in 1929 and another in 1935. In response, the state legislature, in 1937, created the Harris County Flood Control District, in an effort to finally build a modern flood-control system. Eventually, with federal assistance, two huge projects, the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, were constructed to protect downtown from flooding.The city grew rapidly in the postwar years, and in an effort to control storm water and direct the runoff to the Gulf of Mexico, two key bayous through the city were channelized \u2014 essentially converted to concrete culverts \u2014 while a third was widened, Dr. Bedient said. A network of channels \u2014 1,500 of them, today totaling 2,500 miles \u2014 were built to move storm runoff out of neighborhoods and down to the sea.But in the end, they may have provided a false sense of security. \u201cAnd so the building just went rampant, and there weren\u2019t many controls,\u201d Dr. Bedient said. \u201cWe had no zoning. It was like the Wild West, and you just built housing subdivision after housing subdivision up close to the bayous, up close to the channels.\u201dBy the 1980s, Dr. Bedient said, officials came to realize that the system could not handle big rainfalls: the green space that could have absorbed much of the water from a big storm was now paved over with parking lots, houses, churches and malls.Developers both responded to and fueled the boom, often doing what they wanted in Texas\u2019 relatively laissez-faire regulatory climate. In 2015, the Houston Chronicle examined a sampling of permits issued to developers, and found that more than half the developers had failed to follow through on Army Corps of Engineers directives meant to mitigate the destruction of wetlands.Two years ago, Erin Kinney, a research scientist with the nonprofit Houston Advanced Research Center, wrote that 65 square miles of freshwater wetlands had been lost in the Houston-Galveston Bay region, largely because of development and sinking land, and that 30 percent of Harris County was covered with impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots and roofs.Much of the development in recent years has occurred on the Katy Prairie, a vast stretch of land west of town that was once covered in native grasses and wildflowers, a place where rainwater often pooled before soaking into the ground or slowly running into creeks and bayous.Gavin Smith, the director of the Coastal Resilience Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said some of the land in the Houston area had been made more vulnerable to flooding because of the amount of groundwater that had been pumped out of it. That, he said, actually caused the land to sink, a process called subsidence.Even before Harvey, Houstonians had become acutely aware that the flooding question was central to the discussion about their city\u2019s future \u2014 although political solutions have not always been easy to come by.Critics have debated the efficacy of regulations, dating to the 1980s, that require developers to build \u201cdetention ponds\u201d to store rain water.In 2010, city voters narrowly passed a major financing mechanism, ReBuild Houston, to improve roads and an out-of-date drainage system. But some have bridled at the idea of the new taxes and fees involved, and the program has been the subject of at least two lawsuits.New, devastating floods kept coming \u2014 on Memorial Day in 2015, and in April 2016 (the so-called \u201cTax Day\u201d flood) \u2014 killing a total of 16 people and causing more than $1 billion in damage. They were major local news at the time: \u201cIs this the new normal?\u201d the Chronicle asked in an April 2016 headline.The way forward is not clear. In May 2016, Mayor Sylvester Turner appointed Houston\u2019s first \u201cflood czar,\u201d Stephen Costello, an engineer and former at-large City Council member. Mr. Costello was too busy with the unfolding crisis on Wednesday to comment for this article.Gerald E. Galloway, an internationally recognized expert on flood risk management and water policy at the University of Maryland, said that Greater Houston could benefit from effective regional planning, with the patchwork of local governments working together to take into account their developments\u2019 effects on their neighbors.\u201cBut that\u2019s not the style in Texas,\u201d Dr. Galloway said. \u201cYou drive and drive and drive, and you\u2019re going from one community to the next. How do you get all those communities to agree on what needs to be done?\u201dA number of experts have said that local governments will have to consider buying out homeowners who live in flooded areas, returning the land to green space that can absorb the floodwaters. But as Katrina proved, such efforts can generate tremendous pushback.And if the region begins to put stricter regulations on building, there is a chance that one of Houston\u2019s great lures \u2014 affordable housing \u2014 may disappear. This is a concern for Joel Kotkin, the urban theorist and author who has been a great champion of Houston\u2019s lax regulation policies.\u201cIf you put the kind of super-strict planning shackles on Houston, that would be the way to kill it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you live in a hot, humid, flat space if it was expensive?\u201dLike many others, he was quick to praise Houston\u2019s energy and optimism, and said the city would recover. The Texas author Larry McMurtry, a former Houston resident, agreed.\u201cHouston will accept anybody who\u2019s got hustle \u2014 it respects energy more than any place,\u201d he said. \u201cHouston is a very resilient city, and it will overcome.\u201dManny Fernandez reported from Houston and Richard Fausset from Atlanta.

This week, in the time it took her to type out an Instagram screed, Louise Linton transformed herself from the Treasury secretary\u2019s wife to a Real Housewife of the Treasury.She zipped around on a speedboat in an Italian lake. She sipped wine at a restaurant overlooking the Louvre. She lounged in a very nice-looking pool with a very nice-looking giant inflatable swan, a tiny Chihuahua nestled in her arms.Along the way, Ms. Linton tagged and touted a parade of designers. \u201c#TomFord.\u201d \u201c#Valentinorockstudheels.\u201d \u201c#HermesScarf.\u201dThe debacle started after Ms. Linton took a day trip to Kentucky with Mr. Mnuchin and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Ms. Linton, a spun-sugar blond who cuts an over-the-top glamorous figure in Washington, posted an Instagram photo of herself, Hermes bag on one arm and a Hermes scarf on the other, disembarking from a government jet. Her message contained praise for Kentucky: \u201c#nicest #people #beautiful,\u201d she wrote in Trumpian, hash-tagged prose.As happens on social media, a stranger rained on Ms. Linton\u2019s photo op by posting a mean comment.\u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable,\u201d Jenni Miller, a 45-year-old mother of three who lives in Oregon, wrote under the photograph.Ms. Linton\u2019s response was not quite as rose-colored as her original photo caption had been.\u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?\u201d Ms. Linton wrote.She wasn\u2019t done.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u2018trip\u2019 than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.\u201dAnd then, Ms. Linton, fresh from a European vacation punctuated by rides at SoulCycle and trips to the Hamptons, delivered a blow to the offending commoner: \u201cYou\u2019re adorably out of touch.\u201d\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t made her account private, I would have written back with a very snide Marie Antoinette joke,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Ms. Linton is not the first woman associated with Mr. Trump to earn a comparison to Marie Antoinette. As protests erupted around the country over her father\u2019s proposed travel ban in January, an Instagram photo of Ivanka Trump wearing a silver dress was quickly dubbed the \u201clet them eat cake\u201d photograph. Ms. Linton also is not the only woman in the president\u2019s orbit who is dripping in diamonds and draped in Chanel.But she is the first to be bluntly unapologetic about her luxurious lifestyle, one that affords her a comfortable, swan-shaped perch to view the country\u2019s infighting.The other difference, of course, is that Ms. Linton is not a White House official, nor an elected one. She is an actress whose most recent work includes a role as a character named Betty on a 2016 movie called \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201d She often shares photos of her past roles on Instagram. In July, she shared an image of a 2007 \u201cCSI: NY\u201d appearance. Her character in that episode was dressed as Marie Antoinette.When in Washington, Ms. Linton said that she and Mr. Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a former Hollywood film financier, enjoy exploring the city. \u201cDC Architecture reminds me of the architecture in Edinburgh where I was raised,\u201d she wrote in an email in June.The pair are often spotted dining at Cafe Milano or the Trump International Hotel, where in late July they had dinner with the president. Ms. Linton has readily found her place in a circle of distinctly Washington socialites, including Amy Baier, the wife of Bret Baier, the Fox News host, and Abeer Al Otaiba, the wife of Yousef al-Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador.But the scrutiny over their lifestyle follows them. Even on day trips.A Treasury Department official said that the Mnuchins had, in fact, reimbursed the government for the Kentucky trip. And Ms. Linton\u2019s label-loving shout-out was not rewarded with free products or compensation, at least not in the case of her \u201c#valentinorockstudheels\u201d and \u201c#valentino\u201d tags, a spokeswoman for the brand said in an email on Tuesday.Hours later, Ms. Linton did something rare for someone associated with Trump administration: She said she was sorry.\u201cI apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response,\u201d Ms. Linton said in a statement relayed through her publicist. \u201cIt was inappropriate and highly insensitive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A heavy desk, bookshelf and fireplace \u2014 all made out of steel \u2014 lined one wall. Still to come was a metal trunk.\u201cIf I had to go in a space capsule because I couldn\u2019t live on earth anymore, I\u2019d want it to feel like a home,\u201d said the capsule\u2019s creator, the El Salvador-born Los Angeles artist Beatriz Cortez, who spot-welded the futuristic spacecraft and its furniture, giving them unexpected texture.Her steel panels have visible bumps that evoke the repujado metalwork of Spanish colonial artists. Elsewhere she added steel lumps that resemble river rocks \u2014 a basic construction material used by native cultures.\u201cWe always imagine indigenous people being part of our past,\u201d she said, on a break from installation. \u201cI wanted to imagine indigenous people as part of our future.\u201dSome, like Ms. Cortez, have created startling objects that offer portals into alternative worlds or mimic time machines. Others use the imagery of extraterrestrials to express something of the immigrant\u2019s alienating experience. Most engage in the speculative thinking long associated with science-fiction literature and film to explore social issues.\u201cA Latino science-fiction art project allows us to imagine otherwise and escape the paralyzing borders and anti-immigrant sentiment in this country,\u201d said Robb Hern\u00e1ndez, an English professor at the university who organized the show with two in-house curators. \u201cRather than being bound to our punishing gravity and our horizontal understanding of border-crossing, these artists are looking upward to imagine new notions of citizenship, boundaries, who belongs and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cRemember, in space we are all essentially aliens,\u201d he added.With $350,000 in funding from the J. Paul Getty Trust, \u201cMundos Alternos\u201d (\u201cAlternate Worlds\u201d) is the most expensive and research-intensive show that U.C. Riverside\u2019s art center has produced to date.This year\u2019s survey was inspired by the demographics of Los Angeles, where nearly half the population has Hispanic roots, making the area a cultural nexus. Nearby, in Riverside County, 47 percent of the population, and 29 percent of the university\u2019s students are Chicano or Latino.The Riverside curators decided to pursue a sci-fi theme to build on the university\u2019s large collection of science fiction and fantasy literature. They traveled to six countries and 11 American cities where they discovered a wide range of artworks, made mainly over the last 20 years, dealing with concerns including the politics of immigration and the dangers of military surveillance.Laura Molina\u2019s 2004 painting \u201cAmor Alien\u201d playfully takes on the challenges of interracial romance with a beautiful, green-skinned woman draped across the lap of a dashing white man. She looks asleep but as Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez points out, the man is even more disempowered \u2014 encased in a helmet that suggests he cannot breathe on his own while \u201cthe alien queen can survive on her own planet.\u201dThe show also features a towering, spiky headdress by the New York-based Salvadoran artist Guadalupe Maravilla (formerly known as Irvin Moraz\u00e1n), which fuses Mayan and futuristic imagery. He wore it during a performance walking across the Rio Grande in 2011, where the river separates the United States from Mexico. Tyler Stallings, one of the show\u2019s three curators, called the headdress an example of \u201ctechno-shamanism.\u201d\u201cIn the tradition of the science fiction genre, the straight white male scientist becomes the hero and the alien race is often represented as primitive,\u201d Mr. Stallings said. Here, many immigrant or so-called alien artists cast themselves as cosmic pioneers or explorers.Ms. Cortez\u2019s space capsule is a vehicle for sharing her archival research into California\u2019s often-invisible racist past and colonial history. Inside the capsule is a steel helmet that displays, on a smartphone, images relating to Paul Popenoe, who in the 1920s advocated the now-debunked theory of eugenics. The metal tent that tops her structure nods to the experience of homelessness and forced migration today.Over the last two years Ms. Cortez learned how to weld for this project and related pieces; she says such resourcefulness is par for the course for an immigrant. She recalled finding work translating math books into Braille when she first arrived in Arizona from El Salvador in 1989 \u2014 she knew no Braille and had to learn on the job. After getting her Ph.D. in literature and cultural studies, as well as an M.F.A., she is now a professor in the Central American Studies department at California State University, Northridge, as well as a working artist.As Joanna Szupinska-Myers, the show\u2019s other curator, sees it, Ms. Cortez\u2019s work gets at \u201cthe vulnerability and bravery of the immigrant, making you think about someone who picks up and moves to another country with just a few things.\u201dThe curators at U.C. Riverside are thinking about how to reach potential visitors. \u201cOne of the biggest questions is how do we do more than just import objects to our museum,\u201d Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cWhat are our responsibilities to the artists and also the broader Latino and Latin American communities?\u201dThey are preparing some bilingual wall texts and a weekly Spanish-language tour. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, who specializes in queer theory, is teaching a fall course tied to the exhibition. He added that all the sci-fi research has inspired the topic of his next book: \u201ctrans-planetary performance art.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He is believed to have used several aliases. He was denied asylum at the beginning of this year.Police and witnesses say that Mr. Mechkah used two knives to attack women in the center of Turku, a city of 180,000 in southwestern Finland, on Friday afternoon.Two women, one in her mid-50s and the other in her early 30s, were killed; six other women were injured, along with two men who had tried to protect them. Mr. Mechkah was shot in the thigh.Police and intelligence agencies had gotten a tip about Mr. Mechkah earlier this year, warning that he might harbor extremist views, but the tip was not given priority because it was too vague to act on. He was not one of some 350 people whom Finnish authorities have been monitoring as potential security threats.The young man\u2019s defense lawyer, Kaarle Gummerus, said on Tuesday that his client had admitted to the rampage, but that investigators had not yet presented enough evidence to classify the case as a terrorist crime.\u201cThe event in Turku is the result of badly managed immigration in general, and lack of proper deportation legislation in particular,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAll rejected asylum seekers should be deported immediately.\u201dAs politicians spoke in Helsinki, the capital, the nation\u2019s attention was turned to Turku, about 100 miles to the west.Mr. Mechkah appeared in Southwest Finland District Court from his hospital bed; a white sheet covered his face and much of his body. He faces two charges of murder with terrorist intent, and eight charges of attempted murder with terrorist intent.It was not clear what Mr. Mechkah told the court, because journalists were not allowed to listen to testimony from the video feed; they were allowed to listen only to pronouncements by the judge and lawyers, and were repeatedly ushered in and out of the courtroom.Afterward, journalists shouted questions at Inspector Toyras, asking if Mr. Mechkah had expressed remorse, whether the attack was premeditated and whether he had visited the local mosque to pray shortly before the attack, as the Finnish press has reported.Inspector Toyras said that investigators had interrogated Mr. Mechkah once, and planned to interview him again on Wednesday. He said that it was a priority to determine whether the young man, who refused at first to answer questions after the attack, had accomplices.\u201cOf course, we are very interested in whether this was just an individual act, or if there is someone behind it, like a group,\u201d Inspector Toyras told reporters.Three other men have been arrested and appeared in court as part of the investigation. They were identified as Mohamed Bakier, 18; Ilyas Berrouh, 18; and Abdederrazak Essarioul, 28. A fifth man \u2014 identified as Mouad El Fatoyhy, 24 \u2014 was released on Tuesday.All the suspects are Moroccan, and at least two of them had sought asylum in Finland, in addition to Mr. Mechkah. Last year, 155 Moroccans applied for asylum in Finland, but only 20 applications were granted.The German news agency DPA reported that Mr. Mechkah used several false identities while in Germany, in late 2015 and early 2016, and once was charged with causing bodily harm. DPA said that Mr. Mechkah left the country without informing the authorities.At least two of the other suspects had spent time in Germany, DPA reported.The authorities said they were also searching for at least one possible suspect who is no longer in Finland. An international arrest warrant has been issued for that man, and Europol and Interpol were helping with the case, Inspector Toyras said.Mari-Leena Kuosa reported from Turku, Finland, and Sewell Chan from London.

{"Headline": "A Deal Breaker for Trump\u2019s Supporters? Nope. Not This Time, Either.", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Parson Hicks, a health care finance executive who supports President Trump, this past week has felt a little like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Mr. Trump says something. His opponents howl and then predict, with certainty, a point of no return.The last time this happened, she said, was in October with the notorious \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording of Mr. Trump talking lewdly about women. His opponents were sure he was finished. His supporters knew better.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the people who are currently outraged are the same people who have always been outraged,\u201d said Ms. Hicks, 35, a lifelong Republican who lives in Boston. \u201cThe media makes it seem like something has changed, when in reality nothing has.\u201dIt\u2019s an indication of what now seems an almost immutable law of the Trump presidency. There are signs that Mr. Trump\u2019s support among Republican leaders and some Republican voters is weakening. But in an increasingly tribal America, with people on the left and the right getting information from different sources and seeing the same facts in different ways, it reflects the way Mr. Trump has become in many ways both symbol and chief agitator of a divided nation.Moral outrage at Mr. Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville continues to glow white hot, but it has a largely partisan tinge.From Ms. Hicks\u2019s perspective, the president simply pointed out a fact: Leftists bore some responsibility for the violence, too. Of course, Nazis and white supremacists are bad, she said. But she does not believe Mr. Trump has any affinity for them. He said so himself. But she is exasperated that a significant part of the country seems to think otherwise. The week\u2019s frenzied headlines read to her like bulletins from another planet.\u201cI feel like I am in a bizarro universe where no one but me is thinking logically,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have gone so off the rails of what this conversation is about.\u201dMs. Hicks, who is black and grew up in Charlotte, N.C., welcomes the public soul-searching on the meaning of Confederate monuments. She believes that the statues were erected to intimidate black people and that they should be taken down. But instead of focusing on that, she sees opponents of Mr. Trump focusing on Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is not about me as a black person, and my history,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about this president and wanting to take him down because you don\u2019t like him.\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s departure was more noise that didn\u2019t mean much, she said. \u201cThe show is going to go on.\u201dMuch of what powers the love for Mr. Trump among his core supporters is his boxer\u2019s approach to the political class in Washington and to the news media, a group that in their eyes has approached them with a double standard and a sneering sense of superiority for years.Larry Laughlin, a retired businessman from a Minneapolis suburb, compares Mr. Trump to a high school senior who could \u201cwalk up to the table with the jocks and the cheerleaders and put them in their place.\u201d That is something that the \u201cnerds and the losers, whose dads are unemployed and moms are working in the cafeteria,\u201d could never do. Mr. Trump may be rich, he said, but actually belonged at the nerd table.\u201cThe guys who wouldn\u2019t like me wouldn\u2019t like Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys who were condescending to him were condescending to me.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m watching my uncle up there. Where me and Chuck Schumer \u2014 that\u2019s like going to the dentist,\u201d he added, referring to the Democratic leader in the Senate.Gregory Kline, 46, a lawyer in Severna Park, Md., who is a Republican, said he did not vote for Mr. Trump but understands that part of the president\u2019s support comes from fury at the left, particularly the media. When there is an attack by Muslim terrorists, for example, the media reaches for pundits who say most Muslims are good. But when it is a white supremacist, \u201cevery conservative is lumped in with him,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people are deaf and dumb and don\u2019t see it,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump\u2019s sometimes erratic behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s that they don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve heard rational people I really respect make the craziest apologies for this president because they are sick of getting beat on and they are happy he\u2019s fighting back.\u201dBut for many others, support is conditional. (Mr. Trump\u2019s poll numbers have dropped considerably since he took office in January.) Michael Dye, a 52-year-old engineer who is the treasurer for the Republican Party in Annapolis, Md., said he was \u201ca bit stunned\u201d that Mr. Trump had not focused more on condemning what was a large neo-Nazi march through the middle of the University of Virginia, Mr. Dye\u2019s alma mater.\u201cAt best it is na\u00efve to think that the people showing up for the original protest were there simply because they were upset that this statue was being taken down,\u201d said Mr. Dye, who said he voted reluctantly for Mr. Trump.Of the chant \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d he said: \u201cYou can argue that it was 10 percent of the crowd. But there are those types in there and I\u2019ve got a problem with that and I wish he\u2019d specified that.\u201dEven with his reservations, Mr. Dye said he would still vote for Mr. Trump. He wants his party to hold the reins and steer policy, and if Mr. Trump is the only route to that, he will take it.Partisanship is now so deep that what we see depends entirely on who is looking. So when Mr. Trump said there had been \u201cviolence on both sides,\u201d Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 heard a dangerous moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and the people who opposed them. But for many Trump supporters, his words appealed to a basic sense of fairness.When those who were horrified tried to convince those who were not, it did not go well.\u201cEverybody is like, how can you not see it, he\u2019s a total white supremacist, a total Nazi,\u201d said Debra Skoog, a retired executive in Minneapolis and a lifelong Democrat who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t see it that way. I don\u2019t find his language as incriminating as some people do.\u201dYascha Mounk, a political scientist at Harvard University who writes about democracy, said partisanship in the United States today is dangerously deep.\u201cIt\u2019s now at a stage where a lot of Americans have such a loyalty to their political tribe that they are willing to go along with deeply undemocratic behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cIf their guy says, \u2018I think we should push back the election for a few years because of a possible terrorist attack,\u2019 I fear that a significant part of the population would go along with it.\u201d\u201cPeople who see this stuff going down the memory hole as quickly as it is happening feel unsettled by it,\u201d Mr. Kline said. \u201cThe left doesn\u2019t realize that the reaction a lot of people would have is to sit back and say, \u2018Wait a minute, what\u2019s going on here?\u2019 \u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Proving Uber\u2019s Real Value", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe litany of corporate scandals at Uber has raised questions about the way the company is run, led to a lawsuit by a main investor, and prompted fund managers to cut their estimates for the price of shares.The ride-hailing company\u2019s gross bookings in its second quarter this year increased 17 percent from the previous quarter to $8.7 billion. The amount of money it earned after paying its drivers jumped to $1.75 billion from $1.5 billion. Its losses narrowed. Trip requests increased 150 percent from a year earlier.Uber has been valued at about $68.5 billion, which makes it the most highly valued private start-up in the world.But many investors will be watching for more clarity on Uber\u2019s worth.The company\u2019s board voted to move forward with preliminary proposals by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, and by Dragoneer Investment Group to buy shares in the company. The board is also considering an offer from a consortium led by Shervin Pishevar, an early Uber investor, to buy shares.Related Reading:Here\u2019s what the poll of 502 investors (who had at least $50,000 invested in the market, with half of them having investments of more than $250,000) found:\u2022 Mr. Immelt, the former chief executive of General Electric, was viewed favorably by 47 percent of respondents. Compare that rating with how they thought others did in leading their companies: 79 percent for Steve Jobs, 69 percent for Mark Zuckerberg and 36 percent for the most recent Uber chief executive, Travis Kalanick.\u2022 Thirty-five percent of respondents said Uber should pick Mr. Immelt as its next chief executive. About 53 percent said they were undecided.\u2022 Thirty-three percent said Mr. Immelt would do a better job than Mr. Kalanick did as Uber\u2019s chief executive. Just 9 percent of respondents said they thought that Mr. Kalanick would be the superior leader.\u2022 One in four respondents said that Uber should bring back Mr. Kalanick as chief executive, while one in three said that Mr. Kalanick should not return.Mathew Martoma, once a portfolio manager for Steven A. Cohen, was convicted in 2014 of what prosecutors called the most lucrative insider trading scheme of all time.He has since argued that the jury in his trial may not have been properly instructed and that the evidence presented wasn\u2019t enough to support a conviction.The decision comes as some relief for the United States Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. Under Preet Bharara, the office embarked on a sweeping investigation of insider trading that led to a wave of convictions. But many were undone by a Supreme Court decision, United States v. Newman, that effectively raised the bar for evidence needed to convict someone for insider trading.Mr. Martoma had been relying on the Newman case to buttress his appeal. But the panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit looked to a newer decision by the Supreme Court, Salman v. United States, that effectively lowered the bar for evidence once more.But one of the three Second Circuit judges dissented, which may set the stage for Mr. Martoma\u2019s lawyers to ask for the entire appellate court to consider the appeal.Amazon and Whole Foods are nearly ready to combine.Federal antitrust regulators approved Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, and Whole Foods shareholders approved the $13.4 billion deal.The deal was not expected to be blocked because there was little overlap in Amazon and Whole Foods businesses. Amazon\u2019s grocery delivery business still accounts for only a small share of total grocery spending in the United States. And while Whole Foods is a prominent presence, its share in the grocery market remains relatively small.Prosecutors have cast Lee Jae-yong, the heir to the Samsung empire, as a mastermind bent on breaking the law to protect his family\u2019s wealth and power. They have accused him of paying $38 million in bribes to maintain control of Samsung without paying taxes.Mr. Lee paints himself as a detached leader with little knowledge of the inner workings of his companies. He was too busy building global alliances to be involved in the day-to-day operations, Samsung says.The judgment comes after the South Korean public has soured on Samsung. Though the conglomerate is known around the world for its electronics, it is viewed by many at home as holding back the country and financing political corruption.Whatever the judge decides, it isn\u2019t likely to look good for the de facto leader of Samsung. \u201cIn the trial, you come away with the impression that he is incompetent or at least he didn\u2019t know his own company,\u201d Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book about Samsung, told The Times.Advertisement"}

Ehlers, a physicist and longtime Republican congressman from Michigan whose scientific background led him to embrace political positions at odds with those of his party, died on Aug. 15 at his home in Grand Rapids, Mich. He was 83.Rick Treur, Dr. Ehlers\u2019s former campaign manager, said the cause was Alzheimer\u2019s disease.A nuclear physicist and college professor before he entered politics, Dr. Ehlers was elected to Michigan\u2019s third district in 1993 and retired in 2011. Scientists were, and remain, a rarity in elected politics in America; he said he was the first research physicist ever elected to Congress.Dr. Ehlers was part of the wave of Republicans that took control of the House and Senate after the 1994 elections, leaving President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, without a majority in Congress for the rest of his presidency.Dr. Ehlers was a fiscal conservative who worked to enact Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s policy agenda, known as the \u201cContract with America\u201d \u2014 an ambitious set of proposals that often led to compromises with the executive branch. He stood with his party on key issues like balancing the budget, limiting the size of the federal government and repealing a ban on assault weapons.But Dr. Ehlers often disagreed with Republicans on education and the environment. He voted against cuts to the National Science Foundation and a proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, both efforts favored by Republicans. He voted for an increase in funding for a student loan program that many of them opposed.He led a comprehensive review of federal science policy; helped revamp standards for education in science, technology, engineering and math; and helped allocate $270 million to clean the Great Lakes. He also led the way in modernizing the House\u2019s internet presence and email system. His goal, he said, was to create something \u201cso simple that an adult can use it.\u201dDr. Ehlers coaxed his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reconsider scientific issues, like the cause of climate change, when data appeared to contradict their beliefs.\u201cI just had to go around, continuously talking to people about issues and educating them,\u201d Dr. Ehlers told the NPR program \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d in 2012. \u201cIt took an immense amount of my time.\u201dIn one instance, Mr. Treur, the former campaign manager, said, Dr. Ehlers argued in favor of efforts to slow the spread of zebra mussels, an invasive mollusk that had colonized American waters. At one point he had to correct a colleague, who exclaimed, \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to spend money researching the muscles of zebras!\u201dMisunderstandings like these led Dr. Ehlers to urge others in the scientific community to engage in politics.\u201cYou can grumble all you want about those idiots in the Congress,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not helping to educate the idiots, you\u2019re not doing your job.\u201dVernon James Ehlers was born on Feb. 6, 1934, in Pipestone, Minn. His mother, the former Alice Doorn, was a homemaker, and his father, the Rev. John W. C. Ehlers, was the pastor of a Christian Reformed church in Pipestone. Dr. Ehlers said that his faith\u2019s commitment to service helped persuade him to enter politics.He graduated from high school in Celeryville, Ohio, then studied for three years at Calvin College in Grand Rapids before completing his undergraduate degree in physics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956. He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics there four years later.Dr. Ehlers spent the next few years teaching at Berkeley before returning to Calvin in 1966. He also worked as a volunteer science adviser for his congressman at the time, Gerald R. Ford, the future president.Dr. Ehlers served as a state representative and state senator before he won a special election to fill the seat of Representative Paul B. Henry, who had died of a brain tumor in 1993.He married Johanna Meulink in 1958. She survives him, as do two sons, Brian and Todd; two daughters, Heidi Rienstra and Marla Ehlers; two sisters, Frances Engle and Henrietta Buurma; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.Despite Dr. Ehlers\u2019s efforts, scientists remain a minuscule part of the Congress, according to the Congressional Research Services. Aside from a smattering of engineers and medical doctors, there are only three members of Congress \u2014 among 540 representatives and senators \u2014 with backgrounds in science: a chemist, a microbiologist and a lone physicist, Dr. Foster.Follow @dslotnik on Twitter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Looks to Address Inequality With Executive Pay Measures", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Worried by a long-term rise in inequality, Britain announced on Tuesday a series of measures aimed at increasing transparency over executive compensation, hoping to ramp up pressure on companies that offer lavish salaries for bosses but restrict pay for regular employees.The proposals include plans to force all publicly listed companies to publish their wage ratio, comparing their chief executive\u2019s salary with that of the average worker, as well as the creation of a register that \u201cnames and shames\u201d firms that faced shareholder opposition over executive pay levels.In much of the Western world, public anger is growing over what critics say are excessive wages for senior business leaders. That has helped contribute to a populist backlash in many countries, as the gap between the salaries of employees and their managers has widened markedly.But it has become an increasing point of contention here.In one case, investors in the energy company BP protested against the $19.6 million compensation package awarded to the company\u2019s chief executive, Robert W. Dudley, in 2016 \u2014 a majority voted against the deal in a nonbinding vote. And the salary of Martin Sorrell, the head of the advertising giant WPP, regularly attracts pushback from shareholders. Mr. Sorrell made 48 million pounds, or about $62 million, last year.That expanding gulf has spurred the government\u2019s proposals, which it plans to put into effect by June. In addition to forcing the publication of pay ratios, officials would set up a public register listing companies that faced opposition on pay packages from at least a fifth of shareholders.Listed businesses would be pushed to improve employee representation on their boards, by assigning a nonexecutive director to represent workers, creating an employee advisory council or nominating a director from the work force. There is no punishment for failing to do so, but companies would have to announce why they had not followed the requirements.The changes are not entirely unique. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 required publicly traded corporations to begin providing standard information on pay disparities in 2018 (though the S.E.C. said in February that it might reconsider the measure). And in Germany, employees are often well represented on the supervisory boards of large companies.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Still, unions and analysts criticized the measures, arguing that they lacked teeth.Dirk Jenter, an associate professor of finance at the London School of Economics who has surveyed executive compensation, said he had doubts about whether the measures would make much difference and warned that some might even be counterproductive.In particular, companies that are in labor-intensive industries or that employ large numbers of people in lower-paid jobs, like supermarkets, would look worse than investment banks, where average worker pay is higher.\u201cWe\u2019re punishing the companies that employ a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Jenter said. \u201cIt in essence says you have a choice between employing low-paid employees in your companies \u2014 janitors, cleaners, drivers \u2014 or outsourcing the services to other companies or machines.\u201dGreg Campbell, a partner in the employment department at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, said the efforts to increase worker representation were also relatively mild, because company directors in Britain are already required to consider employee interests.\u201cA diversity of views is always worth having,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it is enough to really shift the dial.\u201dStill, some are hopeful that the measures will raise awareness of worsening inequality.\u201cThis is obviously a more voluntary nudge approach to improve corporate governance, but I think there is no magic bullet,\u201d said Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \u201cRegulation can only take you so far because a lot of these issues are around organizational culture and leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Washington Tries to Protect Tech, China Could Fight Back", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration moves to take on China over intellectual property, Washington will find it has limited firepower. Beijing has a strong grip on American technology companies, and global trade rules could favor China.But China can play a strong defense. The country has broad latitude, under special rules it negotiated with the World Trade Organization, to maintain restrictions within its market.\u201cThe problem is that U.S. trade negotiators agreed to provisions allowing China to limit market access for U.S. companies unless they engaged in joint ventures,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which Congress created to monitor the relationship between the two countries.\u201cPotential Chinese partners demand the family jewels,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies can say no, but too many give in to Chinese pressure to make a quick buck.\u201dThe current trade frictions trace back to the Clinton administration.When China was entering the W.T.O. in 1999 and 2000, American negotiators gave Beijing some leeway, a position later supported by the administration of George W. Bush. As a developing country, China was allowed extra protections, such as requirements that companies in critical industries work with Chinese partners. China, in return, promised to shed the extra rules gradually as its economy matured.But Beijing did not open up, even as China evolved into an economic powerhouse. Quite the opposite has happened under President Xi Jinping, who has pursued a more nationalistic agenda than his reform-minded predecessors.China now sees the technology sector as a critical piece of its industrial policy \u2014 a policy that Beijing is aggressively enlisting American tech giants to support and that the leadership will most likely go all out to protect.Beijing\u2019s demands have been partly driven by security concerns, particularly after disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, of electronic spying by the United States on China\u2019s rapid military buildup.China has also been explicit about its economic motives, seeking to dominate fast-growing global industries that could create millions of well-paid jobs for a generation of increasingly well-educated young Chinese.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.In several cases, China\u2019s strategy to control technology approaches the kind of oversight most countries reserve for industries serving the military or government.In the chip sector, a major initiative intended to lift Chinese capabilities has drafted America\u2019s biggest makers of the electronic brains that run everything from smartphones to driverless cars. Over the past four years, America\u2019s largest chip companies have entered into a dizzying network of partnerships unlike anything they have anywhere else.Qualcomm works with a company in southwest China to develop server chips. In 2014, Intel signed agreements with two Chinese chip makers, Spreadtrum and Rockchip, to give it a leg up in the market for China\u2019s smartphones and tablets. Last year, Intel agreed to a partnership with the influential Tsinghua University in China as part of a bid to make server chips that match local specifications.American technology companies can find themselves at a serious disadvantage in China unless they agree to cooperate with government-linked Chinese businesses.Take cloud computing, the fast-growing business of leasing computer power to companies. Chinese laws require foreign companies to join with local partners and allow them only a minority stake. International businesses are also blocked from branding such services under their own names.Both Microsoft and Amazon, dominant forces in cloud computing in the United States, have local partnerships in China. By contrast, China\u2019s e-commerce giant Alibaba operates two data centers in the United States without any partner.Another rule calls for data about Chinese consumers or business operations to be stored in China. Apple and Amazon recently set up data centers in China, again with local partners, to store more customer information in the country.Against that backdrop, the call for trade action is attracting bipartisan support.China can make its own play under global trade rules. Beijing can quickly demand binding arbitration \u2014 and could have a good chance of winning. China was allowed into the W.T.O. with very few limits on its ability to regulate services or foreign investment, two categories in which China was fairly weak when it entered the organization in 2001.If China did win a W.T.O. case, it would then have the right to restrict American exports to the same extent that the United States restricts Chinese imports.China consistently exports four times as much to the United States as it imports. Even so, China could penalize American companies like Apple and Starbucks that have very large operations that produce and sell in China with minimal imports from the United States.\u201cU.S. negotiators, I think, basically dropped the ball,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a longtime trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to the rules on services that were negotiated when China entered the W.T.O. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think China was very important.\u201dOn Twitter follow Keith Bradsher, @KeithBradsher, and Paul Mozur, @PaulMozurPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson Suggests North Korea May Soon Be Ready for Talks", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In some of the most conciliatory remarks to North Korea made by the Trump administration, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson complimented the government in Pyongyang for going more than two weeks without shooting any missiles or blowing up any nuclear bombs.\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that the regime in Pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, suggesting that the brief pause in testing may be enough to meet the administration\u2019s preconditions for talks.\u201cWe hope that this is the beginning of the signal we\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cperhaps we\u2019re seeing our pathway to sometime in the near future of having some dialogue. We need to see more on their part. But I want to acknowledge the steps they\u2019ve taken so far.\u201dThat was the carrot. As for the stick, the Trump administration announced new sanctions against China and Russia on Tuesday as part of its campaign to pressure North Korea to stop its development of nuclear weapons and missiles.The two moves are part of the Trump administration\u2019s dual-track strategy for taming the nuclear threat from North Korea \u2014 ratcheting up economic pressure on the government through sanctions while simultaneously offering a diplomatic pathway to peace.That second approach has gradually softened in recent months. In his first trip to Seoul, South Korea, in March, Mr. Tillerson appeared to make North Korea\u2019s surrender of nuclear weapons a prerequisite for talks. At that time, he said that negotiations could \u201conly be achieved by denuclearizing, giving up their weapons of mass destruction,\u201d and that \u201conly then will we be prepared to engage them in talks.\u201dMr. Tillerson\u2019s remarks Tuesday were particularly noteworthy because they were made in a news conference that was otherwise devoted to discussing the Trump administration\u2019s new approach to the war in Afghanistan.Six systems that North Korea needs to master to achieve a long-sought goal: being able to reliably hit the United States.The new sanctions issued by the Treasury Department affect six individuals and 10 organizations with financial ties to Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program. They represent a gradual increase in pressure on China, which has long frustrated the United States for economically supporting the regime in Pyongyang. Some 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade is with China.\u201cI think it\u2019s a significant action by the Trump administration,\u201d Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit group in Washington, said of the new round of sanctions.Tuesday\u2019s actions appeared to be part of a larger campaign to pressure individuals, businesses and countries with financial ties to North Korea, said Mr. Ruggiero, a former official in the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes at the Treasury. \u201cIt looks like the beginnings of a broad pressure campaign,\u201d Mr. Ruggiero said.Among the Chinese companies sanctioned on Tuesday is Mingzheng International Trading Limited, considered by the Treasury Department to be a \u201cfront company\u201d for North Korea\u2019s state-run Foreign Trade Bank, which has been subject to American sanctions since 2013.The new United States sanctions address how other nations tolerate North Korea\u2019s behavior, particularly China, said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.\u201cThese sanctions expand the U.S. blacklist for companies tied to North Korea\u2019s economic activity and are designed to curb the hard currency available to Pyongyang,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said in an email. \u201cI think we should expect more sanctions of this nature, including more designations to highlight the role of China to enable North Korea\u2019s illicit aims.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Trump, Coal Mining Gets New Life on U.S. Lands", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "Trump RulesA business-friendly secretary of the interior has moved to invigorate a struggling industry, reversing Obama-era restrictions to help create \u201cwealth and jobs.\u201dSupported byDECKER, Mont. \u2014 The Trump administration is wading into one of the oldest and most contentious debates in the West by encouraging more coal mining on lands owned by the federal government. It is part of an aggressive push to both invigorate the struggling American coal industry and more broadly exploit commercial opportunities on public lands.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have good water, we can\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Art Hayes, a cattle rancher who worries that more mining would foul a supply that generations of ranchers have relied upon.The coal industry sued, protested and lobbied to block a rule increasing royalties for mining coal on federal land. Then President Trump was elected, and the rule was suspended. The inside story is told in documents collected by The New York TimesThe Obama administration, he said, had become intent on killing the coal industry, and had used federal lands as a cudgel to restrict exports. The only avenues of growth currently, given the shutdown of so many coal-burning power plants in the United States, are markets overseas.\u201cTheir goal, in collusion with the environmentalists, was to drive us out of the export business,\u201d Mr. Reavey said.Even with the moves so far, the prospect of coal companies operating in a big way on federal land \u2014 and for any major job growth \u2014 is dim, in part because environmentalists have blocked construction of a coal export terminal, and there is limited capacity at the port the companies use in Vancouver.Competition from other global suppliers offering coal to Asian power plants is also intense.In late June, Mr. Zinke visited Whitefish, Mont., to attend a meeting of Western governors, where he vowed to find a balance between extracting commodities from federal lands and protecting them.\u201cOur greatest treasures are public lands,\u201d Mr. Zinke said in a speech. \u201cIt is not a partisan issue. It is an American issue.\u201dAfterward, protesters from the Sierra Club and other groups held a rally in the town square against the actions taken by Mr. Zinke during his first months on the job, chanting \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cLiar!\u201d and carrying signs opposing his policies.But Mr. Zinke was not in public view. Just before the rally started, he was inside a nearby building, meeting with Bill Cadman, a vice president of Whiting Petroleum, a company that drills on federal lands.\u201cWe are all affected by this constant regulatory quagmire,\u201d Mr. Cadman said.Cloud Peak Energy had been preparing for several years to seize upon the arrival of an industry-friendly administration in Washington. But it was also prepared to fight without one.At a gathering of a coal industry trade group in 2015, Mr. Reavey, the company\u2019s chief lobbyist, left no doubts about the company\u2019s determination to defend mining in the Powder River Basin, which includes operations here in Decker.Mr. Reavey likened the industry\u2019s existential crisis to that of tobacco companies in the 1990s. The coal industry, he told executives, had been targeted by a liberal conspiracy of environmental groups, news organizations and regulators. Coal would suffer the same fate as cigarettes, he warned, unless the industry stood its ground.\u201cThe corruption in the coal sector is just so rampant,\u201d she said in an interview.Another hot-button issue was how much to charge in royalties, which generate about $1 billion a year for the federal government.The alliance between Mr. Zinke and the coal industry is well documented in his campaign finance disclosures.What Representative Zinke started, Secretary Zinke and his team were poised to finish.In February, even before the Senate confirmed Mr. Zinke to his new post, Mr. Reavey of Cloud Peak was meeting at the Interior Department headquarters in Washington with President Trump\u2019s political appointees. Among them was Kathy Benedetto, who was temporarily overseeing the division in charge of coal leases.\u201cWe made clear that we thought this rule was bad and they had an opportunity to stop this process from going forward,\u201d he said of the change in royalty payments.The Trump administration killed an Obama-era ban on new federal coal leases. Here are the documents.\u201cCostly and unnecessary,\u201d Mr. Zinke said in announcing that the study was, in essence, being thrown in the trash.\u201cWe are wealthy in life here,\u201d said Donna Fisher, a Cheyenne who lives along the Tongue River and who attended the warrior competition with her grandson. \u201cWe don\u2019t have money. But we have land, water and air. Snuff that out and we are gone.\u201dAs he walked on stage at the governor\u2019s gathering in Whitefish, Mr. Zinke exuded confidence. The United States, he argued, can and should expand energy production from its federal lands, with money earned from leases going toward repairs to roads and bridges, and at national parks.\u201cAs Interior secretary, I am looking at both sides of our balance sheet,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. \u201cThere is a consequence of not using some of our public land for the creation of wealth and jobs.\u201dThere was no such restraint on the nearby town square, where protesters flashed signs with slogans like \u201cZinke Sells Soul to Big Oil\u201d and \u201cWhat Would Teddy Do?\u201d \u2014 a reference to Mr. Zinke\u2019s statements that he admired President Theodore Roosevelt, a conservationist who helped set aside millions of acres as public land.Next to the square, at a pizza restaurant, a once-powerful Washington couple reflected on the frustration of those opposed to the administration\u2019s new direction.Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser in the Obama White House and later a top campaign aide to Hillary Clinton, was eating with her husband, Jim Lyons, an Interior official during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term.Both had expected senior administration roles had Mrs. Clinton won. Now, Mr. Lyons was in Whitefish trying to salvage the rules on oil, gas and coal that he had helped develop just a few years ago. He was holding sessions with governors hoping to enlist them to pressure Mr. Zinke and others.\u201cInstead of driving change, we are searching for ways to continue to be an influence,\u201d Mr. Lyons said. \u201cFrustration is an understatement.\u201dEric Lipton reported from Decker, and Barry Meier from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the C.E.O. Rebellion Against Trump\u2019s Advisory Councils", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo, joined a call with other prominent corporate chieftains who \u2014 like her \u2014 had agreed to advise President Trump.A rebellion was brewing.Along with other business leaders, Ms. Nooyi had watched with bafflement over the weekend as Mr. Trump blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for an outburst of white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va.Ms. Nooyi spoke with Mary T. Barra, the head of General Motors, Virginia M. Rometty, the chief of IBM, and Rich Lesser, the chief executive of Boston Consulting Group, who were similarly outraged with the president\u2019s response. All of them wondered whether it was time to step down from the Strategic and Policy Forum, an elite group formed late last year to advise the president on economic issues.As these calls were occurring, the president\u2019s other main business advisory group, the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, had begun to disintegrate. Early Monday, the chief executive of Merck stepped down from that group, followed by the chiefs of Intel and Under Armour, and representatives from a labor group and a nonprofit business alliance.Some chief executives were still on the fence on Tuesday, torn between remaining on the prestigious presidential policy advisory panel and making a statement by stepping down.But after the president delivered a series of stunning remarks in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday afternoon, when he again equated far-right hate groups with the groups protesting them, many chief executives had enough.On Wednesday morning, a dozen of the country\u2019s most influential C.E.O.s joined a conference call, and, after some debate, a consensus emerged: The policy forum would be disbanded, delivering a blow to a president who came into office boasting of his close ties with business leaders.With the collapse of the councils, the president has all but lost his most natural constituency \u2014 the corporate leaders who stood to benefit from his agenda of lower taxes and lighter regulation.Before they could make a statement announcing their decision, however, Mr. Trump spoke. He had caught wind of their planned defection and wanted to have the last word. Taking to Twitter, he wrote: \u201cRather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!\u201dThis account is based on interviews with more than a dozen people at the companies represented on the council or advising them.Mr. Trump rose to fame as a businessman. A real estate developer and reality television star, he cultivated an image as the consummate boss, dishing out investment advice and popularizing the phrase \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d on the television show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201dAs president, he filled the White House with executives from Wall Street, and installed business and business-friendly leaders in many important government roles. And he convened several business advisory groups stacked with the nation\u2019s top chief executives.But seven months into his presidency, Mr. Trump is faced with an uncomfortable situation: Fewer and fewer business leaders are willing to be associated with a president who continues to advance opinions and policies that are deeply unpopular.\u201cThere is continuing pressure on C.E.O.s from customers, employees, shareholders and board members to take a position against what\u2019s going on and separate themselves from president Trump\u2019s councils,\u201d said Bill George, the former chief executive of the medical device maker Medtronic and a board member of Goldman Sachs. \u201cThese executives cannot live with customers thinking they are in cahoots with someone who supports white supremacists or neo-Nazis.\u201dFor the executives, leaving these groups is no small matter. Presidential advisory groups are largely ceremonial but highly prestigious posts for business leaders, giving them an opportunity to weigh in on policy and try to shape a president\u2019s legislative agenda. But after a few much-publicized events for the groups, momentum was lost, and when the week began, no further meetings were planned.\u201cThey had a few meetings with a bunch of fanfare, but it was more symbolic than anything else,\u201d said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.Still, executives\u2019 involvement with the groups \u2014 or their decision to withdraw \u2014 had become a barometer of their support for the president. The recent mass defections have exposed a fundamental divide between Mr. Trump and mainstream business leaders.\u201cIn American history, we\u2019ve never had business leaders decline national service when requested by the president,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor of organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management. \u201cThey\u2019ve now turned their backs on him.\u201dBy Tuesday evening, a consensus had emerged among many of the chief executives on the policy forum. Having stood with the president in recent months even as he advanced positions they vehemently opposed, including tough immigration policies and withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, many executives felt his apparent tolerance for white nationalist violence was a bridge too far.Ms. Nooyi was drawing heavy criticism on social media for her involvement in the panel. Others, including Mr. Lesser, the chief executive of Boston Consulting Group, and Mark Weinberger, the head of the accounting firm Ernst & Young, also signaled they would not remain. By 10 p.m., it was clear that many participants were prepared to resign.As the group disintegrated, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, was kept in the loop. Mr. Schwarzman was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest business confidants and the chairman of the policy forum, but he was also outraged by the president\u2019s remarks.On Tuesday evening, he called Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and a White House adviser, to inform him that the policy forum was falling apart. At the same time, Mr. Schwarzman began drafting a statement about disbanding the group. A White House spokesman declined to comment.Efforts to schedule a conference call for the chief executives on Tuesday night were unsuccessful, so a call was set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday.On Wednesday morning, Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, called Ms. Nooyi, Ms. Rometty, Ms. Barra and Douglas McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart.Mr. Fink decided to step down after seeing the president\u2019s remarks on Tuesday, and now encouraged other executives to join him. Mr. McMillon, who earlier in the week made public a stinging critique of the president, but had not stepped down from the advisory group, had changed his stance after Mr. Trump\u2019s news conference on Tuesday, deciding to step down.There was a mass exodus of executives from presidential advisory councils as they opposed stances taken by President Trump.As the call began, more than a dozen of the nation\u2019s top business leaders dialed in from around the country \u2014 Mr. Fink was in Aspen, Colo., while Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, was home in New York.Leading the discussion, Mr. Schwarzman, gave each participant time to speak.Two in the group \u2014 Jim McNerney, the former chief executive of Boeing and Jack Welch, the former leader of General Electric \u2014 proposed issuing a statement condemning the president, but keeping the group together.Mr. McNerney and Mr. Welch did not respond to requests for comment.But most others, including Mr. Fink of BlackRock and Ms. Nooyi of Pepsi, leaned toward disbanding.Mr. Dimon was also furious and wanted off the council, but felt conflicted because of his role as chairman of the Business Roundtable, an industry group.Ms. Rometty of IBM, who had faced criticism from employees for her role in the group, advocated that the executives \u201ccondemn and disband.\u201d That phrase soon drew broad backing.As the policy forum was holding its call, other members of the manufacturing council, including Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup and Inge Thulin of 3M, announced they would step down.By the time the call was over, the group had agreed to disband. After the decision was final, Mr. Schwarzman called the White House to let Mr. Trump know. He was asked to include language that the president had agreed to disband it.Shortly thereafter, the president claimed on Twitter that he was disbanding the advisory groups.Companies swiftly disputed that notion. Johnson & Johnson said its chief executive, Alex Gorsky, was leaving the panel before the president\u2019s tweet.After the announcement of the disbanding, many of the chief executives who had initially lent support to Mr. Trump, publicly separated themselves from him, one by one, in stark language.\u201cThere is no room for equivocation here: the evil on display by these perpetrators of hate should be condemned and has no place in a country that draws strength from our diversity and humanity,\u201d Mr. Dimon of JPMorgan wrote.\u201cIn the past week, we have seen and heard of public events and statements that run counter to our values as a country and a company,\u201d Ms. Rometty of IBM said.And Jeffrey Immelt, the chairman of General Electric, said, \u201cThe president\u2019s statements yesterday were deeply troubling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly part of a Twitter message from President Trump. He said \u201crather than putting pressure\u201d on business executives, not \u201crather than put pressure\u201d on them.An earlier version of this article misstated the day on which some chief executives discussed withdrawing from a presidential advisory group. It was Tuesday, not Monday.Reporting was contributed by Michael Corkery, Steve Lohr, Ben Protess and Bill Vlasic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Switzerland and Germany Unlikely Adversaries in Spy Drama", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Tax collectors do not usually loom large in espionage thrillers, nor are Germany and Switzerland often portrayed as bitter adversaries in the spy game.The bizarre case marked the latest development in a long-running conflict between the two countries over Swiss banking secrecy laws, which Germany and other countries see as a means for the wealthy to dodge taxes.German authorities have paid tens of millions of dollars in recent years for information that the Swiss government considers secret. The files allowed German tax officials to identify citizens who had secret bank accounts and unreported income in Switzerland.But Swiss authorities were enraged by the Germans\u2019 use of cash to get employees of Swiss banks to hand over confidential data. Bank secrecy is regarded as a matter of national sovereignty in Switzerland, and while the country has taken steps to prevent its banks from being used to launder money or hide wealth, Swiss banks\u2019 reputation for discretion remains a major selling point to customers.While in Germany the tax collectors were seen as heroes, Swiss officials regarded them as criminals. They issued arrest warrants for the officials and accused them of stealing the information.While it\u2019s unlikely that a Cold War will break out between Switzerland and Germany, the case has strained relations between two close neighbors who share a long border and have many cultural similarities. German is the predominant language in Switzerland, albeit a dialect that many Germans find impenetrable.In their announcement on Wednesday, German federal prosecutors identified the accused spy only as Daniel M., a 54-year-old Swiss citizen who is charged with gathering information about three tax officials in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The officials were responsible for obtaining the bank documents.According to the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Germany, Daniel M. \u2014 described by German media as a former Zurich police officer who operated from Frankfurt \u2014 had been a paid Swiss intelligence operative from 2011 through early 2015. His job was purportedly to gather information on the three German tax officials, who were not identified, who had purchased digital files from bank contacts in Switzerland.If the allegations prove to be true, Lutz Lienenk\u00e4mper, the German state\u2019s finance minister, said in an emailed statement Wednesday, \u201cit would be a completely unacceptable intervention in the work of our finance experts.\u201dRepresentatives of the Swiss government declined to comment.According to German prosecutors, Swiss intelligence officials dispatched Daniel M. to gather information about the tax investigators. After running into difficulties, according to a statement from the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Daniel M. hired a private detective who was able to identify the three officials.Swiss prosecutors then used the information to issue arrest warrants for the tax collectors, who worked in the city of Wuppertal. While Germany does not extradite its own citizens, the warrants meant that the officials could not travel to Switzerland without risking arrest.The Swiss Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office said in an email Wednesday that the investigation against the tax officials was on hold, but that the arrest warrants remained valid. It declined to comment further.Daniel M. also managed to plant a mole inside the agency in North Rhine-Westphalia responsible for tax collection, officials said. The mole has not been identified, German prosecutors said.Daniel M., who was said to have earned about \u20ac30,000 for the spy work, was taken into custody in April. German authorities said at the time that a Swiss citizen had been arrested on espionage charges. But they did not say until Wednesday who they believed he had been working for, or reveal the link to secret bank data.German prosecutors formally filed charges against Daniel M. last week. He remains in custody.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Would Sooner Tax the Rich Than Befriend Them", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2014, one of New York City\u2019s largest private employers, JPMorgan Chase, sought to make a deal with the newly minted administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio. The company wanted to move thousands of workers to a pair of new office towers in the Hudson Yards development, but it demanded a host of incentives from the city to make it happen.The episode offered an early demonstration of how a new mayor, who ran on a platform of ending income inequality and seemed proud not to have ties to the city\u2019s titans of finance, would deal with demands from major businesses.Nearly three years later, Mr. de Blasio has not changed his core philosophy or his approach to Wall Street leaders; as he nears the end of his first term, the mayor has not fostered close relationships with the city\u2019s business giants.Last week, when Mr. de Blasio proposed a tax on those making more than $500,000 a year to raise more money for the struggling subway system, he did not first seek support from the business community.Yet so far, at least, the mayor\u2019s seeming indifference to business leaders has not hurt his chances at re-election, especially with calls to rein in Wall Street becoming a common refrain, and cities, including New York, rethinking the wisdom of offering tax incentives to companies as an inducement to stay.The mayor\u2019s stance also has not hurt the economy of the nation\u2019s largest city.In interviews, financial and real estate executives as well as other members of the city\u2019s corporate class expressed little enthusiasm for the mayor. But he remains strong with Democratic voters in polls.\u201cMost C.E.O.s dislike the mayor\u2019s political rhetoric and doubt his interest or effectiveness in managing city services,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, the city\u2019s premier business group. \u201cBut so long as the city is safe and its fiscal condition is solid, they pretty much ignore what they disagree with.\u201dCorporate leaders have, when asked, stood with Mr. de Blasio in support of policy goals they believe will benefit the city, such as mayoral control of city schools. They have attended dinners at Gracie Mansion when invited in recent months.Mr. de Blasio has engaged in some outreach since the election of President Trump, including a meeting on April 21 at City Hall with the chief executive of Citigroup, Michael L. Corbat, and Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone Group.During that meeting, the mayor sought to enlist their help in resisting cuts to federal funding, and support for the city\u2019s policies on immigration. (Earlier that month, the two executives had been in Washington to meet with the Trump administration and discuss the interests of New York City\u2019s business community.)No one expected that Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat who came from modest means, would enjoy the warm embrace that greeted Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire and philanthropist at home in the city\u2019s upper echelons.\u201cComparing him to his predecessor is a little unfair because Mike came from the business community,\u201d said Edward Skyler, an executive at Citigroup and a former deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cWhile the mayor has made efforts to engage with business leaders, they are never going to embrace his tax policies.\u201dFrom the start, Mr. de Blasio made a point of eschewing the world of Manhattan galas that often bring together the city\u2019s civic and corporate leaders and other markers of the inequality he sought to end. He does not appear in society pages in the manner of Mr. Bloomberg, and, aides say, he would not want to.\u201cIt\u2019s not junior high school. This is not about going to the prom. This is about whether or not people are feeling good about the City of New York as a whole,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor and former Goldman Sachs executive. \u201cI think people would be hard pressed, other than saying, \u2018Oh, you know, it would be nice if I saw him at the opera,\u2019 to say anything about the state of New York City.\u201dShe pointed to the East Midtown rezoning as proof of things being done that business supports. \u201cThe fact that Pfizer could have sold the building and swanned off to suburban New Jersey but chose actively to reinvest in New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cThat to me speaks volumes about how companies are seeing New York City and its future and its present.\u201dFor more than a year, Mr. de Blasio has tried meeting business leaders in a format that better suits him: dinners with his wife, Chirlane McCray, at Gracie Mansion. At first Mr. de Blasio was skeptical, aides said, but he has warmed to the events and held eight such dinners so far. \u201cThere is way more common ground than disagreement on the big issues,\u201d said Gabrielle Fialkoff, a senior adviser to Mr. de Blasio who began organizing the dinners in 2016.While others are eating, Mr. de Blasio delivers remarks about his tenure for much of the meal, then takes questions, according to several people who have attended. One person, who attended a dinner in June, compared the mayor\u2019s speech to a campaign event, but noted that the mayor did not circulate to each table and greet everyone.\u201cHe starts his remarks by saying, \u2018I don\u2019t get to hang out with you guys,\u2019\u201d said Robert S. Tucker, the chief executive of T & M Protection Resources, a security firm, who attended a recent dinner. \u201cI walked out of there thinking very differently about him than I did going it.\u201dFew corporate executives or business owners were willing to openly discuss Mr. de Blasio for fear of antagonizing a mayor who most expect will be easily re-elected. He is facing challenges from long-shot candidates in the Democratic primary race, and polls give him a wide margin in the general election as well.State labor statistics show that, contrary to the fears of some at the start of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure, jobs have stayed in New York. Workers from fashion to finance are eager to live in the city, where unemployment and crime are low. New business creation is up, though with notable declines in retail shops, a trend mirrored nationally, said David Belkin, a senior economist at the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office.With the November vote looming, Mr. de Blasio has returned to campaign mode and embraced a Bernie Sanders-style of populist rhetoric of the sort that turned off some business types last time.The mayor has turned down numerous invitations to visit the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, which remains in Manhattan. \u201cHe\u2019s been invited in, but he has never accepted,\u201d said Joseph Evangelisti, a company spokesman.To get his ear, one businessman decided, the best way was to donate to the mayor\u2019s re-election.\u201cHe\u2019s not my first choice; he\u2019s not necessarily my third choice,\u201d said a businessman who donated the maximum of $4,950 to the mayor\u2019s re-election campaign and requested anonymity to discuss his reasons for doing so.\u201cI\u2019d rather be able to pick up the phone and call him if I think that he\u2019s off base on something, rather than having no relation.\u201dAnd sure enough, he said, soon after the donation he got a personal call from the mayor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If SoundCloud Disappears, What Happens to Its Music Culture?", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThis summer, an engineer named Matthew Healy moved to Berlin to work at SoundCloud, a popular music-streaming service. He started his job on a Monday. On Thursday, a companywide meeting was called. Healy and his new co-workers assumed it was about the acquisition rumors swirling around the company. Instead, Healy learned that he and 172 other employees \u2014 roughly 40 percent of the company\u2019s staff \u2014 were being laid off. \u2018\u2018The rest of the day is a blur,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in a post about his experience online. \u2018\u2018I now realize that I was in shock.\u2019\u2019After the layoffs, the technology blog TechCrunch published a report claiming that SoundCloud had enough money to finance itself for only 80 days. Though the company disputed the report, the possibility that SoundCloud might disappear sent a shock through the web. Data hoarders began trying to download the bulk of the service\u2019s public archive in order to preserve it. Musicians like deadmau5, a Canadian electronic-music producer, tossed out suggestions on Twitter for how the company could save the service. Chance the Rapper tweeted: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m working on the SoundCloud thing.\u2019\u2019Since its start in 2008, SoundCloud has been a digital space for diverse music cultures to flourish, far beyond the influence of mainstream label trends. For lesser-known artists, it has been a place where you can attract the attention of fans and the record industry without having to work the usual channels. There is now a huge roster of successful artists who first emerged on SoundCloud, including the R.&B. singer Kehlani, the electronic musician Ta-Ha, the pop musician Dylan Brady and the rapper Lil Yachty, to name just a few.Part of what made the service so vital was the way that established artists stayed plugged into it. When an unknown Atlanta musician named Makonnen self-released an EP online and on SoundCloud, Miley Cyrus shared an image on Instagram flagging one of his singles, while another song, \u2018\u2018Tuesday,\u2019\u2019 caught the attention of the Toronto rapper Drake. Drake recorded a remix of the song and eventually signed Makonnen to his own label, OVO Sound. This, of course, is what most musicians want, but Makonnen later said in an interview that he was frustrated by the glacial label process, which delayed the follow-up to his EP. SoundCloud allowed artists to bypass that process.Even now, the site houses a large pool of musicians, many of them unsigned, who are part of international music cultures that largely do not exist anywhere else online. In a recent Times article, my colleague Jon Caramanica chronicled the rise of \u2018\u2018SoundCloud rap,\u2019\u2019 a subgenre of rap released primarily on the streaming service that he described as \u2018\u2018the most vital and disruptive new movement in hip-hop thanks to rebellious music, volcanic energy and occasional acts of malevolence.\u2019\u2019 As he noted, it rose as a rebuttal to the hyperproduced sound of artists like Drake. It was music made entirely to be distributed online, yet it created its own culture offline \u2014 something unlikely to have emerged from the imagination of your typical record-label executive.The death of SoundCloud, then, would mean more than the sunsetting of a service: It could mean the erasure of a decade of internet sound culture, says Jace Clayton, a musician and the author of \u2018\u2018Uproot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture.\u2019\u2019 He reminded me of an online music service called imeem, which MySpace bought in 2009 in the hope of absorbing its 16 million users into its own platform. But the struggling service shut down, and all the music uploaded and shared to it was lost, including what Clayton recalls to be a very eclectic subset of black Chicago house music. \u2018\u2018What does it mean if someone can delete hundreds and thousands of hours of sound culture overnight?\u2019\u2019 he asked.SoundCloud always let me get lost in a warren of music that I\u2019d never heard \u2014 or even heard of \u2014 before. Once, it was Japanese trap songs. Another time it was Ethiopian jazz music. It somehow manages to evoke some of the most appealing features of offline music culture, like browsing through bins in a record store or catching indie acts at an underground club.SoundCloud took a community-first approach to building its business, prioritizing finding artists to post on its service over making deals with music labels to license their music, the approach taken by Spotify. The music industry was still in the process of adapting to a digital ecosystem when SoundCloud emerged; illegal file-sharing was rampant. But when the industry finally began squelching unauthorized distribution of artists\u2019 tracks, SoundCloud was hit hard. D.J.s were also told to take down mixes of songs they didn\u2019t own the rights to, and many of the remixes the site was known for were removed. SoundCloud \u2018\u2018was very much built in the dot-com-era mentality of building an audience and then finding a way to make money,\u2019\u2019 Mark Mulligan, a music-industry analyst, told me. SoundCloud struggled to monetize the service. Artists who paid to be featured on the site balked at having ads run against their music, and when the company introduced its own version of a subscription service, called Go, the response was tepid. How do you persuade people who have been using your services free to start paying $5 or $10 a month?Generally speaking, the business of music streaming is treacherous at best: Consumers don\u2019t seem to want to pay big money for access to digital music services, so companies must keep the fees low. But the more those subscribers listen to music, the more these services have to pay the labels for access. Even Spotify, which has the largest user base of all the streaming services, still diverts more than half its revenue back to the labels for licensing fees. And the most popular artists \u2014 Rihanna, Future, Drake \u2014 are all releasing music exclusively through the streaming service that pays them to do so; or in the case of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, through the streaming service they own, Tidal. A start-up like SoundCloud stands almost no chance of competing.For the most part, streaming services feel sterile and devoid of community. Spotify, Tidal and even YouTube to a degree are vast and rich troves of music, but they primarily function as search engines organized by algorithms. You typically have to know what you\u2019re looking for in order to find it. They have tried to remedy that drawback with customized playlists, but still they feel devoid of a human touch. Serendipity is rare.By contrast, the most successful online communities, like SoundCloud, have the feel of public spaces, where everyone can contribute to the culture. They feel as if they belong to the community that sustains them. But of course that\u2019s not how it works. In \u2018\u2018Who Owns Culture?,\u2019\u2019 Susan Scafidi writes: \u2018\u2018Community-generated art forms have tremendous economic and social value \u2014 yet most source communities have little control over them.\u2019\u2019SoundCloud\u2019s fan base may soon learn this lesson the hard way. The service\u2019s founder, Alexander Ljung, declined to be interviewed for this column, but after Chance the Rapper tweeted about his interest in saving SoundCloud, the men talked on the phone, which Chance reported was \u2018\u2018very fruitful.\u2019\u2019 Ljung agreed, tweeting that for now, SoundCloud was \u2018\u2018here to stay.\u2019\u2019 Whether SoundCloud can last another 10 years remains to be seen. But the moral of its struggle is clear: As digital culture becomes more tied to the success of the platforms where it flourishes, there is always a risk of it disappearing forever.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Premier League Puts Your Town on the Map", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUDDERSFIELD, England \u2014 It was not just the size of its new fan base that caught Huddersfield Town by surprise this summer, but the size of its new fans.Within two weeks, all three editions of the jersey had all but sold out \u2014 even though the shirts were available only through the club\u2019s online shop and at one of its two stores here.The club quickly contacted Puma, its apparel supplier, with an urgent request to deliver a new batch as quickly as possible. It will not arrive until September, but when it does, it will be in a greater variety of sizes than before: In another surprise, there had been a surge of requests for jerseys in 3XL and 4XL.The Terriers, it appears, will have a larger audience in more ways than one this season.Huddersfield the town, like Huddersfield the club, will need some time to get used to the spotlight. Both had their heyday in the 1920s, when the team won three English championships and the town was thriving and prosperous, its wealth rooted in the textile industry. Since then, said Raj Bains, the author of \u201cUnderdog,\u201d a book charting the club\u2019s rise last season, \u201ctheir fortunes run almost in sync.\u201d Slowly, inexorably, town and team faded.Now, he says, both are \u201cin the healthiest state they have been for a while.\u201d The tendency, when discussing those Premier League clubs rooted away from the bright lights and the big cities, is to cast their towns as rust-belt relics, still reeling and resentful from the devastating loss of heavy industry in the 1980s.And yet \u2014 both Bains and Steven Leigh, of the Mid Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, agreed \u2014 it is a place trying to shake off the sense of being a waypoint, a place defined not by what it is, but by what it is near. \u201cIt does not want to be somewhere in between Leeds and Manchester,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cIt is a place in its own right.\u201dThe value of a spot in the Premier League, with its global reach and its lucrative television rights, tends to be described in financial terms. Even if Huddersfield spends only one season among English soccer\u2019s elite, it stands to receive somewhere in the region of 165 million pounds ($214 million) plus, in the event of relegation, two years of parachute payments to ease the drop back down the ladder.Yet that is just the start of the true value of the sort of exposure that competing in the Premier League brings. To a club \u2014 as witnessed by the surge of demand for Huddersfield\u2019s jerseys \u2014 there is the merchandising, as well as the increase in ticket sales and an uptick in sponsorship income.To a place, there is more still, a set of advantages that are cast into the sharpest relief when the place is one like Huddersfield, or Burnley, West Bromwich, Stoke, Bournemouth or Swansea, or the dozen or so other small towns and cities that have enjoyed a taste of even brief membership in the world\u2019s highest-profile sports league.Some of the benefits are direct, of course: Leigh suggested that, in the case of Bournemouth, as much as \u00a370 million flowed into town businesses related to soccer \u2014 restaurants and bars and hotels \u2014 in the course of a single season.Others are more tangential. Huw Morris, academic registrar at the University of Swansea, said in 2015 that the institution had seen a surge in applications since it earned the right to call itself a Premier League city. \u201cI speak to some of the people who travel the world to recruit students, and as soon as they hear the word Swansea, they associate it with football,\u201d he told Wales Online.The evidence is anecdotal \u2014 one 2008 study found no correlation between the presence of a Premier League team and university applications \u2014 but the anecdotes are common: Similar views have been expressed by Staffordshire University, in Stoke, and Cardiff University, which cited a surge of applicants from Malaysia after Vincent Tan, a Malaysian, bought the city\u2019s club in 2010.But the most significant benefit is not one that can immediately be quantified financially.Burnley is, perhaps, the best parallel for Huddersfield. It is a substantially smaller city, with a population of just 73,000, making it the smallest place to host a Premier League team. But it would recognize not only many of the historic issues that face Huddersfield \u2014 social deprivation, unemployment, the decline of industry \u2014 but much of the response, too. In 2013, Burnley was voted the most entrepreneurial place in Britain.Now, on the verge of its team\u2019s third season in the Premier League in the last four, it is well positioned to assess what being part of the competition can do to a place. Mike Garlick, the Burnley F.C. chairman, points out the economic transformation, the \u201caway fans and journalists, all needing somewhere to stay,\u201d and the physical one, too: Burnley has spent \u00a312 million building a state-of-the-art training center at Gawthorpe Hall, just outside town.But he lingers more on the psychological impact. He sees the chairman\u2019s role, which he has occupied for the last five years, as almost a civic one (\u201cYou\u2019re a custodian. You own it, technically, but really you\u2019re just looking after it.\u201d) and as his way of giving something back to his hometown.He takes immense pride in the work Burnley does in the community \u2014 sports facilities and educational programs, financed in no small part by Premier League grants \u2014 but also in what the club does for the community just by being a Premier League team.\u201cIt is a great feel-good factor,\u201d he said. \u201cBurnley won the entrepreneurship award the same year as we were promoted. That sort of thing gives a place a winning mentality. It shows you can go and do things for yourself.\u201dIt is that self-confidence, he believes, that is the greatest benefit of a place in the Premier League, of being a Premier League place. Garlick lives in Hertfordshire, just north of London. Yet when he mentions his hometown, \u201cthe first thing people think of is football\u201d \u2014 not angst or decay, not decline and fall, but success. It changes perceptions, and it does so across the world.\u201cI have an office in Singapore,\u201d he said. \u201cI was out there a couple of years ago. I walked along a street full of bars, and they were all showing Burnley. From 7,000 miles away. Burnley. The Premier League puts us \u2014 places like us \u2014 on the map. And that has got to be a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Price of a Mayoral Race That Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI know one wealthy person,\u201d Robert Gangi, a longtime activist in criminal-justice reform, offered the other day.Mayor Bill de Blasio, having raised $4.8 million, mostly through small donations, has not. Although almost no one imagines he will lose, he petitioned the board for public money regardless, successfully arguing that Mr. Gangi and another opponent, Sal Albanese, presented enough of a challenge that he should receive the near $2.6 million for which he was eligible. It is as if an heiress in the midst of a divorce demanded from the courts that her husband, a bartender, start paying her alimony.What does it mean for the mayor to denounce bigotry and hail the city\u2019s progressive, embracing values, as he has done since the events in Charlottesville and repeatedly during the Trump era, without calling for a dismantling of \u201cbroken windows\u2019\u2019 altogether? Presumably, Mr. Gangi might have posed such a question to him in a debate, but a civic forum involving the two is one we are unlikely to witness.Created in the late 1980s as a response to the corruption scandals that had plagued the city, the Campaign Finance Board also sponsors debates and has required, since 1997, that anyone receiving its funds participates in them. The intent of the original stipulation was virtuous \u2014 that taxpayers should hear from the candidates who were receiving their money. But as it works now, someone who files paperwork for the matching-funds program but fails to raise enough money is not invited, which essentially silences anyone who is inadequately networked. Next week Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Albanese will debate each other, and Mr. Gangi will have to watch them on television.Theoretically, Mr. de Blasio, who was comfortable enough to ask the board for money, could graciously ask its members if, in the spirit of democracy (perhaps now hurtling toward its final hours), Mr. Gangi could be invited despite the restrictions. This does not seem destined to happen.What is Mr. de Blasio doing with the public money he is getting, money his campaign insists is necessary in part because no one thought the country would wake up on Nov. 9 to President Trump? \u201cThe city has elected Republicans before,\u201d Monica Klein, the communications director for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign told me.That professed sense of urgency did not keep Mr. de Blasio from going on vacation in Rhode Island this week, shortly before the scheduled debate on Wednesday.Ultimately, Mr. de Blasio is running against himself and the prospect of a humiliatingly low voter turnout \u2014 an outcome that could, arguably, hinder whatever other political ambitions he has.A biography of the mayor, out in September, by Joseph P. Viteritti, a public policy professor at Hunter College is called, \u201cThe Pragmatist: Bill de Blasio\u2019s Quest to Save the Soul of New York.\u201d The preface has its own title: \u201cWhy This Book?\u2019\u2019 Surely, people will be wondering.Email bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Dow Isn\u2019t Really the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesDespite a few rocky days recently, the stock market is having a great year. But exactly how great depends on what you mean by \u201cthe stock market.\u201dAre you talking about the Dow Jones industrial average, the oldest and best-known measuring stick for the American stock market? If so, that one has risen more than 18 percent over the last 12 months, a spectacular return.Or are you referring to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the benchmark for large companies used by many stock professionals? If so, that market has been far less impressive, with a gain in the last 12 months of a little over 12 percent.Or do you mean something else entirely?The divergence between the two big indexes began in November, when the Dow started to surge ahead of the S.&P. 500. Though the shift in the indexes was little noticed at the time, the Dow has gained more than 20 percent since then, while the S.&P. is up about 15 percent. A gap of this magnitude is unusual: The two indexes usually move within a percentage point or two of one another. Why has this happened? To a surprising extent, the divergence depends on just two stocks, Apple and Boeing, and on the ways in which the two indexes are constructed.Both companies have had outstanding performances recently. Boeing stock, which trades at about $235, is up roughly 50 percent for the calendar year. Apple, which trades at roughly $157, has risen about 36 percent. But what may appear puzzling is that while Boeing has had a barely noticeable impact on the S.&P. 500, it has provided a gigantic lift to the Dow.According to data supplied by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, Boeing accounts for one quarter of the Dow\u2019s entire increase for 2017. That\u2019s almost double Apple\u2019s contribution.Yet Apple is the most valuable company in the entire stock market; its market capitalization is more than $800 billion. Boeing, while hardly small, has a market capitalization of only about $135 billion. Such considerations are critical in the S.&P. 500. Stocks with a bigger market cap have a proportionately bigger impact on the index. That\u2019s why it is known as a \u201cmarket-weighted index,\u201d and why professionals use it much more widely than the Dow.\u201cThe S.&P. tells you much more about how the market is really doing,\u201d said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor and market historian at the Wharton School. \u201cModern indexes that track stock markets are generally market weighted.\u201dThe Dow is not a modern index. It is old and simple, created more than a century ago by Charles Dow, who was the co-founder of Dow Jones and the first editor of The Wall Street Journal. For many , the Dow is synonymous with the American stock market. \u201cIf you say, how many points did the market move today, you\u2019re talking about the Dow,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a crazy way to measure the market.\u201dOnly 30 stocks are included in the index, which uses a measuring system so simple that it seems arbitrary: Stocks are weighted by price. That means that the highest-priced share of a stock \u2014 which happens to be Boeing at the moment \u2014 has the greatest sway in the index.Consider the implications of using that kind of index. Imagine that you are creating a food index based on all of the items you have bought in the last year.You purchased one jar of caviar and 1,000 cans of tuna fish. In a price-weighted index, caviar will have the biggest overall impact because it\u2019s the most expensive item you\u2019ve bought, even though you spent far more money on tuna. The rise and fall of caviar is the powerhouse that controls your price-weighted food index, even if you never buy caviar again in your life.\u201cNo one would build a stock market index that way today,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut remember, Charles Dow did it without computers, and it basically works. It tells you how the market performed and it requires relatively little calculation.\u201d It has some idiosyncrasies, though. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a $1,000 stock in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a stock like Amazon in it without all kinds of adjustments because its price is too high and it will change the index too much.\u201dConsider what the Dow looks like now. Through Thursday, Boeing\u2019s weighting in the index \u2014 based entirely on the price of a single share of Boeing stock \u2014 was 7.3 percent, Mr. Silverblatt said. Close behind were Goldman Sachs at a 7.07 percent weighting; 3M, with a 6.47 percent weighting; United Health, at 6.04 percent; and McDonald\u2019s, at 4.91 percent. Apple was only in sixth place in the Dow, with a weighting of 4.85 percent.Because of this price-weighting system, Boeing has more than nine times the stature in the Dow as General Electric. Yet G.E.\u2019s total value \u2014 its market capitalization \u2014 is much greater than Boeing\u2019s. No matter. Boeing has a far bigger impact on the Dow, and on \u201cthe market,\u201d if we are using the Dow as a shorthand way of talking about all stocks, than G.E. does.Is there a better way of defining the stock market? Absolutely. There are many other indexes. The S.&P. 500 does a good job of measuring large-capitalization stocks but it misses thousands of smaller ones.By that broader and no less precise definition, the market is not doing quite as well as either the Dow or the S.&P. would have you believe. The CRSP index is trailing the Dow by more than 2 percentage points this year, and is behind the S.&P. by more than three quarters of a percentage point. That may be why your stock portfolio, if it is diversified enough to capture the entire market, isn\u2019t turning in a performance as spectacular as the daily news reports may suggest.The problem may just be that everybody is talking about the Dow. They are not really talking about the stock market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Offers Neo-Nazis Muted Criticism, Netanyahu Is Largely Silent", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s defiant attempts this week to apportion equal blame to the \u201calt-left\u201d for the violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend and the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests.It also contrasted with the unusual reticence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a powerful orator who often communicates directly through video clips, scathing Facebook posts and statements from his office, but who has remained uncharacteristically tongue-tied about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.The piercing images of the torchlight march at the University of Virginia, with its Nazi symbols and chants of \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d reverberated across Israel, the homeland of, and a refuge for, Jews that was established in the wake of the Holocaust.In a message of solidarity with the American Jewish community, President Reuven Rivlin of Israel wrote, \u201cThe very idea that in our time we would see a Nazi flag \u2014 perhaps the most vicious symbol of anti-Semitism \u2014 paraded in the streets of the world\u2019s greatest democracy, and Israel\u2019s most cherished and greatest ally, is almost beyond belief.\u201dThe manifestations of hatred prompted condemnations from across Israel\u2019s political spectrum, but only a minimalist response from Mr. Netanyahu, who finds himself caught between his vow to represent all the Jews of the world and his friendship with the testy president of the United States.And he has remained silent about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, which American Jewish organizations have described as deeply troubling.Yair Lapid, of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said in a statement, \u201cThere aren\u2019t two sides. When neo-Nazis march in Charlottesville and scream slogans against Jews and in support of white supremacy, the condemnation has to be unambiguous.\u201dAfter eight years of tensions with the Obama administration over policy issues including the nuclear accord with Iran and Israel\u2019s settlement activity, Mr. Netanyahu celebrated the election of Mr. Trump and embraced him as the greatest friend of Israel and the Jewish people. Some of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Israeli allies have defended his reserved response as in keeping with diplomatic norms.\u201cIt is an established custom in Israel that Israeli prime ministers will not be overtly critical of the president of the United States,\u201d said Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the United States from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party.In a telephone interview, Mr. Shoval denounced all expressions of neo-Nazism as abhorrent and said nothing could be equated with it. But, he added, Mr. Netanyahu, \u201cas prime minister, has to take all factors into consideration,\u201d and \u201cdoes not have to come out with public statements.\u201d\u201cThe neo nazis scums in Virginia hate me and my country,\u201d he wrote in English. \u201cBut they belong to the past. Their breed is dying out. However the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my country (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life.\u201dThe Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a clarification deploring expressions of anti-Semitism in general, but legitimizing and supporting the campaign against Mr. Soros, who has financed left-wing causes critical of the Israeli government.Other prominent Israeli politicians and bodies preceded Mr. Netanyahu in condemning the violence in Charlottesville and the response of Mr. Trump, if not by name.Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned by the expressions of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism and hatred exhibited at the neo-Nazi rally,\u201d adding in a statement, \u201cI am horrified by the death of a protester at the hands of one of the marchers. These is no place for such hate speech or violence in any democratic society.\u201dNaftali Bennett, the leader of the far-right party The Jewish Home and minister of education and diaspora affairs, said the \u201cunhindered waving of Nazi flags and symbols\u201d also disrespected the millions of American soldiers who fought to protect the world from the Nazis. \u201cThe leaders of the U.S. must condemn and denounce the displays of anti-Semitism,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Trust Climate Science? Maybe the Eclipse Is a Clue", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy DegreesThanks to the work of scientists, people will know exactly what time to expect the eclipse. In less entertaining but more important ways, we respond to scientific predictions all the time, even though we have no independent capacity to verify the calculations. We tend to trust scientists.For years now, atmospheric scientists have been handing us a set of predictions about the likely consequences of our emissions of industrial gases. These forecasts are critically important, because this group of experts sees grave risks to our civilization. And yet, when it comes to reacting to the warnings of climate science, we have done little.If the science were brand new, that might make sense, but climate scientists have been making predictions since the end of the 19th century. This is the acid test of any scientific theory: Does it make predictions that ultimately come true?In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein\u2019s new and controversial theory of relativity predicted that gravity would cause light to bend. It sounded crazy, but a solar eclipse in 1919 provided the opportunity to test it as starlight passed near the blotted-out sun. Einstein\u2019s theory was proved, turning him into a celebrity overnight.When medicine delivered a wave of vaccines in the 20th century, doctors predicted that widespread use would cause childhood deaths from illnesses like whooping cough and diphtheria to fall. The public trusted the doctors, and those deaths plummeted.So what predictions has climate science made, and have they come true?By the 1960s and \u201970s, climate scientists were making more detailed predictions. They said that as the surface of the Earth warmed, the temperature in the highest reaches of the atmosphere would fall. That is exactly what happened.Summer temperatures have shifted toward more extreme heat over the past several decades.Considering this most basic test of a scientific theory, the test of prediction, climate science has established its validity.That does not mean it is perfect, nor that every single prediction is correct. While climate scientists have forecast the long-term rise of global temperatures pretty accurately, they have not been as good \u2014 yet \u2014 about predicting the short-term jitters.In other fields, we do not demand absolute certainty from our scientists, because that is an impossible standard.Extremely hot days are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades, potentially disrupting our everyday lives.When your aging mother is found to have cancer, the recommended treatment will be rooted in a statistical model of how tumors respond to the available medicines. Your family is likely to follow that advice, even though you know the drugs are imperfect and may not save her.We trust scientific expertise on many issues; it is, after all, the best advice we can get. Yet on climate change, we have largely ignored the scientists\u2019 work. While it is true that we have started to spend money to clean up our emissions, the global response is in no way commensurate with the risks outlined by the experts. Why?Sheer inertia is one of many reasons. The changes we need to make are hard, and they demand large-scale, collective action: to rebuild our energy system, to save our forests, to change our cars, to create radically better buildings.But a bigger reason is that these changes threaten vested economic interests. Commodity companies benefit from exploiting forests. Fossil-fuel companies, to protect their profits, spent decades throwing up a smoke screen about the risks of climate change.Most of them now say they have stopped funding climate denial, but they still finance the careers of politicians who say they are skeptical of climate science and who play down the risks.In the face of such attacks, the scientists soldier on, offering us more predictions even as the old ones come true.They tell us that we are now at risk of causing the great ice sheets in Greenland and west Antarctica to collapse, which would raise the sea level 30 feet or more over some unknown period, wiping out many of the world\u2019s great cities.They tell us that under a worst-case scenario, it might get so hot across large parts of the world that people would be unable to work outdoors without risking death. They tell us that we stand a good chance of causing the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth\u2019s history.These kinds of forecasts are painful to consider. By contrast, something like a solar eclipse is just fun. But as you watch it on Monday, spare a moment to think about the role of science in society.When the moon throws Corvallis, Ore., into near-darkness at 10:16 a.m. local time, or eclipses the sun over Kansas City, Mo., at 1:08 p.m., or Nashville at 1:27 p.m., think about the long scientific journey that allowed us to know precisely when it would happen.Think about Galileo standing in the dock of the Inquisition, forced to recant his belief that the Earth moves around the sun. Legend has it that he whispered under his breath: \u201cAnd yet it moves.\u201d Think about the centuries of patient effort that followed to work out the precise motions of the solar system, now understood so thoroughly that we can use them to predict eclipses centuries in advance.If you respect and honor the scientists who did this work, then spare another moment to think about the scientists whose work is under attack today, and why.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

English boasts greater entropy, but Spanish, the majority language in more than 20 countries, ranks first, followed by Arabic.Rivaling Spain and parts of Latin America, the United States exemplifies how the movement of people throughout the Spanish-speaking world is taking the language in new directions.Ojos Locos, a cavernous sports bar in Albuquerque, offers a glimpse into how Spanish is changing. Like El Super, it\u2019s part of a chain founded in the United States aimed at the Latino market.But some tables were effortlessly mixing English and Spanish, especially those where children were accompanying their parents, while others, including tables of mixed-ethnicity couples, cheered, conversed and cursed (Mexico lost, 1-0) over their frozen margaritas almost entirely in English.The ways in which families use languages at the dinner table also show how Spanish is evolving.In the Nava family, which moved to New Mexico from northern Mexico more than 20 years ago, the grandparents passionately debate in Spanish the performance of their football team, the Dallas Cowboys.But when their adult children talk to one another, it\u2019s in Spanglish. And the language of their grandchildren? Mainly English, with a sprinkling of Spanish words here and there.\u201cOur real communication is in Spanglish,\u201d said Cindy Nava, 29, a policy analyst at the New Mexico Legislature who arrived in the United States at the age of 7. \u201cBut we still recognize the importance of speaking Spanish correctly.\u201dLong before Mr. Trump was elected, the growth and durability of Spanish had caused concerns, leading to \u201cofficial language\u201d laws that in some cases limit the use of any language other than English in government offices and documents, and in other cases are largely symbolic.Rosalie Porter, who came to the United States from Italy as a child and is now the chairwoman of an organization seeking to end bilingual education and declare English the official language of the United States, said, \u201cWhen I was an immigrant child, my language was not politically correct.\u201d\u201cToday it\u2019s different,\u201d said Ms. Porter, whose group, ProEnglish, was founded by John Tanton, a Michigan doctor who started a handful of organizations seeking to restrict immigration. \u201cImmigrants enjoy a lot more visibility\u201d she added, emphasizing that she understood the business reasons behind the growth of Spanish-language media.But if the past is a guide, Spanish will continue to evolve and endure.\u201cFor many of us,\u201d he went on, \u201cSpanish is our path to love, and as history has proven no one can legislate away love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The only living former head of state not incriminated so far is Alan Garcia, who served two terms, from 1985 to 1990 and from 2006 to 2011, and ironically has a legendary reputation for corruption that has haunted him for decades. But he is also under investigation for financial irregularities in the construction of the Lima Metro by, once again, Brazil\u2019s Odebrecht conglomerate.In a region with a long history of graft and impunity, Peru proved fertile ground for illegal payoffs. For almost three centuries of colonial rule, gold and silver from the Andes highlands were shipped to Spain. In 1821, amid a long war that ravaged the country and left it bankrupt, an independent republic was founded with big dreams and aspirations. But from the start, in the building of its railroads and in exploiting new riches like guano from its islands and rubber from its jungle, Peru saw its economic splendor quickly vanish, squandered in a swamp of corruption.Venality reached new depths in the 1990s under Mr. Fujimori, when the infamous head of the secret services, Vladimiro Montesinos, bribed politicians, bankers, entrepreneurs, judges, military officers and journalists. Videotaping all those caught in his web, he bequeathed a visual legacy of abuse of power and deceit taking place behind closed doors. Mr. Montesinos has since been jailed for life, but dishonesty persists. More than half of Peru\u2019s regional governors are in jail or on trial today.Even after two centuries, Peru remains a frail republic. Yet, to its credit, in the past 25 years, it has ended an internal war, settled conflicts with its neighbors, overcome hyperinflation, become a stable democracy and, despite its current predicament, achieved economic growth and reduced poverty. Now, with corrupt political leaders no longer enjoying impunity, who knows, perhaps all past presidents will gather together to watch the bicentennial fireworks behind bars.Sonia Goldenberg is a journalist and documentary filmmaker.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Contradicting Trump, U.N. Monitor Says Iran Complies With Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump has made no secret of his desire to scrap the agreement, even over the objections of many of his top national security officials. But the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency make it harder to create an argument that Iran is in violation.The latest declaration by the I.A.E.A. came just a week after Mr. Trump had sent his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, to Vienna to meet with the top agency officials, who are responsible for conducting the inspections and monitoring Iranian compliance.Ms. Haley was pressing the agency to be more aggressive, and some administration officials have argued that the I.A.E.A. should demand access to a series of Iranian military sites. But under the accord, the agency can only do so when there is a reasonable suspicion that Iran is conducting illicit nuclear-related activities at those sites.So far, according the I.A.E.A. and American officials, the United States has not delivered a list of suspect locations.Ms. Haley, who is rumored in Washington to be a leading candidate to become secretary of state if the incumbent, Rex W. Tillerson, steps down later this year or next, made no comment on Thursday on the report\u2019s findings. But she issued a statement that suggested that the administration would push the inspections argument further, despite an Iranian declaration several days ago that its military sites are off-limits.\u201cIf inspections of Iranian military sites are \u2018merely a dream,\u2019 as Iran says, then Iranian compliance with the J.C.P.O.A. is also a dream,\u201d she said, using the initials for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the Iran deal.In its quarterly report, the I.A.E.A. found that on the second anniversary of the deal, which was struck in Vienna by John Kerry, then the secretary of state, and his Iranian counterpart, Iran\u2019s supply and enrichment level of uranium fuel were well within the allowed limits of the agreement. Iran\u2019s supply of heavy water, used in reactors that can produce plutonium, another nuclear-weapons fuel, also was within the limits, the report stated.Iran was required to dismantle the one reactor it was building that would be capable of producing large amounts of bomb-grade plutonium, and it poses no threat.The findings, which were released to member states of the agency and quickly leaked, were hardly unexpected. And while they make it difficult politically for Mr. Trump to justify scrapping the agreement, which he has called a \u201cterrible deal\u201d that he would have negotiated more skillfully, it does not preclude his own finding that Iran is in violation.In fact, Mr. Trump has several options to choose from.One is to simply scrap the existing accord, declaring that while Iran is in compliance with the letter of the agreement, it has violated the \u201cspirit\u2019\u2019 by continuing to test missiles, finance groups the United States considers terrorist organizations and operate in Syria and Iraq. The deal itself dealt only with Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, but Mr. Trump has said that was not enough to contain what he has called a growing Iranian threat.But the problems with that approach are several. It would free Iran up to produce as much enriched uranium or plutonium as it wishes, which is why Mr. Tillerson and his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have argued against withdrawal. Moreover, the action would ostracize the United States.Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, which also are parties to the agreement, have all expressed strong support for it and have warned that if Mr. Trump withdraws, the United States would be isolated on the issue.Another option would be to declare that Iran was in noncompliance but to keep enforcing the accord in any case, according to some administration officials. That would avoid a vote in Congress over reimposing sanctions, and it would probably defuse, or at least delay, a break with allies.A third option, administration officials say, is to set up what amounts to a test that Washington expects Iran to fail. That would involve providing intelligence information to the I.A.E.A that nuclear-related work \u2014 from enrichment to possible weapons research \u2014 is the basis for an inspection demand.So far, officials say, no such specific information has been turned over.There are other ways to press for further inspections. David Albright and Olli Heinonen, both former I.A.E.A. inspectors who have been highly critical of Iran, argued in an article published Thursday that the I.A.E.A. could make better use of provisions in the accord that enable verification that dual-use equipment \u2014 which could be used for civilian or weapons work \u2014 is properly accounted for.Others however, saw ulterior motives in any attempt by the administration to push for more aggressive inspections.Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based advocacy group, was critical of Ms. Haley for suggesting that Iran might be violating the deal \u2014 even though the United States had presented no evidence that Iran is hiding something nefarious.\u201cIt not necessary for the I.A.E.A. to inspect at random military sites without good cause or to just test Iran\u2019s cooperation,\u201d Mr. Kimball said. \u201cBy insisting that the I.A.E.A. seek access to unspecified \u2018military sites,\u2019 perhaps as a pretext for accusing Iran of noncooperation, Ambassador Haley is undermining the ability of the agency to get Iranian cooperation and access to key sites when it counts.\u201dMr. Trump has also accused Iran of flouting the United Nations Security Council resolution that put the agreement into effect, which calls on Iran not to test ballistic missiles. He has imposed new sanctions on Iran in response, which the Iranians have denounced as a violation of the nuclear agreement.Political analysts who once thought the accord would probably survive the Trump administration are less optimistic now.\u201cThe Trump administration simply doesn\u2019t like this agreement,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington.\u201cIt will continue to look for a way not to certify Iran\u2019s compliance in coming months,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said. \u201cAnd it will probably seek I.A.E.A. inspection of Iran\u2019s military facilities to an extent Iran deems intolerable. This deal is still in a lot of trouble.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Raises Pressure on Venezuela With New Financial Sanctions", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela on Friday, modestly ratcheting up the pressure on the embattled government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for increasingly repressive policies.The sanctions restrict trading of Venezuelan bonds sold by the government in the American financial markets to raise money. The effect could increase the likelihood of a Venezuelan default on its debts at the end of the year.The administration stopped short of prohibiting imports of Venezuelan crude oil to American refineries, which would almost certainly be a crippling step. American refiners have lobbied hard against sanctions against oil imports, arguing that they would raise fuel prices, slash profit margins and potentially cost oil company jobs along the Gulf Coast.Financial and political analysts said the new sanctions would not represent a lethal blow to Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. But many say its survival over the next year is in serious doubt, partly because of continuing problems raising money to pay interest on its onerous debts while paying for food imports.\u201cIt certainly sends a message,\u201d Risa Grais-Targow, the lead Venezuela analyst at Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consulting firm, said of the new sanctions. \u201cBut I would say in many ways it\u2019s not going to be that impactful because the Venezuela government effectively already lacks market access and hasn\u2019t been able to issue new debt for quite a while.\u201dThe new sanctions have broad loopholes, allowing for the financing of most commercial trade, including the export of American light crude oil to Venezuela for mixing with its heavy crude, and financing for humanitarian services to the Venezuelan people.Financing of import and export transactions of Pdvsa\u2019s American affiliate, Citgo, which has several refineries in the Gulf of Mexico along with a network of pipelines and gasoline stations, will also be exempted from the new sanctions. However, even while Citgo can still sell debt, it cannot directly send profits back to the Venezuelan government.\u201cThese measures are carefully calibrated,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, \u201cto deny the Maduro dictatorship a critical source of financing to maintain its illegitimate rule, protect the United States financial system from complicity in Venezuela\u2019s corruption and in the impoverishment of the Venezuelan people, and allow for humanitarian assistance.\u201dWhile limited, the move is the latest in a series of actions since Mr. Maduro\u2019s government held elections for a Constituent Assembly this month to circumvent the powers of the democratically elected Congress and rewrite the Constitution. The administration has placed financial sanctions on 20 leaders and individuals close to the government, including Mr. Maduro himself.President Trump has even suggested that the United States might consider military action in Venezuela. That possibility was strongly criticized in Latin America and the United States as a throwback to the days of Yankee imperialism.Still, top aides to Mr. Trump have been increasingly strident in their denunciations of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.\u201cWe will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,\u201d Ms. Sanders said as she announced the new executive order applying sanctions.Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, aimed her criticism directly at Mr. Maduro.\u201cWe will not stand for the dictatorship he\u2019s trying to create,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cand we will continue to take decisive action until he takes steps to return Venezuela to the prosperous democracy it once was.\u201dAside from political turbulence, Venezuela is suffering one of the worst economic crises in modern Latin American history. Hunger is common, store shelves are empty and oil production \u2014 the country\u2019s life blood \u2014 is in sharp decline. The government still has more than $9 billion in reserves, but those are quickly shrinking with $3.7 billion in loan payments due later this year.Venezuela has roughly $97 billion in foreign debt, strangling an economy that has been eroding for years, especially as oil prices have plummeted since 2014. The financial crisis is drawing the country closer to Russia, with the Russian oil company Rosneft supplying some financing to Pdvsa in exchange for exploration and production rights.The Trump administration has been debating whether to ban imports of Venezuelan oil for months, and officials say that option is still open. The United States buys roughly half of Venezuela\u2019s oil because many of its refineries were built to process heavy grades of crude that originate in Venezuela, Mexico and Canada. Few countries have refineries with ample capacity to refine Venezuela\u2019s heavy oil.Advertisement"}

Indigenous women were being murdered or were disappearing at an alarmingly high rate.Finally, a year ago, the new Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fulfilled a campaign promise and began the inquiry into the \u201congoing national tragedy\u201d that indigenous organizations and families of victims had long demanded. With a budget of 54 million Canadian dollars ($42 million U.S.), the National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was asked to explore the root causes of the violence, including the role of institutions like the police and child welfare services.Critics, most from indigenous communities, see the inquiry as just another government process that does not reflect their concerns and will change nothing. Another complaint is that the commission lacks authority to reopen closed cases.Defenders of the commission say it is understandable that people who have waited so long for the problem to be recognized are frustrated with the pace. The head of the panel, Marion Buller, a judge with indigenous roots, has said people simply expect too much from a commission that started from scratch. She has vowed to carry on.For years, Canada has struggled to come to grips with its mistreatment of indigenous populations. A truth and reconciliation commission that worked from 2008 through 2015 focused on a network of government-financed, church-run boarding schools that sought to assimilate indigenous children into the dominant culture. Many died or were sexually assaulted. Today, Canada\u2019s indigenous population, about 1.4 million people, has rates of poverty, imprisonment and suicide far higher than for the rest of Canada.All that makes for a formidable challenge. Trying to identify the causes, put an end to the tragedy and provide justice and healing was always bound to be a \u201cvery difficult process,\u201d as Mr. Trudeau recently acknowledged.The inquiry has had a rocky start, and it would do well to heed the calls of indigenous communities for more participation and openness. But even if the format and focus need adaptation, it is an inquiry that cannot be abandoned.Advertisement"}

The early investor Benchmark may be loath to give in to demands to sell its 13 percent stake. But it would help restore some stability and let the venture capital firm rake in billions of dollars.Benchmark, which led Uber\u2019s Series A funding round in early 2011, has injected nearly $30 million into the company, according to fellow shareholders. Now, though, it has turned to the courts to try to stop Uber\u2019s co-founder and former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, from participating in board business.Mr. Kalanick stepped down in June after a series of scandals and has not yet been replaced. The company is also looking for a chief operating officer, a finance chief and a general counsel, meaning it is ostensibly being run by more than a dozen top employees.Trouble is, Mr. Kalanick is still on the board, can stack it in his favor thanks to his supervoting stock and company bylaws, and is on the committee trying to find a new leader.Uber, meanwhile, is bleeding red ink, losing more than $700 million in the first quarter. That\u2019s despite controlling \u2014 with some $20 billion of bookings last year \u2014 around a fifth of the global taxi and limousine industry, according to Reuters Breakingviews estimates.Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit, though, adds to and prolongs the chaos and will make it even harder to find people willing to join the company as executives or directors.All things considered, that should make selling out appealing. Three other shareholders are already demanding that Benchmark leave the board and offload at least 75 percent of its holdings.SoftBank, among others, may be waiting in the wings. It may be valuing Uber at $45 billion. That\u2019s a 35 percent discount to Uber\u2019s current official worth. But it would still allow Benchmark to make $5.8 billion, almost 200 times its investment.Sure, Benchmark claims that Uber could easily be worth more than $100 billion in two years. Given the ride-hailing company\u2019s travails, though, that\u2019s a stretch. And it\u2019s a VC firm, not an activist investor. Cashing in and driving off in search of the next big thing has a lot of appeal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Warns Against Erasing Regulations Made After Financial Crisis", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, delivered a strong rebuttal on Friday to Republican criticism that financial regulation is impeding economic growth.In a speech that amounted to a warning to the Trump administration, Ms. Yellen said that people were forgetting the lessons of the crisis that began a decade ago.\u201cAlready, for some, memories of this experience may be fading \u2014 memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and why certain steps were taken in response,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen\u2019s forceful support for financial regulation may complicate her prospects for renomination as Fed chairwoman. Her four-year term ends in February, and President Trump has said he is considering whether to name someone else in her place. Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, whom Mr. Trump has described as a candidate for the Fed job, is an architect of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans.Speaking at an annual conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Ms. Yellen said increased regulation had strengthened the financial system. She said there was little evidence that regulation had reduced the availability of credit. But even if safety had come at some cost, she urged a focus on the bigger picture: Financial crises cause large declines in the availability of credit for virtually everyone.She also cautioned against overconfidence, noting that policy makers gathered at this same conference a decade ago were optimistic about the resilience of the system \u2014 which was even then in the process of falling apart. One goal of the changes enacted since the crisis is to guard against the problems that regulators do not anticipate.\u201cThe events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented and these reforms have made the system safer,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to reduce financial regulation. He told a round table of business leaders in February that his friends could not get loans.\u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,\u201d he said, referring to the 2010 law signed by President Barack Obama that strengthened financial regulation.Ms. Yellen, who rarely spoke about regulatory issues during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, has been increasingly outspoken in defense of those changes.Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory policy consulting firm, described the comments as a watershed moment for the Fed. Historically, she said, Fed officials have deferred to politicians on regulatory issues to preserve the Fed from a backlash that might limit its independence to make monetary policy.\u201cI think the Fischer-Yellen counterattack is unprecedented in its openness, and signals the strong commitment since the crisis by the Fed \u2014 at least this board \u2014 to a new dual mandate: macroeconomic growth and financial stability,\u201d she said.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, joined the chorus in a lunchtime address.\u201cThere is never a good time for having lax regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cAny reversal would call into question whether the lessons of the crisis have indeed been learned.\u201dBoth Ms. Yellen and Mr. Draghi took the day off from saying anything of substance about monetary policy, although Mr. Draghi said in response to a question that the European Central Bank needed to be \u201cvery patient\u201d in deciding how long to maintain its stimulus campaign.The world\u2019s major economies are all expanding for the first time since the financial crisis, but the pace of growth remains disappointingly slow. The annual conference here brings together officials from around the world, and much of the discussion has focused on ways to increase growth. There is a consensus that monetary policy has done what it can.Mr. Draghi argued that the developed world must remain committed to globalization, which he described as critical to future prosperity. The importance of trade \u201cmay actually be growing\u201d because developed nations must rely on innovation, particularly given the burdens of aging work forces and high levels of public debt. He highlighted research that shows openness to trade keeps national economies closer to the technological frontier.\u201cTo foster a dynamic global economy, we need to resist protectionist urges,\u201d he said.\u201cThe pain is real,\u201d said Ann Harrison, a University of Pennsylvania economist. \u201cThis may seem obvious to us, but for many decades, economists just assumed trade was win-win. And either there were no losers, or those losers were being appropriately compensated.\u201dThere was broad agreement that more should be done for those workers, but there were few ideas beyond better education and better jobs.Mostly, the economists gathered here expressed hope that people would embrace the broader benefits of trade rather than focusing on the narrow costs. \u201cAll I can hope is that we are having a pause in the progress toward peaceful economic integration,\u201d rather than a permanent decline, said John Van Reenen, an economics professor at M.I.T.In a similar vein, Ms. Yellen argued that the United States must remain committed to strong financial regulation to provide a stable foundation for economic growth.\u201cEnhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, thereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen extended an olive branch to the Trump administration, saying the Fed wanted to improve regulations, including easing the burden on smaller banks and reviewing restrictions on investment activity by larger banks. But she emphasized that she was not proposing the kind of major overhaul favored by Mr. Trump. \u201cAny adjustments to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks associated with the reforms put in place in recent years,\u201d she said.One specific difference concerns the Fed\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests\u201d of large financial institutions. Randal Quarles, nominated by Mr. Trump to serve as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman of supervision, has described the tests as too rigorous and too complicated. Ms. Yellen said testing \u201chas contributed to significant improvements in risk management.\u201dShe noted that large banks have shifted to a more stable mix of financing. Funding from equity investors, or capital, has doubled, while the least stable funding, short-term wholesale borrowing, has been cut roughly in half. \u201cBanks are safer,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grandpa Had a Pension. This Generation Has Cryptocurrency.", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuture TenseCryptocurrency has understandable appeal to millennials who came of age during the 2008 financial crisis and are now watching the rise of antiglobalist populism threaten the stability of the international economy.\u201cThere\u2019s a low cost for entry, you don\u2019t pay a lot of fees and millennials are the most tech-savvy,\u201d said John Guarco, 22, a recent Duke graduate living on Staten Island who, like most of the people interviewed for this article, asked that names of the coins in which he has invested not be published for fear of being targeted by hackers.Unlike previous generations, many of these greenhorn investors don\u2019t have pensions or 401(k)\u2019s, are mistrustful of socking money away in mutual funds and are fully accustomed to owning digital assets that have no concrete properties. As traditional paths to upper-middle-class stability are being blocked by debt, exorbitant housing costs and a shaky job market, these investors view cryptocurrency not only as a hedge against another Dow Jones crash, but also as the most rational \u2014 and even utopian \u2014 means of investing their money.Sebastian Dinges, 33, the director of operations for Cheeky, a company that makes mealtime products, started his first job after college in 2007. Once he had enough money to invest in the stock market, he said, he \u201cwanted to be risky and get a big return.\u201d Within six months, the market crashed.\u201cSo there\u2019s definitely disillusionment,\u201d he said.The majority of Mr. Dinges\u2019s holdings are now in cryptocurrency. His skepticism of traditional markets is shared by a number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts in his age bracket who have observed the recent political and economic upheavals.Mr. Wax was still in high school when the 2008 crisis unfolded, but he was paying attention to the headlines. So was Mr. Guarco, who said cryptocurrency was a \u201csafeguard against the volatility in the rest of the world.\u201d\u201cInvesting in cryptocurrencies is a hedge,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a period of long-term deregulation and tax cuts to the wealthiest. It\u2019s not the best recipe for stability.\u201dMr. Wax also invests in cryptocurrency to shore up his finances as a freelancer in the precarious music industry.\u201cI constantly feel like I\u2019m looking over the edge of a cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of money just sitting in a savings account \u2014 with the way inflation works and how low interest rates are, you\u2019re losing money. There\u2019s less money than there\u2019s ever been in the history of recorded music, so that gives me anxiety. It\u2019s weird to say that owning cryptocurrency soothes that anxiety, because it\u2019s counterintuitive, but it does.\u201dNevertheless, it\u2019s not just twentysomethings in the gig economy who are losing faith in traditional investment tools. Mr. Ginn quit working at Fidelity Investments the day before the market crash in 2008.\u201cIt\u2019s not investing,\u201d he said of his old job. \u201cIt\u2019s just sticking money somewhere. The investment advisory industry has to give out watered-down, averaged-out advice. When you get into mutual funds, you lose a lot of the ability to beat the markets.\u201dTom Berg, 44, a founder of BloKtek Capital in Northbrook, Ill., which invests in digital currencies and assets, said: \u201cI got out of the stock market years ago. \u201cMy personal opinion was I\u2019m not going to fight for 2 or 3 percent. It\u2019s a conservative place.\u201d By contrast, digital currencies \u2014 his preferred term to cryptocurrency, which he says carries the stigma of black-market money laundering \u2014 have disrupted the internet and created a major opportunity for those willing to jump in early, Mr. Berg believes. \u201cAt first it was an internet of information,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it evolved to an internet of things \u2014 social media, I can buy this, I can sell stuff. Now it\u2019s the internet of value.\u201dIn his view, cryptocurrency left the \u201cdark ages\u201d six months ago, when it was still the domain of \u201ca lot of people who believed in anarchy.\u201d He thinks that cryptocurrency is a good five years from going mainstream and that the bubble will burst some time after that, at which point he will sell his assets.\u201cIf my landscaper ever asks me about crypto, that\u2019s the day I get out,\u201d he said.Assuming one\u2019s money is protected, there are, of course, the standard risks of investing, amplified by the volatility of cryptocurrency. It\u2019s common for a coin to fluctuate double-digit percentages within a day, often because of \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d techniques from coordinated users trying to manipulate prices in completely unregulated free markets.\u201cThis is a great opportunity to pull it out and put it toward fixing the house,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the future potential is not worth it.\u201dMr. Berg would agree, advising BloKtek Capital clients to \u201cset it and forget it\u201d and not fall prey to the temptation to make short-term transactions.\u201cMy wife and I use it as our bank account,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery paycheck, we put a percentage into long-term holdings. We do not expect to become rich overnight. That\u2019s a way to become very poor in one hour.\u201d (Though his wife works at his company, it bears mentioning here that the vast majority of cryptocurrency investors seem to be male, and their Twitter discourse tends to be less than refined, with insults often lodged at devotees of rival currencies.)Even those in it for the long haul, however, admit to monitoring the prices compulsively, scratching the gambler\u2019s itch.\u201cIf I have a moment where the price has left my mind, I\u2019ll want to reinsert it,\u201d Mr. Wax, the record producer, said. \u201cI check it as much as any social media. It\u2019s become as distracting as anything else on my phone.\u201dAs he works in the cryptocurrency world, Mr. Berg maintains an even more observant \u2014 and most likely exhausting \u2014 regimen.\u201cI\u2019m always watching the markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe saying is, \u2018Crypto never sleeps.\u2019 It\u2019s 24/7, it\u2019s global, it doesn\u2019t have a stock market, it doesn\u2019t have a bell.\u201cI sleep about four hours a day.\u201d\u201cThe financial gain is fun, but it\u2019s really about improving the world, improving the financial system, transparency, cost, increased speed,\u201d Mr. Ginn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the double-sided tape for society. When financial markets collapse, the tape rips people apart and you have a system collapse. Finance got away with it in \u201908; it almost took the world down, and nothing changed.\u201d In lieu of more stringent government oversight, he believes that Ripple can help \u201creduce systemic risk.\u201dThat safety-net altruism drives Yoni Saltzman, 24, who designs robotic mechanisms for aerospace and medical applications. Mr. Saltzman has holdings in four different cryptocurrencies and is working with a small team in New York to develop a digital coin it hopes to introduce within a year. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like the idea of not only changing the world, but saving the world.\u201dThis is, of course, the same vaguely idealistic rationale Silicon Valley executives routinely trot out to justify their ventures, not all of which seem especially concerned with the greater good. In the meantime, those who have boarded the crypto-train frequently proselytize to friends and family. Unsurprisingly, they have more luck with their younger peers. Mr. Guarco, the Duke graduate, has persuaded a few friends to take the plunge.His older relatives, however, unaccustomed to coins that one can\u2019t pluck out of a lint-filled pocket, are a harder sell.\u201cThey usually respond, \u2018Crypto-what?\u2019\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article omitted an explanation of the online term \u201chodl,\u201d which has come to mean \u201chold on for dear life.\u201d It was originally a misspelling of \u201chold,\u201d not an acronym.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Coding Boot Camps Close, the Field Faces a Reality Check", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "Successful schools, analysts say, will increasingly be the ones that expand their programs to suit the changing needs of employers.Supported byIn the last five years, dozens of schools have popped up offering an unusual promise: Even humanities graduates can learn how to code in a few months and join the high-paying digital economy. Students and their hopeful parents shelled out as much as $26,000 seeking to jump-start a career.But the coding boot-camp field now faces a sobering moment, as two large schools have announced plans to shut down this year \u2014 despite backing by major for-profit education companies, Kaplan and the Apollo Education Group, the parent of the University of Phoenix.The closings are a sign that years of heady growth led to a boot-camp glut, and that the field could be in the early stages of a shakeout.The demand from employers is shifting and the schools must adapt. Many boot camps have not evolved beyond courses in basic web development, but companies are now often looking for more advanced coding skills.It is now closing at the end of the year.Tarlin Ray, who became president of Dev Bootcamp in April, said in an email that the school offered \u201ca high-quality program\u201d that helped thousands of people join the high-tech economy. \u201cBut we were simply unable to find a sustainable business model,\u201d he wrote.Iron Yard echoed that theme. In an email, Lelia King, a spokeswoman, said that while students benefited, the company was \u201cultimately unable to sustain our current business model.\u201dBoot camp courses, aimed at adults, vary in length and cost. Some can take 26 weeks or more, and tuition can reach $26,000. The average course length is just over 14 weeks, and the average cost is $11,400, according to Course Report.The successful schools, analysts say, will increasingly be ones that expand their programs to suit the changing needs of employers. Some have already added courses like data science, artificial intelligence, digital marketing and project management. Other steps include tailoring courses for corporations, which need to update the skills of their workers, or develop online courses.The promise of boot camps is that they are on-ramps to good jobs. But rapid expansion into new cities can leave little time to forge ties with nearby companies, the hiring market for boot camp graduates, said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.That message was underlined by Mr. Ray of Dev Bootcamp. While he would not discuss specifics about what happened to his school, he wrote: \u201cWe do think that as the boot camp industry continues on, it will be important to create stronger alignment with employers.\u201d\u201cEmployer-paid programs are now a big slice of the pie\u201d for General Assembly, about half of its business, said Jake Schwartz, its chief executive.Kaplan is not closing Metis, a data science boot camp, which has corporate training programs.Several boot camps are deploying \u201cblended\u201d models with both in-person and online teaching. Entirely online courses, in theory, could deliver rapid, profitable growth. But that is a different model from the immersive, face-to-face learning that has been the hallmark of the boot camp experience.\u201cOnline boot camp is an oxymoron,\u201d said Mr. Craig of University Ventures. \u201cNo one has figured out how to do that yet.\u201dIn late 2015, the co-founders, Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum, decided to try an online-only offering, Learn.co. The tuition is $1,500 a month. Students go at their own pace, and on average complete the course in seven months, putting in about 800 hours. Tuition charges stop after eight months \u2014 and there are instructors online 16 hours a day for help and advice.Kailee Gray, 29, a math instructor in Fargo, N.D., seeking a career change, said she had communicated daily with instructors and participated in online study groups. On the night before a job interview, she recalled \u201cgetting panicked\u201d and sent a message to an instructor. Soon, Rebekah Rombom, vice president for career services at Flatiron, was on the phone for a reassuring pep talk.It seems a particularly high rate for an online course, especially when compared with free online courses, which only a small proportion of students complete.But just how much is uncertain. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that they can do it at the scale they have,\u201d said Thomas Eisenmann, a professor and lead author of the study. \u201cWhat\u2019s not clear is whether it can go from a hundred or a few hundred to thousands and thousands.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

Ron Lieber, The Times\u2019s Your Money columnist, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Personal finance is indeed deeply personal, and I\u2019ve found over the years that I learn as much from the people who read my work as I do from sources. To tap into that wisdom, I often open up comments on my column and moderate them myself, replying along the way to questions or particularly provocative statements.But because mine is a weekend column and there are sometimes hundreds of comments to approve by hand, I need to have a laptop with me wherever I go in order to keep up, and the lighter the better. So I lean hard on my MacBook Air (and really abuse the Samsonite Xenon backpack I use to lug it around).What do you like about it, and what could be better?A while back, I heard the author Gretchen Rubin say something enlightening about how much happier she was when she realized she could have multiple phone chargers and laptop cords instead of just one. I bought myself a Chromebook to use for office meetings (to go with my desktop machine at work and the Mac at home) so I wasn\u2019t lugging the Mac around on the subway even more than I already do.What\u2019s your favorite fintech app, and why?I love being able to scan checks and deposit them without doing the whole envelope, stamp, mailbox routine. I haven\u2019t maintained checking accounts at banks with branches in over 15 years, and this helps me keep the streak going. I do find it rather curious, however, that Charles Schwab can suck that paper through the air and into my checking account without much delay but still helps itself to a four-day hold on transfers from my external savings account.I have a saying \u2014 more like a lament \u2014 that I repeat so often that I\u2019ve turned it into a hashtag: Nothing is simple or easy. (Nothing!) #Nisoe. Technology has come a long way, but it is almost never as simple as its marketers suggest. My wife and I have rarely managed to touch any aspect of our audiovisual setup in our apartment without needing to pay someone to actually make it work. Now, hiring tech support in this way is reflexive \u2014 a pre-emptive way to buy back time that would surely be lost in figuring the whole thing out and probably failing. So I encourage people to budget for that, whether in hours or dollars.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life, and what do you and your family do with it?Why is Spotify better than alternatives like Apple Music?I haven\u2019t tried Apple Music, so I\u2019m not sure if it would be any better at this, but it would be neat to be able to post these spontaneous playlists to Facebook with some kind of natural language command so that people could play them with just one click. Why can\u2019t I type (or speak) something obviously recognizable, like \u201ctake the last six songs I played and post them to my Facebook account\u201d and have it just happen?If you could dream up a gadget or app that has yet to exist, what would it be and how much would you be willing to pay for it?I don\u2019t even know where to start here. Let\u2019s go from cheap to expensive.A voice (or foot!) operated screen door for when your hands are filled with grilled food or dirty dishes: $10.An app for all kids\u2019 first phones that allows them to help when they see someone on the street in need of help. Hit one button, and $1 moves from their allowance app to the nearest homeless shelter or food bank. I\u2019d pay $20 for this, but maybe Apple or Google will figure this out themselves and give it away in their app stores.And how about an app that finally lets me store all of the restaurants I want to try, so I can pull it up whenever I get hungry to remind myself of what is nearby or at the location that I\u2019m heading to? Maybe $25 for this one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Race for Mayor Looks So Sad", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFive men are on the ballot for New York City mayor in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary. (In writing this, we first checked the calendar to make sure it was 2017. Not a single woman, or for that matter, a single nonwhite candidate, is in the race for the party\u2019s nomination.) Of the five, only two took part in a televised debate at a Manhattan theater Wednesday evening: Mayor Bill de Blasio and his presumed main opponent, Sal Albanese. The others had not raised enough money to qualify to be on that stage.There is logic in setting a dollar minimum to show that a candidate has a detectable political pulse. But it puts a price tag on the democratic process, particularly troubling in a city where affordability is a dominant concern. \u201cThresholds deprive the voters of choices,\u201d said Jerry Goldfeder, a New York election lawyer. As for defining a candidate\u2019s seriousness, he said, \u201cthe electorate loves to surprise pundits.\u201dSince Mr. de Blasio\u2019s other challengers collected enough signatures on nominating petitions to qualify to run, why exclude them from a debate, whether the one on Wednesday or a follow-up set for Sept. 6? Granted, relying solely on signatures could foster a come-one come-all spirit, with debates then including oddballs whose entertainment value far exceeds their political viability. That\u2019s been known to happen. It would probably also lead to well-heeled candidates challenging every jot and tittle of their poorer rivals\u2019 petitions \u2014 a familiar, unsavory practice in New York.This has been an uninspired mayoral race. None of the mayor\u2019s opponents qualify as household names \u2014 not Richard Bashner, a community board member in Brooklyn; not Michael Tolkin, a technology entrepreneur; not Mr. Gangi; not even Mr. Albanese, though he has run for mayor twice before. The last time, in 2013, he got less than 1 percent of the vote in a crowded Democratic primary.Voter-approved limits that confine city officeholders to two four-year terms might also have had an unfortunate effect. Better-known Democrats who already hold elective office and could have been stronger competitors apparently decided to wait Mr. de Blasio out. Assuming Mr. de Blasio wins re-election, he must leave City Hall at the end of 2021. Some political scientists are convinced that without term limits, and denied the option of avoiding an incumbent, a few of those officials \u2014 like Representative Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn and Queens or the city comptroller, Scott Stringer \u2014 might have been tempted to take on the mayor now.Given the weak field, more inclusive debates could give challengers a better chance. Early in the 2013 election cycle, debates helped lift a mayoral contender who barely cracked 10 percent in polls. His name was Bill de Blasio.Advertisement"}

Days later it opposed tougher screening of Chinese investments in Europe.Greece\u2019s diplomatic stance hardly went unnoticed by its European partners or by the United States, all of which had previously worried that the country\u2019s economic vulnerability might make it a ripe target for Russia, always eager to divide the bloc.Instead, it is the Chinese who have become an increasingly powerful foreign player in Greece after years of assiduous courtship and checkbook diplomacy.Among those initiatives, China plans to make the Greek port of Piraeus the \u201cdragon head\u201d of its vast \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d project, a new Silk Road into Europe.When Germany treated Greece as the eurozone\u2019s delinquent, China designated a recovery-hungry Greece its \u201cmost reliable friend\u201d in Europe.\u201cWhile the Europeans are acting towards Greece like medieval leeches, the Chinese keep bringing money,\u201d said Costas Douzinas, the head of the Greek Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs and defense committee and a member of the governing Syriza party.China has already used its economic muscle to stamp a major geopolitical footprint in Africa and South America as it scours the globe for natural resources to fuel its economy. If China was initially welcomed as a deep-pocketed investor \u2014 and an alternative to America \u2014 it has faced growing criticism that it is less an economic partner than a 21st-century incarnation of a colonialist power.If not looking for natural resources in Europe, China has for years invested heavily across the bloc, its largest trading partner. Yet now concerns are rising that Beijing is using its economic clout for political leverage.Mr. Douzinas said China had never explicitly asked Greece for support on the human rights vote or on other sensitive issues, though he and other Greek officials acknowledge that explicit requests are not necessary.\u201cIf you\u2019re down and someone slaps you and someone else gives you an alm,\u201d Mr. Douzinas said, \u201cwhen you can do something in return, who will you help, the one who helped you or the one who slapped you?\u201dThe Trump administration, recognizing it has a geopolitical and economic challenger, recently intervened to help lift an American deal over a Chinese competitor \u2014 and the Greeks seemed happy to play one power off the other.E.U. officials are concerned that China is buying silence on human rights issues and undermining the bloc\u2019s ability to speak with one voice. Analysts say China targets smaller countries in need of cash, among them Spain, Portugal and others that suffered in the financial crisis. Hungary, where China is pledging to spend billions on a railway, also blocked the E.U. statement on the South China Sea.Many analysts have noted that Greece\u2019s human rights veto came as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras returned from a summit meeting in Beijing in May, where he signed billions of euros\u2019 worth of new investment memorandums with Chinese companies.Greek officials insisted that, despite all the Chinese investments, the country identified with, and was loyal to, the E.U. and did not do China\u2019s bidding. Some European officials are not so sure.\u201cThe Greek government needs to choose where its alliances lie and realize the E.U. is not only a market, but first and foremost a community of values,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a prominent member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands.Over the summer, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tightened rules to limit takeovers of German strategic assets, a move aimed at Chinese state-backed firms. As Ms. Merkel put it to a German newspaper after Greece\u2019s vote blocking the condemnation of Chinese human rights violations, Europe \u201chas to speak with China in one voice.\u201dShe added that China\u2019s economic might allowed it to pressure weaker European nations. \u201cSeen from Beijing,\u201d she added, \u201cEurope is an Asian peninsula.\u201dIn January 2015, Greek voters shook Europe by electing the radical leftist Syriza party and its leader, Mr. Tsipras. He had campaigned to end the austerity measures of the E.U. and halt privatizations like the port of Piraeus. Boisterous protesters spilled into Athens, waving Syriza flags and denouncing the European power centers, Brussels and Berlin.But it was Beijing that became quietly nervous. China\u2019s years of laborious and expensive spadework in Greece suddenly seemed imperiled, especially its investments in Piraeus.Immediately after Mr. Tsipras took office, the Chinese ambassador, Zou Xiaoli, became the first foreign official to pay him a visit. Mr. Zou pressed Mr. Tsipras to honor the previous Greek government\u2019s commitments to privatize Piraeus, according to several people with knowledge of the meeting.Back in Beijing, Chinese officials expressed displeasure, and the state-run news media ran articles questioning Greece\u2019s friendship with China. Less than a week later, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, telephoned Mr. Tsipras to make sure there were no more misunderstandings.In response, Mr. Tsipras and his deputies announced an \u201cupgrading of relations between Greece and China.\u201d Within weeks, three Chinese frigates arrived in Piraeus port. At a ceremony, Mr. Tsipras affirmed Greece\u2019s intent to \u201cserve as China\u2019s gateway into Europe.\u201dEven as Berlin and Brussels grow wary of Chinese investment, Greece may not care, after suffering under German-enforced austerity attached to the international bailouts that have kept the country afloat since the 2010 debt crisis.In 2010, as creditors demanded the gutting of pensions and sharp tax increases, the Chinese offered to buy toxic Greek government bonds. In 2013, as Greece became increasingly subject to creditor budget restrictions, the Chinese spent freely on Greek assets.In turn, Greece has sometimes been a voice in the room at the E.U. for China on sensitive issues \u2014 although government officials insist Greece remains loyal to the bloc and to NATO, and is only seeking to strike a balance in a shifting world.As for scuttling the E.U. statement on China\u2019s human rights violations \u2014 the first time in a decade the bloc was silenced \u2014 government officials said Greece viewed the E.U. approach as \u201cunproductive.\u201d After the vote, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry applauded \u201cthe relevant E.U. country for sticking to the right position.\u201dAlong more than 20 miles of coastline outside Athens, a forest of cranes at the Piraeus port load and unload thousands of containers from China and around the world. An ultramodern floating dock is scheduled for arrival in November from China. A planned new Chinese-financed passenger hub is also in the works.China has transformed Piraeus into the Mediterranean\u2019s busiest port, investing nearly half a billion euros through the state-backed shipping conglomerate Cosco. It hopes to make Piraeus the entry point to Europe under its One Belt, One Road project.Chinese goods would travel along a new network of railways and roads radiating up through Central European nations, with the prized destination being Germany, where China invested $12 billion last year alone.In the middle of the port, Chinese, Greek and E.U. flags flutter in front of the headquarters of Cosco, which now controls the entire waterfront through its 67 percent stake in the port.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of neocolonialism without the gunboats,\u201d said Mr. Douzinas with a chuckle.Greek officials note that, unlike democratic nations that change politicians every few years, the Chinese have a long and steady strategic view.\u201cThey know what they want,\u201d said Stergios Pitsiorlas, the Greek deputy economics minister and one of the government\u2019s point men dealing with China.Cosco has brought around 1,000 jobs to the area, but it has outfitted cargo docks with cranes made in China, not in Greece, and expanded the docks with building materials from China. And as Greece struggles through record joblessness, the company has used subcontractors to hire around 1,500 workers mostly on short-term contracts at wages far below what unionized Greek dockworkers are paid.\u201cThere are more workers, but they earn less income,\u201d said Giorgos Gogos, the general secretary of the Piraeus dockworkers union.Yet Greece needs any jobs, and leaders are counting on more Chinese investment. Fosun International Holdings, a Chinese conglomerate run by Guo Guangchang, often referred to as China\u2019s Warren Buffett, is spending billions of euros with a consortium with Greek and Arab investors to convert an abandoned former airport on the seaside outside Athens into a posh playground three times the size of Monaco for moneyed tourists. The project, Hellenikon, is part of a bigger plan to bring over 1.5 million Chinese tourists to Greece during the next five years.Mr. Tsipras has swept aside regulatory hurdles, clearing two large refugee camps installed in the former airport, and quashing attempts by members of his own party to delay construction because of concerns the project might pave over ancient archaeological sites.\u201cThat also has been unstuck,\u201d said Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, the Greek economy minister.After World War II, the benefactor showering millions on Greece was the United States, courtesy of the Marshall Plan. America\u2019s role in Greece wasn\u2019t always popular \u2014 especially its support for the country\u2019s military dictatorship during the Cold War \u2014 but the United States was regarded as the gold standard for economic opportunity. Not so much anymore.When former President Obama visited Greece last November on his final foreign trip, some Syriza officials, bitter that his administration had not intervened more forcefully during the financial crisis, mocked his speech as a funeral oration for his own legacy, worthy of Pericles.Privately, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers said the trip also served to demonstrate, somewhat belatedly, American engagement in Greece in the face of Russian meddling in the region.But it was China that was most deeply entrenched. Eliot Engel, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described a \u201cfree-for-all for rogue countries\u201d in Greece.\u201cWe see it with Russia and we see it with China,\u201d he said as he attended a July 4 party at the United States ambassador\u2019s residence in Athens, part of a congressional delegation that had come to drum up business for American companies. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for America to be engaged in the world.\u201dMr. Tsipras is trying to play both sides. Having traveled twice in a year to Beijing to meet the Chinese president and attend One Belt, One Road forums to draw investment, he has recently welcomed American businessmen and promoted Greece\u2019s recovery to American lawmakers.In May, when Fosun and two other Chinese companies bid to take over a major Greek insurer, the United States commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross, intervened to help push the deal into the hands of Calamos Investments, a Greek-American consortium whose chief executive is a backer of President Trump. The Exin Group, a Dutch partnership with Calamos, eventually won the bid.\u201cHe sent us a letter asking us to look at Calamos,\u201d said Mr. Papadimitriou, the economy minister. Any deal, Mr. Ross implied in the letter, \u201ccould be the beginning of more investments in Greece,\u201d Mr. Papadimitriou recalled.Some Greek government officials cited Fosun\u2019s defeat as evidence that Athens wasn\u2019t under China\u2019s sway.\u201cWe are sensitive to being viewed as someone else\u2019s colony,\u201d said Panagiotis Kouroumblis, Greece\u2019s maritime minister. \u201cNothing can move forward without the agreement of the Greek state.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the Chinese ambassador, Zou Xiaoli.

{"Headline": "Covering the Health Care Debate Through Four Administrations", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One of the remarkable features of covering the congressional battle over health care this year has been the way reporters pieced together a picture of what was happening from snippets of information extracted from members of Congress dashing through the Capitol.At times, I felt as if I were in a time machine \u2014 reliving, in reverse, my previous reporting for The New York Times on the laborious legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. Reporters roamed the halls like hunters and sprang into action with voice recorders in hand when a senator emerged from the Senate chamber, an elevator or a subway car, or an unmarked hideaway office.It was not unusual to see more than a dozen reporters surrounding or chasing after senators who appeared to be thinking out loud as they responded last week to questions about the latest iteration of the Senate Republican health plan. Republican senators themselves often professed to be in the dark about crucial details. But from the scattered clues they offered \u2014 like tiles of a mosaic \u2014 journalists assembled a picture of what was happening behind the scenes.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, for example, disclosed that Senate Republicans were planning to drop a tax cut for high-income people that had been included in a bill passed by the House and in a measure drafted by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who eventually cast a decisive vote against the Republican health plan last week, had hinted at the bill\u2019s problems in a corridor conversation with journalists a month earlier. Asked about the chances of a quick deal on health care, Mr. McCain remarked, \u201cPigs could fly.\u201dIn bird-dogging senators, I worked with one of our ace congressional correspondents, Thomas Kaplan, who honed his skills prying secrets out of the New York State Legislature. We deployed two interns, Emily Cochrane and Avantika Chilkoti, to help track the fast-moving events.The Senate vote occurred at 1:30 a.m. on Friday and lasted about 15 minutes. It was strange to watch such riveting drama in the middle of the night. But it was speedy compared with the all-nighter in November 2003, when the House approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare. That vote started at 3 a.m. and lasted nearly three hours as Republican leaders quashed an uprising by committed conservatives.In 2009 and 2010, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats basically knew what they wanted: a government guarantee of health insurance for all Americans. They disagreed on some important details. But Democrats had much more consensus than today\u2019s Republicans.The differences between President Trump and Mr. Obama are obvious. Mr. Trump floated above the gritty details of health policy and took occasional jabs at Republicans slaving over the issue. Mr. Obama immersed himself in the details, and his top aides occasionally reached out to journalists to provide tart-tongued tutorials on the politics of health care.In some ways, the collapse of Republican efforts to uproot the Affordable Care Act recalled the last days of the \u201cClinton Care\u201d effort to remake the American health care system. It appeared to be moribund, but its champions vowed to keep trying. It finally expired on the Senate floor in 1994. (That defeat inspired Democrats to try again 15 years later.)The four rounds of health care legislating have one thing in common: the passion that surrounds the issue.Cancer survivors, children with disabilities and young adults with diseases converged on Congress in a bid to save the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers, listening to their stories, were clearly moved. I had never heard members of Congress speak with such empathy on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries or drug addicts, whose treatment was financed by Medicaid.But for every such testimonial, Republicans could cite reports from constituents aggrieved by the law: people who said they were spending more on health insurance premiums than on home mortgage payments, and \u201cvictims of Obamacare\u201d who could not afford to use their insurance because the deductibles were so high.The lawmakers were, in a sense, deciding who would live and who would die \u2014 but they had alternate versions of reality that could simply not be reconciled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Health Care Victory, Senate Democrats Seek Compromise on Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Emboldened by the failure of Republicans to pass health care legislation on their own, Senate Democrats are seizing the opportunity to influence the coming overhaul of the tax code with a call for bipartisanship.But the overture got a frosty reception from Republicans on Tuesday despite recent musings about working across party lines.On Tuesday, 45 Senate Democrats sent a letter to President Trump; the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell; and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, urging them to work with Democrats on a tax plan.The Democrats are reaching out as they have been trying to revamp their populist economic agenda and while Republicans are reeling from their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Both parties are thinking about the Republicans\u2019 ability to press ahead with their agenda while maintaining strict partisan lines.\u201cWe are confident that, by working together, we could modernize our tax system to increase working families\u2019 wages, improve middle-class job growth, promote domestic investment, modernize our outdated business and international tax system and put in place sound fiscal policy,\u201d the group wrote.Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, organized the drafting of the letter, which lays out their priorities. Three Democratic senators who are up for re-election next year \u2014 Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 did not sign the letter. They could be ripe targets for Republicans looking for Democrats to get on board with their tax plan.Despite the outreach, bipartisanship will not come easy.On taxes, Democrats tend to favor raising taxes on the rich to pay for cuts that would reduce tax rates for middle-income families. The parties are in closer agreement on changes to the corporate tax system, but Democrats argue that the cuts Republicans are proposing are far too deep.In the conditions laid out in their letter, the Democrats insisted that changes to tax laws not increase the tax burden on the middle class and that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers not see their tax bills shrink.They also insisted that Republicans return to \u201cregular order\u201d and not try to push a tax bill through Congress using budget reconciliation rules that require only a simple majority in the Senate.Finally, they want a rewrite of the tax code that does not add to the deficit and is not paid for with cuts to programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.For much of this year, Democrats have criticized the proposed tax policies of Republicans as giveaways to the rich. It was clear on Tuesday that Republicans are not eager to let Democrats meddle with their plans for a tax overhaul, even if they would welcome a few of their votes.\u201cWe will need to use reconciliation because we have been informed by the majority of the Democrats in a letter I just received today that most of the principles that would get the country growing again, they\u2019re not interested in addressing,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, leaving the option for Democrats to support a Republican-led tax plan. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think this is going to be 1986 when you had a bipartisan effort to scrub the code.\u201dFor its part, the Trump administration has been more vocal this week about the importance of attracting some Democrats to its tax plan. At a gathering on Monday of conservative activists sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, the political network of the Koch brothers, Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, made the case that Democrats need to be brought into the fold. The Republican majority in the Senate, he said, was too slim for party members to count only on one another.\u201cWe ask your help, actually, reaching out to Democrats as well,\u201d Mr. Short said, noting the ones who are coming up for re-election. \u201cIf they hear from their constituents that they need tax reform, that\u2019s going to be a very strong selling point.\u201dIt remains unclear how enthusiastic Democrats really would be to make compromises with Republicans that would allow Mr. Trump to score a major legislative victory. In the battle over the Affordable Care Act, even potentially vulnerable Democratic senators from states that the president won last year held firm in their opposition to the repeal of the health care law.Relegated to the minority, however, Democrats are trying to stake out the moral high ground. Mr. Schumer warned on Tuesday that Republicans could suffer the same fate on taxes that they did on health care if they continue to operate alone.\u201cThere\u2019s real potential for bipartisan support on tax reform, but I think our Republican colleagues, dictated by the Koch brothers hard right wing of their party, is running away from it,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThey say tax reform is hard, and it is. But it\u2019s a lot harder if Republicans try to do it all by themselves.\u201dCooperation between the parties will be necessary for Congress to deal with more immediately pressing legislative priorities. The debt ceiling must be lifted by the end of September, and Mr. Schumer, Mr. McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin huddled on Tuesday morning to discuss the way forward.Although Mr. Mnuchin and Democrats want a \u201cclean\u201d lift of the statutory borrowing limit, many Republicans are pushing for spending cuts or changes to budget process to be linked to any legislation.No breakthrough was made on that issue.Advertisement"}
