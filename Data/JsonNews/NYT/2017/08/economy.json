{"Headline": "European Central Bank Chief Says Monetary Policy Must Stay \u2018Very Patient\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said Friday that monetary policy must remain \u201cvery patient\u201d even as an economic recovery finally takes hold in Europe.\u201cA significant degree of monetary accommodation is still warranted,\u201d he said.The importance of trade \u201cmay actually be growing\u201d because developed nations must rely on innovation as a source of growth, Mr. Draghi said, particularly given the burdens of aging work forces and high levels of public debt. He highlighted research that shows openness to trade keeps national economies closer to the technological frontier.\u201cTo foster a dynamic global economy, we need to resist protectionist urges,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi spoke at an annual conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, at which the morning sessions were substantially devoted to research showing that trade has important negative consequences that policy makers have failed to address.\u201cThe pain is real,\u201d said Ann Harrison, a University of Pennsylvania economist. \u201cThis may seem obvious to us, but for many decades, economists just assumed trade was win-win. And either there were no losers, or those losers were being appropriately compensated.\u201dMr. Draghi acknowledged that many people are angry about trade.\u201cThe social consensus on open markets has however been weakening in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are concerned about whether openness is fair, whether it is safe and whether it is equitable.\u201dAn economic expansion has taken hold across the developed world, but the pace of growth remains slow by historical standards. Mr. Draghi noted that potential growth in the developed world has slowed to 1 percent from an average of 2 percent in 2000.Mr. Draghi said policy makers need to focus on increasing dynamism. \u201cA turn toward protectionism would pose a serious risk for continued productivity growth,\u201d he said.He said policy makers must address those concerns both at the national level and by improving cooperation among nations, and that some of the concerns stem from a lack of trust that other nations are engaged in fair competition. Mr. Draghi noted that encouraging trade and economic integration was one reason for the creation of the European Union.Anti-trade speech has so far outpaced measures to restrict trade, but Mr. Draghi and other speakers said it was critical to ensure that a slowdown did not become a turning point.Much of the discussion focused on the need for policies to help workers whose jobs are lost to foreign competition \u2014 but there were few concrete solutions on offer. The most popular suggestion was that workers should seek better educations, then new jobs.Mostly, the economists gathered here expressed hope that people would embrace the broader benefits of trade rather than focusing on the narrow costs.\u201cAll I can hope is that we are having a pause in the progress toward peaceful economic integration,\u201d rather than a permanent decline, said John Van Reenen, an economics professor at M.I.T.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How This U.S. Tech Giant Is Backing China\u2019s Tech Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Chinese government develops drones, the American technology giant Qualcomm is helping. The same goes for artificial intelligence, mobile technology and supercomputers. Qualcomm is also working to help Chinese companies like Huawei break into overseas markets in support of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands.Qualcomm is providing money, expertise and engineering for Beijing\u2019s master plan to create its own technology superpowers.Big American companies fiercely protect their intellectual property and trade secrets, fearful of giving an edge to rivals. But they have little choice in China \u2014 and Washington is looking on with alarm.To gain access to the Chinese market, American companies are being forced to transfer technology, create joint ventures, lower prices and aid homegrown players. Those efforts form the backbone of President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious plan to ensure that China\u2019s companies, military and government dominate core areas of technology like artificial intelligence and semiconductors.Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are working with Chinese companies to develop server chips, creating rivals to their own product. Intel is working with the Chinese to build high-end mobile chips, in competition with Qualcomm. IBM has agreed to transfer valuable technology that could enable China to break into the lucrative mainframe banking business.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of unease in Washington,\u201d said James Lewis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThe defense, intelligence agencies and others are concerned that advanced chip-making capabilities are going to China.\u201dQualcomm declined to comment, as did Intel.Qualcomm is caught in the middle.The world\u2019s dominant mobile phone chip maker, Qualcomm ran afoul of the Chinese government, getting hit in 2015 with a record $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior. To get back in Beijing\u2019s good graces, the company agreed to lower its prices in China, promised to shift more of its high-end manufacturing to partners in China, and pledged to upgrade the country\u2019s technology capabilities.The extent of Qualcomm\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government \u2014 and the complications for American tech giants \u2014 is seen in a low-slung office building in the southwest part of the country. There, a team of engineers is developing leading-edge microchips to compete with the finest made by Intel. The chips will help power a huge data and cloud center with the potential to strengthen the country\u2019s computing capabilities. No longer content to rely on buying the chips that go into cellphones, computers and cars, China now wants to design and build the brains that drive much of the digital world.The government is providing land and financing to the start-up formed with Qualcomm, called Huaxintong Semiconductor. Qualcomm has provided the technology and about $140 million in initial funding.\u201cQualcomm has a balancing act,\u201d said Willy Shih, who teaches at Harvard Business School. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s PCs are made in China, and most of the world\u2019s smartphones too, so they have to play along. It\u2019s a fact of life.\u201dQualcomm was early to break into China.In the mid-1990s, as China\u2019s economy began to boom, President Bill Clinton pressed the country\u2019s leaders to open to American technology companies.Members of the Clinton administration, including Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce, were dispatched to Beijing to hammer out the details. They pushed for one company by name: Qualcomm.\u201cAt the time, they were the only U.S. show in town,\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said.\u201cBill Daley and I pushed the Chinese hard on accepting the U.S. standard for wireless technology,\u201d she added, \u201cand that was Qualcomm.\u201dMobile phone adoption was taking off globally, largely backed by a European wireless standard called G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications. Qualcomm had a competing American standard called C.D.M.A., or Code Division Multiple Access.Irwin M. Jacobs, a founder of Qualcomm, spearheaded an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington and Beijing, promoting the technology\u2019s potential to transform wireless communication markets.\u201cWe knew China would be important, and they didn\u2019t have their own system,\u201d said Perry LaForge, a former Qualcomm executive. \u201cWe also told them this system would give them an opportunity to manufacture their own handsets, and not rely on buying them from other countries.\u201dWhen Qualcomm first entered China in the late 1990s, it was slow to gain traction. The company struggled to find Chinese partners to produce mobile phones that worked with its network. China also tried to develop its own wireless standard.Qualcomm eventually won out, helping write the standards for next-generation mobile technology, 3G and 4G service. The standard championed by European telecom providers faded rapidly. And China\u2019s homegrown technology struggled.By 2013, virtually every wireless device around the world was reliant on either Qualcomm\u2019s chips or its patents \u2014 enough to provide some of the technology industry\u2019s fattest profit margins.With its dominance rising, global brands like Apple and Samsung began complaining to regulators around the world, citing \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d pricing practices and high royalty fees. In China, a trade group made up of the country\u2019s major handset makers complained about patent holders levying \u201cexorbitant licensing fees.\u201d\u201cThese days a smartphone is covered by about 250,000 patents,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational center based in Honolulu. \u201cA Chinese smartphone maker needs to negotiate license agreements with companies like Qualcomm that own the essential patents.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese government was worried about this,\u201d he added. \u201cThat all these costs could constrain Chinese companies.\u201dThe raids began at dawn, in late November 2013. Investigators descended upon Qualcomm\u2019s offices in Beijing and Shanghai, questioning the staff and hauling away laptops and documents.At the time of the raids, the San Diego-based company\u2019s senior managers were at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York, attending an investor conference. The executives were planning to talk about the company\u2019s strategy. Instead, they began fielding frantic phone calls from China.The China business, which accounted for more than half of its global revenue, was in trouble.A week later, one of the country\u2019s most powerful regulatory agencies, the National Development and Reform Commission (N.D.R.C.), announced that it was looking into whether Qualcomm had abused its power in the sale of mobile phone chips. \u201cQualcomm came to control so much of the chip market in China,\u201d said Louie Ming, a former Qualcomm executive in China. \u201cIt was clear they were eventually going to run into antitrust problems.\u201dWhile Qualcomm agreed to fully cooperate with the investigation, some senior executives appealed to the Obama administration, pressing the White House to raise the issue with China\u2019s senior leaders, according to a former administration official.Qualcomm\u2019s troubles went beyond China. The company was also under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the European Union and South Korea, as well as by the United States Federal Trade Commission.China didn\u2019t back down. The head of the N.D.R.C. branded Qualcomm a monopoly.In February 2015, after a 15-month-long investigation, Qualcomm settled allegations in China that it had charged unfairly high prices for its chips and patents. The company agreed to pay the $975 million fine \u2014 about 8 percent of its annual revenue in China \u2014 and to lower the prices for chips sold in the country.\u201cWe are pleased that the resolution has removed the uncertainty surrounding our business in China, and we will now focus our full attention and resources on supporting our customers and partners in China,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.Qualcomm then went into business with the Chinese government.There was a $150 million investment fund to help Chinese start-ups; new research and design facilities set up with Chinese companies such as Huawei and Tencent; and a partnership with a Beijing-based company called Thundersoft to develop drones, virtual reality goggles and internet-connected devices.Qualcomm is also helping the Chinese government develop supercomputers, a technology the United States government has discouraged American companies from supporting overseas. In May, Qualcomm agreed to form a joint venture with other state-backed firms to design and sell mass-market smartphone chips. And to help make Chinese chip manufacturing more competitive, Qualcomm has pledged to shift more of its high-end production \u2014 long done by outside contractors in Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 to China.\u201cThis is what China does better than anyone else,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank focused on technology policy that has conducted studies detailing the Chinese government\u2019s pressure on technology companies.\u201cThey have a large carrot and a large stick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have a market no C.E.O. can walk away from.\u201dQualcomm\u2019s biggest new venture is taking shape in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou Province. Determined to leap into advanced technology, China has designated a large parcel of land in the provincial capital of Guiyang as the home of a new industrial park for supercomputing, data centers and cloud computing. The country\u2019s large state-run telecom operators and its internet behemoths, including Alibaba and Tencent, are moving in, to build massive server farms. The region offers lower energy costs and abundant supplies of water, necessary to cool server farms.A year ago, Qualcomm set up a joint venture with the Guizhou government and pledged to invest about $140 million for a minority stake in the business, situated in a development zone that has also attracted the interest of Microsoft and Dell. Qualcomm says it received American government approval for the deal.The new Qualcomm joint venture, Huaxintong Semiconductor, broke ground on the site in 2016, and now operates in a 46,000-square-foot design and engineering center. A major test of the partnership will come when the joint venture\u2019s first server chips are released \u2014 helping Qualcomm and the Chinese government stake out new ground. The Chinese government will control the chips and reap most of the profits.In late March, Qualcomm\u2019s president, Derek K. Aberle, flew to Guizhou to meet a powerful local government leader, Chen Miner, a confidant of the Chinese president. Seated in a government hall, before an enormous landscape painting, Mr. Aberle pledged to \u201ccontinually cooperate\u201d with the Chinese government.A headline last Sunday with an article about Qualcomm\u2019s efforts in China misidentified the location of the company\u2019s headquarters. It is based in San Diego, not Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Affirmative Action Is an Example of How Polls Can Mislead", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusThe polls don\u2019t tell a clear story. Some polls show that affirmative action is very popular. Others show that it\u2019s not popular at all. How pollsters pose the question is a critical factor.Based on its limited success at the ballot box and my own read of which poll questions make the most sense, my best guess is that affirmative action is fairly unpopular. But I\u2019m troubled by a wider problem: It\u2019s not clear that even a well-worded question would give us much insight into the politics of the issue.Over the last decade or so, polls have shown that the public backs the liberal or Democratic position on just about every major issue. By these measures, comprehensive immigration reform, environmental protection, gun background checks and many other issues ought to have been political winners for the Democrats. And yet Republicans now hold full control of government in Washington. There\u2019s a loosely held but widespread assumption that many of these same issues have been a part of the Republican resurgence.It\u2019s not just the issue questions that failed analysts. The poll questions on character also failed to tell the story of the 2016 presidential election.In pre-election surveys, Donald J. Trump polled worse than Hillary Clinton on just about every question. Voters viewed him more unfavorably, thought he was unqualified for the presidency and, yes, even thought he was more dishonest than Mrs. Clinton. The most straightforward interpretation of the polling \u2014 that her clear lead was fairly solid, since it was underpinned by an advantage on whether she was fit to be president \u2014 simply did not pan out.This isn\u2019t a small problem. Journalists have traditionally relied on issue and character questions to frame the story of American elections. It\u2019s how most public pollsters rationalize the cost of horse-race polling. Political consultants often take a similar approach to try to shape their messages, which winds up influencing the promises and programs of elected officials. But the seemingly clear story told by the polls has led us somewhat astray, and it\u2019s probably part of why elected officials, journalists and pollsters were caught off guard in 2016.So what\u2019s going on?The issue could be something fundamental: The questions are bad, or voters are misrepresenting their opinions. But assuming that\u2019s not the problem, here are a few possibilities.An issue position might be broadly popular, but those who back the minority view may be far more likely to vote on the issue. This is a common explanation for why gun control seems to play so poorly for the Democrats. The liberal viewpoint on gun control and background checks really is popular; it\u2019s just that the conservatives back their viewpoint far more enthusiastically.The idea here is that there\u2019s some critical group of voters who might matter more than others. Gun control and immigration overhaul might be popular nationwide, for example, but the electoral politics could play differently if a significant share of a persuadable and targeted voting group took the position not favored by the majority.This could have been a big factor in electoral politics over the last few years. White working-class Democratic-leaners were always the weakest link in the Obama coalition, and there\u2019s plenty of evidence that a significant chunk of them are sympathetic to the minority view on a lot of issues, including trade, immigration and guns. For good measure, white working-class voters have disproportionate sway in the Senate and the Electoral College.But it\u2019s hard to examine groups of persuadable voters using individual national polls. Making the issue even more challenging: Older white working-class voters are underrepresented in the average national poll of adults compared with their share of the electorate.By this measure, affirmative action is probably less popular politically than a national survey would imply.But perhaps the biggest problem of all is that the voters that were decisive in the last election might not be decisive in the next one.Another possibility is that voters really do support background checks for guns until they hear the counter-messaging, like the prospect that the government might take everyone\u2019s guns.Similarly, voters might quickly split along partisan lines once a party or a candidate weighs in on an issue.Whether voters support or oppose a policy may simply not be all that important to their vote.Maybe the state of the economy and whether they approve of the incumbent president are likeliest to affect their vote choice. Republican strength is certainly consistent with that possibility, given the modest pace of economic growth and Democratic control of the White House for eight years. If that\u2019s true, perhaps the Republican Party\u2019s comparatively unpopular policies might set them up for big defeats.Perhaps issues matter, not because of the policy, but because of the message it sends about a candidate. President Trump, for instance, could reinforce his appeal among white voters with unpopular stances that nonetheless reinforce the view that he intends to govern on their behalf. A Muslim ban might not be popular as policy, but it shows his seriousness in pursuing terrorists. A wall might not be popular, yet shows his seriousness in taking on undocumented immigrants.This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, but all of these factors might have played some role in allowing a seemingly unpopular agenda to bring Republicans to power.Issue polling has its place. A government in a democracy should be aware of the views of the public. But if you\u2019re strictly interested in electoral consequences, you\u2019re probably a lot better off focusing on the president\u2019s approval rating than the popularity of the president\u2019s policy agenda.Advertisement"}

Goldman, who diagnosed deficiencies in Moscow\u2019s economic policies for decades and was among the first Kremlinologists to predict the downfall of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, died on Aug. 2 in Cambridge, Mass. He was 87.The cause was complications of dementia, his son, Seth, said.A perceptive economist, prolific author, professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts and associate director of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard, Professor Goldman was an authority on the Soviet economy, methodically charting its downs (becoming an importer of grain) and potential ups (becoming an exporter of oil, before prices plunged, and of gas).He pioneered scholarship on the environmental damage inflicted under Communist domination and the emergence of a post-Soviet economy driven by oil and gas production.As early as 1987, he painted a grim picture of the consequences of perestroika and glasnost, the liberalization programs that Mr. Gorbachev had put in place. And, parting ways with most other Kremlinologists, he predicted that Mr. Gorbachev would not survive as Soviet leader for more than three more years. (He lasted until 1991, when the Soviet Union effectively collapsed.)\u201cThe Soviet bureaucracy will shake off all attempts to reform it as easily as a bear would swipe away attacking rabbits,\u201d Professor Goldman wrote in his book \u201cGorbachev\u2019s Challenge: Economic Reform in the Age of High Technology\u201d (1987).In 1989, upheavals that had begun in Eastern Europe exposed fatal fissures in the Soviet bloc. By the end of 1991, with consumer goods scarce, secessionist movements mounting and Kremlin intrigue deepening, Mr. Gorbachev resigned as president.\u201cMarshall Goldman counts among the pioneers of American studies of the Soviet economy,\u201d Paul Roderick Gregory, an economics professor at the University of Houston and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote in an email.By 1983, in his \u201cU.S.S.R. in Crisis: The Failure of an Economic System,\u201d Professor Goldman was suggesting that the failing economy was encouraging Soviet citizens \u201cto wonder whether or not they should continue to be so passive\u201d and whether \u201cthe time is riper than ever for some kind of explosion.\u201dNot everyone agreed with him.\u201cMarshall was an excellent lecturer and attracted a lot of interest to the Russian economy,\u201d Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank, wrote in an email. \u201cBut he was on the wrong side of Russia\u2019s last three leaders, opposing both Gorbachev and Yeltsin, while lauding Putin.\u201dProfessor Goldman credited President Vladimir V. Putin with invigorating the Russian economy by nationalizing energy companies.\u201cRussia would be very different, but that rapid economic growth would still be there, Putin or no Putin,\u201d he said in a 2008 lecture. In his book \u201cPetrostate: Putin, Power and the New Russia\u201d (2008), he wrote, \u201cPutin made a difference, but oil and gas made an even more important difference.\u201dProfessor Goldman warned, however, about Kremlin cronyism and the precariousness of what he called the Russian petrostate relying so heavily on energy exports.In 2010, in a new preface to \u201cPetrostate,\u201d following an economic slump, he wrote that the decline in oil prices had prompted his wife to suggest that the book\u2019s title was misleading. Not only had it been misread as \u201cProstate,\u201d he wrote \u2014 \u201cDid I know something about Putin\u2019s health that his physicians had been hiding from the public?\u201d \u2014 but, he added, it might have been more appropriately titled \u201cImpoverished State.\u201dMarshall Irwin Goldman was born on July 26, 1930, in Elgin, Ill., to Sam Goldman and the former Bella Silvian, who ran an army surplus store and later sold liquor wholesale.He graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1952 and earned master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics at Harvard University.After being drafted and serving as a teacher in the Army, he joined the faculty at Wellesley in 1958 and remained there until he retired in 2002 as professor emeritus.Professor Goldman was associate director of what became known as the Davis Center at Harvard from 1975 to 2006 and was instrumental in securing its enduring financial support. He was also a founding director of Century Bank and Trust Company and vice chairman of Century BanCorp. He frequently wrote Op-Ed and Sunday Business articles for The New York Times.In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, the former Merle Rosenblatt, a professor emerita at Boston University, where she has specialized in modern Chinese history; their three other children, Ethan Goldman, Dr. Avra Goldman and Dr. Karla Goldman; 12 grandchildren; and his sister, Rhoda Frank.Advertisement"}

Putin\u2019s closest allies trying to settle scores.According to the prosecution, Mr. Sechin reported the extortion attempt to the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the K.G.B. He then worked with the intelligence service on a sting operation, and Mr. Ulyukayev was invited to Rosneft headquarters in Moscow on the night of Nov. 14, 2016.Apprehending Mr. Ulyukayev as he left Rosneft\u2019s offices, F.S.B. officers found 130 million rubles, or more than $2 million at current exchange rates, in the trunk of his car.Mr. Ulyukayev, who pleaded not guilty at a pretrial hearing on Aug. 8, has said that no money changed hands, and that the charges against him were \u201cfabricated.\u201d He accuses Mr. Sechin\u2019s allies, including Oleg V. Feoktistov, a retired F.S.B. general who became vice president of security at Rosneft before Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s arrest, of planting the cash in his car.The defendant, who appeared at Zamoskvoretsky District Court in Moscow on Wednesday, made an oblique reference to Mr. Sechin\u2019s role in court documents when he mentioned the Rosneft chief\u2019s \u201cweight in the Russian political establishment.\u201dMr. Sechin, a veteran Soviet intelligence officer who worked for Mr. Putin during his time in the St. Petersburg government and who followed him to Moscow, is considered a leader among the \u201csiloviki,\u201d a powerful group of current and former intelligence and military officers.

{"Headline": "McConnell, in Private, Doubts if Trump Can Save Presidency", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility, complicated by the position of Mr. McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine L. Chao, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, according to more than a dozen people briefed on their imperiled partnership. Angry phone calls and private badmouthing have devolved into open conflict, with the president threatening to oppose Republican senators who cross him, and Mr. McConnell mobilizing to their defense.A protracted government shutdown or a default on sovereign debt could be disastrous \u2014 for the economy and for the party that controls the White House and both chambers of Congress.Yet Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are locked in a political cold war. Neither man would comment for this article. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, noted that the senator and the president had \u201cshared goals,\u201d and pointed to \u201ctax reform, infrastructure, funding the government, not defaulting on the debt, passing the defense authorization bill.\u201dStill, the back-and-forth has been dramatic.During the call, which Mr. Trump initiated on Aug. 9 from his New Jersey golf club, the president accused Mr. McConnell of bungling the health care issue. He was even more animated about what he intimated was the Senate leader\u2019s refusal to protect him from investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to Republicans briefed on the conversation.Mr. McConnell has fumed over Mr. Trump\u2019s regular threats against fellow Republicans and criticism of Senate rules, and questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the presidency in a public speech. Mr. McConnell has made sharper comments in private, describing Mr. Trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing.In offhand remarks, Mr. McConnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency may be headed, and has mused about whether Mr. Trump will be in a position to lead the Republican Party into next year\u2019s elections and beyond, according to people who have spoken to him directly.At a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, Mr. Trump alluded to Mr. Flake unfavorably, referring to him as \u201cweak on borders\u201d and \u201cweak on crime\u201d without mentioning him by name. He referred to Mr. McConnell only in passing, calling on him to abolish the Senate filibuster.\u201cWhen it comes to the Senate, there\u2019s an Article 5 understanding: An attack against one is an attack against all,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has found himself in Mr. Trump\u2019s sights many times, invoking the NATO alliance\u2019s mutual defense doctrine.The fury among Senate Republicans toward Mr. Trump has been building since last month, even before he lashed out at Mr. McConnell. Some of them blame the president for not being able to rally the party around any version of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, accusing him of not knowing even the basics about the policy. Senate Republicans also say strong-arm tactics from the White House backfired, making it harder to cobble together votes and have left bad feelings in the caucus.Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told colleagues that when Mr. Trump\u2019s interior secretary threatened to pull back federal funding for her state, she felt boxed in and unable to vote for the health care bill.In a show of solidarity, albeit one planned well before Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Flake, Mr. McConnell will host a $1,000-per-person dinner on Friday in Kentucky for the Arizona senator, as well as for Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who is also facing a Trump-inspired primary race next year, and Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Mr. Flake is expected to attend the event.Former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican who is close to Mr. McConnell, said frustration with Mr. Trump was boiling over in the chamber. Mr. Gregg blamed the president for undermining congressional leaders, and said the House and Senate would have to govern on their own if Mr. Trump \u201ccan\u2019t participate constructively.\u201d\u201cFailure to do things like keeping the government open and passing a tax bill is the functional equivalent of playing Russian roulette with all the chambers loaded,\u201d Mr. Gregg said.Others in the party divide blame between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell. Al Hoffman, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee who has been supportive of Mr. McConnell, said Mr. McConnell was culpable because he has failed to deliver legislative victories. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s been Mitch\u2019s responsibility, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done much,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.But Mr. Hoffman predicted that Mr. McConnell would likely outlast the president.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to blow up, self-implode,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said of Mr. Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if McConnell pulls back his support of Trump and tries to go it alone.\u201dAn all-out clash between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell would play out between men whose strengths and weaknesses are very different. Mr. Trump is a political amateur, still unschooled in the ways of Washington, but he maintains a viselike grip on the affections of the Republican base. Mr. McConnell is a soft-spoken career politician, with virtuoso mastery of political fund-raising and tactics, but he had no mass following to speak of.Mr. McConnell, while baffled at Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for internecine attacks, is a ruthless pragmatist and has given no overt indication that he plans to seek more drastic conflict. Despite his private battles with Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell has sent reassuring signals with his public conduct: On Monday, he appeared in Louisville, Ky., with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a discussion of tax policy.Mr. McConnell\u2019s Senate colleagues, however, have grown bolder. The combination of the president\u2019s frontal attacks on Senate Republicans and his claim that there were \u201cfine people\u201d marching with white supremacists in Charlottesville has emboldened lawmakers to criticize Mr. Trump in withering terms.For the moment, Mr. McConnell appears to be far more secure in his position, and perhaps immune to coercion from the White House. Republicans are unlikely to lose control of the Senate in 2018, and Mr. Trump has no allies in the Senate who have shown an appetite for combat with Mr. McConnell.Roger J. Stone Jr., a Republican strategist who has advised Mr. Trump for decades, said the president needed to \u201ctake a scalp\u201d in order to force cooperation from Republican elites who have resisted his agenda. Mr. Stone urged Mr. Trump to make an example of one or more Republicans, like Mr. Flake, who have refused to give full support to his administration.\u201cThe president should start bumping off incumbent Republican members of Congress in primaries,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cIf he did that, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan would wet their pants and the rest of the Republicans would get in line.\u201dBut Mr. McConnell\u2019s allies warn that the president should be wary of doing anything that could jeopardize the Senate Republican majority.\u201cThe quickest way for him to get impeached is for Trump to knock off Jeff Flake and Dean Heller and be faced with a Democrat-led Senate,\u201d said Billy Piper, a lobbyist and former McConnell chief of staff.Advertisement"}

It feels inevitable.But it\u2019s not.The line on the chart (which we have recreated as the red line above) resembles a classic hockey-stick graph. It\u2019s mostly flat and close to zero, before spiking upward at the end. That spike shows that the very affluent, and only the very affluent, have received significant raises in recent decades.This line captures the rise in inequality better than any other chart or simple summary that I\u2019ve seen. So I went to the economists with a request: Could they produce versions of their chart for years before 1980, to capture the income trends following World War II? You are looking at the result here.The gray line in the chart above, labeled \"1980,\" shows the change in income from 1946 to 1980. Below, you can watch the change across every 34-year period starting with 1946-1980 and ending with 1980-2014. Each line is labeled with the final year in the period:The message is straightforward. Only a few decades ago, the middle class and the poor weren\u2019t just receiving healthy raises. Their take-home pay was rising even more rapidly, in percentage terms, than the pay of the rich.The post-inflation, after-tax raises that were typical for the middle class during the pre-1980 period \u2014 about 2 percent a year \u2014 translate into rapid gains in living standards. At that rate, a household\u2019s income almost doubles every 34 years. (The economists used 34-year windows to stay consistent with their original chart, which covered 1980 through 2014.)The basic problem is that most families used to receive something approaching their fair share of economic growth, and they don\u2019t anymore.income growth IN 1980income growth in 2014+6%+6%Average income growth44Average income growth2.0%1.4%2200020th40th60th80th100th020th40th60th80th100thincome growth in 1980+6%Average income growth42.0%20020th40th60th80th100thincome growth in 2014+6%Average income growth41.4%20020th40th60th80th100thincome growth in 1980income growth in 2014+6%+6%Average income growthAverage income growth442.0%1.4%2200020th40th60th80th100th020th40th60th80th100thDifferent policies could produce a different outcome. My list would start with a tax code that does less to favor the affluent, a better-functioning education system, more bargaining power for workers and less tolerance for corporate consolidation.Most Americans would look at these charts and conclude that inequality is out of control. The president, on the other hand, seems to think that inequality isn\u2019t big enough.Source: Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel ZucmanCharts by Jessia Ma and Stuart A.

{"Headline": "Republicans Want to Sideline This Regulator. But It May Be Too Popular.", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the election of President Trump, the nation\u2019s consumer watchdog agency faced a quandary: how to shield the Obama-era institution from a Republican administration determined to loosen the federal government\u2019s grip on business.In the weeks after the election, Richard Cordray, the Democrat who leads the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, directed his staff to compile stories from ordinary Americans thanking it for resolving complaints.The anecdotes, which he solicited in an email to share with the Trump transition team, could provide a counterpoint to critics who had cast the agency as a regulatory scourge on the economy. And implicit in his request to employees was the belief that some accolades would come from parts of the country that helped elect Mr. Trump \u2014 evidence that the popularity of consumer safeguards transcends party divisions.\u201cThere must be hundreds of such stories,\u201d Mr. Cordray wrote in the email in November, which was obtained in a public records request. He added, \u201cI can think of no better vindication\u201d of the agency\u2019s consumer relief efforts.The approach, outlined in emails and other documents obtained through the public records request by The New York Times, comes as the Trump administration has taken an uncharacteristically low-key public stance toward the agency, a prominent blue holdout in a federal regulatory regime newly awash in red.The White House\u2019s restraint was based in part on a pragmatic assessment, according to people familiar with the strategy. At one point, contemplating a high-profile run on the agency, the White House examined polling data from political bellwether states, two people briefed on the matter said. The agency, they concluded, was too popular to pick a public fight with.The stories of gratitude rounded up by the agency\u2019s staff for Mr. Cordray illustrated its appeal. Among them was a homeowner in Tennessee who got a disputed lien removed from a property, someone in Kentucky who got assistance warding off a debt collector pursuing a medical bill that had been paid, and a person in Pennsylvania who said the agency helped resolve a contested credit card debt.That doesn\u2019t mean the Trump administration and other opponents have given up on neutralizing the bureau\u2019s work.Administration officials have isolated the bureau from parts of the government that, under President Barack Obama, helped fulfill its mission. In public statements and documents, officials at the Justice Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have all turned a cold shoulder toward Mr. Cordray and his staff.Lobbyists for the financial industry are working behind the scenes on efforts to dismantle some of the bureau\u2019s signature initiatives, according to people directly involved in the plans. They include lawsuits to be filed in reliably conservative courts when new regulations are issued.For now, though, it is mostly a waiting game. Mr. Cordray\u2019s term as director expires next July, when he could be replaced with a sympathetic Trump appointee. That moment could come earlier as there is speculation that Mr. Cordray might resign \u2014 perhaps soon \u2014 to enter the Democratic primary for governor in Ohio.\u201cThe industry will be very happy to see him out of there,\u201d said Alan S. Kaplinsky, a lawyer with Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia, who represents financial institutions in matters before the bureau. \u201cThe people running that agency are definitely Obama people.\u201dThe Trump administration, eager for Mr. Cordray\u2019s exit, has compiled a list of successor candidates in the event of his early departure, according to three people with knowledge of the preparation. Yet Mr. Trump can fire Mr. Cordray only for cause, and such a move would most likely backfire by rendering Mr. Cordray a political martyr among Democrats \u2014 perhaps bolstering his chances of winning, should he enter the governor\u2019s race.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Cordray, 58, has counseled his roughly 1,600 employees to tune out the political noise.\u201cI encourage you to remain focused on doing your good work on behalf of consumers,\u201d he said, according to a script for a call with employees in late November. \u201cKeep calm and carry on.\u201dThe agency was proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, when she was a Harvard professor, to serve as an advocate for consumers in their dealings with financial institutions. Mr. Cordray, who was working at the bureau as its enforcement chief, was made its first director in 2012 in a recess appointment by President Obama, which heightened the partisan rancor over the regulatory crackdown on Wall Street.Financial executives and lobbyists offer mixed reviews of his tenure.They describe Mr. Cordray as intelligent, pleasant and accessible, willing to meet with industry constituents and hear out their lobbyists. But they also consider him a \u201cdefinitely ideological\u201d \u2014 in the words of Richard Hunt, the chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, a banking trade group \u2014 leader of an agency that is structured like \u201ca dictatorship.\u201d\u201cRichard Cordray has gone above and beyond to take C.E.O.s to task on things that he had no jurisdiction over,\u201d Mr. Hunt said.Mr. Kaplinsky, the financial services lawyer, said Mr. Cordray had stifled innovation in the industry by being too rigid. \u201cIt is one guy who calls all the shots,\u201d he said.Mr. Cordray said he listened to and appreciated his opponents. \u201cSometimes you look at the critics and say, \u2018Nobody else was telling me that, but you were,\u2019\u201d he said in a recent interview.Since Mr. Trump has taken office, Mr. Cordray has faced increasingly personal attacks. A longtime critic, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has led the charge.He also launched an investigation over a contentious new rule that allows consumers to band together in class-action lawsuits against financial firms. Mr. Hensarling later suggested that there were legal grounds to pursue contempt-of-Congress proceedings against Mr. Cordray, accusing him of inadequately responding to subpoenas in that investigation.Separately, Mr. Hensarling has questioned Mr. Cordray\u2019s political activities in Ohio and called for an investigation into whether he violated a federal law that prohibits federal employees from most political campaign activities.While industry lobbyists are more circumspect, they, too, are eager to remake the bureau. Some in the banking industry would like it to disappear, but others would prefer simply to reduce its autonomy.\u201cI hope we\u2019ll rebalance the pendulum in a way that ensures honest market participants have clear rules,\u201d said David Hirschmann, who heads the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, \u201cand those who break laws are appropriately handled through strong, vigorous enforcement.\u201dMr. Cordray says the criticism is a badge of honor. He believes the bureau\u2019s work will have lasting ramifications.\u201cThis has been an agency that has gotten people\u2019s attention in a lot of ways,\u201d Mr. Cordray said. \u201cThey have a lot of things they say about us.\u201dMr. Trump has not spoken publicly about the bureau, but in mid-June, he received his first major report from the Treasury Department about the financial system and its regulators.The consumer bureau figured prominently in the report, garnering 340 references and a chapter devoted to the opportunity that Republicans have to change it.\u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to regulatory abuses and excesses,\u201d the report said.\u201cTreasury took the reins,\u201d said Mr. Hirschmann, of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who participated in meetings with Treasury staff members as they researched the report. \u201cI\u2019ve been impressed.\u201dSimilarly, the Justice Department under Mr. Trump has taken some shots at the consumer bureau. In one court case, it sided with a mortgage lender questioning the agency\u2019s constitutionality.The bureau had fined the lender, PHH Corporation, $109 million and accused it of illegal kickbacks. PHH denied wrongdoing, appealed the ruling, claimed the bureau was unconstitutional and asked a judge to shut it down.Other alliances within the federal government have deteriorated.The consumer agency had been collaborating with the Department of Education on overhauling the $1.3 trillion student loan market to ensure that private companies collecting loan payments abided by consumer protections.Lobbyists are also feeling empowered by the change in administrations. Working on behalf of payday lenders, they have flooded the consumer agency with comments, more than a million in all, urging it to halt a proposed crackdown on the industry.So far, that push has not deterred the bureau. Within the agency, there is a mounting sense of urgency to get the final version of the payday rules out, according to two people familiar with the process. The new rules would represent the first time that the lucrative market \u2014 the payday industry collects $7 billion annually in fees \u2014 was directly regulated by the federal government.The bureau\u2019s rollout last month of its rule allowing class-action lawsuits in some arbitration cases has also rattled Wall Street, and is widely seen as a provocative stance against the prevailing political momentum in Washington.A challenge to the rule passed the House, but has stalled in the Senate. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has said he would not back a repeal of the rule. Other Republicans are also wavering.\u201cModerate Republicans don\u2019t want to be painted as anti-consumer,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point, a research firm tracking the fate of the agency\u2019s recent rules.An article on Friday about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau quoted incorrectly from comments by Richard Hunt of the Consumer Bankers Association. Mr. Hunt described the bureau\u2019s chief, Richard Cordray, as \u201cdefinitely ideological.\u201d He did not say Mr. Cordray is \u201cdoggedly ideological.\u201dBen Protess and Eric Lipton contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Paul Kagame Appears Set for Victory in Rwanda Vote", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Rwandans went to the polls on Friday, appearing to overwhelmingly extend the long tenure of President Paul Kagame, who has guided the country with a steady and at times repressive hand after a genocide two decades ago.With 80 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Kagame was drawing the support of 98.7 percent of those casting ballots, according to the country\u2019s electoral commission.The two opposition candidates, Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party and the independent Philippe Mpayimana, a former journalist, had yet to reach 1 percent of the vote, the commission reported from the capital, Kigali. A third challenger, Diane Rwigara, who had been considered Mr. Kagame\u2019s strongest opponent, was disqualified in July.Victory will allow Mr. Kagame to remain in power until 2024 and, under recent changes to the Constitution, gives him the option of running for two more five-year terms after that, although he has suggested that he would not do so.Supporters of Mr. Kagame say his extended mandate cannot be compared to that of other rulers in the region, given the great trauma of his country\u2019s recent history: a state-organized attempt to exterminate one of the two main ethnic groups when Hutus slaughtered Tutsis in 1994.Still, the election in Rwanda stands in stark contrast with what is happening in nearby Kenya, where citizens are set to vote next week after vibrant campaigning by candidates.In Rwanda, a history of political repression and attacks on dissidents \u201cstifles political debate and makes those who might speak out think twice before taking the risk,\u201d Amnesty International wrote recently in a report.David Himbara, who was Mr. Kagame\u2019s economic adviser until 2010, when the two men had a falling out, has accused the authorities of manipulating statistics to make Rwanda appear wealthier and more advanced than it really is.Rwanda has one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, expanding by 8 percent annually, according to the World Bank. But it is still very poor: More than half of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day. \u201cHe says he has built an economic lion, when Rwanda is a midget in the region,\u201d Mr. Himbara said.Although Mr. Kagame has sought to compare himself with strong leaders in Asia who transformed their economies, \u201cin Rwanda\u2019s case, you have the suppression of human rights that is not delivering economic development,\u201d Mr. Himbara said. \u201cThat trade-off is not working.\u201dDespite the criticism, Rwanda has made spectacular strides under Mr. Kagame, who is known to be cerebral and introverted, since he led rebel forces into Kigali, the capital, in 1994 to oust the Hutu-led government after a three-month rampage in which more than 800,000 Tutsis were massacred.Although Rwanda is still poor, lives have improved significantly since the genocide. There is an emerging tech hub in Kigali. Streets are clean. Mr. Kagame has banned plastic bags.The government says the poverty rate dropped to less than 40 percent in 2014 from nearly 57 percent in 2006, a remarkable feat compared with the situation in some of Rwanda\u2019s neighbors, like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi, which is still plagued by Tutsi-Hutu violence. The authorities in Rwanda are aiming to transform it into a middle-income country, along the lines of Kenya or Indonesia, by 2020.More than a third of government revenue comes from foreign aid, but Mr. Kagame has been hailed by much of the world\u2019s elite as a \u201cvisionary\u201d (former President Bill Clinton) and \u201camong the greatest leaders of our time\u201d (Bill Gates) for using that assistance well.At the same time, analysts and those who know Mr. Kagame personally say he has not groomed a successor, nor put in place a system that would ensure that Rwanda\u2019s advances outlast him.Naked pictures of Ms. Rwigara, a 35-year-old opposition candidate and a trained accountant, appeared online just days after she announced her candidacy against Mr. Kagame. The National Electoral Commission eventually disqualified her over irregularities involving the signatures needed to run.Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution and the director of the research organization Africa Security Initiative, said that a country\u2019s leadership should not change just for change\u2019s sake. \u201cBut the danger of perpetuating a one-man rule,\u201d he said, \u201cis \u2014 what will happen when he is gone?\u201d\u201cHe is convinced that there is much more to do, and that at this point, he is the best person to do it,\u201d Mr. Kinzer said. \u201cI find it difficult to imagine him shrugging his shoulders and walking away and saying, \u2018I\u2019ll leave it to the next guy.\u2019 \u201dMr. Kinzer recalled a conversation he had with a Rwandan. \u201cIn Africa,\u201d the man told him, \u201cthe moment it becomes clear who the next person is, you\u2019re finished.\u201dIn the absence of a successor, Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said, the president needs to create a political system that will promote institutional stability, and a multiparty system to lessen the probability of another genocide. Mr. Lee, the former Singapore leader whom many are quick to compare Mr. Kagame to, took the title of minister mentor toward the end of his career, part of an effort to at least try \u201cto figure out a way to pass over power.\u201dAt the same time, democratic change in Rwanda should be gradual, Mr. Kinzer warned. \u201cThe only year when there was some measure of free discourse in Rwanda was the year that led up to the genocide.\u201dThere is still a sense among Rwandans that \u201cas long as this guy is in power, nothing bad can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not a bad guarantee, considering what is happening in the neighborhood.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 77.Mark Miller, a longtime friend and political consultant to Mr. White, said the cause was a heart attack.Mr. White, a Democrat, was the attorney general of Texas from 1979 to January 1983, when he became governor after defeating William P. Clements, the Republican incumbent. (Mr. Clements returned to defeat him in 1986.)In his four years in office, Mr. White won legislation requiring high school students to pass basic skills tests to graduate; establishing competency tests for public-school teachers and raising their salaries; capping class sizes in elementary schools; and increasing taxes by $4 billion to finance it all. Facing an economic downturn caused by plummeting oil prices, he also tried to wean the state off its dependence on oil and lure other industries to Texas.\u201cHe laid the groundwork for diversification of the Texas economy,\u201d President George Bush said in a statement, \u201cand he made significant investments in improving education in our great state.\u201dThat prompted a fierce backlash in a state where high school and college football are deeply ingrained in the culture. Mr. White received personal threats, and a legal challenge reached the Texas Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld the law.Mr. White defended the rule, telling state legislators at the end of his term, \u201cAmericans didn\u2019t get to the moon on a quarterback sneak.\u201dIn a campaign ad in 1985, he quoted the mother of a student who had been barred from his high school football team for failing his English class: \u201cHis father and I didn\u2019t send him to school to play. We sent him to learn. Even if he makes the team, he wouldn\u2019t be a professional ballplayer, but if he doesn\u2019t pass his classes, he\u2019ll never be a professional anything.\u201dEven after that defeat, Mr. White told reporters he had no regrets.\u201cHis focus in life was not to be a politician,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHis focus in life was to make educational strides, and make an impact on the education of children and teachers in our state.\u201dIn a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, Mr. White said he was inspired to push his education agenda by the experience of his mother, Sarah Elizabeth White, teaching first grade. \u201cIt was all designed around what a first-grade teacher needs,\u201d he said.Mark Wells White Jr. was born on March 17, 1940, in Henderson, Tex.

Here Are the Highlights.", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sometimes, 140 characters just aren\u2019t enough.Seven days into a 17-day \u201cworking vacation\u201d in Bedminster, N.J., President Trump unburdened himself during two lengthy, impromptu news conferences on Thursday, eagerly ping-ponging through the litany of domestic and foreign policy issues that have consumed his administration for weeks.Ignoring his press secretary, who was holding a \u201cOne More Question\u201d sign in the back of the room, Mr. Trump doubled down on his threats to North Korea, shrugged off Russia\u2019s ejections of hundreds of American embassy staff, defended his abrupt decision on transgender troops and claimed he had never considered firing the special counsel \u2014 directly contradicting his own private statements to aides and friends.In sometimes rambling answers filled with words like \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cbiggest\u201d and \u201cfinest,\u201d the president bragged about everything from the state of the economy, the size of his nuclear arsenal, the breadth of his achievements and the increase in security at the border with Mexico.He called Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, \u201cmy friend\u201d and \u201ca very talented man.\u201d (Mr. McMaster was sitting to Mr. Trump\u2019s right.) But the president did not foreclose the idea that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, should \u201cstep aside\u201d if Republicans fail to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.Altogether, the president dabbled in more than a dozen topics for reporters gathered at his golf club, each one generating newspaper headlines and chyrons on television.Just like his tweets.After days of venting, on Twitter and in private, over the Senate\u2019s failure to pass a health care repeal bill before the August recess, Mr. Trump was asked if Mr. McConnell should consider stepping down.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Mr. Trump began, \u201cif he doesn\u2019t get repeal and replace done, and if he doesn\u2019t get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn\u2019t get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure \u2014 if he doesn\u2019t get them done, then you can ask me that question.\u201dAsked if that answer amounted to a yes or a no, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cYou can ask me the question. That means ask me that question. Let\u2019s hope he gets it done.\u201dThe comments were a remarkable acceleration of tensions between a president aggrieved at his lack of significant legislative accomplishments to date, and the lawmaker tasked with shepherding his agenda through a Republican-led Congress.They also signaled a conspicuous desire from Mr. Trump, who often campaigned as a renegade outsider with few meaningful allegiances to either party, to again position himself as a crusader against Washington gridlock \u2014 even though he and his allies are now at the controls, grinding the gears.The laconic Senate leader has strained all year to wrangle his narrow majority. Mr. McConnell has gotten little help from an often disengaged and policy-averse president whose habit of setting arbitrary (and often shifting) deadlines has frustrated senators for months.Mr. McConnell\u2019s team showed little appetite for a protracted feud. Antonia Ferrier, Mr. McConnell\u2019s spokeswoman, issued a subdued comment in response about the \u201cpath forward\u201d to repeal and replace the health care law and added, \u201cBut if he has any new statements today, I\u2019ll be sure to send them along.\u201d\u2014 Matt FlegenheimerRead more \u00bb \u201cI want to thank him, because we\u2019re trying to cut down on payroll, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cThere\u2019s no real reason for them to go back. So I greatly appreciate the fact that we\u2019ve been able to cut our payroll of the United States. We\u2019ll save a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u2014 Peter BakerRead more \u00bb Asked whether he had considered firing Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Russian election meddling, Mr. Trump said that he had not.\u201cI haven\u2019t given it any thought. Well, I\u2019ve been reading about it from you people. You say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to dismiss him.\u2019 No, I\u2019m not dismissing anybody. I mean, I want them to get on with the task.\u201dBut the statements stood in contrast to what Mr. Trump has privately told people close to him in recent months. The president has discussed both the possibility of firing Mr. Mueller and his concerns that the investigation will undermine his presidency.Meanwhile, Mr. Manafort \u2014 who had been represented by Reginald J. Brown of the law firm WilmerHale \u2014 announced that he was switching lawyers. \u201cAs of today, WilmerHale no longer represents Mr. Manafort,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Manafort said.Mr. Trump said he had not spoken to Mr. Manafort \u201cfor a long time,\u201d but \u201cI\u2019ve always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man. He\u2019s like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place, who knows, I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe Justice Department\u2019s investigation into possible links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia\u2019s election interference has engulfed the White House in political and legal scrutiny.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday of his relationship with Mr. Sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u2014 Michael SchmidtRead more \u00bb Two weeks after declaring on Twitter that transgender people would be banned from serving in the military, Mr. Trump said that he is doing the United States military a \u201cgreat favor.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had great support from that community,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI got a lot of votes.\u201dHe said that the military is \u201cworking on it now,\u201d adding, \u201cI think I\u2019m doing a lot of people a favor by coming out and just saying it.\u201dDefense officials said they were taken by surprise by Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on July 26. One administration official said the White House is considering urging transgender service members to retire early. But a defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said on Thursday that doing so might be difficult to defend in court.\u2014 Helene CooperRead more \u00bb Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Transgender Bathroom Bill Falters Amid Mounting Opposition", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe effort is now focused on the House version, but State Representative Jonathan Stickland, one of the bill\u2019s 46 co-authors and a member of the Tea Party-backed Freedom Caucus, said he was pessimistic about its chances of being allowed to advance to a vote.\u201cI think the Straus team has already decided that they are not going to let it out,\u201d said Mr. Stickland, who, like other members of the staunchly conservative caucus, persistently defies the speaker\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis is clearly part of a national agenda that is being pushed by the progressive left, and I think that that is just all coming to a head here.\u201dThe Senate bill would require transgender people to use bathrooms in schools and local government buildings corresponding to the gender listed on their birth certificates or state-issued identification cards. The House bill would prevent school districts and county or local governments from adopting or enforcing nondiscrimination ordinances that would allow transgender people to use bathrooms of their choice. The ordinance override provision is also an element in the Senate bill.Although law enforcement, religious groups and transgender advocates have all been part of the opposing coalition, big business has been a dominant force throughout the debate.\u201cCorporate America is stepping forward, speaking loudly about the fact that this will have a chilling effect on business opportunity in this state,\u201d said State Representative Byron Cook, a Republican and the chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, who has thus far refused to call a hearing on the bill. \u201cI\u2019m hearing from many major corporations about this bill and the effect it will have.\u201dCorporations active in Texas that have opposed the measure include IBM, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Intel, Capital One, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Facebook, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.The association is the most powerful business lobby in the state, representing companies with more than two million employees and $8 billion in business. The group\u2019s president, Chris Wallace, said the association moved quickly to form a coalition, Keep Texas Open for Business, against legislation when it became apparent that the bathroom battle was heading to Texas.\u201cWe do not want to do anything to tarnish Texas\u2019 brand,\u201d he said.The strategy has included a seven-figure radio ad buy, strategically targeted letters signed by prominent chief executives, lobbying blitzes throughout the Capitol and rallies on the Capitol grounds.Several dozen women, predominately business owners and executives, many accompanied by their children, gathered on the south steps of the state Capitol on Tuesday as 15 speakers attacked the legislation as the work of \u201cextremist\u201d politicians that will blunt the economy and foster discrimination and hate crimes.\u201cI don\u2019t want my child to be a statistic of the 2017 special session,\u201d said Kimberly Shappley, a registered nurse and ordained minister from the Houston suburbs who was accompanied by her 6-year-old transgender daughter, Kai.Mr. Patrick and other supporters of the legislation say the projections in Texas and the impact in North Carolina have been vastly exaggerated.Business\u2019s involvement has increasingly become a target for proponents as they accelerate their efforts in the remaining days of the session.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has seen corporations engage on an issue like this outside the framework of taxes and regulations in our memory,\u201d said Dave Welch of the Texas Pastor Council, which is a leading supporter of the legislation. \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of a rising moral bankruptcy in corporate America, in which the only thing they support is their image and their bottom line.\u201dIf the session goes all 30 days \u2014 and it could end earlier \u2014 lawmakers would adjourn on Aug 16. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, has given no hints on whether he would call another session, although he has been particularly insistent that lawmakers give Texans new safeguards against rising property taxes.As for the bathroom legislation, the governor told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper on Friday that it was \u201cway premature\u201d to conclude that the House bill wouldn\u2019t come up for a vote.The intensity of the debate has raised questions about the future relationship between business groups and the state\u2019s Republican leadership, which have shared a decades-long bond. Mr. Wallace, president of the Texas business association, said the bond would remain unbroken despite the differences in the current showdown.\u201cNinety-plus percent of the time we are in agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just happen to disagree on this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Engineer Gets Prison in Diesel Cheating Case", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 A Volkswagen engineer was sentenced on Friday to 40 months in prison for his role in the German automaker\u2019s decade-long scheme to cheat on federal emissions tests for diesel-powered cars sold in the United States.The engineer, James Liang, is the first company employee sent to prison in the vast scandal that has tainted Volkswagen\u2019s reputation and cost it more than $20 billion in fines and settlements with consumers.Mr. Liang, who helped develop the software that concealed high levels of pollutants generated by Volkswagen\u2019s diesel engines, reached a plea deal with prosecutors last year after agreeing to assist in the government\u2019s investigation of the company.But even after that pledge, Mr. Liang received a harsher sentence than the government recommended for pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and violating the Clean Air Act.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Federal prosecutors recommended a three-year sentence and a $20,000 fine, but Judge Sean F. Cox of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan gave Mr. Liang a longer sentence, as well as two years of supervised release and a $200,000 fine.The judge said Mr. Liang and other Volkswagen executives and employees were responsible for a \u201cmassive and stunning fraud\u201d that violated the trust that consumers need to have in goods and services purchased from corporations.\u201cThis is a very serious and troubling crime against our economic system,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout that trust in corporate America, the economy can\u2019t function.\u201dMr. Liang, a 63-year-old German citizen, declined to address the judge at the sentencing. His lawyer, Daniel Nixon, portrayed the longtime engineer as remorseful for the crimes that made him the \u201cworldwide face\u201d of the emissions scandal.\u201cHe was not the mastermind, but he did play a role,\u201d Mr. Nixon said, adding that Mr. Liang never benefited financially from aiding in the development of so-called defeat devices that masked the high levels of harmful diesel emissions.But the judge said Mr. Liang was \u201ctoo loyal\u201d to the German automaker he had worked for since the 1980s, and unwilling to expose its deceptive practices or walk away from his $350,000-a-year job.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Although his cooperation with investigators has helped the government\u2019s cases against the company and other Volkswagen executives, the judge said it was not enough to allow Mr. Liang to be sentenced to home confinement, as his lawyer had requested.\u201cYour cooperation and regret is noted, but it doesn\u2019t excuse the conduct,\u201d the judge said.Volkswagen has already pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the Clean Air Act, as well as customs violations and obstruction of justice.The company agreed to pay $4.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties in the case brought by the Justice Department. The penalties were part of $22 billion in settlements and fines that Volkswagen is paying in connection with the cheating scandal.Six other Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the case, as well as one employee of the automaker\u2019s Audi luxury division.Mr. Schmidt, the former head of Volkswagen\u2019s environmental and engineering center in Michigan, has been held without bail in prison since his arrest in January. Earlier this month, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating the Clean Air Act.Mr. Schmidt, who is to be sentenced in December, faces up to seven years in prison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Murder and an Exodus \u2014 Another Election in Kenya", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe nation was shocked by the discovery of Mr. Musando\u2019s strangled, beaten body on the outskirts of Nairobi last Monday, just as the various campaigns \u2014 for the presidency and vice presidency, the governorships, the county assemblies, the National Assembly and the Senate (including some seats set aside for women) \u2014 entered the final stretch.Mr. Musando\u2019s killing \u2014 and that of a female friend who was with him \u2014 inevitably lends credence to claims by Raila Odinga, the leader of the opposition National Super Alliance, known as NASA, that shadowy state agents bent on seeing President Uhuru Kenyatta returned to office plan to rig Tuesday\u2019s election. Given the closeness of the race, the concerns expressed by Mr. Odinga \u2014 who is making his fourth and probably final bid for the presidency \u2014 boost the likelihood of opposition supporters hitting the streets, and then of an iron-fisted crackdown by security forces.But Mr. Musando\u2019s murder, which feels like a throwback to earlier eras, also poses questions of a deeper nature.Back in the early 2000s, when I was researching a book about corruption in Kenya, the one element never in doubt was its title, \u201cIt\u2019s Our Turn to Eat.\u201d I had heard the phrase everywhere, used to justify the plundering of public resources by whichever tribe sat in pole position at any given institution \u2014 the key one being State House, the president\u2019s office.I came to loathe the phrase. Its knee-jerk use sounded like a clanging alarm bell, a warning of the approaching collapse of an entire nation-building project. When President Mwai Kibaki\u2019s faithful among the Kikuyu, the Meru and the Embu were suspected of rigging the 2007 elections to prevent Mr. Odinga\u2019s long-marginalized loyalists in Nairobi, the western part of the country and the coastline from \u201ceating,\u201d the scene was set for pitched battles along strictly ethnic lines.And here\u2019s the nub, one too easily missed these days as nerves fray: Devolution is starting to work.\u201cThere\u2019s more accountability, at more levels, than ever before in Kenya,\u201d Nic Cheeseman, an expert on African democracy at the University of Birmingham, told me recently. \u201cThe experience of taking politics closer to the people has been transformative, particularly so in the areas farthest from Nairobi.\u201dIn dusty towns in the nomadic north, torpid settlements along the coast and isolated villages in the west, packed rallies and blaring convoys reveal how communities that traditionally viewed government as corrupt, distant and irrelevant are now engaging.Foreign reporters and Kenya\u2019s Western donors fret over whether the presidential contest will go to a second round \u2014 a requirement if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote overall and 25 percent of the vote in at least half of Kenya\u2019s 47 counties. But the local races have gotten voters equally impassioned.Willy Mutunga, the former chief justice who oversaw the Supreme Court decision to uphold Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s 2013 election victory, believes that devolution is deflating the nation\u2019s obsession with the top executive office. \u201cWhy worry about who gets to be president when your governor is changing things at home?\u201d he said. \u201cI put a lot of emphasis on the members of the county assemblies. In the future, Parliament and the MPs won\u2019t count for much.\u201dMind-sets are still in the process of shifting, however. \u201cDevolution has drawn some of the poison out of the system, but it hasn\u2019t lanced it completely,\u201d Kwamchetsi Makokha, a newspaper columnist and civil society activist, told me. \u201cThere are big appetites out there and not all of that hunger can be satisfied at the county level.\u201dSkeptics caution that corruption \u2014 which has reached new heights under Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s government \u2014 has also devolved to the county level, where newly established institutions and an embryonic civil society are struggling to establish accountability. Whatever happens at the ballot box on Tuesday, the contest for one\u2019s turn to eat probably won\u2019t be eliminated so much as reincarnated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Age of Trump, the Dollar No Longer Seems a Sure Thing", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It is the closest thing to a certainty in the global economy. When trouble flares and anxiety mounts, people who manage money traditionally entrust it to a seemingly indomitable refuge, the American dollar.Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has surrendered nearly 8 percent against a basket of major currencies.The dollar remains the dominant instrument for global trade, a role it is unlikely to surrender anytime soon. Yet those who trade in currencies see tentative signs that the dollar may be losing some status as markets grapple with the unorthodox actions of the man leading the nation printing the money.Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency has been so full of departures from the norms of international relations that uncertainty has seeped into the calculation of America\u2019s plans. That has subjected the dollar to additional skepticism, enhancing the fundamental factors pulling it down, from worries about the strength of the American economy to improved fortunes in Europe and Asia.The dollar has in some sense become an international medium of expression about the American political environment. Its value offers a gauge of sentiment for Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects in achieving his economic goals, as well as worries about his potentially impulsive declarations.\u201cAt the margin, investors may be a little more cautious in treating the dollar as safe haven,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a London-based company that handles foreign exchange transactions. \u201cCertainly, the sentiment toward the viability of the Trump administration has not helped. There\u2019s the risk that at 3 a.m., Trump tweets something and the dollar gets hit.\u201dBefore Mr. Trump was even sworn in, many investors were buying into the so-called Trump trade, a bet that the new president\u2019s plans for tax cuts, deregulation and a hefty dose of infrastructure spending would spur economic growth. This formulation has earned favor in the stock market. During the Trump administration, American shares have reached new highs, propelled by strong corporate profits and executives exuding optimism.Yet the Trump trade was also a wager that the dollar would climb as investment flooded into the United States to exploit fresh growth opportunities.Those expectations have been overwhelmed by the turbulence of the Trump presidency. Senior government officials have been hired and fired at the pace of a reality television show. Myriad disclosures have intensified questions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s coterie colluded with Russia to influence the American election. Big parts of his agenda have stalled.All the while, Mr. Trump has unleashed his signature Twitter rants, sometimes undercutting the positions of his cabinet members and sowing confusion. In the estimation of many economists, the dollar\u2019s fall reflects an assumption that his administration will be hard-pressed to deliver on key goals.\u201cThe potential for serious investment and tax reform and economic growth in the United States is unlikely to be realized,\u201d said Ian Goldin, a former World Bank vice president and now professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s just a mood that gets amplified every time we have a disaster in the White House, or a new tweet.\u201dCurrency values are both volatile and relative. The dollar\u2019s worth must be understood as a reflection of contrasting economic prospects in the United States and other lands.Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-growth initiatives have been sidelined just as the Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates, constraining American expansion. At the same time, Europe \u2014 long a morose topic in the global economic conversation \u2014 has shown encouraging signs of vigor.Given these shifts in fortune, investors have been inclined to sell dollar holdings while shifting the proceeds into euros. Since January, the dollar has lost more than 11 percent against the euro.\u201cForeign exchange markets were persistently discounting Europe\u2019s strength,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former official at the Bank of England, and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThey are playing catch-up.\u201dBut the dollar has slipped even against currencies of nations in precarious positions.Since early January, it has lost more than 6 percent compared with the Japanese currency, the yen. The strength is perhaps a testament to recent signs of burgeoning activity in Japan\u2019s economy even as the government contends with a series of scandals.A weaker dollar also makes vacations in the United States cheaper, attracting more international tourists and bolstering employment in the hospitality industries.But given that the United States imports more than it exports, a cheaper dollar effectively increases prices on wares for American consumers, from clothing to electronics to tools.A weaker dollar may be pleasing to Mr. Trump. He has previously called for a cheaper greenback to make it easier for American companies to sell goods abroad. He has railed against countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States, such as China and Germany, while accusing them of profiting from undervalued currencies.Currencies tend to be nudged by scores of factors that play out at once, rendering speculative any conversation about daily price movements. Evidence is mixed on whether the dollar is less of a safe haven. While the value of the American currency has dropped, so has another traditional refuge, the Swiss franc. This may indicate that geopolitical events have simply not reached a point at which investors are seeking shelter.\u201cRisk factors are playing out as opposed to \u2018head for the hills\u2019 kind of panic,\u201d said Lutfey Siddiqi, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cWhat has certainly happened is that the outlook for the United States is dramatically less clear than it was at the start of the year.\u201dBut the reaction on Wednesday to the latest tensions on the Korean Peninsula bolstered the notion that the dollar is functioning differently. The yen rallied, and so did gold \u2014 both safe havens. The dollar dipped.The fate of the dollar is now subject to the influences of a presidential administration that has given markets an expectation for the unexpected. As traders seek to divine the risks of geopolitical hot spots, this appears to be weighing on the American currency.\u201cThere is some erosion in the relative stability of the United States in light of this administration\u2019s inconsistency on global affairs,\u201d said Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute. \u201cThe U.S. is at relatively more risk than we thought in the past.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Four-State Tour, Democratic Leaders Try to Reconnect With Workers", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 The three Democratic congressmen sat at one end of a long, rectangular table that extended nearly the length of the Teamsters hall here, surrounded by about 50 union leaders, members and local residents offering a mix of praise, complaints and political strategy.\u201cThis is a forum that was desperately needed for a long time,\u201d James H. Paylor Jr., a top organizer for the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, told the lawmakers. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying that it\u2019s never too late as long as you start today.\u201dRepresentatives Mark DeSaulnier of California, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Donald Norcross of New Jersey finished a four-stop, cross-country tour on Aug. 4 that set out to do just that: understand and tap into the economic anxiety felt by many working class voters, as part of a broader, fractious and painful self-examination Democrats have undertaken following Donald J. Trump\u2019s ascension to the White House.\u201cWe in labor, we may not have the billions of dollars, but we still have a lot of people,\u201d said New Jersey State Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and the general vice president of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of seats that belong to working class people. It\u2019s up to us to claim them.\u201dAlong with Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, who could not make the final leg of the trip, the four Democratic House members are planning to release their report, \u201cThe Future of Work, Wages and Labor,\u201d in the coming months. Though they view their work as a complement to the party\u2019s progressive platform, they also acknowledge that fellow Democrats may disagree with some of their proposals.Some of them that might even sound, well, Trumpian.\u201cThose trade agreements, we\u2019re still paying a price on NAFTA,\u201d Mr. Norcross said in an interview, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a frequent target for Mr. Trump on the campaign trail last year.Mr. Norcross argued that some of the demands within his party for uncompromising legislative positions has left Democrats on the wrong side of the jobs argument.\u201cIt\u2019s not yes to everything environmental, no to everything with jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of working those together to try to move them forward.\u201dThe idea for the initiative began a year ago when Mr. DeSaulnier, a freshman congressman from the Bay Area, saw the booming so-called gig economy spawned largely by Uber and other tech start-ups in his district, and wondered how lower paying, part-time jobs might be affecting working families. So he asked the two tradesmen he knew in the House, Mr. Pocan, a painter, and Mr. Norcross, an electrician.That conversation inspired a yearlong tour by the four members of Congress, which culminated this month in a labor town hall meeting inside a crowded Teamsters building in this struggling city in southern New Jersey.Ending the tour here, after stopping in Michigan and Wisconsin (which have \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws that prevent organized labor from forcing all workers to pay union dues or fees), offered a bit of a throwback case study: Though working class families in New Jersey face similar problems as the working class elsewhere, the state still maintains strong ties between organized labor and the Democratic Party.After the town hall meeting, Mr. Paylor expressed both comfort and frustration. He did not know that Mr. Norcross had been working to introduce bills aimed at his interests, including one that would direct the Department of Energy to provide training for energy industry jobs and another that would allow people paying for apprenticeships to receive the same tax benefits as those paying for traditional college.\u201cMost working class people don\u2019t even understand that that\u2019s going on in Washington, so they\u2019re willing to vote against their own personal interest in many cases,\u201d Mr. Paylor said. The Democratic Party and its elected officials, he added, need to do a better job of communicating, and \u201cto identify themselves that they are representative of the working class.\u201dAnd, if Mr. Norcross has his way, maybe a few more working class candidates will appear on the ballot.Mr. Norcross told the crowd in the Teamsters hall that there were more than 200 attorneys in the House of Representatives. \u201cThere\u2019s one electrician, one painter, and one iron worker and one carpenter. We need some more help folks. We need some more.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about efforts by Democrats to reconnect with working class voters erroneously included one state among those with right-to-work laws. Though Michigan and Wisconsin have the laws, California does not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Myth That Corporate Tax Cuts Mean More Jobs", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEvery $1 billion in tax savings would create 7,000 well-paying jobs, Mr. Stephenson went on to say. The correlation between lower corporate taxes and more jobs, he assured viewers, runs \u201cvery, very tight.\u201dAs Congress prepares to take up tax legislation this fall, including an effort to reduce the corporate tax rate, this bold jobs claim merits examination. Notably, it comes from the chief executive of a company that\u2019s already paying comparatively little in federal taxes.Despite the enormous savings AT&T has realized, the company has been downsizing. Although it hires thousands of people a year, the company, by our analysis at the Institute for Policy Studies, reduced its total work force by nearly 80,000 jobs between 2008 and 2016, accounting for acquisitions and spinoffs each involving more than 2,000 workers.Companies buy back their stock for various reasons \u2014 to take advantage of undervaluation, to reward stockholders by increasing the value of their shares or to make the company look more attractive to investors. And there is another reason. Because most executive compensation these days is based on stock value, higher share prices can raise the compensation of chief executives and other top company officials.Since 2008, Mr. Stephenson has cashed in $124 million in stock options and grants.Many other large American corporations have also been playing the tax break and loophole game. Their huge tax savings have enriched executives but not created significant numbers of new jobs.Our report analyzes the 92 publicly held American corporations that reported a profit in the United States every year from 2008 through 2015 and paid less than 20 percent of their earnings in federal income tax.We chose this particular tax threshold because, as Mr. Stephenson mentioned, House Republicans are proposing to reduce the federal statutory corporate tax rate to 20 percent, down from the current 35 percent. President Trump wants an even deeper cut, down to 15 percent.If claims about the job-creation benefits of lower tax rates had any validity, these 92 consistently profitable firms would be among the nation\u2019s strongest job creators. Instead, we found just the opposite.The companies we reviewed had a median job-growth rate over the past nine years of nearly negative 1 percent, compared with 6 percent for the private sector as a whole. Of those 92 companies, 48 got rid of a combined total of 483,000 jobs.At the companies that cut jobs, chief executives\u2019 pay last year averaged nearly $15 million, compared with the $13 million average for S&P 500 companies.Instead of tax-rate cuts for these big corporations, the coming tax debate in Congress should focus on making wealthy individuals and big corporations pay their fair share.American multinationals hold $2.6 trillion in profits \u201coffshore,\u201d on which they would owe $750 billion in federal taxes if the money was repatriated. In most cases, these foreign profit stashes are merely an accounting fiction. Companies retain full access to these funds for use in the United States and could, if their executives so chose, use them to create jobs here.Ordinary Americans have to pay all the taxes they owe each and every year. Offshore corporations should be required to do the same.Beyond closing loopholes, we need to explore new ways to raise revenue fairly, including a tax on Wall Street speculation.Most of us already pay a sales tax on gasoline, clothes and other basics. Why should hedge fund investors and other Wall Street traders pay no tax at all when they engage in short-term buying and selling of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stocks and derivatives? A fee of just a small fraction of 1 percent on each Wall Street trade would encourage longer-term investment while generating huge revenue for real job creation.The message policy makers really need to hear? Stop peddling the myth that \u201ctax relief\u201d for big companies will be good for the rest of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Stocks Reach New Heights, What\u2019s Trump Got to Do With It?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dIt was, all things considered, a factually accurate statement. Business is looking better. The stock market is at a high. And, yes, it did not happen by itself.The question, however, is this: Has anything that has happened at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had anything to do with it?Putting aside the administration\u2019s inability to successfully pass any meaningful legislation thus far \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot to put aside \u2014 can Mr. Trump fairly take any credit for the market\u2019s trajectory? After all, when I and others talk to C.E.O.s and investors, one constant refrain we hear is that they actually expect little to get done on the legislative front.Where they repeatedly said they were expecting big changes \u2014 that will translate into higher profits \u2014 was in Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to lower regulatory burdens and costs, something that he could accomplish, in part, through executive orders and the appointment of regulators who are less inclined to enforce the rules aggressively.But that\u2019s not right. Listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks \u2014 which are the real reason the stock market has soared \u2014 and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations.The only time the word \u201cregulation\u201d was even used on Apple\u2019s earnings call \u2014 during which the company described how it beat analysts\u2019 estimates by a wide margin \u2014 was in reference to China. The word did not get a mention on Amazon\u2019s earnings call, nor was there any reference to Washington at all, despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth.Even on Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings call, which included several questions and answers related to regulations, not once did any official suggest that the firm\u2019s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens. Indeed, the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses.\u201cThe administration is, at a minimum, telling a one-sided story \u2014 it\u2019s a bit disingenuous,\u201d Charles Campbell, managing director at MKM Partners, said about Mr. Trump and his team\u2019s taking credit for the rising stock market. \u201cFor the average American who is uninformed, it probably passes\u201d as sounding correct, he lamented.But Mr. Campbell said it was \u201ca little early\u201d for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts. \u201cThis is the first full reporting period, quite honestly,\u201d since Mr. Trump took office, he noted.In industries like finance, Mr. Campbell said, stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be business-friendly changes in the regulatory environment. \u201cIt is the anticipation that there will be an effect,\u201d he said.It is very true that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of United States companies, but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch.The larger issue is, when it does happen, how much can deregulation really help juice the economy?The answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy.According to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume.But here\u2019s the rub: It isn\u2019t that simple, in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like $225 billion.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internal Combustion Engine Is Not Dead Yet", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAmong all the world\u2019s uncertainties, at least one matter seems settled: Batteries and electric motors will have a major role in powering the cars and trucks of our future. What is far less certain is how large that role will be, or how quickly the shift to electrification will happen.The trend of electric-powered cars has grown far beyond hybrids like the ubiquitous Toyota Prius. Early this year, Ford Motor announced that it would develop hybrid versions of both its brawny F-150 pickup, the country\u2019s best-selling vehicle, and the performance-focused Mustang. Last month, Volvo said that starting in 2019, all of its newly released models would be hybrid or all-electric. This was quickly followed by the news that France and Britain plan to ban the sale of new petroleum-burning vehicles by 2040.But gas- and diesel-powered engines are not done yet. Just as electrified cars \u2014 whether hybrids or pure battery-powered models \u2014 seem headed for market dominance, Mazda announced a breakthrough in gasoline engines that could make them far more efficient. It is the latest plot twist in a century of improvements for internal combustion engines, a power source pronounced dead many times that has persisted nevertheless. Here is some truth-squadding on the latest in auto technology.Mazda said it had made a big advance in a combustion method commonly known as homogeneous charge compression ignition, which would result in gasoline engines that are 20 to 30 percent more efficient than the company\u2019s best existing engines. Researchers around the world have tried to crack this process for years, but it has never really left the laboratory.Mazda, which now markets no hybrid vehicles, calls the engine Skyactiv-X and says it is scheduled for a 2019 introduction. In simplest terms, the big difference with the new engine is that under certain running conditions, the gasoline is ignited without the use of spark plugs. Instead, combustion is set off by the extreme heat in the cylinder that results from the piston inside the engine traveling upward and compressing air trapped inside, the same method diesel engines use. The efficiency gains come with the ability to operate using a very lean mixture \u2014 very little gas for the amount of air \u2014 that a typical spark-ignition engine cannot burn cleanly.Definitely. John Heywood, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicts that in 2050, 60 percent of light-duty vehicles will still have combustion engines, often working with electric motors in hybrid systems and largely equipped with a turbocharger. Vehicles powered purely by batteries, he estimates, will make up 15 percent of sales.The power-boosting advantage of turbochargers is widely deployed today, but in coming years it could be tilted toward the design of smaller engines that still meet customers\u2019 needs. \u201cThe real benefit comes from downsizing,\u201d Dr. Heywood said. \u201cThat reduces friction, which chews up a significant part of the energy input.\u201dDr. Heywood, who has pondered whether he would best serve his students by teaching combustion or electrochemistry, addresses the challenge of gasoline\u2019s future from a somewhat different direction: the practical limitations of battery electric cars. \u201cHolding a gas nozzle, you can transfer 10 megawatts of energy in five minutes,\u201d he said, explaining today\u2019s refueling reality. To recharge a Tesla electric at that rate today, he said, would require \u201ca cable you couldn\u2019t hold.\u201dThe question is how much better gas engines can get. Conventional piston engines have come a long way, and technical refinements like direct fuel injection, variable valve timing and cylinder shutdown systems are now widespread. Along with innovations in lightweight body materials and dual-clutch transmissions, mileage has steadily improved, so naturally, further gains are now harder to come by \u2014 usually in single-digit percentages.Even the plans in Europe to ban the sale of new gas- or diesel-powered cars will take decades to fully kick in. The rules would not take effect for more than 20 years. In addition, the average age of the 270 million light-duty vehicles on the road in the United States today approaches 12 years, so even if sales of new petrol-burning cars stopped immediately, it would take more than a decade for the fleet to switch over.Hybrids like the Prius may continue to save money at each fill-up, but that\u2019s not the whole story. In its test of the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan, a plug-in model that the government says can drive 33 miles on battery power alone, Car and Driver calculated the payback of the $2,100 hybrid premium to be more than eight years (based on driving 12,000 miles a year and before any tax incentives). So, yes, there are savings if you drive lots of miles or tend to hold on to vehicles for a long time. The calculus shifts if gas gets more expensive. That said, the hybrid is friendlier to the planet in terms of tailpipe emissions and greenhouse gases.By 2050, Dr. Heywood\u2019s studies project, today\u2019s fuel economy could be doubled. \u201cA quarter to a third of that improvement would come from improvements to the vehicle,\u201d he said, in areas like aerodynamics and weight reduction. Other promising areas include variable compression ratios \u2014 a technology Nissan plans to introduce next year \u2014 and making better use of available fuels.That question of whether to teach combustion or electrochemistry? Dr. Heywood still wrestles with it, though he admits that the answer is \u201cboth of the above.\u201d The topic has become the theme of a presentation he has prepared \u2014 and the concept of electrification can be found on most pages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Developers and Panel Makers Clash Over Tariff Request", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Dozens of solar industry executives, government officials and foreign diplomats gathered here on Tuesday to urge federal trade commissioners to reject a petition from two troubled domestic solar equipment manufacturers to impose steep tariffs and minimum price guarantees on similar imports.At risk, they argued, is the future of the solar industry itself.\u201cThey seek a public remedy for their own private failings,\u201d said Matthew R. Nicely, a lawyer representing the main solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, before the United States International Trade Commission. \u201cIf successful, they will undermine the hard work and innovation that is making solar a viable alternative to conventional energy sources.\u201dBut Matthew J. McConkey, a lawyer for Suniva, the Georgia-based manufacturer that originally brought the petition, argued that the case was about more than two companies that managed to outlast the many manufacturers squeezed out of business by foreign competition.\u201cThe United States is literally strewn with the carcasses of shuttered solar manufacturing facilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about all of those companies and their workers who are out of business.\u201dAt issue is whether the financial woes of Suniva and its co-petitioner, SolarWorld Americas, are a result of unfair competition from Chinese companies benefiting from state subsidies, or of their own business practices. And though the sharp drops in the cost of panels have made it difficult for domestic manufacturers to compete, they have also fueled a boom in solar development throughout the country, providing a lift to an industry that says it now has more than 250,000 jobs.Further complicating matters is that Suniva, once lauded on the White House blog as \u201can American success story\u201d during the Obama administration but now in bankruptcy, is majority-owned by a Chinese company that now disavows the case.With roots in a protracted trade war between the United States and China that started in 2011, the dispute centers on crystalline silicon cells, the major electricity-producing components, as well as the modules, or panels, into which they are assembled. SolarWorld Americas, a subsidiary of a now-bankrupt German panel maker, had filed a trade complaint along with six other domestic solar manufacturers that accused their Chinese counterparts of using unfair government subsidies to finance their operations and then selling their merchandise for less than the cost of manufacturing and shipping it.SolarWorld won the case, as well as a second that included Taiwan, where Chinese manufacturers had turned for cells to avoid anticipated tariffs. But that, the petitioners argue, set off a global race to the bottom on price, as manufacturers opened factories in other low-cost countries, leading to the current case. This time, the companies are seeking blanket global protections to keep manufacturers from circumventing tariffs aimed at specific countries by expanding elsewhere in what the petition referred to as a game of Whac-a-Mole.The case, which the commission itself designated \u201cextraordinarily complicated,\u201d has given rise to a number of unusual alliances and fault lines. It has lined up almost the entire domestic industry \u2014 from electricians to corporate executives \u2014 against two of its own. It has also made bedfellows of solar businesses and conservative-minded policy groups opposed to trade restrictions and subsidies that have in the past worked to undermine solar\u2019s forward march.Among those opposing the Suniva petition is the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is connected with Charles G. and David H. Koch, billionaire brothers whose fortunes derive, at least in part, from fossil fuels.About 300 people attended Tuesday\u2019s hearing, sending staff members scrambling to squeeze extra chairs into the chamber to accommodate all the witnesses and their lawyers, as well as the public. In that group was a crew of solar workers organized by the solar trade group, wearing T-shirts that said, \u201cSave America\u2019s Solar Jobs, No New Solar Tariffs.\u201dThe opponents, led by the trade group, argued that tariffs would increase the price of solar panels, halting the rapid spread of solar development \u2014 especially on the scale undertaken by utilities \u2014 and jeopardizing tens of thousands of jobs.\u201cAll else equal, any increase in equipment costs for utility-scale developers, whether the result of lower domestic subsidies or increased import tariffs, would increase the price of solar electricity developers could offer,\u201d said Amy Grace, who leads North America research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. And that increase, she said, \u201cwould result in fewer contracts being signed and lower solar deployment.\u201dA handful of renewable energy executives testified that the problems of Suniva and SolarWorld stemmed from their inability to qualify for financing, their inability to produce and deliver modules that met the industry\u2019s needs, and their inability to compete in a quickly evolving industry. But the petitioners defended their products, saying that they had attracted steady customers and had few performance problems. Instead, they said, the problem was the quickly plummeting prices that resulted from the oversupply of overseas panels last year.An economist testifying in support of the petitioners, Andrew Szamosszegi of Capital Trade, offered evidence of a relationship between the glut, particularly in China, and a steep drop in prices last year. He quoted the 2016 financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission from SunPower, whose chief executive, Tom Werner, had testified against imposing tariffs.\u201cExcess capacity and industry competition have resulted in the past, and may continue to result, in substantial downward pressure on the price of solar cells and panels,\u201d Mr. Szamosszegi read.A different argument in support of the case was delivered by Bucky Johnson, the mayor of Norcross, Ga., where Suniva is based.\u201cSome might say protectionism \u2014 I say bunk,\u201d he told the commission. \u201cGiven a level playing field, I believe that Suniva and the solar manufacturing industry can thrive in our economy and provide some of the most innovative and sustainable products in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Are Signaling That Hurricane Harvey Won\u2019t Crush the Economy", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPricing a DisasterHurricane Harvey is a disaster of monumental proportions that will destroy vast amounts of property and upend millions of lives. But it also appears that the overall economic toll, at least for the United States as a whole, will be modest. And that surprising fact offers important lessons about how the modern economy works.That benign view of the economic impact of the storm is the immediate verdict of financial markets Monday, which showed no signs of expectations that there will be broad ripple effects.The stock market was essentially flat at midday. Bond prices are also little changed; if investors expected lasting damage, they would most likely would have bid up bond prices, seeking safety and anticipating a slower pace of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.And despite the Texas Gulf Coast\u2019s central role in American energy production, oil prices are not exhibiting the kind of spike they did after Hurricane Katrina in 2005; the price of West Texas intermediate crude fell Friday and Monday.Gasoline prices are a different story, having risen because refining capacity was shut down amid the storm. But the 9 percent rise in the price of gasoline futures in the last week is the kind of swing that happens routinely, and has brought prices back only to around their late-July level.But when you pick apart the ways a disaster \u2014 even a huge one \u2014 can affect the overall economy, it becomes clearer why financial markets and economic forecasters are so sanguine.There are likely to be power outages, and there is already severe flooding of roads and other transportation infrastructure. Industrial facilities themselves may be damaged by floods. But one thing that the Hurricane Katrina experience, among other disasters, has showed is how effective modern corporations are at overcoming those kinds of logistical challenges.There\u2019s not much evidence of that happening because of Harvey for a few reasons. Home insurance policies generally do not cover flooding, which means the severe flood damage should have less impact on insurers\u2019 payouts than you might expect. For many individuals, the financial losses from flooding can be devastating. But the possibility of the kinds of systemic problems that ripple across global financial markets appears remote.The need to rebuild or repair flooded buildings in Texas could create a surge in economic output in the state in the months ahead, generating higher growth in gross domestic product. This is a macabre artifact of economic accounting \u2014 no one would suggest that people are actually better off when billions of dollars\u2019 worth of capital is destroyed. But it is how the math works.If this disaster had happened in a period like 2009 or 2010, when the housing bust had left millions of people \u2014 especially construction workers \u2014 unemployed, the need to rebuild homes and businesses in Houston might have worked like stimulus spending.But it\u2019s not 2010 anymore. The unemployment rate among construction workers peaked at 27.1 percent in February 2010, but is now down to 4.9 percent. There aren\u2019t a lot of qualified, idle construction workers. Perhaps the availability of well-paying jobs in rebuilding homes in Texas and in doing mold remediation work and other tasks that will be in high demand could even coax people into the labor force who have been on the sidelines. In that case, the effort that goes into rebuilding Houston may create a bit of a boost to G.D.P., even if much of it comes at the cost of economic activity elsewhere.The storm continues to wallop the Gulf Coast, and it\u2019s premature to declare that the economy is in the clear. But the initial evidence suggests that the human damage is far greater than the economic damage.Advertisement"}

Alongside its new owner\u2019s Wrangler, Timberland Pro Series and Red Kap brands, Dickies will give VF a leading position in what it calls the global workwear marketplace, which it estimates is a $30 billion-a-year opportunity. VF expects Dickies sales to rise about 4 percent a year to over $1 billion in 2021.On that basis, the acquisition is also financially savvy. VF says it can raise Dickies\u2019 operating margin to about 14 percent, roughly double its current level, if below the profitability of its own workwear division.That would generate some $105 million of after-tax profit, suggesting a rough return on investment of more than 12 percent after four years. That alone merits taking a flier on making America great again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C.E.O.s Long Avoided Politics. Trump Is Changing the Calculus.", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe bar for a chief executive of a public corporation to repudiate a United States president is extraordinarily high. Corporate leaders aren\u2019t given their power, prestige, responsibility and nine-figure pay packages to use the corner office as their personal soapbox.With President Trump\u2019s comments on white supremacists and other right-wing extremists ringing in the ears of America\u2019s chief executives, that high bar appears to have been passed.Such a public schism between a president and a business leadership long considered the backbone of the Republican establishment left corporate historians at a loss for precedent. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything to compare to this,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management and the author of \u201cFiring Back: How Great Leaders Rebound From Career Disasters.\u201dCharles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said he knew of no other examples, not even involving Richard Nixon at the height of the Vietnam War protests and during Watergate.Referring to a tweet by Mr. Trump criticizing Kenneth C. Frazier, the Merck executive who led this week\u2019s corporate retreat from the White House councils, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, \u201cNever in history has a president attacked and threatened the chief executive of a major U.S. corporation like that.\u201dAfter provoking a furor with his initial failure to condemn the white supremacists behind last weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump might have staved off a full-scale exodus with his somewhat stilted but conciliatory comments on Monday. But then he reignited the flames at a news conference on Tuesday at which he said there was \u201cblame on both sides,\u201d including club-wielding members of what he called the \u201calt-left,\u201d for the Charlottesville violence. The white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke were quick to embrace his remarks.As pressure mounted on prominent council members like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Ginni Rometty of IBM and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, as well as other chief executives who remained silent or issued platitudes, corporate boards were hastily meeting to map strategy. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from 24 chief executives in the past two days,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said on Wednesday. \u201cBoards are having ad hoc conference calls. People are very worried and concerned.\u201dThose conversations have been far more complicated than one might expect. It\u2019s safe to say that no chief executive wants to be identified with white supremacy, racism or domestic terrorism. At the same time the president wields enormous influence over their shareholders, employees and customers.\u201cChief executives don\u2019t have the luxury of ventilating their personal political opinions, whatever they might be,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t let their personal views influence their business decisions. If they really feel strongly about something, they can always resign and then say whatever they want.\u201dBack then, Mr. Sonnenfeld, too, praised Mr. Trump\u2019s openness to business views as a welcome change from an Obama administration perceived as anti-business. \u201cHe\u2019s very charming and open to new ideas,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said then of Mr. Trump.This week was a different story. After the Charlottesville events and Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, \u201cchief executives have a moral duty to use their position as a bully pulpit and to speak out,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said, adding that George Weyerhaeuser, a former chairman of the giant timber and wood products company bearing his name, had once told him, \u201cWe have a license to operate from society, and if we violate that license it can be revoked.\u201dOr as Mr. Elson told me, \u201cAt some point, if identification with the administration becomes so polarizing that it impairs your ability to run the company, then you may have to do something.\u201dWeighing the benefits of advising a president steeped in controversy versus the risks to shareholders and other constituents from potential consumer boycotts is a calculus that varies widely from company to company.That new action appears to have arrived.\u201cThe risk of consumer blowback is especially acute for companies like Under Armour, and you\u2019ve seen this elsewhere in the retail space,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. But he noted that speaking out against a social scourge like racism can also enhance a brand. \u201cTaking a public stand doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a misalignment with shareholder interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be the right thing to do. Howard Schultz has done this very effectively at Starbucks.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Schultz publicly criticized the president\u2019s response to the Charlottesville events, and on Wednesday he spoke at an emotional companywide meeting. \u201cI come to you as an American, as a Jew, as a parent, as a grandparent, as an almost 40-year partner of a company I love so dearly,\u201d he said. \u201cI come to you with profound, profound concern about the lack of character, morality, humanity and what this might mean for young children and young generations.\u201dIn such circumstances, collective action by business leaders is often the most effective course, as members of the president\u2019s advisory councils appear to have decided this week. That way no one company bears the brunt of the president\u2019s wrath.After Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Charlottesville, Mr. Sonnenfeld has been among those calling for collective opposition. \u201cFomenting racial unrest is not in the nation\u2019s interest and it\u2019s not in businesses\u2019 interest,\u201d he said. \u201cDivide and conquer has always been Trump\u2019s strategy, and somehow it has worked until now. The way to take a bully down is through collective action.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Thursday, about the calculus of chief executives in deciding whether to take on the president, referred incompletely to President Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday about the instigators of last weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va. He said there was \u201cblame on both sides,\u201d including club-wielding members of what he called the \u201calt-left\u201d; he did not say that group was solely responsible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is What Hunger Looks Like \u2014 Again", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMogadishu, Somalia \u2014 As I waited for my ride to collect me from the Mogadishu airport, an officer told me an apocryphal tale: A starving goat, blind from hunger, mistook a baby wrapped in a green cloth for grass and bit off a mouthful of emaciated flesh from the baby\u2019s upper arm. The baby\u2019s anguished cry brought the mother to her knees and she wept in prayer. The next day, a friend I met in Mogadishu repeated a variation of the same tale.I saw the story as encapsulating much of what everyone needs to know about the goat-eats-baby severity of the current famine in the Somali Peninsula, with more than six million affected, crops wasting away, livestock dead or dying, water and foods scarce. Cholera, typhoid and meningitis finish the job that prolonged hunger has started.The families at the internally displaced people\u2019s camps had left their scorched farms and walked numerous miles in punishing heat, across land stripped of vegetation. Parents go mad with despair at the sight of their babies dying from hunger, thirst or both. Hunger affects children\u2019s memories. More than a million children are projected to be malnourished in Somalia, according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.Memories of older famines returned. In 1974, I lived in Somalia when the rains failed and a drought worked itself into a famine. Our destitute relatives, who had lost several children and their beasts to the famine, turned up at our doorstep.Seventeen years later, in 1991, the Somali civil war destroyed the state and created a huge reduction in food production. In 2011, when another famine stalked the nation, I remember standing in the midst of a rainless ruin as the weak wind, as malnourished as the people, blew across a barren land, unable to stir the dust in the cracks of the hard-baked earth. The men and women I met were bereft of every vital element that gives meaning to life. About 260,000 people died of hunger.Lower Shabelle and Bakool, the two regions most hit by famine and controlled by Al Shabaab militants, are inaccessible. Al Shabaab denies the existence of famine in the areas it controls and has barred humanitarian agencies from reaching those affected. Sadly, the United Nations and the international community have also refrained from describing it as a famine.I contacted a man whom I will call Mr. Markaawi. He worked with an aid group that ran a camp on the outskirts of the city for those displaced by war and famine. Since the collapse of the Somali state in 1991, one is more likely to fall prey to a bomb when driving on a highway, in a cafe, in a well-appointed restaurant, a luxury hotel, a hospital or at a refugee camp. A journey away from one\u2019s private space in Somalia renders one as vulnerable as a clay pigeon, ready to be shot at.Friends in Mogadishu, where I was visiting from Capetown, where I currently live, dissuaded me from traveling to the camps outside the capital. Mr. Markaawi helped me meet some displaced families at his office, close to my hotel.Again and again during our conversations I heard the refrain that the famine had been at work for months before it was being talked about, that the international response had been slow and that disease and child malnutrition and early deaths intensified as the famine spread across southern Somalia, more particularly in the territories controlled by Al Shabaab.Moreover, the dysfunction of the Somali state, its inability to improve the economy and meet its people\u2019s needs, the long war and the corruption of the political class had forced the Somalis to place greater trust in the international community.There was a clear sense that the current famine was more lethal than the one in 2011. \u201cWe lost a third of the beasts we owned in 2011,\u201d a man said. \u201cNow the devastation is more severe. We\u2019ve lost all our cattle. No water, no food and no seeds to plant.\u201d People took the only option open: They left. Each family in the camp receives $70 from the aid groups to feed and support themselves.I met Faduma Abdullahi, a 36-year-old mother of eight, who had come to the displaced people\u2019s camp outside Mogadishu from a village in the Kurtunwarey District in southern Somalia, about 100 miles away.She and her sharecropper husband owned a farm and a house and survived the 2011 famine by bartering for essentials. This time they abandoned their farm and house because nearly everything they had was gone. The couple feared that they and their children would starve to death. \u201cWe borrowed the bus fare and came to the camp,\u201d she said. From the $70 an NGO gives them, they pay a fee for a villager to look after their house.Nobody from the Somali government or a foreign organization had visited their farming village to offer assistance. I had heard of Muslim charities working in the area near her village. I wondered if they ever helped. \u201cWe never set eyes on an Arab,\u201d Ms. Abdullahi said.Many villagers \u2014 like a farmer and a teacher whom I shall call Mohamed Mahmoud Mohamed, for his safety \u2014 were willing to survive on little and stay, but threats and fear of enforced recruitment by Al Shabaab made them leave. Mr. Mohamed, a 43-year-old father of three, ran a Quranic school with 60 students in his village. He farmed and raised cows when he wasn\u2019t teaching.Mr. Mohamed had no more milk to sell. His cows died in the famine. His classroom began emptying as the students left with their parents. The absence of rain, water and food forced him and his family to debate whether they should join the exodus. Mr. Mohamed said he wanted to stay and find a way to survive. Then Al Shabaab began seeing him \u2014 a teacher of the Quran \u2014 as a man worth recruiting for their cause. Mr. Mohamed and his family left.I spoke to Mr. Mohammed about the tale of the goat and the baby. He was not surprised. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t shock me,\u201d he said. \u201cTerrible famines change the nature of both human and animal behavior.\u201dMr. Markaawi was worried about the gap between what governments and donors pledge and what they eventually deliver. He narrated a folk tale in which a starving woman hears the moo of a cow coming from the heavens and she prays to Allah to bring down the cow so that she can feed her starving children. The cow, when it presents itself to the woman, turns out to be a hyena. I asked him to interpret the folk tale. \u201cI would say that no aid whose main aim is to provide stopgap emergency humanitarian assistance is good enough to do the job.\u201dNuruddin Farah is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cHiding in Plain Sight.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Wants to Help Harvey Victims. Trump Should Say Yes.", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDurham, N.C. \u2014 Some of the most heartening images to emerge from storm-torn Houston this week have been of neighbors doing what we all hope our neighbors will do when we are in trouble.From shuttling victims to safety in their personal boats to braving waist-high water searching for the stranded, neighbors have been helping neighbors cope with the worst natural disaster ever to strike the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city, and doing it without regard to politics or ideology.Another neighbor has offered to help us in these desperate times, a neighbor that also came to our aid when Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Gulf Coast 12 years ago. That neighbor is Mexico. The Trump administration should accept its help again, and do so with thanks and gratitude.Because, as Hurricane Harvey can teach President Trump, that\u2019s what neighbors do.I witnessed Mexico\u2019s willingness to be a good neighbor while serving as the No. 2 at the American Embassy in Mexico City in 2005. Within hours of Hurricane Katrina\u2019s landfall in New Orleans, Mexican officials were on the phone offering to send army field kitchens and naval cleanup crews to the stricken areas.Those offers frankly caught us flat-footed. We were accustomed to looking at Mexico as the poor relation who needed our help, not the other way around. Even more surprising, the Mexican Army was by far the most nationalistic and anti-American element in the Mexican government. Yet it ended up leading a convoy of more than 200 Mexican soldiers to assist displaced Americans in San Antonio, where it eventually served 170,000 meals, distributed more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations.Although few Americans outside of Texas were aware of the episode, it was a major morale boost for Mexico and a transformative moment in American-Mexican military-to-military relations, which thawed noticeably from that point forward.Mexico has again done the neighborly thing, and we can again transform our relationship. On Tuesday, the Mexican Embassy in Washington formally sent a diplomatic note to the State Department offering humanitarian assistance to the victims of Hurricane Harvey. The Mexican foreign ministry had issued a news release over the weekend signaling the move and noting that it was acting \u201cas good neighbors should always do in times of difficulty.\u201dThe Mexican offer must still be approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State Department, in coordination with Texas officials, who will decide what they need. While the details remain to be hashed out, Mexico has a proven disaster-relief capability and is next door to the worst-hit areas. The approval process was complicated in 2005 by chaos in Washington and red tape on the ground \u2014 federal agricultural inspectors at the border almost turned the Mexican kitchen convoy around because its cooks couldn\u2019t prove that beef they were carrying came from a mad-cow-free facility. This time, we should not let interagency fumbling cause delays.Mexico\u2019s decision to come to our assistance in 2005 was unexpected. But its willingness to help us again today seems even more stunning. Mexico remains the United States\u2019 second-largest export market, fourth-largest oil provider and the only country besides Canada with which we share a land border. Our economies, culture and history are highly integrated and critically interdependent, as those of neighbors often are. Yet President Trump has made Mexico-bashing the applause line of countless campaign speeches and late-night tweets.Even as the Mexican government was preparing its assistance offer over the weekend, with the hurricane churning over South Texas, Mr. Trump continued his tirade. \u201cWith Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.\u201dMexican leaders may well see their offer as an effort to counter Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Mexico monologue. But they also have a record of demonstrating that when the chips are down, humanity trumps hubris.If Texas decides it could use Mexico\u2019s help, Mr. Trump should swallow whatever embarrassment he feels at what he has said in the past and seize this opportunity to set our relationship right.It would be the neighborly thing to do.Stephen R. Kelly is a research scholar at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and a retired American diplomat who served in Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not Too Late on North Korea", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorth Korea\u2019s substantial nuclear arsenal and improving intercontinental ballistic missile capacity pose a growing threat to America\u2019s security. But we need not face an immediate crisis if we play our hand carefully.Given the bluster emanating from Pyongyang and Bedminster, N.J., Americans can be forgiven for feeling anxious.Shortly after adoption of new United Nations sanctions last weekend, North Korea threatened retaliation against the United States \u201cthousands of times\u201d over. Those sanctions were especially potent, closing loopholes and cutting off important funding for the North. August is also when the United States and South Korea conduct major joint military exercises, which always set Pyongyang on edge. In August 2015, tensions escalated into cross-border artillery exchanges after two South Korean soldiers were wounded by land mines laid by North Korea. This juxtaposition of tough sanctions and military exercises has predictably heightened North Korea\u2019s threats.We have long lived with successive Kims\u2019 belligerent and colorful rhetoric \u2014 as ambassador to the United Nations in the Obama administration, I came to expect it whenever we passed resolutions. What is unprecedented and especially dangerous this time is the reaction of President Trump. Unscripted, the president said on Tuesday that if North Korea makes new threats to the United States, \u201cthey will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d These words risk tipping the Korean Peninsula into war, if the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, believes them and acts precipitously.Either Mr. Trump is issuing an empty threat of nuclear war, which will further erode American credibility and deterrence, or he actually intends war next time Mr. Kim behaves provocatively. The first scenario is folly, but a United States decision to start a pre-emptive war on the Korean Peninsula, in the absence of an imminent threat, would be lunacy.We carefully studied this contingency. \u201cPreventive war\u201d would result in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of casualties. Metropolitan Seoul\u2019s 26 million people are only 35 miles from the border, within easy range of the North\u2019s missiles and artillery. About 23,000 United States troops, plus their families, live between Seoul and the Demilitarized Zone; in total, at least 200,000 Americans reside in South Korea.Japan, and almost 40,000 United States military personnel there, would also be in the cross hairs. The risk to American territory cannot be discounted, nor the prospect of China being drawn into a direct conflict with the United States. Then there would be the devastating impact of war on the global economy.The national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, said last week that if North Korea \u201chad nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States, it\u2019s intolerable from the president\u2019s perspective.\u201d Surely, we must take every reasonable step to reduce and eliminate this threat. And surely there may be circumstances in which war is necessary, including an imminent or actual attack on our nation or our allies.But war is not necessary to achieve prevention, despite what some in the Trump administration seem to have concluded. History shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea \u2014 the same way we tolerated the far greater threat of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War.It will require being pragmatic.First, though we can never legitimize North Korea as a nuclear power, we know it is highly unlikely to relinquish its sizable arsenal because Mr. Kim deems the weapons essential to his regime\u2019s survival. The North can now reportedly reach United States territory with its ICBMs. The challenge is to ensure that it would never try.By most assessments, Mr. Kim is vicious and impetuous, but not irrational. Thus, while we quietly continue to refine our military options, we can rely on traditional deterrence by making crystal clear that any use of nuclear weapons against the United States or its allies would result in annihilation of North Korea. Defense Secretary James Mattis struck this tone on Wednesday. The same red line must apply to any proof that North Korea has transferred nuclear weapons to another state or nonstate actor.Second, to avoid blundering into a costly war, the United States needs to immediately halt the reckless rhetoric. John Kelly, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, must assert control over the White House, including his boss, and curb the Trump surrogates whipping up Cuban missile crisis fears.Third, we must enhance our antimissile systems and other defenses, and those of our allies, which need our reassurances more than ever.Fourth, we must continue to raise the costs to North Korea of maintaining its nuclear programs. Ratcheting up sanctions, obtaining unfettered United Nations authority to interdict suspect cargo going in or out of the North, increasing Pyongyang\u2019s political isolation and seeding information into the North that can increase regime fragility are all important elements of a pressure campaign.Finally, we must begin a dialogue with China about additional efforts and contingencies on the peninsula, and revive diplomacy to test potential negotiated agreements that could verifiably limit or eliminate North Korea\u2019s arsenal.Rational, steady American leadership can avoid a crisis and counter a growing North Korean threat. It\u2019s past time that the United States started exercising its power responsibly.Susan E. Rice was the national security adviser from 2013 to 2017 and the United States ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Graduates of Walmart Academy", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Walmart invited me to visit one of its job training programs in late June, I wasn\u2019t sure it was a story.But new to the retail beat, I decided to take the chance and visit Fulton, N.Y., a small city near Syracuse, where the giant retailer runs one of its regional training centers called Walmart Academy. I wanted to understand how the nation\u2019s largest private employer was imparting new skills on its vast work force of 1.2 million people.When I got there, an academy teacher stood at a whiteboard discussing various inventory and merchandising challenges with about a dozen store supervisors. After only a few minutes, I was lost in soup of corporate acronyms, slogans and minutiae \u2014 and no closer to determining whether this training will actually help Walmart workers get ahead in life (or just make them better at selling things). I feared the trip had been a waste.As we left the academy class, one of the managers pointed out a pile of bricks displayed on a cabinet in the back of the store, painted with the yellow Walmart sunshine logo. One of them had a plaque that read \u201cWalmart Academy: Building a Solid Foundation for Our Future Leaders.\u201d\u201cWhere did the bricks come from?\u201d I asked.The manager said they had been pulled out of the former Nestl\u00e9 factory that was being demolished in Fulton. It had made chocolate for generations and employed hundreds of people before it closed in 2003, devastating the local economy. Many of the employees working in the Walmart, he said, are the grandchildren or relatives of former Nestl\u00e9 workers.And from there, the story began to take shape: It wasn\u2019t so much about job training, but about what it looks like when Walmart becomes the equivalent of the new factory in a ruined factory town.The Walmart representatives took me around the Fulton store to introduce me to some recent graduates of the academy. I spent most of the day talking with more than a dozen employees.I met Mac Guile, whose grandparents lost their jobs at Nestl\u00e9 and could barely afford food and hot water. And there was Ashley VanHorn, a mother of two, who talked about overhearing a customer refer to Walmart workers as \u201clow lifes\u201d and how she thinks every day about going back to community college to finish her degree.After I left Fulton, I followed up with the graduates by phone. They spoke candidly not just about working at Walmart, but about adjusting their expectations to the realities of living in an impoverished place like Fulton. Since the election of Donald J. Trump, there has been a great deal of attention paid to the economic and psychic wounds of former manufacturing towns that are rampant with drug addiction, joblessness and a lack of hope.Walmart is not only one of the largest employers in the Fulton area, but it is trying to establish itself \u2014 with caps and gowns and red brick monuments \u2014 as the community\u2019s hub.Of course, Walmart is not doing this out of pure benevolence. The giant publicly traded corporation wants its employees to be more motivated at work and the local community to feel good about shopping at Walmart. And the reality is that the roughly 300 jobs at the Fulton Walmart cannot make up for all the blue-collar jobs lost at Nestl\u00e9 and other factories.When it came to writing, the story needed to raise some critical questions about the efficacy of the training program. But I also wanted to show what the Walmart Academy, and particularly the graduation ceremony, meant to the employees. The moment was as special as if they had been graduating from high school \u2014 a milestone that many of them had missed.Ellen Pollock, the editor of The New York Times\u2019s business section, who first had the idea to look into Walmart Academy, advised me to keep it simple and let the workers tell how they feel.As a reporter covering business, I am constantly looking for how the acts of big companies affect people\u2019s lives. The challenge is to avoid getting caught up in abstract corporate strategies or ponderous economic theories.In this case, the real story was under a pile of bricks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racially Charged Nissan Vote Is a Test for U.A.W. in the South", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for more than 3,500 employees who will be voting Thursday and Friday on whether to unionize the sprawling Nissan plant here, the concern is more immediate: How much they can expect of their employer in a world of diminishing prospects for blue-collar workers \u2014 not just in pay and benefits, but also in status and respect.Conversations with 20 workers reveal a workplace bitterly divided on these questions. In one camp are those who feel that Nissan has provided a standard of living that would have been unattainable had the company not opened its nearly mile-long plant in Canton more than 14 years ago.\u201cMost of us just have a high school education,\u201d said Kim Barber, a quality technician who has been with Nissan since the plant opened, in an overfilled parking lot before her shift last week. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50. I can\u2019t go anywhere else.\u201dMs. Barber said she made about $26 an hour, roughly twice what she made in her previous job driving a forklift at a storage company, adjusting for inflation.In another camp are those workers who believe they should not be asked to grade the company on the curve that is Mississippi\u2019s low-wage economy. \u201cNissan knew what they were doing when they put their plant around here,\u201d said Annie Matthews, a union supporter who is also in quality control and a veteran of 14 years at the plant.Many people had been working at McDonald\u2019s making $7 an hour, she said, \u201cand now this is the best thing that ever happened to them.\u201dUnion supporters complain that the company has been stingy with benefits and bonuses, that workers on the production line are pressured to sacrifice safety to keep the line moving briskly, and that supervisors arbitrarily change policies about discipline and attendance.And another issue looms awkwardly over the forthcoming vote: race. A large majority of the nearly 6,500 workers at the Nissan plant are African-American. One does not have to search hard for racial overtones.Along with some of her co-workers, Ms. Matthews, who is black, claimed that white supervisors rewarded white workers who were their friends with cushier assignments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Billy Bob as your manager, you go duck hunting, possum hunting together,\u201d she said.(The company rejected the accusation, saying that promotions and assignments were made on the basis of merit, and that the rationale for decisions was not always visible to other employees.)The U.A.W., for its part, has taken pains to highlight the campaign\u2019s racial dimension. In its news release announcing the impending vote, it quoted a worker who accused Nissan of violating African-Americans\u2019 labor rights even while marketing cars to them.The union has also forged close alliances with local black pastors and community leaders, whose mantra has been that the ability to form a union is a civil right.Bishop Thomas Jenkins, a local pastor who once led a group of fellow clergymen to the plant to urge Nissan to commit to an evenhanded election process, said Mississippi seemed to have a \u201cspirit of mediocrity,\u201d sending a message that workers \u201cought to be glad to have a job.\u201d Mr. Jenkins said neither he nor his church had received money from the U.A.W.In some ways the sensitivity about race may have prevented the organizing campaign from becoming more divisive than it otherwise might have.In Mississippi, union officials say, the state\u2019s Republican establishment has been relatively subdued, perhaps calculating that more aggressive opposition would be ineffective, even self-defeating.\u201cIf the governor of the state of Mississippi says it\u2019s not good for you, then it must be great for you,\u201d said Barbara Blackmon, the Democratic state senator who represents the area.Officials at the union, which has been working in earnest to organize the Canton plant since 2012, say a unionized South is crucial to restoring leverage for workers across the country, since employers can rein in wages by locating there, or merely threatening to. \u201cThere has to be a floor at some point that workers will not go past,\u201d said Gary Casteel, the union\u2019s second-ranking official.Nissan says that its wages are significantly higher than the average in central Mississippi, and that while it ended eligibility for its pension plan after 2005, it makes two forms of contributions to employees\u2019 retirement accounts \u2014 one matching a portion of what workers contribute, and one independent of their contributions. (The major American automakers contribute a roughly equivalent percentage of workers\u2019 income to their retirement funds.) Nissan distributes annual \u201cthank you\u201d bonuses to workers, worth $4,000 in each of the last two years, though the bonuses are not based on profitability, as is the practice with American automakers.In an ad campaign, Nissan testifies to its efforts to improve the lives of its workers. One ad features an African-American supervisor who describes struggling to pay her bills as a single mother before landing at Nissan, which later promoted her and even helped her finish college.\u201cIf anything, it should be the opposite argument,\u201d said Scott Waller, interim president and chief executive of the Mississippi Economic Council, a business advocacy group, alluding to the potential for racial polarization. The high proportion of African-Americans that Nissan employs at the plant, he said, \u201cspeaks to the great progress, the positive things that are happening in this state.\u201dStill, workers say there is more than one way to divide them than along racial lines \u2014 namely, by inciting fear. And Nissan \u2014 which unlike Volkswagen before it has refused to stay neutral in the union campaign \u2014 has not forsworn this tactic.In a video shown to workers, Steve Marsh, the plant\u2019s top official, warned that the employees of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler represented by the U.A.W. \u201cexperienced significant instability in recent years, and suffered from many layoffs and plant closings.\u201dManagers have also held frequent discussions with workers in which they make similar suggestions about how a union could hurt job security. Nissan says the meetings are intended to counter misinformation.Workers say there are also fault lines between those who have more to lose and those who have less. For example, workers hired in the plant\u2019s early years make about $26 an hour and receive six days of paid time off each year; workers hired more recently top out at about $24 (and often make less) and receive only three paid days off. (In addition to paid time off, all Nissan employees receive 14 paid holidays and 10 to 20 vacation days, depending on how long they\u2019ve been at the company.)Some workers are also promoted into less physically demanding jobs like quality control, while others languish on the assembly line for a decade or more.Many of the anti-union workers are \u201cin a job where they\u2019re just walking around with a clipboard, they\u2019re not on that line,\u201d said Eric Hearn, who has worked on one of the plant\u2019s assembly lines for five years. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to say anything.\u201dAt a meeting of workers at the local U.A.W. office last week, union supporters fumed about a recent slide presentation in which managers explained that Nissan could not guarantee most workers their old jobs in the event of a strike.One worker, Chip Wells, later said in an interview that many colleagues were worried by the presentation, even though strikes are a rarity.\u201cIt just scared a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Wells said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rwanda President\u2019s Lopsided Re-election Is Seen as a Sign of Oppression", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 The re-election of Paul Kagame, Rwanda\u2019s longtime president, had never been in question. But opponents and rights advocates say his nearly 99 percent margin of victory reflects what they call an oppressive political environment that stifles dissent in the central African nation.The lopsidedness of the result of the Friday vote giving Mr. Kagame a third seven-year term, announced on Saturday, was no surprise to supporters. They called it an accurate barometer of his enormous popularity in transforming Rwanda from the post-genocide depths into a beacon of African prosperity and stability.\u201cPeople trust him. If it were not democratic, he could even score 100 percent,\u201d said Wellers Gasamagera, the spokesman for Mr. Kagame\u2019s Rwandan Patriotic Front political party. \u201cThere is nothing strange as to the high score in terms of votes.\u201dStill, the results also punctuated the glaring absence of a viable opposition in Rwanda. Dissenting views are frequently silenced.One of Mr. Kagame\u2019s opponents in the election had expected to do far better or even win. Frank Habineza, founder of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, said before the vote that he had anticipated receiving 65 percent of the total. He got less than one half of 1 percent.Mr. Habineza, a former journalist, said in an interview on Saturday that the results were \u201cindeed not pleasing as we had expected.\u201dThe portents of defeat seemed clear at one of Mr. Habineza\u2019s last campaign rallies. Held on a roadside in the outskirts of Kigali, the capital, only 500 people showed up. Chickens darted around while half the crowd stood across the street, listening from a distance.By contrast, at the president\u2019s final campaign rally on Wednesday on a hilltop near Kigali, more than 200,000 people sang, danced and cheered while waving the party flag.\u201cKagame really changed the lives of the people, so we have to vote for him,\u201d said Chaste Uwihoreye, 39, a clinical psychologist who lost both parents in the 1994 genocide that left 800,000 Tutsis dead.He credited Mr. Kagame, who led rebel forces to stop the massacre, with uniting and reconciling Rwandans while expanding the country\u2019s economy.Mr. Habineza acknowledged that some people in Rwanda fear criticizing the government. In 2010, his party\u2019s vice president was found beheaded weeks before the elections. Other opposition parties have faced violence and harassment.Still, he said, \u201cNo one will ever intimidate me.\u201dMore than 6.6 million Rwandans cast ballots for Mr. Kagame, according to the official tally. Just over 80,000 voted for the opposition. The government said turnout totaled 96 percent.The postelection mood was somber for the new People Salvation Movement, which says that it has been systemically persecuted by Mr. Kagame\u2019s loyalists. Fifteen of its members met inside a gated house, curtains drawn and doors shut, to discuss future strategy.Diane Rwigara, 35, an accountant who leads the group and was once considered a strong contender against Mr. Kagame, said she was fighting against fear. \u201cPeople get mistreated by the government, by people of power, and they choose to keep quiet,\u201d she said.Ms. Rwigara said she had submitted almost double the required signatures to qualify as a presidential candidate, but was rejected by the electoral commission in July. She said the influence of Mr. Kagame\u2019s party over the commission meant it had \u201cno capacity to organize free and fair elections.\u201dThe consequences of her intention to challenge Mr. Kagame came quickly.Fake nude photos of Ms. Rwigara circulated on the internet. The Rwandan tax agency demanded $6.6 million from her family\u2019s tobacco business for taxes, penalties, fees and interest. Her family\u2019s bank accounts have been frozen and businesses shuttered, surrounded by state security forces.\u201cIt\u2019s because I spoke out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t just kill you physically. They kill you financially, too.\u201dPlainclothes government security forces seized the co-founder of her movement on Dec. 26 after he had given an interview in a local newspaper, Ms. Rwigara said, and \u201cnobody knows\u201d where he is.At a rural polling station about an hour outside Kigali, Charles Ndamage, who voted for Mr. Habineza, said his neighbors had threatened him for supporting an opposition candidate.\u201cIn the village, you can be treated as an enemy of the country,\u201d Mr. Ndamage said.Ida Sawyer, the central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said that under Mr. Kagame, independent news media have been silenced and rights organizations are almost nonexistent \u201cafter years of intimidation and interference.\u201dBoniface Twagirimana, the vice president of the United Democratic Forces of Rwanda, said his party had been forced to operate illegally after the government rejected its repeated registration applications.Mr. Twagirimana claims plainclothes intelligence operatives tried to kidnap and strangle him in Kigali more than two years ago.\u201cWe can even die. Every day we wait for those people who finish us anytime,\u201d he said.In March 2016, a member of Mr. Twagirimana\u2019s party disappeared, according to Amnesty International, and last May, a party representative\u2019s body was found mutilated. The party\u2019s chairman is serving a 15-year prison sentence on charges of terrorism and threatening national security, after running for president in 2010.The outcome of political repression in Rwanda, Mr. Twagirimana said, is that Mr. Kagame \u201cis competing against himself.\u201dMr. Gasamagera, the spokesman for Mr. Kagame\u2019s party, rejected such criticism as unwarranted. He said Rwanda had a \u201cfree and open environment for freedom of expression.\u201dNine of the 11 registered political parties in Rwanda endorsed Mr. Kagame in his presidential run. A 2015 constitutional referendum approved by 98 percent of voters allows Mr. Kagame to potentially remain in power until 2034.At Rwanda\u2019s electoral commission headquarters in downtown Kigali, the commission\u2019s executive secretary, Charles Munyaneza, said he had been \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the voting process.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Staley\u2019s Series of Unfortunate Events", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDays into a two-week sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Seumas Meharg reeled in a 150-pound yellowfin tuna.As the immense fish flailed on the deck, he tried to dispatch it with a knife. He stabbed the creature once, then took another shot. This time, his hand slipped, and the knife sliced deeply into his fingers.\u201cI went down to the galley, washed my hand, made a fist, sat down and was quite white,\u201d Mr. Meharg recalled.The sailboat\u2019s owner, James E. Staley, pulled out a satellite phone and dialed a doctor. Emergency stitches were a must. But help in Africa was three long days away; the Caribbean, a week and a half.So Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, got to work. While another mate did the stitching, Mr. Staley held down his friend and then helped tie the knots and mop up the blood.That incident, four years ago aboard the Bequia, is typical of Mr. Staley, now the chief executive of the British bank Barclays. Friends and colleagues said he reacts to problems quickly and sometimes impulsively, with dogged loyalty.Three decades ago, when his brother came out as gay, Mr. Staley began attending Act Up meetings. At the money management division of JPMorgan Chase, he ended a demeaning practice that required people who were fired to leave immediately with their belongings in a box. As a trustee of Bowdoin College, he helped install as president Clayton S. Rose, a longtime friend who was seen as an unconventional candidate because he didn\u2019t have tenure and had spent 20 years in banking before starting a second career in academia.But if Mr. Staley were a character from classical literature, his fidelity would be his tragic flaw.Since being named the chief executive of Barclays on Dec. 1, 2015, the 60-year-old American has come under investigation by British bank regulators for trying to unmask a whistle-blower who criticized the competency of one of his senior hires. He has lost the confidence of a major client, the powerful private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, which was angered by Mr. Staley\u2019s attempt to help his brother-in-law\u2019s business interests \u2014 at what KKR regarded as its expense.On a more prosaic note, he even fell for an email from a prankster, who, posing as the chairman of Barclays, pledged allegiance after a bruising annual investor meeting.Mr. Staley declined to be interviewed for this article, citing the whistle-blower investigation. But he agreed to let a reporter shadow him for a day while he worked.\u201cWe are done restructuring Barclays,\u201d he said that day in July at a town-hall meeting at the bank\u2019s office in Leeds in northern England. \u201cWe are going to make or break it based on what we\u2019re doing today and what we\u2019re doing here, in London, and in New York, and around the world. And I think it\u2019s going to pivot, sort of, the way the bank thinks about itself, because now the only thing that\u2019s going to work is us, if we make it work.\u201dMr. Staley\u2019s stumbles have spurred demands from some shareholders for his resignation. During the bank\u2019s second quarter, his asset sales led to a huge loss, which was compounded by disappointing trading results and sizable legal costs. Shares of Barclays are down 13 percent so far this year.His current quandary is an outgrowth of Barclays\u2019s transformation from a three-century-old British commercial and retail lender, with Quaker roots, into a global banking and trading powerhouse.In the 1980s, Wall Street banks arrived in London, and the city soon became the hub of global finance. Barclays decided it needed to compete with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and the like in trading and deal making. It brought in an American executive named Robert E. Diamond Jr. to build its investment banking business. And in the wake of the financial crisis, it acquired the United States\u2019 operations of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, giving it a large presence in New York.While the investment banking business brought growth, it also generated problems with regulators and a heavy legal cost. Mr. Diamond was jettisoned in 2012 after an investigation led to a $450 million fine over allegations that Barclays traders had manipulated an important interest rate benchmark known as Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate.The bank then turned to a retail banker, Antony Jenkins, as a safer steward of its business. But he, too, was ousted after a three-year turnaround effort that was deemed too slow.How much to emphasize investment banking over Barclays\u2019s traditional banking business in Britain continues to be a source of internal tension.Running Barclays \u201cis a challenge because of the structure of the bank,\u201d said Richard Portes, an economics professor at the London Business School.Under Mr. Staley, Mr. Portes said, \u201cit hasn\u2019t changed the strategy in terms of putting weight \u2014 a lot of weight \u2014 on the investment banking side of the business. Maybe that is a good call. It\u2019s not obvious.\u201dSo far, Mr. Staley has weathered an internal investigation and calls to throw him out at an annual shareholder meeting in May. But his ouster may still come due to an inquiry by a British regulator into his conduct toward the whistle-blower; the results of the inquiry are expected as early as this fall.In Britain, Barclays still has the cachet of a Goldman Sachs and the reach of a Bank of America. It was a major player in Africa for a century, and introduced the first automated cash machine in 1967. Last year, one of every three pounds spent in Britain was facilitated in some way by a Barclays credit card.But investigations and management missteps have turned its executive suite into a temporary office. Mr. Staley is the fifth chief executive in seven years.Despite the trouble, his strategy for reshaping the bank\u2019s operations has won praise from analysts and employees. To cut costs, preserve capital and strengthen Barclays in the eyes of regulators, he sold most of its African operations and cut the quarterly dividend to stockholders. He bolstered the company\u2019s commitment to investment banking, partly by working his own contacts in private equity and at multinational companies.But these efforts may not be enough.Mr. Staley was born in Cambridge, Mass., one of the many stops along his father\u2019s career as a plant manager of soap factories for Procter & Gamble. During high school, he was intrigued with politics, staying up late discussing the intricacies of Washington with friends.It was the 1970s, and the career guide \u201cWhat Color Is Your Parachute?\u201d had recently been published. \u201cI remember talking to him about the book,\u201d said John Farmer, a high school classmate who remains a close friend, \u201cand he said, \u2018I know what color my parachute is. It\u2019s green.\u2019 Meaning money.\u201dMr. Staley attended Bowdoin, in Maine, where he majored in economics. To make money, Staley spent two and a half summers mining trona, a mineral used to make baking soda, in Rock Springs, Wyo., where he lived in a tent by the Green River. He spent another summer working for a Pennsylvania congressman on Capitol Hill. But after graduation, he turned to Wall Street.In 1979, Mr. Staley landed at Morgan Guaranty, a forerunner to JPMorgan that was then primarily a commercial lender and bond dealer with asset-management and back-office services.He was soon transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he met his future wife, a 19-year-old college student named Debora Nitzan. After graduating from college, Ms. Nitzan worked for her family\u2019s business, an office furniture company called Aceco.In 1985, Mr. Staley\u2019s younger brother, Peter, was diagnosed as H.I.V. positive. During a painful series of conversations with his family that Thanksgiving, Peter revealed that he was both gay and ill. Jes was one of the last to be told.\u201cI sheepishly made it clear to him that I was most nervous to tell him, because I regarded him as homophobic,\u201d Peter recalled. \u201cHe looked at me quizzically and was baffled by that. He didn\u2019t realize the language he\u2019d been using over the years.\u201dBy 1989, Jes Staley was living in New York again and working to build Morgan into a full-service investment bank. He made a speedy professional ascent. In 2009 he was named to run the entire investment bank, a job reserved for executives with C.E.O. potential.Managing monster egos and ornery clients was one of his strengths. In 2004, when he engineered JPMorgan\u2019s $1.3 billion investment in the hedge fund Highbridge Capital as a way to increase returns for the bank\u2019s ultrawealthy investors, he preserved the Highbridge team\u2019s generous compensation terms and even prevented members of the bank\u2019s internal real estate division from visiting Highbridge\u2019s luxurious midtown Manhattan offices, fearing that they would alienate the Highbridge staff by insisting on cheaper space.\u201cJes understood that he had to run interference between us,\u201d said Glenn Dubin, one of Highbridge\u2019s founders. \u201cAnd he did that.\u201dOver a span of several years, the Highbridge deal helped sharply augment the client money JPMorgan Asset Management oversaw.Heavy hitters weren\u2019t the only ones to win Mr. Staley\u2019s attention. In 2002, after he joined the bank\u2019s operating committee, he halted a decision to force a woman who had been fired from the premises with her belongings in a box, insisting he would fire her manager if such humiliation occurred again. Underperforming employees would be given additional chances to prove themselves in other roles, he promised.A year or so into Mr. Staley\u2019s tenure at the investment bank, according to associates from that time, a personnel issue arose with another banker that would have ramifications for Mr. Staley years later.Tim Main, a respected banker who advised financial companies, was under duress from a divorce, according to these associates. Mr. Main was taking prescription medicine, they said, that affected his behavior when mixed with alcohol. During a management meeting with the bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, Mr. Main\u2019s speech was altered as he gave a report, said the associates from that time, and Mr. Dimon was concerned. Mr. Main soon took a sabbatical, they added, then he eventually left JPMorgan altogether.Mr. Staley, who was two notches above Mr. Main in the bank hierarchy, didn\u2019t know him well but respected the banker\u2019s professional achievements. Months later, when a smaller investment bank, Evercore Partners, called Mr. Staley for a reference, he recommended Mr. Main.Three years later, Mr. Staley left JPMorgan amid murmurs of discord with Mr. Dimon. He became a partner in the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital. The transition gave him time to pursue outside interests, including sailing the Atlantic with Mr. Meharg and working as a Bowdoin trustee.In 2014, he was chosen to lead the college\u2019s search committee for a new president. High on the list of candidates from Bowdoin\u2019s recruiting agency, said those involved with the process, was Clayton Rose, an old friend of Mr. Staley\u2019s from JPMorgan who had left banking to pursue academia. He earned a Ph.D., and then a teaching post at Harvard Business School.Mr. Staley was clearly a fan of Mr. Rose, these people said, but deferred to others through much of the screening process, fearing that a perception of positive bias might work against his old friend. Ultimately, Mr. Rose prevailed, winning the role by a unanimous vote.\u201cThe committee just rallied around Clayton because of his remarkable record of success throughout a varied career,\u201d said Mr. Staley in an announcement of the January 2015 decision.Soon after joining Barclays, Mr. Staley devised a strategy to cut what he regarded as nonessential businesses, freeze hiring to avoid laying people off, save costs by slashing the bank\u2019s quarterly dividend in half and refocus on both international investment banking and retail finance in Britain.On Wall Street, the idea of Barclays as a top-tier investment bank had become a stretch. Not only did it rank low among United States-based global advisers on big corporate mergers and stock and bond issuances, it suffered from the perception of a flawed culture, due to its role in the Libor scandal and other regulatory troubles.At a meeting with executives at the Blackstone Group, the world\u2019s biggest private equity firm, in 2016, Mr. Staley asked what Barclays could do to build up its book of banking businesses, according to people who attended. Providing a $100 million credit facility to one of Blackstone\u2019s energy funds would be a start, replied Bennett Goodman, a co-founder of its credit business.Though the economics weren\u2019t great, Mr. Staley agreed.Blackstone soon rewarded Barclays with additional work. At Apollo Global Management, another big private equity firm, the trajectory was similar. The company\u2019s relationship with Barclays has \u201cchanged dramatically since he arrived,\u201d said Leon Black, an Apollo founder and the firm\u2019s chairman and chief executive, referring to Mr. Staley, \u201cwhich speaks, one, of our relationship, and two, performance begets more business.\u201dTo further bolster the business, Mr. Staley then hired Tim Main to head the financial institutions advisory group within Barclays\u2019s investment bank.Not everyone welcomed the move. Shortly after it was announced, a letter was sent to Barclays\u2019s independent directors, according to people briefed on its details, complaining about Mr. Main\u2019s behavior during his rough spell at JPMorgan.When the letter was shared with Mr. Staley, he was troubled. In a note to employees, he said he had believed the intent of its writer was to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d their colleague.Hoping to defend Mr. Main, Mr. Staley asked fellow executives whether he could investigate the letter writer\u2019s identity, said one of these people. But since the letter was being treated internally as a \u201cwhistle blow,\u201d with protections around anonymity and against retaliation, colleagues told Mr. Staley to stand down, this person added.Yet weeks later, after the internal inquiry into the letter\u2019s allegations had been concluded and Mr. Main\u2019s hiring reaffirmed, Mr. Staley tried again, this time instructing Barclays\u2019s internal security team to track down the writer, Barclays said. The group made some effort, including asking the United States Postal Service for assistance through video footage, said a person with knowledge of its efforts. But ultimately, Barclays said, nothing came of their work.The following January, Barclays said, another whistle-blower contacted the board. This time, the complainant found fault with the entire whistle-blowing process at Barclays, mentioning Mr. Staley\u2019s handling of the Main letters.Barclays\u2019s directors hired a London law firm to investigate Mr. Staley\u2019s conduct. According to a statement on April 10, the firm found that Mr. Staley had \u201chonestly but mistakenly\u201d sought to unmask the writer without realizing the impropriety of his actions; the board accepted the explanation.But some lawyers said the entire chapter constitutes a grave breach of protocol, with broad implications for the bank.\u201cSeeking to identify the identity of the whistle-blower is a violation of the law,\u201d said Jordan Thomas, chairman of the whistle-blower practice at the New York law firm Labaton Sucharow, \u201cbut it also undermines the culture of integrity within Barclays.\u201dIf company executives have a reputation for retaliating against whistle-blowers, he added, \u201cthe leadership of Barclays will be disadvantaged because fewer people are going to be telling them about problems. And they\u2019ll learn about problems when they\u2019re at a more advanced stage.\u201dReading emails on his iPad the evening after the annual meeting, Mr. Staley responded enthusiastically to the message. \u201cThanks for sharing the foxhole with me,\u201d he wrote.The sender was in fact a disgruntled Barclays customer living near Manchester who was playing a prank. He shared his stunt on Twitter and then with The Financial Times, prompting merrymaking about Mr. Staley\u2019s gullibility.In recent months, lawyers for Mr. Staley have asserted that the letters objecting to Mr. Main were almost certainly written by someone outside Barclays, according to people with direct knowledge of their strategy \u2014 meaning not a whistle-blower in the conventional sense. Their hope, these people said, is that the argument somehow absolves him from the typical company restrictions around whistle-blowing.Yet as the writer\u2019s identity remains unknown, according to people who were briefed on the efforts to track him or her down, those arguments may fall flat. And with at least four major regulatory reviews now underway, among them probes from the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain and the United States Justice Department, some analysts and lawyers said he\u2019s on the knife\u2019s edge of professional survival.As if Barclays did not have enough distractions, Mr. Staley has become involved in another embarrassing squabble involving a major client of the bank, KKR.The dispute centers on KKR\u2019s 2014 investment in Aceco, the company founded by Mr. Staley\u2019s father-in-law decades ago that had gone from office furniture to data storage.KKR spent $700 million to acquire the company\u2019s debt and buy a majority stake in it from three sellers: Debora Staley, Mr. Staley\u2019s wife; Jorge Nitzan, her brother and the chief executive; and the private equity firm General Atlantic. But Aceco\u2019s fortunes soon turned, and in 2015, facing a cash crunch amid a broader swoon in the Brazilian economy, Aceco stopped paying off its creditors.By 2016, KKR had written its investment down to zero and was accusing Mr. Nitzan, who had been dismissed as chief executive, of foul play. Mr. Nitzan has denied the accusations, blaming Aceco\u2019s travails on the crashing Brazilian economy. KKR said whistle-blowers had claimed that there was accounting fraud at Aceco. The company has denied the allegations.Late in 2016, Alex Navab, an executive from KKR, called Mr. Staley to ask that Mr. Nitzan, Mr. Staley\u2019s wife and General Atlantic repay KKR for its investment.After that call, Mr. Staley felt he was being threatened by Mr. Navab, said someone who was briefed on its details. He asked a friend with his own private equity firm to consider investing in Aceco, which was then bankrupt, with Mr. Nitzan, its potential chief executive once again, said people who were briefed on those conversations. Then Mr. Staley vouched for Mr. Nitzan to two investors he knew who had lost money in KKR\u2019s failed Brazilian endeavor, said people who were briefed on the investors\u2019 conversations.Mr. Navab was unhappy when they heard of his actions, said someone with knowledge of his thinking at the time. KKR appeared to divert business that might have otherwise gone to Barclays. For Mr. Staley, who has been trying to bolster Barclays\u2019s private equity business, it was a real blow.On a drizzly Tuesday in July, Mr. Staley was at the Great Yorkshire Show, an annual agricultural fair not far from Leeds. With the whistle-blower investigations hanging over him, he was determined to focus on Barclays\u2019s core business. On that day, it meant visiting a sliding-door manufacturer the bank had helped finance, conducting the town-hall meeting and visiting with farmers for whom Barclays had recently doubled an existing 100 million pound investment pool.Inside the welcome tent, Simon Theakston, a local beer company scion, poured Mr. Staley a pint of bitter as a plate of hard cheese and Yorkshire pie was offered.Mr. Staley asked Mr. Theakston whether his company was publicly or privately owned.\u201cPrivately,\u201d the brewer said. \u201cMy brothers and I.\u201d\u201cNow I feel at home,\u201d said Mr. Staley, raising his pint glass. \u201cCheers.\u201dAfter half a drink and a chat with a farming union official, Mr. Staley walked down the muddy grounds of the fair, flanked by managers from Barclays\u2019s agriculture department. They stopped to talk to representatives from a rural charity and a luxury real estate company before strolling through the cattle-judging tents, where the stench of manure was powerful. In one stall, a cow appeared to be giving birth.\u201cThat might be a prolapse,\u201d said one of Mr. Staley\u2019s lieutenants, who walked on, chatting amiably with Mr. Staley about a brown bull\u2019s muscular physique.Hours later, he was on an express train back to London, sipping a drink with his communications managers and a young aide from his office. During the ride, Mr. Staley held forth on World War II, American politics and recent departures from JPMorgan. The possibility that he might have to leave his new one was not mentioned.Weeks earlier, he had interviewed Tim Throsby, president of the international unit of Barclays, at a company event in New York, said people who were there. Afterward, one of the employees in the audience asked him what he would have done if he had discovered the author of the letter that criticized Mr. Main.\u201cI should not have gotten that involved,\u201d Mr. Staley answered, according to a transcript of the remarks. \u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes. You know, I\u2019m sorry about it, but I\u2019m human.\u201dBen Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$78,000 of Debt for a Harvard Theater Degree", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Twelve years after finishing Harvard\u2019s graduate theater program, Katierose Donohue still pays almost as much in student loans each month \u2014 about $650 \u2014 as for her share of the rent in Los Angeles. She recently stopped hosting her monthly sketch comedy show, \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d because she didn\u2019t always break even on her $200 budget. She\u2019s now working side jobs as a dog walker and a social media copywriter, after past gigs serving at Starbucks and handing out free cigarettes for Camel.\u201cI can\u2019t afford to make my craft, even though I\u2019m regularly booking work,\u201d Ms. Donohue said. \u201cOne fellow alum said to me, \u2018Getting this degree basically guaranteed that I wasn\u2019t able to pursue it as a career because I immediately had to get a job to pay for the education I received.\u2019\u201dThe steep repayment burdens have been a straitjacket on students and their career aspirations for years. But now they have become a major problem for Harvard and the A.R.T. Institute, too.The troubles have cast a spotlight on little-seen difficulties and pressure that graduate acting students face, as well as a conundrum for Harvard officials. They have expressed great pride in the American Repertory Theater, Ms. Paulus and their Tony Award-winning shows like \u201cPippin,\u201d yet they have done relatively little to address the financial or academic concerns of students in that theater\u2019s graduate program.Ms. Paulus, in a recent interview at the A.R.T., said that the three-year admissions hiatus will give the institute a chance to try to address three key areas: increasing financial aid for students; renovating facilities; and exploring the possibility of a master of fine arts degree with Harvard.The alumni association\u2019s letter accused Ms. Paulus and others of neglecting those three concerns. But she described them as longtime priorities of hers.\u201cIt has always been my goal since the day I arrived nine years ago to pursue a fully funded M.F.A. with Harvard,\u201d Ms. Paulus said.Asked whether there had been pushback from Harvard over those years, Ms. Paulus said: \u201cI can\u2019t grant the M.F.A. I mean, you understand that. Harvard University has an enormous procedure for that, and we\u2019ve reiterated our interest in that from the day I got here.\u201d She added, \u201cHarvard\u2019s never granted an M.F.A., so it\u2019s a process.\u201d\u201cThey told me, \u2018We don\u2019t give degrees in butchery, so why would we give one in acting?\u2019\u201d he recalled, though he declined to name names.Notable alumni of the A.R.T. Institute include the playwright and actress Katori Hall, who said she still owes tens of thousands of dollars in loans, as well as Jon Bernthal (\u201cBaby Driver\u201d) and Steve Zahn (\u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes\u201d).A Harvard spokeswoman declined to make administrators available to answer questions about the master\u2019s degrees and the institute. Robin Kelsey, dean of arts and humanities at Harvard, issued a statement in which he expressed support for Ms. Paulus. He wrote, \u201cPausing the Institute will enable Ms. Paulus and her colleagues at the A.R.T. and elsewhere at Harvard to consider new and creative ways to support our shared pursuit of the dramatic arts.\u201dWith the exception of a small fund that distributes scholarships, institute students are not eligible for financial aid grants through Harvard. Me\u2019Lisa Sellers, who will graduate in 2018 with roughly $135,000 in debt, said that she once went to a Harvard financial aid office in desperation. She recalled that an employee there asked her, \u201cAnd this is a Harvard program?\u201dInstitute students are given Harvard IDs and can live in Harvard graduate housing. But when one current student, Shawn Jain, went to join a campus gym, workers at the front desk had to look deep into the computer system to find him. Mr. Jain and Ms. Sellers also said they were initially denied access to discounted transit passes because they were told that they had to be administered through Harvard\u2019s 13 schools, and the institute didn\u2019t count. Though they were eventually given passes, it contributed to Mr. Jain\u2019s sense of being a second-class citizen at Harvard.\u201cI feel like we\u2019re the stepchild that no one really wants,\u201d Mr. Jain said.The 13 current students and alumni interviewed for this article emphasized the high quality of their theater training, the institution\u2019s excellent faculty and the unique opportunities they have in their residency in Russia. As for their frustrations about the loan debt and the degrees, some put the blame on Ms. Paulus. Under her leadership, the A.R.T. has been involved in artistically ambitious and experimental theater as well as new, commercially popular productions like the musicals \u201cWaitress\u201d that she staged here and later on Broadway. The letter from the alumni association contended that Ms. Paulus had shown \u201clittle respect or interest\u201d in the institute.Ms. Paulus rejected claims, made by students as well as Mr. Brustein, the founder, that she was preoccupied with directing for Broadway, and pointed to the A.R.T.\u2019s many productions that do not transfer to New York.\u201cEvery show we do is about our nonprofit mission to expand the boundaries of theater and talk about how theater can galvanize compassionate citizenry in America, and that is what drives my vision,\u201d Ms. Paulus said. She also said that she spends about half her time raising money, for the A.R.T. and the institute, and emphasized that she is committed to restarting admissions in three years.Of the high student debt, she said, \u201cI feel the real question here is how artists make a living in America, and this points to the underlying issue of how the arts are valued in America, in a transactional capitalist economy.\u201dSeveral alumni said they took responsibility for the debt they found themselves in, acknowledging that they were aware of the institute\u2019s costs and paucity of aid but still chose to enroll.\u201cWe all went into it knowing how much it cost,\u201d said Natalie Battistone, who graduated from the institute in 2015. \u201cI went into this knowing that I would have this large amount of education debt to pay off.\u201dMs. Donohue described being starry-eyed when she enrolled.\u201cI was 21, and it was like, this is it, this is my dream,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember thinking: O.K., if this is what I\u2019m supposed to do, sign me up. So I\u2019m the jerk in a way.\u201dStill, Ms. Donohue wonders why Harvard and the institute haven\u2019t done more to support students and alumni. The institute long provided students who applied for aid with roughly $2,500 per year, which did little to dent the estimated tuition of $63,370 over two years, not to mention living expenses. There was an uptick in financial aid for the class of 2018 in the coming year, but the institute declined to provide specifics. Graduate acting programs elsewhere offer a range of fellowships, grants and scholarships.Ms. Donohue foresees this financial burden hanging over her head for years to come.\u201cYou immediately graduate and are handed the bill, and it\u2019s like, good luck, you better book something huge and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re never going to survive in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to have a family or a house or kids, this will be hanging around your neck, and you really might need to do something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market\u2019s Surge Meets Dollar\u2019s Swoon", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix months into the Trump presidency, two symbols of American financial might \u2014 the Dow and the dollar \u2014 have taken divergent paths, highlighting the complexities that investors face as the global economy hums, while Washington is enmeshed in political turmoil.Over this same period, the United States dollar has lost about 10 percent of its value against a basket of six major currencies.The near-mirror image fall in the dollar has been especially pronounced in recent weeks, stemming in part from concerns that President Trump\u2019s political problems will hamper his ability to pass a major tax reduction or an infrastructure bill.Yet those concerns have yet to halt the stock market\u2019s seemingly unstoppable advance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to record highs in the Dow as a validation of his administration, posting on Twitter on Tuesday morning:\u201cStock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d\u201cWhether you like the administration, the people, the rhetoric or not, there is no overstating just how powerful the animal spirits have been,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer for Deltec International Group, an investment firm based in Nassau, Bahamas. \u201cYou are seeing it in the data and it is evident in the financial markets as well.\u201dWhile there is no doubt that the animal spirits have done their work, just as important to the market\u2019s recent rally has been the significant fall in the dollar \u2014 not just against the euro and the yen, but against more volatile currencies like the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.Even the Chinese renminbi, once criticized by Mr. Trump as artificially low, has gained value against the dollar, climbing more than 3 percent for the year.A dollar in retreat means that trillions more dollars are sloshing around the global economy, ending up in 100-year Argentine bonds, Turkish airline stocks, junk bonds with stripped down investor protections and, of course, Dow stalwarts like Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\u201cDollar weakness means that there is increased liquidity all around the world,\u201d said Mr. Lele, the investment officer. \u201cAnd all that is flowing into carry trades.\u201dThe carry trade is financial jargon that describes the flow of money from low return assets to those with a higher return \u2014 not least when investors use a cheaper asset (dollars) to pay for riskier assets that promise better performance.When central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, intervened aggressively in global markets after the financial crisis, the immediate effect was rock bottom interest rates, a weak dollar and a search for \u201ccarry\u201d by global investors.Yet this trade lost some of its urgency in recent years as investors bet that the Fed would raise rates and that Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive fiscal policies would give a boost to the United States economy and the dollar.Instead, Trump administration officials have veered from the standard practice of talking up the dollar by pretty much doing the opposite. This approach was spurred largely by the administration\u2019s tough talk on trade and support for American manufacturers whose exports benefit from a less robust dollar.But it is also true that Mr. Trump, both from within his cabinet and his outside panel of economic advisers, has heard the view from Wall Street that an overly strong dollar would not help American financial markets.Edward Yardeni, an independent investment strategist, refers to the recent run-up in stocks, after what has already been one of the longest bull markets in financial history, as a \u201cmarket melt-up.\u201dThink of it as a rush of perhaps less discerning money into stocks, propelling stock market indexes past one historical milestone after another.For example, as of Monday, the Dow had reached 30 record highs this year, according to research by Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm.In a recent strategy note, Mr. Yardeni highlighted the effect of investor money pouring into exchange traded funds, which are easily traded, low-cost funds that track all varieties of indexes and investment themes.Over the last year, $232 billion has flowed into E.T.F.s that invest in domestic equities. In recent months, as the dollar has softened, global E.T.F.s that invest in Europe and emerging markets have been deluged with money and have taken in $121 billion for the year.Leading the way have been E.T.F.s that invest in higher-yielding, harder-to-trade securities like emerging market bonds, leveraged loans and bonds issued by low-rated corporations.Institutional and retail investors use the funds to make quick and longer term investment bets. But much of the flows, of late, seem to be coming from retail investors, many of whom were sitting on the sidelines in the last few years, analysts say.\u201cRight now, the market thinks the future looks good,\u201d said Peter Mallouk, the founder of Creative Planning, an independent investment adviser managing more than $26 billion out of Leawood, Kan. \u201cCorporate earnings are up, corporate taxes are expected to drop and most importantly, unemployment continues to trend lower.\u201dBeyond the stimulative effect that a struggling dollar has on global investment flows, some analysts point to another, more specific reason that might explain the near perfect correlation between the dollar\u2019s fall and the Dow\u2019s rise.The Dow, much more so than the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, has a weightier concentration in multinationals that rely on exporting their goods overseas, like Caterpillar, Boeing and Coca-Cola, to name a few.The weak dollar and strong growth in Asia, Europe and many emerging markets will be a boon for these companies, a number of which suffered in past years when the dollar was ascendant and worries about Europe and developing nations abounded.\u201cThere is no doubt that the big news \u2014 a drop in the dollar \u2014 is benefiting the Dow more than other indices,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis.\u201cIt has multinationals, and it benefits from improved trade flows. So dollar weakness may propel the Dow to 22,000 and beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Our Cynical Age, No One Fails Anymore \u2014 Everybody \u2018Pivots\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsLast month, the right-wing media personality Mike Cernovich announced that he was conducting a \u2018\u2018big pivot\u2019\u2019 away from the fringes of the news ecosystem. The move was unexpected, as Cernovich had carved out a comfortable niche for himself \u2014 railing against coastal elites and feminism, peddling conspiracy theories and self-help books. But Cernovich appeared to have decided that it was \u2018\u2018bad for business\u2019\u2019 to, for example, keep pushing rumors of pedophilia in the Democratic leadership. Instead he wanted to capitalize on the relationships he had developed with Trump-administration officials in order to present himself as a new kind of journalist.Cernovich\u2019s announcement may have seemed like typical digital-age image management, but a few days after his declaration, a somewhat generous profile appeared on the website of New York magazine. Its (admittedly tongue-in-cheek) headline: \u2018\u2018Mike Cernovich Pivots From Pizzagate to Not-So-Fake News.\u2019\u2019 In the article, Cernovich told the magazine that he was a \u2018\u2018nonfiction writer,\u2019\u2019 which may have been news to the various enemies he has casually accused of being child abusers, or to Hillary Clinton, who Cernovich claimed during the election cycle was suffering from a terminal illness. While acknowledging Cernovich\u2019s toxic history, the article still gave him credit for his ability to break news from Trump\u2019s advisers. And like that, the pivot was complete. Cernovich had changed his narrative by announcing his intention to do so.The \u2018\u2018pivot\u2019\u2019 has assumed a peculiar place in our common lexicon. A word once used to describe a guard angling for position on the basketball court is now in wide circulation in politics and business. That\u2019s especially the case in Sili\u00adcon Valley, where pivoting has become the new failure, a concept to describe a haphazard, practically madcap form of iterative development. With its sheen of management-speak, pivoting is well suited to our moment. And like any act of public relations, pivoting is also a performance. A key part of the act is acknowledging that you are doing it while trying to recast the effort as something larger, more sophisticated, highly planned. The pivot, though it arises from desperation, is nevertheless supposed to appear methodical.The word seems to have first gained currency in Silicon Valley through the efforts of Eric Ries, author of \u2018\u2018The Lean Startup.\u2019\u2019 Ries defines pivoting as \u2018\u2018a change in strategy without a change in vision.\u2019\u2019 Many successful start-ups now claim a pivot as their origin story. Slack began its life as a video-game company before realizing that its actual value might lie in a chat app the company used to communicate internally. The company is now considered to be worth at least $5 billion, putting it among the most successful pivoters of all time. (Other web staples \u2014 YouTube, Groupon, Instagram \u2014 began life in vastly different iterations before pivoting into their current forms.) There\u2019s a promise of technocratic efficiency with pivoting, that all you require is a good business plan, and perhaps another injection of venture capital, and you can transform yourself overnight.It was inevitable that the word would eventually creep outward from Silicon Valley. Recently, it has found a home in online media, where pivoting is now seriously in vogue. Following the cue of Mashable, Vocativ and other digital outlets, Cory Haik, the publisher of Mic, announced her company\u2019s pivot in August. Haik acknowledged that Mic was acting out \u2018\u2018the much-lamented and much-snarked-about .\u2009.\u2009. \u2018pivot to video.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 For the uninitiated, this entails essentially dumping your editorial staff in favor of cheaply produced, shareable videos favored by advertisers and newsfeed algorithms. This is precisely what Mic did \u2014 the company laid off 25 editors and writers \u2014 but Haik claimed that this time was different, that this move was part of a greater transformation, namely \u2018\u2018the early stages of a visual revolution in journalism.\u2019\u2019 Mic wasn\u2019t just pivoting to survive, according to its publisher; it was doing so because it saw great opportunity \u2014 and ad dollars \u2014 in another medium. Or at least, these are the promises peddled to worried shareholders and disaffected media critics.The pivot may be a tech-age phenomenon, but it has an antecedent in another rhetorical maneuver favored by Beltway types: \u2018\u2018evolving\u2019\u2019 on an issue. Once poli\u00adticians would emptily pretend to have thought about an issue and \u2018\u2018evolved\u2019\u2019 toward a new position, even as it was obvious to all observers that the move was strategic. (Barack Obama\u2019s evolution on gay marriage is the ne plus ultra here.) Now politicians are freer to be openly cynical; like the business pivot, the political pivot is a product of expediency and pragmatism, rather than of some shift in deeply held ideals. The political pivot is more obviously compromised, focus-grouped, more of a performance about changing \u2018\u2018optics\u2019\u2019 or a media narrative.Which brings us to Donald Trump, a man who many commentators believe to be constitutionally incapable of pivoting. Indeed, it does now seem very unlikely that some urgent event could foment a shift to a more mature, presidential attitude on the part of our splenetic, unpredictable commander in chief. At age 71, Trump has proved himself incapable of change, at least in the eyes of most credible observers. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t pivot; he merely pirouetted, and then he dug into the same political ground he has already claimed,\u2019\u2019 John Cassidy wrote in The New Yorker after Trump\u2019s relatively sober Feb. 28 speech to Congress \u2014 a description that could be applied to all of Trump\u2019s flirtations with polite behavior. Members of the never-Trump right also gave up on the pivot idea long ago: \u2018\u2018We are in the last days of the \u2018He can pivot!\u2019 fantasy,\u2019\u2019 Jonah Goldberg wrote last year in National Review.But the truth is that Trump is pivoting constantly. Or perhaps more accurately, the man is so erratic that he has no baseline of behavior against which to pivot. For instance, Trump seemed to change his mind last month on the war in Afghanistan, adopting a very Obama-like policy of deploying more troops into the country. While he once presented himself as against nation-building, Trump as commander in chief has proved amenable to any number of military adventures placed in front of him. That he now approves of the extension of the 16-year war in Afghanistan can be explained by his taste for violence and his deep attention to how he is treated by the media, who have mostly lauded the move. If pivoting is a media phenomenon as much as any kind of grand strategy, then Trump owes credit to a credulous press that tends to grant the mantle of maturity to any president who decides to bomb another nation.A cynical gesture for a cynical age, pivoting is designed for a public sphere where bad faith is a given and attention, of any kind, is the ultimate commodity. Trump knows how to profit from the attention economy, but he is not playing the multidimensional chess with which his enemies (and allies) occasionally credit him. Instead, he seems to be a creature of pure id, making impulsive, superficial decisions based on what he sees around himself. Trump sometimes changes his mind, but he rarely manages to act in any strategic sense. The mistake the media sometimes make is crediting Trump with strategic brilliance when he\u2019s capable of nothing of the sort. But it can seem as if Trump\u2019s behavior is so venal, so beyond pale and precedent, that it must reflect some kind of plan. Who would act this way otherwise?Trump\u2019s innovation is to have mined a deeper vein of cynicism, exhausting the weary tropes of polite political discourse. He is the ultimate pivoter, aimlessly following his own impulses as his administration is mired in daily absurdities. In Trump, the hopelessness and institutional gridlock of our system find their efflorescence; his nihilistic malleability lays bare the fact that all our poli\u00adticians\u2019 supposedly canny pivots are, at root, pivots to nowhere.Jacob Silverman is the author of \u201cTerms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Damaging Myth of the Loner Genius Nerd", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmotional IntelligenceMany scientists have said he got the biology wrong. But the job requirements of today\u2019s programmers show he was also wrong about working in tech.In fact, interpersonal skills like collaboration, communication, empathy and emotional intelligence are essential to the job. The myth that programming is done by loner men who think only rationally and communicate only with their computers harms the tech industry in ways that cut straight to the bottom line.The loner stereotype can deter talented people from the industry \u2014 not just women, but anyone who thinks that sounds like an unattractive job description. It can also result in dysfunctional teams and poorly performing products. Empathy, after all, is crucial to understanding consumers\u2019 desires, and its absence leads to product mistakes.She added, \u201cBut not everyone is the same, and that\u2019s where empathy and broader diversity really help.\u201dIt\u2019s true that programming can be a solitary activity in college computer science classes or entry-level positions. But soon after, it\u2019s impossible to avoid teamwork \u2014 with the business or legal departments, but also with other engineers.Yet that was never an accurate description of the job. It was social from the beginning, in university computer labs and, later, Silicon Valley garages, he said. The social circle just didn\u2019t include women.\u201cFor a lot of these young men, a certain computer culture becomes an expression of masculinity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who aren\u2019t doing physical labor, aren\u2019t playing professional sports. But they can express their masculinity by intense competition, playing pranks on one another, demonstrating their technical prowess, in ways that don\u2019t translate well to mixed-gender environments.\u201dEarly on, children who are less comfortable with social interaction \u2014 particularly boys, who are more likely to be socialized that way \u2014 are channeled toward science and engineering, he said. Teachers generally focus on the technical aspects and not the interpersonal ones. The result is a field filled with people who dislike social interactions and have been rewarded for it.In the tech industry, the lack of interpersonal skills has become a weakness and a liability.\u201cYou might have ideas in your head, but unless you communicate them, no one\u2019s going to understand,\u201d he said.Technical skills without empathy have resulted in products that have bombed in the market, because a vital step to building a product is the ability to imagine how someone else might think and feel. \u201cThe failure rate in software development is enormous, but it almost never means the code doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem that actually exists, or it imagines a user completely different from actual users.\u201dWith Google Glass, for example, it was a technical feat to make a tiny computer you could wear as a pair of glasses. But the product wasn\u2019t one that typical people needed, or wanted.When Apple introduced its Health app, it tracked sleep, exercise, food, medications and heart rate, but not menstrual cycle. Yet period trackers are one of the most used health tools for women. (The app now includes it.)Google Plus, the company\u2019s social network, initially required that users make public their name, photo and gender. There was a technical argument for including gender \u2014 to construct sentences like \u201cShe shared a photo with you\u201d \u2014 but it also exposed women to online harassment.\u201cThe team that made this decision was entirely male,\u201d said Mr. Zunger, who was the chief architect of social networking at Google at the time. \u201cIt was a really clear case of getting things wrong, for the simple reason that the people in the room weren\u2019t diverse enough to notice an obvious problem.\u201dEmpathy also affects which products are built in the first place \u2014 why, for example, Silicon Valley has spent more time building apps for expensive food delivery than for decreasing hunger.When engineers build products with empathy, it can seem like magic: Technology seems to predict what people want before they know they want it. That was part of Steve Jobs\u2019s genius. Just look at the number of people connected to their phones, or a child using an iPhone for the first time.One way to develop empathy at companies is by hiring diverse teams, because people bring different perspectives and life experiences. But the more widespread the stereotypes like those in the Google memo, the harder it becomes.\u201cThat nerd identity is really damaging to women,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also damaging to minorities and to a lot of men who don\u2019t want to subsume their identity in that.\u201dThat\u2019s why the consequences of the Google memo could reach far beyond the particular case, influencing which young people choose to go into technology, and which products they make that affect every aspect of our lives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seeking Greater Global Power, China Looks to Robots and Microchips", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In Chinese schools, students learn that the United States became a great nation partly by stealing technology from Britain. In the halls of government, officials speak of the need to inspire innovation by protecting inventions. In boardrooms, executives strategize about using infringement laws to fell foreign rivals.China is often portrayed as a land of fake gadgets and pirated software, where intellectual property like patents, trademarks and copyrights are routinely ignored. The reality is more complex.China takes conflicting positions on intellectual property, ignoring it in some cases while upholding it in others. Underlying those contradictions is a long-held view of intellectual property not as a rigid legal principle but as a tool to meet the country\u2019s goals.Those goals are getting more ambitious. China is now gathering know-how in industries of the future like microchips and electric cars, often by pushing foreign companies attracted by the country\u2019s vast market into sharing their technology. It is also toughening enforcement of patents and trademarks for a day when it can become a leader in those technologies \u2014 and use intellectual property protections to defend its position against rival economies.Zhang Ping, a scholar of trade law at Peking University in Beijing, said the West had long used intellectual property laws as a \u201cspear and shield\u201d against Chinese companies, hurting their profits at home and blocking access to foreign markets. Now, she said, it is time for China to fight back.\u201cIf you want to enter our market to cooperate, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Zhang said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t grab us by the neck and not let us grow.\u201dTrademarks and patents protect companies and inventors, compensating them for their time, ideas and investment. While poorer countries have throughout history worked to obtain inventions from wealthier nations, sometimes running afoul of intellectual property laws, China has rewritten the playbook for acquiring advanced technology.Since Deng Xiaoping, as leader, opened the Chinese economy to the outside world nearly four decades ago, the country has made it a priority to obtain ideas and inspiration from overseas.Joint ventures helped China build whole industries from scratch. After using them to explore high-speed rail technology, Chinese firms now dominate the global industry.Chinese experts say those moves are simply smart deal-making, not violations of intellectual property laws, allowing the country to harness its leverage as the world\u2019s second largest economy to win practical knowledge.But now China\u2019s efforts are moving beyond routine manufacturing into cutting-edge technologies \u2014 and the Trump administration has denounced the arrangements as coercive.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday that it would defend China\u2019s interests if they appeared to be threatened by the investigation.\u201cChina will absolutely not sit by and watch, will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures, and resolutely safeguard China\u2019s lawful rights,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.Still, as China comes up with its own innovations, the country\u2019s leaders are embracing stricter laws on patents, copyrights and trademarks.Li Jian, a vice president of Beijing East IP, a Chinese law firm, said mainland companies increasingly saw strong intellectual property protections as a tool to help protect inventions and earn royalties overseas.\u201cMany Chinese companies have realized that through patent protection they can gain an advantage in the market,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cThey have more faith now in the Chinese government to protect their intellectual property.\u201dEnforcement is still inconsistent, experts say. Local officials are often reluctant to aid foreign companies, worried about jeopardizing tax revenues from homegrown companies.The Made in China 2025 initiative is a key reason the country is improving intellectual property rights. The plan focuses on sectors like electric cars, robotics, semiconductors and artificial intelligence.By forcing foreign companies to hand over more technology and encouraging local companies to make new products based on that technology, Chinese leaders hope to cement the country\u2019s dominance in critical fields. They also see an opportunity to dictate the terms of the future development of technology and extract licensing fees from foreign firms that use Chinese-made technology.Several trade organizations and governments have said the plan is protectionist. Some have called for reciprocity, arguing that the United States should impose on Chinese companies the same restrictions China places on foreign companies.\u201cThere is an unmistakable national policy to boost the position of Chinese companies in cutting-edge areas,\u201d said William P. Alford, a Harvard law professor and an expert on Chinese intellectual property laws.Chinese experts have defended the strategy.\u201cTo become an adult, you have to accumulate knowledge,\u201d said Professor Zhang, of Peking University. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for a country.\u201dAs China\u2019s power has grown, Chinese companies have started using intellectual property laws to fend off foreign rivals.\u201cThe crazier the enemy,\u201d the statement said, \u201cthe more we need to prove the necessity of our siege.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Iran Out to Remake Mideast With Arab Enforcer: Hezbollah", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTehran's TurnBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 For three decades, Hezbollah maintained a singular focus as a Lebanese military group fighting Israel. It built a network of bunkers and tunnels near Lebanon\u2019s southern border, trained thousands of committed fighters to battle Israel\u2019s army and built up an arsenal of rockets capable of striking far across the Jewish state.But as the Middle East has changed, with conflicts often having nothing to do with Israel flaring up around the region, Hezbollah has changed, too.It has rapidly expanded its realm of operations. It has sent legions of fighters to Syria. It has sent trainers to Iraq. It has backed rebels in Yemen. And it has helped organize a battalion of militants from Afghanistan that can fight almost anywhere.As a result, Hezbollah is not just a power unto itself, but is one of the most important instruments in the drive for regional supremacy by its sponsor: Iran.Hezbollah is involved in nearly every fight that matters to Iran and, more significantly, has helped recruit, train and arm an array of new militant groups that are also advancing Iran\u2019s agenda.Founded with Iranian guidance in the 1980s as a resistance force against the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah became the prototype for the kind of militias Iran is now backing around the region. Hezbollah has evolved into a virtual arm of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, providing the connective tissue for the growing network of powerful militias.Months of interviews with officials, fighters, commanders and analysts from nine countries, and with members of Hezbollah itself, bring to light an organization with new power and reach that has not been widely recognized. Increasingly, Iranian leaders rely on it to pursue their goals.Iran and Hezbollah complement each other. Both are Shiite powers in a part of the world that is predominantly Sunni. For Iran, a Persian nation in a mostly Arab region, Hezbollah lends not just military prowess but also Arabic-speaking leaders and operatives who can work more easily in the Arab world. And for Hezbollah, the alliance means money for running an extensive social services network in Lebanon, with schools, hospitals and scout troops \u2014 as well as for weapons, technology and salaries for its tens of thousands of fighters.The network Hezbollah helped build has changed conflicts across the region.\u201cOn the front lines, there were lots of nationalities,\u201d said Hamza Mohammed, an Iraqi militiaman who was trained by Hezbollah and fought in Aleppo. \u201cHezbollah was there, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis \u2013 everyone was there, with Iranian participation to lead the battle.\u201dThe roots of that network go back to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, when Iran called on Hezbollah to help organize Iraqi Shiite militias that in the coming years killed hundreds of American troops and many more Iraqis.Recent wars have allowed Iran to revive and expand the web, and some of the groups Hezbollah trained in Iraq are now returning the favor by sending fighters to Syria.More than just a political alliance, Hezbollah, whose name is Arabic for Party of God, and its allies have deep ideological ties to Iran. Most endorse vilayat-e-faqih, the concept that Iran\u2019s supreme leader is both the highest political power in the country and the paramount religious authority. They also trumpet their goal of combating American and Israeli interests, while arguing that they fill gaps left by weak governments and fight Sunni jihadists like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.Many wonder what these tens of thousands of experienced fighters will do after the wars in Syria and Iraq wind down. Hezbollah leaders have said they could be deployed in future wars against Israel.But Tehran\u2019s rising influence has made both Iran and its allies a target, the focus of military and diplomatic action by Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States, all of which consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization.For Hezbollah, moreover, expansion has come with a cost. The grinding war in Syria has saddled it with heavy casualties and growing financial commitments.In an interview, Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s deputy secretary general, proudly acknowledged his organization\u2019s efforts to pass its rich militant experience to other Iranian-aligned forces.\u201cEvery group anywhere in the world that works as we work, with our ideas, is a win for the party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is natural: All who are in accordance with us in any place in the world, that is a win for us because they are part of our axis and a win for everyone in our axis.\u201dHezbollah has become active in so many places and against so many enemies that detractors have mocked it as \u201cthe Blackwater of Iran,\u201d after the infamous American mercenary firm.The consequences are clear far from Hezbollah\u2019s home turf.In an expanding graveyard in the Iraqi city of Najaf, a militia fighter, Hussein Allawi, pointed out the headstones of comrades killed abroad. Some of the graves were decorated with plastic flowers and photos of the dead.\u201cThis one is from Syria, that one is from Syria \u2014 we have a lot from Syria,\u201d Mr. Allawi said.Many had begun their careers as he did. After joining a militia, he received military training in Iraq. His most experienced trainers were from Hezbollah.In recent years, much of the world has focused on the Sunni jihadists who have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State. But less attention has been paid as Iran fired up its own operation, recruiting, training and deploying fighters from across the Shiite world.At the heart of that effort, Hezbollah has taken on increasingly senior roles in ventures once reserved for Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps \u2014 the force that helped create Hezbollah itself.In Iraq, Iran has redeployed militias originally formed to battle American troops to fight the Islamic State. It has also recruited Afghan refugees to fight for a militia called the Fatemiyoun Brigade. And it has organized a huge airlift of fighters to fight for Mr. Assad in Syria. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps provides the infrastructure, while commanders from Iran and Hezbollah focus on training and logistics.Militiamen interviewed in Iraq described how they had registered at recruitment offices for Iranian-backed militias to fight the Islamic State. Some were trained in Iraq, while others went to Iran for 15 days of drills before flying to Syria to fight. More experienced fighters took advanced courses with Iranian and Hezbollah commanders in Iran or Lebanon.Iran rallied the combatants with cash and religious appeals, effectively pitting one international jihad against another.For Ali Hussein, an Iraqi high school dropout, the battle began after the Islamic State stormed into northern Iraq in 2014 and he went to the recruitment office of an Iranian-backed militia to sign up to fight the jihadists.But first, Mr. Hussein was told, he had to fight in neighboring Syria, against rebels seeking to topple the government. He agreed and was promptly launched into an extensive, Iranian-built network of loyal militants scattered across the Middle East.He was bused to Iran with other recruits and airlifted to Syria, where he received military training and lectures about holy war. After a month on the front lines, he returned to Iraq with $1,000 and a newfound ideological fervor.\u201cI want to continue fighting jihad until victory or martyrdom,\u201d he said.Phillip Smyth, a University of Maryland researcher who studies militant groups, said more than 10,000 Iraqi fighters were in Syria during the battle for Aleppo last year, in addition to thousands from other countries.Officers from Iran coordinated the ground forces with the Syrian military and the Russian air force while Hezbollah provided Arabic-speaking field commanders, the fighters said.Iraqi militia leaders defended their role in Syria, saying they went to protect holy sites and fight terrorists at the request of the Syrian government.\u201cIf anyone asks why we went to Syria, ask them what allowed the Americans to occupy countries,\u201d said Hashim al-Musawi, a spokesman for an Iraqi militia active in Syria. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sneak in, we entered through the door.\u201dHezbollah fighters from Lebanon have surfaced on Iraq\u2019s battlefields, too.Ali Kareem Mohammed, an Iraqi militia sniper, recalled a battle with the Islamic State in central Iraq when the jihadists kept sending armored cars filled with explosives that his comrades\u2019 weapons could not stop. They called for help, and a group of Lebanese fighters brought advanced antitank missiles.\u201cEveryone knew they were Hezbollah,\u201d Mr. Mohammed said. \u201cIf anyone came with a suicide car, they would hit it.\u201dToday, his group uses the same missiles without Hezbollah\u2019s help, he said.Although the Houthis follow a different sect of Islam, Iran and Hezbollah have adopted the Houthi cause in speeches by their leaders, raising the group\u2019s profile. They have also provided some military and logistical support. Ali Alahmadi, a former Yemeni national security chief, said that Houthi fighters began receiving military training in Lebanon as early as 2010 and that two Hezbollah operatives were arrested in Yemen in 2012 and returned to Lebanon through Oman.\u201cWe sent them to Oman with a verbal message to their bosses: Stop meddling in Yemen,\u201d Mr. Alahmadi said.After the American invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, Hezbollah operatives went to Iraq to help organize militias to fight the Americans with roadside bombs and other insurgency tactics.Some of those militiamen now lead forces that have made common cause with Hezbollah again, this time in Syria.\u201cToday, we have one project in the region,\u201d said Jaafar al-Husseini, the military spokesman for another Iraqi militia that works with Hezbollah. \u201cThe threat in Syria, the threat to Hezbollah and the threat in Iraq have convinced us that we need to coordinate and work together more.\u201dWhile Hezbollah has extended its regional reach, it has made its greatest foreign investments \u2014 and paid the highest costs \u2014 in Syria, and its intervention there has reshaped the group.Its leaders have portrayed the war as a conspiracy by Israel, the United States and Saudi Arabia to use extremists to destroy Syria and weaken the pro-Iranian axis in the region. This, in their view, makes their intervention an extension of the \u201cresistance\u201d against Israel.But that argument falls flat for many in the region, who see a military force built to fight Israel turning its guns on fellow Muslims.That was the feeling for many in Madaya, a Syrian mountain town that had joined the uprising against Mr. Assad in 2011. Four years later, the government decided to squeeze the rebels out and imposed a siege. Snipers moved in, and the fighters unleashed religious battle cries, letting Madaya\u2019s residents know they were under siege by the Party of God.Hezbollah went to Syria aware that if Mr. Assad fell, it would lose its only Arab state sponsor and the weapons pipeline from Iran. So Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, consulted with officials in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and they made a commitment to back Mr. Assad, according to Iranian officials and analysts close to the group.Since then, Hezbollah has deployed as many as 8,000 fighters to Syria at any one time, analysts say. Now, with the immediate threat to Mr. Assad gone, many suspect that Hezbollah will maintain a permanent presence in Syria. It has organized Hezbollah-style militias among Syrians, evacuated border communities it considered a threat to Lebanon and established a branch of its Mahdi Scouts, a long-term investment in the cultivation of fighters.Syria has given a new generation of Hezbollah fighters extensive experience, including in offensive operations and in coordinating with the Syrian military and the Russian air force.But many have also returned in coffins, and their faces are enshrined on martyr posters throughout Lebanon.In May, hundreds of people wearing yellow Hezbollah sashes crowded into a community hall in Natabiya in southern Lebanon to pay their respects to the group\u2019s wounded fighters \u2014 18 of them at this particular ceremony, many from battles in Syria. Five were in wheelchairs, one missing a leg, another missing two. Others leaned on canes and crutches.When the Lebanese national anthem played, only six could stand up.Some analysts say the group has lost 2,000 fighters or more in Syria and that more than twice that many have been wounded \u2014 a substantial toll for a force that analysts say can draw on a maximum of 50,000 fighters.In an interview, Sheikh Qassem, Mr. Nasrallah\u2019s deputy, denied that Hezbollah had long-term ambitions in Syria. He also declined to discuss any numbers related to fighters, other than calling reports of more than 2,000 dead \u201cenlarged.\u201d\u201cIn the end, we consider the results that we reached in Syria much greater than the price, with our respect to the great sacrifices that the young men of the party put forward,\u201d he said.Hezbollah has long put great resources into supporting the families of its dead fighters. It also takes care of the wounded, although they pose a different challenge, returning to their communities as reminders of war\u2019s cost.Supporting all those families is expensive, and there are now more on Hezbollah\u2019s payroll than ever before. Running a war and other international operations also drives up costs at a time when the United States has targeted the group\u2019s finances.Hezbollah\u2019s leaders have acknowledged that most of the group\u2019s budget comes as cash from Iran. But residents of Hezbollah communities say they have felt the pinch in recent months, with less money in the economy as the party cuts spending.Hezbollah\u2019s success has multiplied its enemies. The more it grows, the more they want to destroy it.\u201cIf you wait for the Iranian project to mature and take hold, you will see that this ragtag militia has become a competent military with ideological leadership and with what I would call a social support system,\u201d said Anwar Gargash, minister of state for foreign affairs in the United Arab Emirates, which is part of the coalition fighting Iranian-aligned rebels in Yemen. \u201cThe Iranians have done it before.\u201dIsrael, too, has been worried about Iran\u2019s expansionism in Syria, through Hezbollah.One concern is that Hezbollah has been able to move missile batteries into Syria, giving it another potential platform for attacks on Israel besides Lebanon.Hezbollah forbids its fighters to speak with outsiders, but through an acquaintance I met two fighters in April who agreed to speak on the condition that I concealed their identities.One, with a pistol in his belt and flecks of white in his black beard, showed me videos of himself fighting in Syria and said he had joined the party at age 15 to fight Israel.I asked if fighting other Muslims in Syria was different from fighting Israel, and he said it was the same battle: \u201cNothing has changed for us; we are still the resistance.\u201dHe denied sectarian motivations. But he held no sympathy for Syrians who opposed Mr. Assad, and he dehumanized the rebels.\u201cI get disgusted by the way they look, their long beards and shaved mustaches,\u201d he said, referring to the grooming practices of some conservative Muslims.\u201cIf it were not for Hezbollah,\u201d he added, \u201cSyria would have fallen a long time ago.\u201dAsked about the use of siege tactics in Syrian towns like Madaya, one fighter claimed that it had been the rebels who had caused the hunger, by hoarding food.The other chalked it up to the cost of winning the war.\u201cEither you are strong or you are weak, and if you are weak you get eaten,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, Hezbollah is strong.\u201dIt is from Beirut that Hezbollah runs the wide-ranging political, social and military operations that give it power at home and increasing clout abroad. Hezbollah does not control the state as much as maintain the power it needs to block any effort to undermine its force, diplomats and Lebanese officials said.The center of its operations is the southern suburbs of Beirut, which serve as the party\u2019s headquarters and a virtual diplomatic district for its regional allies. Inside, Hezbollah bureaucrats run a private school system and social services network. Representatives of Iraqi militias and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels maintain a presence. And a range of satellite television stations run by Hezbollah and its allies blanket the region with pro-Iranian news.The party\u2019s history has helped solidify its place in Lebanon.After the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, Iranian leaders sent officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to organize Shiite militias in the Lebanese civil war. The result was Hezbollah, which also began waging a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon.Israel\u2019s withdrawal, in 2000, helped enshrine Hezbollah as the centerpiece of the resistance. Its reputation was further burnished in 2006, when it fought Israel to a standstill in a 34-day war that killed more than 1,000 Lebanese and dozens of Israelis.Some suspected that the war\u2019s destruction would be the beginning of the end for Hezbollah. But Iran flooded the country with money, underwriting an enormous reconstruction campaign and also helping the party expand its military.Few checks remain on Hezbollah\u2019s domestic power.But the group\u2019s activities abroad remain troubling to many Lebanese, while its strength poses risks for the country.Hezbollah has more than 100,000 rockets and missiles pointed at Israel, in addition to 30,000 trained fighters and a smaller number of reservists, said Brig. Gen. Ram Yavne, the commander of the Israeli Army\u2019s strategic division. Israel also says Hezbollah is so integrated into the Lebanese state that it may not differentiate between the two in a new war.For now, Hezbollah appears to be avoiding escalation with Israel in order to focus elsewhere. And the party\u2019s political clout in Lebanon has many political figures here finding ways to work with the group.Alain Aoun, a Christian member of Parliament from the president\u2019s party, said that Hezbollah kept its domestic and regional activities separate and that he considered it a valuable political partner.But he said that calls for Lebanon to contain Hezbollah were unrealistic after decades of support from Iran and Syria, and that confrontation with the United States and Israel had helped it grow.\u201cAll these countries contributed for 30 years to creating this power, so now you say, \u2018Go, Lebanese, and fix this problem,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Aoun said. \u201cIt is bigger than us.\u201dReporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Nour Youssef from Cairo, Karam Shoumali from Istanbul, Falih Hassan from Baghdad, and Ian Fisher from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Fifty Inventions\u2019 Falls Short of Its Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryTim Harford\u2019s Undercover Economist persona has been dissecting the economics of everyday life for over a decade.His efforts, initially through a column that continues at The Financial Times, provide a trans-Atlantic parallel to those of the wildly successful Freakonomics franchise established by the University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and the journalist Stephen J. Dubner.Both \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d became best-selling books in 2005 and both spawned successful sequels and multimedia spinoffs. Mr. Leavitt and Mr. Dubner have an NPR podcast and even a \u201cFreakonomics\u201d movie, and Mr. Harford\u2019s podcast and video appearances have been sponsored by the BBC.In this era of increasing global acrimony, I am happy to report that far from producing another intercontinental rivalry, the Freakonomists and Undercover Economist have developed something of a mutual admiration society. They contribute to each others\u2019 blogs and favorably review each other\u2019s books.The effective interpretation of complex economic research for a general reader is an important journalistic function. The decision-makers who apply research results in ways that have significant social impact are far more likely to be general readers than academics. Mr. Harford\u2019s achievements over this period are all the more impressive by virtue of the fact that he is both the economist and the journalist producing the translation of the technical ideas.Mr. Harford\u2019s latest book (his sixth follow-up to \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d) is a different kind of translation: a reimagining of his popular 2016 podcast from the BBC World Service, \u201cFifty Things That Made the Modern Economy,\u201d as a book.The subtle name change from podcast to book \u2014 \u201cFifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy (Riverhead: 2017)\u201d \u2014 reflects an emphasis on humility. Mr. Harford repeatedly emphasizes that he is not trying \u201cto identify the 50 most economically significant inventions.\u201dUnfortunately, Mr. Harford\u2019s clarity about what the book isn\u2019t is not matched by comparable clarity about what the book is.This is not to say that there isn\u2019t plenty to savor in \u201cFifty Inventions.\u201d After all, the podcast was popular for a reason, and much of the book is a verbatim transcription of that series. The issue is that the insistence on making the book be about something more than the individual tales often becomes a distraction instead of a benefit. Organizing the podcasts by theme is sometimes forced, the cross-referencing of the stories uneven and the promised payoff \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to draw these lessons together and ask how we should think about innovation today\u201d\u2014 never really comes.Take the first invention grouped under the first theme: the gramophone as an example of the phenomenon that \u201cnew technologies almost always create winners and losers.\u201d Mr. Harford argues that the availability of recorded music \u201cled the way toward a winner-take-all dynamic in the performing industry.\u201dHe provides an engrossing account of the English soprano Elizabeth Billington, who prompted a mad bidding war among opera houses and was the highest paid solo singer of the early 19th century. Yet those financial spoils represented, in today\u2019s dollars, less than 1 percent of what Elton John pulls in. The availability of recorded music, Mr. Harford argues, has not only enriched the handful of Elton Johns but has been costly to those who fail to achieve superstardom because \u201cwhen you can listen at home to the best performers in the world, why pay to hear a merely competent tribute act in person?\u201dCiting an influential 1981 article on superstar economics, Mr. Harford then asserts that across many industries in which technology has radically expanded the market, the result has been that \u201cthe only-slightly-less-good went from making a comfortable living to struggling to pay their bills.\u201d He particularly argues that satellite television \u201chas been to athletes what the gramophone was to musicians.\u201dThe trouble with this narrative, as any American sports fan knows, is that it is false. Even the weakest players in any of the major sports leagues should have few challenges in obtaining life\u2019s necessities. For example, during the 50 years since Marvin Miller negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement for the Major League Baseball Players Association \u2014 precisely the period over which Mr. Harford predicts that slightly-less-good athletes should have been financially devastated \u2014 the minimum salary has grown 20,000 percent. The average player currently makes over $4 million and the minimum is over half a million.Part of the challenge faced by Mr. Harford is simply one of space. The economics is right, but the complexities of the industry structures often require a more nuanced story line. Fifty compelling stand-alone yarns in under 300 pages would challenge the most accomplished economic journalist. Adding a discussion of seven overarching themes (not to mention the need to compare and contrast and deliver on the anticipated concluding lessons) and the burden of integrating these into the individual narratives is more than can be reasonably achieved.The less than five pages devoted to Google search highlight both the structural challenge and the need for nuance. In pressing the theme of winners and losers Mr. Harford emphasizes that, with the rise of Google, newspaper advertising \u201chas fallen off a cliff.\u201d This is an unsatisfying on two fronts. First, the more fundamental challenge to newspaper advertising predated Google, with the introduction of Monster, Craigslist, eBay and the slew of other online marketplace businesses that eviscerated the core newspaper classified profit engine. Second, the bigger impact of the Google advertising monolith is the extent to which it has swallowed a disproportionate slice of the growth in digital advertising generally, relegating many once promising and highly popular ad-based online businesses to the dustbin of history.More troubling is the perfunctory history of AdWords, the core monetization engine that underpins Google\u2019s financial success. Mr. Harford correctly points out that the brilliant search algorithm in itself, although wildly useful, was not financially viable on its own. Mr. Harford, however, gives no context for how the pay-per-click advertising lifeline represented by the auction-based AdWords product came to be.Some of the most interesting parts of \u201cFifty Inventions\u201d are Mr. Harford\u2019s discussion of the complex role of government generally and intellectual property rights particularly in both fostering and hindering innovation. Yet he fails to mention that Google paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit by the originator of pay-for-click technology. An interested reader might expect, at a minimum, some perspective on whether this key episode in digital history reflected an example of intellectual property overreach or the value of government protection of ideas.Early on in \u201cFifty Inventions,\u201d Mr. Harford notes he has studiously avoided producing \u201ca book-length listicle.\u201d But given Mr. Harford\u2019s prodigious skills as an economic storyteller, there are few as well positioned to produce precisely that. There are, after all, reasons that listicles are so popular \u2014 indeed those reasons would make a great \u201cUndercover Economist\u201d column.If Mr. Harford had simply embraced our love of listicles rather than set himself an inherently unachievable task, the resulting book would have yielded more pleasures and fewer frustrations.Jonathan A.

DACA made it possible for her to obtain a driver\u2019s license, pay in-state college tuition and live without fear. Ms. Lazaro has been working as a research associate at Nova Southeastern University studying chronic fatigue syndrome, and recently received security clearance to work at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Miami.\u201cWithout DACA, I would be fired immediately,\u201d she said.Most crucially, if DACA ends, those who benefit from the program would again be eligible for deportation. And they would not be hard to find \u2014 the Department of Homeland Security has DACA and tax documents showing their addresses, which may also be the addresses of their undocumented parents.\u201cIf DACA is repealed, they have my most updated tax return and know where I live,\u201d said Jung Woo Kim, a DACA beneficiary who was born in South Korea. He spoke during a rally in Washington on Aug. 15, the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the program.He traveled from Los Angeles to participate in a round-the-clock vigil near the White House that is scheduled to end when Congress is back in session Sept. 5, the deadline for Mr. Trump to respond to the attorneys general.The threat to the program has rekindled an activist spirit that was crucial to its creation. Hundreds of people turned out for the Washington rally, one of several held around the country that day, and more than two dozen people were arrested and accused of blocking sidewalks.Starting around 2010, undocumented young adults campaigned with intensifying vigor, using marches, sit-ins and other methods, as hope faded that Congress would provide them with a path to lawful status. Their leaders ultimately secured meetings with Obama aides and argued that the executive branch could grant undocumented immigrants \u201cdeferred action,\u201d a form of prosecutorial discretion that would shield them from deportation and allow them to work, although it would not confer legal residency or citizenship.\u201cDACA gave a group of undocumented people the ability to get in line, and we did, 800,000 of us,\u201d said Gaby Pacheco, 32, one of the leaders of the movement. \u201cThe economy didn\u2019t collapse. People didn\u2019t lose their jobs. Quite the contrary: We bought cars, homes, and were able to make better wages.\u201dTo qualify, applicants must have entered the United States before age 16, lived in the country continuously since June 2007 and have committed no serious crimes. The protection lasts for two years and can be renewed. The administration has approved tens of thousands of new and renewal requests for DACA deferrals since Mr. Trump took office.Polls show that DACA enjoys overwhelming support among the public. But eliminating it would please many Trump supporters who favor a hard-line stance on illegal immigration and who regard the program as nothing short of an amnesty that the president has no power to grant.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the policy; it\u2019s about the Constitution,\u201d said Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, who accused Mr. Obama of abusing his power by circumventing Congress to create law. \u201cThe fact is, there is no statute authorizing this.\u201dMr. Paxton was joined by the attorneys general of Arkansas, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Idaho Gov. C. L. Otter, in a June 29 letter to Mr. Sessions urging the White House to start phasing out DACA by Sept. 5 or face a lawsuit.In 2015, Texas and 25 other states won a federal court ruling blocking the Obama administration from extending deferred action to an estimated five million undocumented parents of children who were citizens or legal residents, as well as to young immigrants who arrived between 2007 and 2010. The ruling was upheld on appeal, and last year, the Supreme Court split 4 to 4, leaving the lower court\u2019s decision in place.If the attorneys general have the same success challenging DACA, it would be up to Congress to give the Dreamers a way to stay in the country legally. Four bills with bipartisan sponsors have been filed that would provide relief to the Dreamers. Those do not appear likely to gain traction in the near future. Nevertheless, there has been talk of a possible large-scale deal in which the Dreamers would be granted protection in exchange for something else, such as more restrictions on legal immigration or tougher measures for illegal immigrants.\u201cThese young people grew up in this country and came out of the shadows voluntarily after our government promised not to deport them,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who has introduced legislation with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, to make DACA permanent. \u201cWe\u2019ve since witnessed Dreamers graduate college, start businesses and give back to their communities in myriad ways,\u201d Mr. Durbin said.With the program\u2019s future in the balance, more than 100 law professors recently signed a letter to President Trump arguing that DACA is legal because the president has the power to decide whom to deport, given that the government does not have the resources to target all undocumented immigrants.\u201cThe legality of the program is crystal clear,\u201d said Shoba Wadhia, a law professor at Penn State who helped write the letter.Support has also come from a group of Democratic attorneys general led by Xavier Becerra of California, who may try to intervene to defend DACA, as well as from some business leaders.John Rowe, a former chief executive of the energy giant Exelon, who has mentored Ms. Rojas, the DACA recipient, at the Illinois Institute of Technology, said, \u201cThe program has been instrumental to advance talented people like Jessica.\u201dNow a co-chairman of the Illinois Business Immigration Coalition, Mr. Rowe organized a letter to Mr. Trump supporting the program that was signed by 132 chief executives from across the country. \u201cTo cancel this program is bad economics, bad politics and un-American,\u201d he said in an email.For Ms. Rojas, who was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was 5 and was the first in her family to attend college, it could spell the end of her $65,000-a-year job working for a unit of Exelon and put her entire life in America in jeopardy. \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of DACA, I was able to come this far.\u201dNathalie Nieves contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Reporter\u2019s Tale in Houston: When a Story Becomes Your Own Disaster", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELLAIRE, Tex. \u2014 I have covered as many as five wars on two continents, but nothing prepared me for when the big story collided with me and my family.As I write this, the home that I saved my entire career to buy is flooding fast and my wife, Paola, our 12-year-old daughter, Emilie, and I have moved to the second floor with some of our valuables, food, water, and of course our three-year-old cockapoo, Sweetie, who is now barking frantically out of fear. It\u2019s only a matter of time before our piano is ruined. One of our cars looks completely flooded, and the other is blocked in the garage, so it looks like we will be staying put for a while.There is nowhere to drive anyway.My daughter just got an alert on her phone telling us to take shelter for a possible tornado. We are ready to go to an interior closet if necessary.For the moment, I don\u2019t think we are in any danger, and the three of us are keeping calm, gaining strength from the sturdiness of our neighbors.We are the lucky ones. As I looked out my window this morning, I saw the local fire department arrive to take away pregnant women and others trapped in their homes. My quiet Mildred Street is now a raging river, and the emergency medical workers are using kayaks to transport people to their truck. I can hear honking car horns in the distance, which is adding an eerie staccato backdrop to the driving rain pounding our windows.I live in a compact, two-story, four-bedroom brick house in a leafy community called Bellaire that is full of medical personnel who work nearby at the Houston Medical Center and other professionals. It\u2019s an area of lovely parks where people typically have young children and dogs, and dog walking is the social glue that keeps people talking and knowing one another. It also has an active email social media platform, which is normally full of advice about where to find a good piano teacher or gardener. Today it is full of messages of struggle and support. Most people are displaying a stiff upper lip. Others seem distraught, especially those with young children. Some are urgently asking for canoes to get out of their homes or to help neighbors do so.Above all, the messages show that all of our lives are going to be different for a while. Probably a long while.\u201cWe live on Pamellia Drive & the house is now completely flooded,\u201d one neighbor wrote in a typical post Sunday morning, with no end in sight for the rain. \u201cWe have animals but we are willing to split up (3 with one person, 3 with the other) in the event that we need to evacuate or can no longer stay here. Any recommendations?\u201dAnother woman wrote, \u201cWe have an 18 month old\u2026anyone willing to let us into their 2 story home? Thank you so much.\u201dOur community is nothing but neighborly, and even people in trouble seem to be thinking of others. When another neighbor\u2019s house filled with a foot of water, her gas chimney suddenly caught fire. Fortunately her son hurried downstairs to turn off the gas knob. She took the time to write, \u201cIf you have a gas chimney and are starting to flood please turn your gas off to prevent fire!\u201dI called one close friend, Angela Watts, early in the morning, and I was amazed how brave she was as she explained that she, her daughter and dog were hunkered down on the second floor after water started pouring into her house. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019m upstairs,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking the water will just keep coming in. We have our food upstairs, and water too. We can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201dI found the conversation upsetting, but 15 minutes later we were in exactly the same situation. Now there is six inches of water in our house and at least a foot outside.I have managed to salvage my Persian rug and hope that hangings and art that I have collected over the years will be safe. Funny how you sometimes think of relatively unimportant things in an emergency, but these things are like the museum pieces of my life. One of our toilets is already backed up, but we\u2019ll have to manage since the local sewage system seems to be completely backed up. We expect to lose our power any time.After initially panicking a bit, the three of us got hold of ourselves and got to work. Paola cooked all our meat, figuring it is going to spoil anyway and we are bound to get hungry. Emilie and I filled garbage bags with our plentiful collection of classical and jazz CDs. I wrapped up a beautiful antique lamp I inherited from my father. Emilie salvaged a few bottles of wine, vermouth and gin, knowing I\u2019m probably going to get thirsty for more than water and juice. We laughed together, as we focused on survival mode. This is a character building moment for her, and so I need to keep calm and be a good, fatherly example.We just lost our electricity.And the weather forecast is for at least two more days of rain. Outside my window, the houses on the street look like sinking ships. And along with taking care of my family, it\u2019s hard not to worry about my ability to continue to cover a story with enormous consequences for the city where I live, for the national economy and perhaps for consideration of climate change.Around 12:30 p.m. the rain suddenly stopped. But our electricity and hardline telephone are out. We are not sure whether the water is safe to drink from our tap. And I hear that another wave of rain is on the way, and another, and another for the next couple of days. It\u2019s going to be a long week.Advertisement"}

And under guidelines issued this month by state regulators, that is too much of a mouthful.The rules say new companies cannot register names that are paragraphs or long sentences, or that include sensitive language, including political terms. They also give the government authority to fix \u201cinappropriate\u201d names as it sees fit.Niu Xiaolu, a.k.a. Uncle Niu, whose company makes condoms, said he would try to keep the name. \u201cIf I cannot, I will fix it according to regulations,\u201d he said.Although the new rules unleashed a tongue-in-cheek online hunt in China for other potential violators, they address a broader and particularly vexing problem for stodgy Chinese officialdom: keeping up with China\u2019s exuberant \u2014 and sometimes reckless \u2014 entrepreneurs. That means centralizing and streamlining a system that had permitted misleading, repetitive or just plain long-winded company names.In the nearly four decades since China began to loosen its controls on private enterprise and allow foreign money into the country, the government has struggled to manage the freewheeling results. As the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, behind the United States, it is in the unusual position of being an authoritarian state that sometimes has no idea what its businesses are up to.Company names are an example of the problem, writ small.Other corporate names have drawn headlines over the years because, with just one or two shifts in tone, they sound like invitations to have sex. The country is also awash in copycat names, or those trying to cash in on a popular trend.Chen Fei, head of a Beijing company called First Earn 100 Million Beijing Trading Company, which sells medical equipment, chemical products, machinery and even stationery, said he didn\u2019t see a problem. The name easily went viral, he added.In the past, \u201cregulation of company names was like a black box,\u201d said Jiang Daxing, an economic law professor at Peking University. He added that the new rules \u201cwill help improve transparency and efficiency.\u201dLocal officials had also allowed some companies to use names that piggybacked on the success of other popular brands, potentially confusing consumers, said Huang Hui, a senior partner at Wan Hui Da, a Chinese intellectual property services company. The new rules, he added, should bring clarity to the marketplace.Names that discriminate against gender, race or ethnicity are now prohibited, as are references to terrorism, separatism and extremism. Religious terms, the names of national leaders, illegal organizations and reactionaries are also banned. And companies cannot use their names to imply they are nonprofit organizations.Yang Wen, the head of What Are You Looking At Shenzhen Technology Company, said he did not think his business would run into trouble, despite having a sentence \u2014 albeit an unpunctuated one \u2014 in its name. The company makes virtual-reality hardware.\u201c\u2018What are you looking at?\u2019 is a casual northern China phrase,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cIt does not have any problem. This name is easy to remember and fits with our V.R. glasses products.\u201dA company called King of Nanning, Guangxi and His Friends Trading Company Ltd., which operates two Vietnamese restaurants, was singled out on Chinese social media as running afoul of the new guidelines.Ma Xiaojun, the company\u2019s founder, said it was hard to find a \u201cproper\u201d name, so he chose his based on a friend nicknamed King. He said he didn\u2019t see a problem with founding a business with a less serious moniker.Neither Hangzhou Looking for Trouble Internet Technology nor a related business, Hangzhou No Problem If I\u2019m Here Internet Technology Company, could be reached for comment.For Mr. Niu, the head of the condom maker, having a long company name cuts both ways. On the one hand, he said, it made payment impossible using WeChat and Alipay, the country\u2019s two major mobile payment systems. Neither system could handle the length, he said.\u201cWe are mostly doing e-commerce, which is almost 100 percent affected by this trouble,\u201d he said.On the other hand, he added, when he has asked for a receipt using his company name in restaurants, sometimes the staff recognizes it and gives him a free meal.Advertisement"}

President Moon also faced accusations from the conservative political opposition and the South Korean news media that Seoul was being ignored by Washington, its most important ally in dealing with North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.South Korea\u2019s emphasis on transparency on Friday followed a series of statements opposing an armed conflict with the North. Although most South Koreans loathe the repressive regime in the North and its nuclear pursuit, they also are afraid that the South has more to lose in a war than the impoverished North, a fear that the regime of Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader, has been using as leverage.Leaders of Mr. Moon\u2019s governing Democratic Party had more pointed jabs for Washington.\u201cHigh-ranking American officials too should refrain from using excessive language,\u201d said the party\u2019s chairwoman, Choo Mi-ae, without mentioning Mr. Trump by name. \u201cTheir impromptu and not-carefully-thought-out messages only serve to worsen the situation and play into the hands of North Korea\u2019s shrewd intentions.\u201dMs. Choo also berated North Korea, calling its plan to target Guam \u201ca delusion that would only bring about its self-destruction.\u201dShe also said that the intensifying threats between the United States and North Korea were hurting investors\u2019 confidence in the South Korean economy. On Friday, the South\u2019s benchmark Kospi index plummeted 39.76 points, or 1.69 percent, to its lowest level since May 24.\u201cThere is a growing fear that the escalating tension between North Korea and the United States, which matches power with power, could lead to a worst-case scenario,\u201d Ms. Choo said. \u201cAll sides in and around the Korean Peninsula must do what they can to turn the situation into a dialogue phase before things get irremediable.\u201dSome analysts also cautioned against overreacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric.\u201cThe United States is not going to start a war over South Korea\u2019s head here,\u201d Patrick M. Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said on Friday after meeting with White House officials. \u201cThe intention is to deter and contain North Korea.\u201dMr. Cronin said Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh words were designed to \u201csignal a resolve to demonstrate that deterrence holds and that we have the capability to neutralize Kim should he attack.\u201dBut he said that by using \u201cthe same kind of rhetoric that North Korea is long accustomed to using,\u201d Mr. Trump also ends up unintentionally helping Mr. Kim\u2019s strategy of creating the fear \u201cthat he could instigate war.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Frustrations With Britain Rise Ahead of Talks Next Week", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the clock ticking, hopes are fading that Brussels and London will make enough progress by an October summit to move discussions to the topic Britain cares about most: continued access to Europe\u2019s single market and its 500 million consumers.In a briefing for journalists, European Union officials ticked off a list of issues that they said remained unresolved before the talks are supposed to start Monday afternoon. They requested anonymity, as is routine while discussing the content of formal negotiations.The size of the bill Britain must pay for its departure was also unsettled, they added.The distance between the two sides was described as very big, and there were scant expectations of a breakthrough next week.One official dismissed British attempts to move the discussion to the future trading relationship without first settling the terms of divorce.Adding to the theatrics, the former British prime minister, Tony Blair, who is a passionate opponent of his country leaving the bloc, will visit with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission president, on Thursday when the talks are expected to finish.An overall accord is supposed to be concluded in October 2018, but unraveling 44 years of shared lawmaking and cooperation across a vast swath of sensitive policy areas, from fisheries to online privacy, is a mammoth task that looks increasingly hard to achieve.Only two months since the formal start of talks in June, progress has already flagged, and tensions have developed between London and Brussels over a two-stage approach.European Union officials first want sufficient progress on protecting the rights of European Union citizens in Britain, agreement on the cost of the departure, and to resolve the questions regarding Northern Ireland, before talks on a future trading relationship begin.Asked on Friday by the BBC radio about the bill Britain would have to pay Brussels, Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, said the country would meet its legal obligations.Mr. Johnson, who has previously been dismissive of the need for a financial settlement, declined to give a figure. But he said Britain \u201cshould pay not a penny more, not a penny less\u201d of what those obligations required.British efforts to redirect the talks toward future trade issues are one of the key irritants for Brussels.The government of Prime Minister Theresa May \u201cis balking at the two-stage approach to try to cross the Rubicon while remaining a citizen of Rome \u2014 that\u2019s to say keep trade with Europe while abandoning the European Union, which is an unfeasible position,\u201d said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, the director of European Centre for International Political Economy, a research organization in Brussels.European Union leaders are expected meet at an Oct. 19-20 summit to assess whether there has been sufficient progress to start second-stage talks on trade.But there is a growing feeling that the decision will be put off until European Union leaders gather at their year-end summit on Dec. 13-14. That would leave less than a year to reach an overall deal.European officials on Friday reserved some of their harshest criticism for British proposals on Northern Ireland, eliciting a sharp response from the British on Friday.\u201cWe have always been clear about the importance we attach to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement \u2014 and to the lives and livelihoods of the people of Northern Ireland,\u201d a spokesman for the British Department for Exiting the European Union said in a statement.\u201cThat includes a proposal that the U.K. and E.U. should agree upfront on the crucial importance of avoiding a hard border for the peace process in Northern Ireland,\u201d the statement added.Both London and Brussels want to avoid the reinstatement of border checks \u2014 the hard border that many fear would raise the specter of a return to sectarian violence.Britain has proposed using technological means to ensure that goods and people do not cross the border illegally. But that has not satisfied the Europeans, who first want more concrete commitments by London.One of the European Union officials called the idea of an invisible border magical thinking, and said that the peace process should not be used as a bargaining chip.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Scion of Mexico Fights Corruption, and Becomes a Target", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto sat before the nation\u2019s titans of industry and allowed himself a smile.Mexico\u2019s business elite had invested record amounts of money in the country, giving life to the president\u2019s promise of an economic renaissance and a welcome bright spot in an otherwise bleak landscape of scandals hovering over his administration.But the president needed more from the nation\u2019s top business leaders, perhaps his most important allies. He needed loyalty. According to five people who recounted the private gathering in May, the president turned to Claudio X. Gonz\u00e1lez Laporte, a corporate chairman revered in Mexico.Your son, the president told him, needs to stop being so critical of the government.The room fell quiet. Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son had spent nearly two decades fighting the twin plagues of corruption and impunity blighting Mexico. But his latest endeavor, an investigative news group that has exposed contract rigging by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s allies, was making too much noise for the president\u2019s liking.\u201cCivil society should not spend so much time talking about corruption,\u201d the president scolded Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez. The powerful crowd sat stunned at the attack on one of their own, until Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez broke the silence.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my son and the work he is doing,\u201d he responded.Even in Mexico, where state pressure is often delivered with a heavy hand, a president openly attempting to silence a member of one of his most trusted constituencies was seen as exceptional, according to the people who recounted the exchange. The president\u2019s office denied the rebuke, saying Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had offered a more general message to the crowd, encouraging it to focus as much on Mexico\u2019s achievements as on the government\u2019s shortcomings.But the episode was only the latest in a string of attempts to silence Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son and his work.On two occasions in 2016, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son received messages on his cellphone intended to deploy the spyware, hacking attempts that came shortly after damning reports published by his group, according to an independent forensic analysis.\u201cWe are under siege,\u201d the son, Claudio Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., said in a statement to The New York Times, declining to be interviewed. \u201cBut we will continue to denounce corruption and impunity whenever we find it, be it public or private.\u201d\u201cMexico is not condemned to be corrupt,\u201d he added.The government has denied knowledge or responsibility in all of the cases, and has begun its own inquiry to determine who authorized and ran the spying campaign.But Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. is perhaps the clearest instance in which the president has been described as openly criticizing and trying to silence a target of the spying, potentially bringing Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto closer to the hacking scandal than in any other case.And that is not the only punitive action the government has taken against the family.In a single day this year, the authorities initiated nine separate audits of organizations that Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. has been deeply involved with, and the government has signaled that it may revoke some of their nonprofit statuses, according to representatives of the organizations and others with firsthand knowledge of the audits. Some donors are already considering halting contributions, fearful of being seen as taking sides against the government.\u201cIf you combat corruption, corruption will combat you,\u201d added Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., who received a personal audit from the government on the same day that his organizations did. \u201cChange comes at a price.\u201dThe president\u2019s office rejected assertions that it had tried to intimidate the Gonz\u00e1lez family, or any critics in Mexico, \u201cin any way.\u201d It denied singling out Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez and his son at the business meeting, saying the president had simply told the crowd that highlighting the nation\u2019s advances \u201care as necessary\u201d as pointing out \u201cthe deficiencies of the government\u2019s actions.\u201d\u201cI assure you that the president made no comment to Claudio X. Gonzalez about the work of his son at Mexicans Against Corruption,\u201d said Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, the president\u2019s spokesman, who attended the meeting.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto came to office five years ago promising to fix Mexico \u2014 to modernize its economy, mend its reputation for violence and repair its broken rule of law. Transparency would shine a light on the corruption that stunted the nation, he pledged. His party, synonymous with autocratic rule during the seven decades it was previously in power, would become the change agent the country needed so desperately.Now, the efforts against Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. and his group, Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, offer a new window into how criticism is handled in Mexico, even within the most elite circles of society.But Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. has leveraged his privilege, pressuring his peers to take on social issues. He started a nonprofit, Mexicans First, to promote public education in Mexico, which is among the worst of all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research and policy organization of the world\u2019s richest countries.Nearly two years ago, he co-founded the anticorruption group, focusing on investigative journalism, research and legal action. The group hired some of Mexico\u2019s most prominent journalists, giving them license to pursue whatever targets they saw fit, an unusual freedom in a media landscape dependent on hundreds of millions of dollars in government advertising.Their stories include an investigation into land grabs by a state governor in beach towns like Tulum, the revelation that government-favored companies were leaked information to help them bid on public contracts, and an investigation detailing how a friend of the president\u2019s had collected more than $650 million from the government by gaming public contracts to provide electricity meters for the country.Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. has been unsparingly vocal himself. At a conference at Ibero-American University in Mexico City on Feb. 1, he criticized the president personally, telling a panel, \u201cIf there were such a thing as a hall of infamy, Pe\u00f1a Nieto would be in the top 10.\u201dA few weeks later, on Feb. 27, the tax authorities announced nine audits related to five organizations that were either founded or run by Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. in the last 20 years. Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity was not among them. Its audit came later.People close to Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. say that he was aghast and asked an economist to calculate the odds of even five audits randomly occurring on the same day against firms he was affiliated with. The answer he got back: 1 in 200 quadrillions, or a 0.0000000000000000000000000204 percent chance.To those involved in the groups, the audits were an obvious scare tactic, an overt way to threaten their activities. But even before that, in the summer of 2016, someone using government software had secretly tried to hack into and take over Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr.\u2019s cellphone.In July 2016 and again that August, his phone was targeted by Pegasus, a software sold to the Mexican government by NSO Group, an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer, on the condition that it be used only to monitor criminals or terrorists.When the target clicks a link in a text message, the software infects the user\u2019s phone, tracking every detail of the person\u2019s digital life, including encrypted messages. It can even use the camera and microphone to spy on the person.The hacking attempts came weeks after reports from Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr.\u2019s anticorruption group and another organization that struck at the president\u2019s allies, including the governor of Veracruz at the time, Javier Duarte, who is now under arrest and charged with overseeing a vast empire of corruption.In recent months, forensic evidence of a broad hacking campaign against government critics has emerged. The targets have included lawyers investigating the case of 43 students who disappeared en masse after clashing with the police, a journalist who revealed a questionable real estate deal by the president\u2019s wife, academics fighting corruption and the family members of critics, including a teenage son living in the United States.The government has begun its own investigation, but its approach has sent a chill through the hacking victims. Rather than simply demanding that the government agencies with the software release their target lists and the information obtained, prosecutors are demanding the phones of everyone who claimed to have been targeted.The hacking victims have balked, worried that the request is meant to further intimidate them or provide the government with all the information that the hackers were trying to steal in the first place.The Mexican government, by contrast, says it needs the phones to verify the presence of the spyware on them, calling that an \u201cindispensable\u201d part of establishing whether a crime has been committed.But there is strong evidence to suggest that such a request is unnecessary. A similar investigation conducted in Panama, where the former president has been charged with using Pegasus against more than 150 of his adversaries, never required the victims to turn over their phones, according to court documents and interviews with several of the targets there.\u201cIt is absurd that the authorities in Mexico would ask the targets to hand in their phones,\u201d said Balbina Herrera, a target of espionage and a presidential candidate who ran against Ricardo Martinelli, the former Panamanian president accused of the spying. \u201cThey are simply re-victimizing them.\u201dForensic experts also say the Mexican government does not need the victims\u2019 phones to conduct a thorough investigation.\u201cPhones aren\u2019t needed to prove illegal targeting with NSO spyware,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior investigator at Citizen Lab, who confirmed the use of Pegasus against Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Jr. \u201cIn the Panama investigation, victims were shown what the government had taken, and asked to confirm it was their information.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cin the Mexican investigation, the first thing the prosecutor asks for is the phones the government is accused of trying to snoop on.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quiet Epidemic of Suicide Claims France\u2019s Farmers", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKERL\u00c9GO, France \u2014 A dairy farmer, Jean-Pierre Le Guelvout, once kept 66 cows at a thriving estate in southern Brittany. But falling milk prices, accumulating debts, depression and worries about his health in middle age became too much to bear.Just 46, Mr. Le Guelvout shot himself in the heart in a grove behind his house one cold December day last year. \u201cIt was a place that he loved, near the fields that he loved,\u201d explained his sister Marie, who said she was \u201cvery close\u201d to him but did not see his suicide coming.The death of Ms. Le Guelvout\u2019s brother was part of a quiet epidemic of suicide among French farmers with which stoical rural families, the authorities, public health officials and researchers are trying to grapple.Farmers are particularly at risk, they all say, because of the nature of their work, which can be isolating, financially precarious and physically demanding.For farmers who do not have children to help with the work and eventually take over, the burden is that much greater. Falling prices for milk and meat have also added to debts and stress in recent years.Researchers and farming organizations agree that the problem has persisted for years, but while they have stepped up efforts to help farmers, the effectiveness of such measures and the toll from suicides remain difficult to quantify.The most recent statistics, made public in 2016 by France\u2019s public health institute, show that 985 farmers killed themselves from 2007 to 2011 \u2014 a suicide rate 22 percent higher than that of the general population.Even that number of suicides, which increased over time, may be underestimated, say researchers, who add that they fear the problem is not going away, though they are still analyzing more recent data.\u201cThe doctor establishing the death certificate can avoid mentioning suicide,\u201d said Dr. V\u00e9ronique Maeght-Lenormand, an occupational physician who runs the national suicide prevention plan for the Mutualit\u00e9 Sociale Agricole, a farmers\u2019 association.The reason? \u201cSome insurance companies won\u2019t allow compensations for spouses after a suicide,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the weight of our Judeo-Christian culture.\u201dMr. Le Guelvout\u2019s case came to light because he had previously achieved some fame as a participant in a popular television program, \u201cL\u2019Amour Est Dans le Pr\u00e9\u201d (\u201cLove Is in the Field\u201d), a sort of French version of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d that aimed to help farmers find companionship.\u201cHe was very na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Le Guelvout said. \u201cHe wanted a wife who worked outside the farm, and to become a father.\u201dBut in some ways, he was representative of the farmers who are most likely to kill themselves, according to public health statistics. They are often men ages 45 to 54, working in animal husbandry.\u201cIt is a time when you start having small health issues, when you think about the transfer of your farm,\u201d Dr. Maeght-Lenormand said. \u201cFarmers can start wondering why they\u2019re doing all of this if no one is here to inherit it.\u201dBut that is not the only force that pushes many to despair.The debts, Mr. Deffontaines said, can lead farmers to deepen their investments, both personal and financial, as they immerse themselves in their work and take more loans to pay off previous ones. In doing so, they fuel their isolation and deepen the financial hole they are in, he said.In recent years, those financial pressures have grown only more onerous. In 2015, the European Union ended quotas for dairy farmers that had been intended to avoid overproduction.The move to end quotas came on top of the bloc\u2019s imposition of sanctions on Russia in response to its land grab in Ukraine, cutting off a once-robust export market for European dairy farmers in 2014.Seven years ago, the French government began addressing the rising suicide rate among farmers, and the agriculture minister at the time, Bruno Le Maire, elevated the issue to a national cause.Since then, multiple steps have been taken in coordination with the Mutualit\u00e9 Sociale Agricole, the farm organization.Much of the focus was placed on farmers who were single or widowed, but building trust was not easy, said Dr. Maeght-Lenormand of the farmers\u2019 association.\u201cFor the farmers who pay regular social contributions to us, we\u2019re still seen as the ones claiming money from them,\u201d she said.But farmers\u2019 organizations, like Solidarit\u00e9 Paysans (Farmers\u2019 Solidarity), have also stepped in.In 2015, V\u00e9ronique Louazel, who works for the national bureau of the solidarity association, met with 27 struggling farmers for a study on the crisis the profession faces.Farmers are often reluctant to talk about their difficulties, and it is hard for them to imagine doing anything else. \u201cThey have a strong culture of labor and effort, and they\u2019re not used to complaining,\u201d Ms. Louazel said.But things are slowly changing, as more farmers speak up.Cyril Belliard, 52, is among them. One recent day, he told his story to a small support group that had gathered in his tiny house in Vend\u00e9e, a farming region in western France.Mr. Belliard had been a farmer since 1996, he told them. But recently, he watched his goats dying day after day of a mysterious illness that neither he nor his veterinarian could figure out. Debts were piling up. Legal procedures began.\u201cI was living in a mobile home to avoid paying rent,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI moved into this small space of 35 square meters, where the whole family, my wife and children, would live, eat and sleep,\u201d he added, referring to an area of about 375 square feet.The father of three children, Mr. Belliard depended on charities for food and Solidarit\u00e9 Paysans for support. Finally, in March, he decided to sell his farm to a young farmer.\u201cI held on thanks to sports, which I\u2019ve been practicing since I was 18,\u201d he said, \u201cand thanks to my kids, who were always my priority.\u201dNow, he is considering a career change. But leaving farm life is not easy and not always an option.Since Mr. Le Guelvout\u2019s suicide, his brother Andr\u00e9, 52, has taken over the farm in Brittany, and his sister Marie worries about how he will handle all of the work that was previously shared. The family recently decided to stop milk production and to sell part of its livestock.\u201cAndr\u00e9 has been a farmer his whole life,\u201d Ms. Le Guelvout said. \u201cAll that I want right now is for Andr\u00e9 to live peacefully on his farm, until he retires.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A College Admits a Big Mistake. Imagine That.", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe people who run the University of California, Irvine, found themselves with a problem this spring. More high school students than expected said yes to Irvine\u2019s offer of admission \u2014 about 800 more. The campus didn\u2019t have room for so many freshmen, and Irvine needed to do something.What followed was a fascinating case study in human behavior and the management of a large organization. The story took a new turn, for the better, on Wednesday, and it still isn\u2019t over.Then something remarkable happened.I still have some questions and concerns about the new policy, and I hope Irvine\u2019s critics keep monitoring the situation. But the change is a big improvement. And it\u2019s an all-too-rare instance of people in power being willing to change their minds \u2014 to decide that the embarrassment of changing course is better than doubling down on a mistake.The Irvine story starts with a problem that\u2019s entirely understandable: There is no foolproof way to predict how many students will say yes to a college\u2019s admission offer. The percentage of students who respond positively is known as \u201cyield,\u201d and it fluctuates year to year, based on the economy, the admissions practices of other colleges and the whims of teenagers.Irvine took some small initial steps to address the situation, like creating a pilot program that persuaded about 100 freshmen not to live on campus. But its big step was to crack down on students who it said made technical mistakes in the enrollment process and to rescind 499 acceptances.It was able to do so because the acceptance letters that all high school students receive are officially only tentative offers of admission. They are contingent on the students\u2019 graduating from high school in good standing, paying tuition and submitting various forms, among other things.In order to shrink its class size, Irvine became \u201cmore stringent\u201d about applying these criteria, officials said. For example, students who failed to submit their final high school transcript on time \u2014 as the college said was the case with Gonzalez \u2014 had their acceptance revoked.It was an extremely harsh punishment for a bureaucratic oversight. These students had already turned down other colleges to choose Irvine, and it was too late for them to change their minds.Irvine officials initially defended their decisions by saying that they were just enforcing an existing policy. The problem, of course, was that whatever the policy officially stated, the university was enforcing it differently this year. A late form submission that wouldn\u2019t have mattered for students last year or a couple of years ago \u2014 say, for the older sibling of a student who had her acceptance rescinded \u2014 suddenly turned a teenager\u2019s life upside down.The students didn\u2019t create the over-enrollment mess. Irvine did. Yet the students were paying the price for it.I could tell that Irvine\u2019s officials were never entirely comfortable with their approach. Parham used the word \u201cheartbreaking\u201d on Tuesday. In an email exchange the same day, Gillman wrote to me, \u201cWe made mistakes that are putting too many innocent students through a very difficult experience, and we will do all we can to make sure that never happens again.\u201dBut they still kept defending their approach \u2014 until they didn\u2019t.On Wednesday afternoon, Gillman announced that Irvine was reinstating the offers to almost 300 students whose acceptances had been rescinded because of a missed deadline (so long as their final high school transcripts don\u2019t show problems, such as an F). Roughly another 200 students, whose senior-year grades fell too steeply or whose transcripts contain inconsistencies, will still have to win an appeal in order to enroll.My guess is that 200 may still be an unfairly large number of rescinded acceptances and a larger number than in past years. I hope Irvine also does right by the 200 students and avoids expelling any on technicalities to ease its space crunch. Ria Carlson, an Irvine spokeswoman, told me that the university was still figuring out how it would fit in the additional students.I also don\u2019t want to ignore the anxiety that Irvine caused in the lives of several hundred families. That can\u2019t be undone. But whatever damage Irvine has done, it also provided its incoming students with a worthwhile lesson even before they arrive on campus.Even adults in positions of authority \u2014 decent, well-meaning adults \u2014 make mistakes. They\u2019re an unavoidable part of life. And it can be pretty miserable to admit you made a big one. But admitting it, and trying to fix it, is still a lot better than the alternative.Advertisement"}

We are going from \u201clater\u201d to \u201cnow.\u201d In the past you could fix any climate/environmental problem later or now. But today later is officially over. Later will be too late. At some point, the deforestation of the Amazon is not reversible.We are the middle of a change in the \u201cclimate\u201d of globalization.

And your rivals\u2019 falling becomes more dangerous than your rivals\u2019 rising: We will be hurt a lot more by China\u2019s economy tanking than its putting tanks on islands in the South China Sea.Governing today is all about how you prepare your society to get the most out of these three climate changes and cushion the worst. Sadly, that\u2019s not our society\u2019s priority right now. In the age of Trump we are treating governing as entertainment.Some conservatives argue that\u2019s fine. The less D.C. does, the better. Let the market rule. I disagree. What actually made America great was a government that prepared the right soil in education, regulation, immigration, research and infrastructure, and a dynamic private sector that grew all kinds of flowers in that soil.Which brings me to China. China takes governing seriously \u2014 in a cruel way and in an impressive way. Its leaders wake up every morning and ask themselves two questions. First, how do we stay in power? Their answer, which I find reprehensible, is: We\u2019ll use technology to repress our people. I think in the long run depriving China\u2019s people of freedom, a basic human right, will undermine their ability to realize their full potential.But it has worked better than expected, up to now, because China\u2019s leaders are just as focused on asking a second question: What world are we living in? Which leads to: What are the biggest forces shaping this world? And what kind of national strategy do we need so our people can get the most out of these forces and cushion the worst?They know we\u2019re in the midst of these three climate changes and have formulated a strategy \u2014 \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 to thrive within it. It\u2019s a plan for building the infrastructure, investments, education and regulations that will enable Chinese companies to lead in supercomputing, new materials, computer-controlled machine tools, industrial robotics, space and aviation equipment \u2014 including drones \u2014 clean cars, clean energy, biomedicine and next-gen medical devices.Only time will tell how much what China has wrong about governing will undermine what it has right.He\u2019s spending the money instead on a wall against Mexico. Is there anything more stupid?And then you watch the health care debate. And then you realize that in addition to the executive branch, one of our two parties has gone nuts. For seven years the G.O.P. made replacing Obamacare, which needs improving, its top goal, and when it finally controlled all the levers of power, it was clear that it had done no homework on a better plan or built any intraparty consensus for it. It was all a fraud.And then you look at all the knife fights between rival Trump aides and you realize that none of these fights were over how to thrive in a world challenged by these three climate changes. They were all about who could get closest to and flatter our Dear Leader most. But our Dear Leader \u2014 as we saw in the health care debate \u2014 has done no homework on the future, either. He\u2019s been too busy promising to restore the past.This is so dangerous. When the pace of change accelerates in climate, technology and globalization all at once, small errors in leadership navigation can have huge consequences. It\u2019s like a 747 pilot who enters the wrong navigational coordinates. You can find yourself so far off course that the pain of getting back will be staggering.We have such a pilot. It is time for the adult Republicans and Democrats in Congress to come together and take the helm.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}

In Britain, farms employ labor from Poland, Romania or Bulgaria when the harvest comes. Nearly half of the drivers of trucks coming in and out of Spain are from nations to the east.The principle underpinning all of that \u2014 the freedom of citizens from European Union countries to work anywhere in the 28-nation bloc \u2014 is a pillar of the union itself. In theory, it allows workers to move across the region to find employment and benefits businesses by providing a wider talent pool.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who promised to protect his compatriots from \u201cunfair competition\u201d from the east, is moving aggressively to focus attention on these posted workers as he begins a three-day tour of Central and Eastern Europe on Wednesday.\u201cDo you think I can explain to the French that businesses are closing in France to move to Poland while construction firms in France are recruiting Polish workers because they are cheaper?\u201d he said during the interview. \u201cThis system does not work right.\u201dEast European leaders accuse Mr. Macron of protectionism. They question why France and its neighbors have not cracked down on employers abusing the system.On Wednesday, Mr. Macron sought to smooth the frictions, saying he wanted to push for new rules to combat fraud and to limit to one year the length of time an employee could be posted to another European Union country. His three-day itinerary includes stops in Austria, Romania and Bulgaria, and meetings with the prime ministers of Slovakia and the Czech Republic while in Austria.\u201cI deeply believe,\u201d Mr. Macron said, \u201cthe time of the European reconstruction has come.\u201d\u201cThe posting of workers directive, as it functions, is a betrayal of the European spirit,\u201d he added, during a joint news conference with Chancellor Christian Kern in Salzburg, Austria.While posted workers make up less than 1 percent of Europe\u2019s labor force, eastern bloc leaders have vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the rights of their citizens to work across the region.The practice can easily spiral into exploitation when posted workers lack the social protections given to local hires. The host country also loses tax revenue and social security deposits to the East European countries where the workers\u2019 pay slips are based.The issue has long been politically charged in Europe, but it flared anew during the French presidential election when Mr. Macron and his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen cited the free movement of cheap labor as a source of joblessness and unfair competition.A high-profile labor abuse case in March also raised scrutiny.One of the biggest French construction companies, Bouygues Travaux Publics, was fined around 30,000 euros, or $35,000, after lengthy government investigations found it had contracted with exploitative, low-cost employment agencies to hire hundreds of Polish and Romanian workers.The workers, who were enlisted to help build a nuclear power plant run by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, known as EDF, in Flamanville, a town on the country\u2019s northwest coast, received little to no health care coverage from 2009 to 2011, when the facility was being constructed. The employment agencies were also charged with bilking the French state of social security contributions totaling nearly \u20ac12 million.Some member-states are taking matters into their own hands.Austria recently tightened measures to deter domestic companies from contracting low-cost European laborers. This month, the government fined an Austrian engineering group, Andritz, \u20ac22 million for using a Croatia-based contractor to hire around 200 Croatian workers for a \u20ac7 million construction project, citing a violation of national fair labor laws.Many of the truckers are employed by Spanish companies that set up a head office in Poland or another eastern country. The companies then pay the lower taxes and social security charges of the cheaper country, avoiding the higher Spanish fees.It is the type of practice that Mr. Macron wants to limit.\u201cA Europe that protects,\u201d the French president said, \u201cis a Europe which is able to solve the issue of posted workers.\u201dBeno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Others, like the University of Texas, accept a set percentage of the top students at every state high school. Neither method has fully succeeded in composing student bodies that match the racial makeup of their states.Other colleges with more freedom to curate a student body continue to weigh race as one factor in admissions, which can lead to more diversity.

He is among a group of students pushing Princeton, where 9 percent of students are black, to admit more from low-income backgrounds.For Mike Coiro, who will enter Columbia University in the fall, the role race might or might not play in college admissions had inserted itself into conversation after conversation as he and others at his New Jersey boarding school filled out their applications.\u201cIt\u2019s not something I actively worried about, but it was definitely in the back of my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered whether being a straight white male would have any effect on Columbia.\u201dBut Mr. Coiro said he supported affirmative action, despite being, in his words, \u201ckind of right-leaning.\u201d That is partly because his best friend, a Hispanic student who will be the first person in his family to attend college, will also be a freshman at Columbia in the fall.\u201cWe\u2019re both here,\u201d Mr. Coiro said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel disadvantaged at all.\u201dBut though these methods may have somewhat increased the number of low-income students of all backgrounds, racial diversity remains elusive.Socioeconomic considerations \u201cmay be desirable in and of themselves,\u201d said Mark Yudof, a former president of the University of California and former chancellor of the University of Texas. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they can get the job done.\u201dStudents in the top 9 percent of their high school class are guaranteed admission to at least one U.C. campus.Starting in 2011, most of the system adopted what university officials call a \u201cholistic\u201d review, under which admissions officers considered the entirety of the applicant\u2019s circumstances, \u201creading the application beginning to end before making a judgment,\u201d said Han Mi Yoon-Wu, the undergraduate admissions director for the system. \u201cNothing is particularly weighted more than anything else.\u201dRace is not one of the criteria, but to opponents of race-conscious admissions, such methods sound suspiciously like a euphemism for affirmative action. Admissions officers are using details about a student\u2019s background as a \u201cproxy\u201d for race, said Ward Connerly, an African-American businessman who is a longtime and outspoken critic of affirmative action.Nevertheless, a gap persists.The number of black and Latino students enrolling at Los Angeles and Berkeley, the flagship campuses, have declined even more steeply. Blacks made up about 3 percent of all undergraduates at Berkeley last year, with Asians at 39 percent and whites at 26 percent.\u201cThere is still a lot of work to be done,\u201d Ms. Yoon-Wu said.In 1999 Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, pre-empting an attempt by Mr. Connerly to pass a version of Proposition 209 in his state, banned racial preferences in admissions but attempted to compensate by guaranteeing admission to a state college to students who graduated in the top 20 percent of their high school classes.State statistics also show that the number of black students attending Florida\u2019s state schools has declined slightly since the rule went into effect. At the state\u2019s flagship university, the University of Florida, 6 percent of undergraduates who enrolled in fall 2015 were black, down from 12 percent in 2000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 17 percent of Florida\u2019s population is black.A University of Florida spokeswoman said a number of factors had contributed to the change, including the economy, the lack of need-based financial aid and a higher number of applications, which made the school more selective. Changes in the way students report their race may mean that many black students are being counted in other categories, such as Hispanic, she added.\u201cThe University of Florida strives for a diverse campus community,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Margot Winick. \u201cWe have worked diligently to remove barriers through recruiting programs.\u201dFor example, she said, the university arranges campus visits and conducts outreach at urban, rural and low-income high schools.At the University of Florida in Gainesville, the \u201cdwindling\u201d number of black students is noticeable, said Dwayne Fletcher, the head of the Black Student Union.\u201cIt\u2019s a palpable feeling when it comes to wanting to find someone you can identify with, and having to look few and far between,\u201d said Mr. Fletcher, 21, an agriculture education and communication major who will be a senior this fall.\u201cI was told that it was not for the AIM program, I would not be at the University of Florida,\u201d said Mr. Fletcher, whose parents immigrated from Jamaica. \u201cI\u2019m not saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to select all these people of color at random to fill a quota to make sure we\u2019re exemplifying diversity.\u2019 However, equity is something that needs to be considered.\u201dFor many opponents of affirmative action, the ideal admissions system strips out all factors but achievement.\u201cAll that matters, in the type of society that I envision, is that you are at the top and you are there because you have achieved in accordance with the rules that we\u2019ve laid out,\u201d said Mr. Connerly. \u201cNot on the basis of your skin color, not on the basis of where your daddy was born.\u201dThe California Institute of Technology, an elite destination for science, engineering and math study just outside Los Angeles, hews strikingly close to Mr. Connerly\u2019s vision.\u201cWe are as close to a meritocracy as is possible,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the university, Kathy A. Svitil.Underrepresented minorities, including African-Americans, Hispanics, American Indians and Alaska natives, make up 16 percent of the undergraduate population.There was a tiny number of African-American students in last year\u2019s freshman class, 4 out of 235. The largest ethnic group was Asians, with 77 students, followed by whites, with 70.Fadl Saadi, a former graduate student at the university, says there has been tension in the past over whether to admit more underrepresented minorities.The response on campus was less than warm, he said.\u201cI received a lot of pushback from people who felt that this kind of \u2018perfectly meritocratic system\u2019 was the ideal,\u201d Mr. Saadi said. \u201cThere was this preconceived idea that outreach into ethnicities and underrepresented minorities and genders would be somehow linked to a decrease in quality.\u201dBut on a campus that has historically had a wide gender imbalance, skewed toward men, the college seems to be striving for gender parity, if not racial diversity: About three times as many men as women applied last year, but women were three times as likely to get in as men.Among the most diverse and prestigious colleges in the country is Columbia University. Among domestic undergraduates, the proportion of Hispanics and African-Americans has increased significantly over the past two decades, to 28 percent in the class of 2021, according to Columbia.Black and Latino applicants are often trying to surmount not only poverty, but also inferior public schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of a great institution to try to help to address those injustices,\u201d he added. \u201c Secondly, it just makes complete sense to prepare your students for a world that is profoundly diverse.\u201dTristan Douville, who is a Native American from Alaska, was participating last week in a summer program for incoming freshmen who would be the first in their families to attend college. He said participants have had frank conversations about the stigma they may face when they join the rest of the student body.But, he said, the program\u2019s directors reinforce that \u201cwe got in because we deserved to be at Columbia just as much as other people did.\u201dMr. Bollinger said the popular understanding of affirmative action \u2014 that admissions officers save some spots for minorities, regardless of their qualifications \u2014 did not match reality. Instead, he said, the university selects a pool of qualified people whom they believe can thrive on campus, looking at an array of factors including grades, test scores, essays, recommendations, legacy status, athletic ability, musical talent and geographic diversity.He denied that Columbia discriminated against white or Asian applicants.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know without going through the entire admissions process why it is you were not accepted,\u201d he said.Still, there is little transparency about how much of a role race plays in the admissions offices of highly selective colleges. When part of the process does become public, as it did after the Department of Education investigated a complaint by Asian-American applicants against Princeton, it can show admissions officers highlighting race in frank terms.Other officers wrote that Asian-American applicants had \u201cvery familiar profiles\u201d or were \u201cdifficult to pluck out.\u201dMembers of other minorities, on the other hand, appeared to catch the officers\u2019 interest if they played up their backgrounds: A native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander received the comment, \u201cWere there a touch more cultural flavor I\u2019d be more enthusiastic.\u201dBut the Education Department, which opened the investigation in 2008, ultimately found that while the officers\u2019 comments were sometimes associated with stereotypes, Princeton had not discriminated based on race or selected applicants based only on their race.Asked for comment, Daniel Day, a Princeton spokesman, reiterated the investigation\u2019s findings, adding that they were \u201cas true today as they were then.\u201dDaniel Alvarez, the boarding-school friend of Mr. Coiro who is joining him at Columbia, did not dispute Mr. Coiro\u2019s belief that he had benefited from the school\u2019s affirmative action policies.But while his classmates had speculated about some black and Latino students who had been admitted to elite schools, Mr. Alvarez said he had not been one of those targets. He was well-known in his high school for being academically successful and accomplished, he said.\u201cPeople can think what they will, but in the end, I\u2019m never going to really be able to know\u201d whether race helped him, he said. \u201cI feel like the true measure of whether or not it was really part of it will depend on how I do there. If I get there, and I\u2019m struggling, and this isn\u2019t the sort of school that I belong at, then maybe I\u2019ll reconsider.\u201dReporting was contributed by Elizabeth A.

{"Headline": "The Power Plants That May Save a Park, and Aid a Country", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIRUNGA NATIONAL PARK, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 On the verdant savanna of Virunga National Park, a herd of elephants clustered near an umbrella-shaped acacia tree to seek shelter from the blazing morning sun. From a Cessna far above, the giant animals looked like brown-gray miniatures.Emmanuel de Merode, the director of Virunga National Park, piloted the plane. He wore a Virunga park ranger uniform and had his green beret tucked into the shoulder of his khaki shirt. Mr. de Merode flew over the dazzling 50-mile-long Lake Edward, then descended to a grassy airfield flanked by palm trees.On this day, the flight was his commute. \u201cIt\u2019s the best job in the world,\u201d he said.Mr. de Merode was visiting a small hydroelectric power plant \u2014 built more than four years ago with an investment from the European Union \u2014 that has lofty goals. It powers a soap factory, providing jobs and a market for local palm oil. It supplies electricity to homes, reducing the need to illegally chop down Virunga\u2019s trees to make charcoal. Ideally, it will spark entrepreneurship among carpenters, tailors and others whose businesses struggle to exist without electricity.In short, the tiny power plant is crucial to an ambitious attempt not only to protect Virunga \u2014 Africa\u2019s oldest national park \u2014 from threats including armed rebels, deforestation and oil prospectors, but to jump-start the local economy and potentially help stabilize one of the world\u2019s worst conflict zones.Mr. de Merode, who is a Belgian national (and a Belgian prince), became the director of Virunga in 2008, the first non-Congolese to hold such a position. He was born in Africa and has spent most of his life here.Work conditions are treacherous. In 2014, he was ambushed near Virunga and shot in the stomach and legs. The attackers were never found, and their motive was unclear, although many groups oppose Mr. de Merode\u2019s conservation efforts, which disrupt the status quo.The assassination attempt didn\u2019t deter him. \u201cPeople who wear a uniform get injured all the time,\u201d Mr. de Merode said. \u201cThis is part of my job. I would regret it terribly if I gave up.\u201dBut the region is under intense pressure from a growing human population, and Virunga could provide land, food and fuel that those people desperately need. That puts its mission to preserve habitat for gorillas and other creatures, however noble, on a collision course with practicality.However, deforestation is one of Virunga\u2019s biggest threats. For cooking fuel, 97 percent of people living near the park rely on charcoal made by chopping down the park\u2019s trees and slowly roasting them into carbonized chunks.The practice is illegal. Yet Congo\u2019s charcoal industry is worth an estimated $35 million and helps fund deadly insurgents who hide in Virunga\u2019s forests, according to the Enough Project, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on Africa. In theory, hydropower could reduce reliance on charcoal cooking fuel, although this is easier said than done.Virunga plays an important role in offsetting carbon emissions. The park and plantations in the province are second only to the Amazon in terms of total forest area, according to the W.W.F.After the country gained independence from colonial Belgian rule in 1960, corruption, political instability and bloody conflict wracked the country, which is one of the poorest in the world. It was ranked 176 out of 187 countries on the United Nations\u2019 Human Development Index in 2015.Roads, electricity and running water are scant. Without this basic infrastructure, economic growth is severely stunted. Electricity is necessary to run grain and lumber mills, to process palm oil or fruit juice, to operate cement plants and brick factories \u2014 to build pretty much anything modern.In the past, hydroelectric power plants funded by Catholic charities or other nonprofits weren\u2019t properly maintained. And there were some scams in which businesspeople collected money from villagers, then ran off with the funds.But eastern Congo has enormous agricultural potential. The country has one of the world\u2019s largest areas of arable land. It \u201chas the potential to become the breadbasket of the entire African continent,\u201d according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.However, farmers have a hard time eking out a living because they lack modern agricultural resources such as quality seeds and fertilizer, not to mention roads, cold storage and other infrastructure to get goods to market. And agribusinesses cannot run without electricity.The country is so ill-equipped to deal with its farming potential that most of its agricultural goods are processed outside the country. All its cooking oil, for instance, is imported. And palm oil from Congolese farmers is exported to neighboring Uganda, turned into soap, and then imported back to Congo at higher prices.Tourism is another way Congo could create jobs and boost its economy. Mountain gorillas reside in only three countries: Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 and tourists pay good money to see them. To see Virunga\u2019s gorillas, park permits and transportation alone cost about $600.But violence has limited the potential here. During a burst of war in Congo between 2004 and 2009, insurgents invaded and occupied Virunga.Tensions eased, and tourism surged in 2010 and 2011, when Virunga\u2019s new luxury lodge opened. That year, Virunga hosted 5,000 tourists and earned more than $1 million. But then, in November 2012, the rebel group M23 took over Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, where the lucrative gorilla and volcano tourism is based. For more than a year, Virunga was closed to visitors.The park reopened in January 2014 amid fragile stability. An alphabet soup of a dozen rebel groups and militias still plague Virunga, which they use as a hide-out along the country\u2019s porous, unpatrolled borders with Rwanda and Uganda.Most international governments have issued travel warnings for eastern Congo. Tourists must travel to, from and within the park with armed rangers.The five-hour trek is exhausting, but with his earnings, Mr. Boscon bought some goats. A $50 tip from one generous tourist allowed him to buy a small piece of rocky land.Other than farming and tourism, \u201cthere\u2019s no hope of other jobs,\u201d Mr. Boscon said. He wanted an education, but there was no school in his area when he was growing up during Congo\u2019s civil wars.Isaac Sadiki, 24, was the only volcano porter with a university degree. He admitted some might find his work humiliating because he\u2019s a college graduate. But, he explained, \u201cIt helps me earn some money. I cannot be part of militia.\u201d Like most rural people here, he has been a victim of violence. Mr. Sadiki was 8 years old when rebels attacked his family at their home near the Ugandan border and brutally beat his mother.Mr. de Merode argues that jobs would prevent idle, poor young men from joining militias. Economic development is \u201cthe only way of overcoming conflict,\u201d he said.However, that is an idealistic vision that doesn\u2019t always work.And of course, there are the day-to-day challenges of running power plants in an unstable, poor and corrupt country. The two existing plants offer lessons in trial and error.Mr. de Merode was flying to Mutwanga, a small town outside Virunga\u2019s northern border. There, a modest concrete building houses one German-made turbine spun by the coursing waters of the Butau River.Outside, where the distant white glaciers of the Rwenzori Mountains loomed in ghostly silhouette, Mr. de Merode strode along a narrow channel that diverts water into the powerhouse. This $2 million pilot plant is a run-of-the-river design, which means it does not use dams and minimizes the impact on the environment.A couple miles away, at the other end of town, is Sicovir, a soap factory that opened in April 2016. It is the first and only factory in the area \u2014 and the only source of formal employment here.Leonard Maliona is Sicovir\u2019s managing director, and his family has invested in the factory. A young Congolese man in his early 30s, Mr. Maliona walked across the floor of the gleaming facility and pointed out boilers and pressing machines that squeeze oil from palm kernels. The waxy smell of soap permeated the air. Sicovir has the potential to produce tons of soap in one day. A hundred people work here.For all its promise, though, Sicovir is hampered by a lack of electricity. The water levels of the Butau River have been lower than projected, in part because of unexpectedly lower rainfall. So the power plant generates less than one-quarter of its promised 380-kilowatt capacity. It\u2019s enough to give electricity to more than 500 households in town (more than 2,500 people), the local hospital, streetlights and 40 small businesses, such as hair salons and phone-charging kiosks. The power it generates is a boon to an area where the hospital once used flashlights.But it is not enough to run Sicovir\u2019s heavy machinery \u2014 boilers, steamers, presses. As a result, the factory relies on diesel generators.Selling Sicovir\u2019s soap is also a challenge. Bad roads make it difficult to collect palm oil from local farmers. Businesspeople are targets for extortion and robbery. Running the factory is \u201cvery stressful,\u201d Mr. Maliona said.He believes that more and stronger businesses could harness political power to get things done. \u201cIf more businesses are created, we can create a lobby group,\u201d Mr. Maliona said. \u201cIf you have 20 companies paying taxes, we can say, \u2018We want the road done.\u2019\u201dMr. Maliona sobered as he described that unproven theory. But when asked why he started the factory, he brightened: \u201cThe joy of producing. When you see the first soap come out, you think, \u2018Now we can do it.\u2019\u201dHundreds of miles away in a town called Matebe, outside Virunga\u2019s southeast corner, sits the park\u2019s second run-of-the-river plant, which began operating in December 2015. It can generate more than 13 megawatts of electricity from the much larger Rutshuru River. The hilly landscape means a taller vertical drop and more energy when the river water is funneled through three turbines.One morning, Matebe\u2019s power plant bustled with activity. Hammers pounded and saws shrieked. The plant employs more than 600 people.Engineers built the plant with about $20 million from Howard Buffett. Mr. Buffett, who has long been interested in wildlife conservation, approached Virunga out of the blue. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know who he was,\u201d Mr. de Merode said.Mr. Buffett first came to the region in the mid-1990s to see mountain gorillas in Uganda. Wildlife brought him here, \u201cbut the everyday challenges the people faced \u2014 and the conflict \u2014 captured my attention,\u201d he wrote in an email. Also, he added, \u201cI like to work in the places that everyone else thinks are too risky.\u201dJobs are precious in this area, where there are few schools. \u201cEvery day people are queued up outside for work,\u201d said Sandrine Eeman, the engineer in charge of networks for Virunga Energy, the park\u2019s private utility division. Human resources were a challenge, but engineers and technicians were hired from different parts of Congo, and locals were trained and hired for jobs requiring less expertise.Jackson Bakinahe Ndemeye, 25, started as a casual-wage construction worker in 2014 and worked his way up. Today he helps maintain the valves that control water flow from the river.Ndemeye has a 12th-grade education, far higher than most people in the area. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many job opportunities,\u201d he said. Since he started working at the power plant, he has learned to handle machinery and pour concrete. And with his steady income, Mr. Ndemeye helps send his younger siblings to school. He added, \u201cNow I can buy pants if I want.\u201dAlthough this power plant was built under budget and ahead of schedule in less than two years, it has its share of challenges. Transmission and distribution lines are still being built, so only 2.5 megawatts of Matebe\u2019s 13-megawatt capacity are being used. Its electricity primarily powers the plant\u2019s offices and facilities, Virunga\u2019s tourist lodge and grounds, as well as rural streetlights and homes in some nearby villages.That\u2019s due partly to funding. Virunga needed money to build 20 miles of power lines to the city of Goma. A year ago, CDC, the private sector arm of Britain\u2019s Department for International Development, pledged $2.5 million for that next phase.Transmission and distribution, and getting customers to pay, are some of the biggest challenges for energy companies in developing countries. So far, some 3,000 households have paid to connect to Matebe\u2019s power plant, which will deliver electric service for more than 15,000 people. At least thirteen villages have streetlights, and more were scheduled for connection this spring. Virunga aims to eventually connect 4,000 households to hydroelectricity.It costs a relatively hefty $292 to connect to the electrical supply and then $5 to $10 each month for 3 to 10 amps of electricity \u2014 enough to power a few light bulbs and charge mobile phones. It\u2019s pricey for a rural family, but in the long run, the electricity is cheaper than conventional fuel.\u201cPeople are poor, but energy is not as expensive as you imagine,\u201d said Ephrem Balole, the chief executive of Virunga Energy. For cooking, the average low-income rural household each month uses two sacks of charcoal, which cost $15 each. Families spend at least $5 each month for kerosene used for lighting.Michael Karonkario, 39, lives in a small house in the village of Ruchiro, where he is a caretaker of the area\u2019s mobile-phone antenna. He was one of the first in the village to connect to the new electrical service. His six children can now study at night, he said.There are some concerns that people are too accustomed to cooking with charcoal and will be reluctant to switch to electricity. So Virunga plans to give free electric hot plates to people who connect to the supply. Mr. Karonkario, for one, didn\u2019t want to wait, so he got his own hot plate. It \u201cheats up faster than charcoal and doesn\u2019t make the kitchen as hot,\u201d he said.Giving rural people access to electricity is part of Virunga\u2019s mission, but only a small part of its business plan. The medium and large businesses are crucial to making Matebe\u2019s hydropower financially sustainable.\u201cBuilding the plant is the easy part,\u201d said Ms. Eeman, the Belgian engineer who helped oversee Matebe\u2019s construction. \u201cEntrepreneurship is the bigger challenge.\u201dVirunga Energy has received about 100 applications from local businesses who want electricity to run corn, cassava and sugar mills, juice and confectionary factories, garages and welding services, beauty salons, bakeries, carpentry workshops, brick works and more, said Mr. Balole of Virunga Energy.Some applications are from existing small businesses that want to expand, while others are just starting. Entrepreneurship is a fledgling concept in this conflict zone, which is accustomed to receiving aid money, but Mr. Balole isn\u2019t worried about that. \u201cBusinessmen are skilled,\u201d he said. Some nuns have already started a sugar cane plant, he pointed out.Harnessing mass demand in the city of Goma is a bigger task. Its people now use just 5 megawatts of electricity \u2014 not enough for this city of one million. Power outages are common.Goma needs 40 to 50 megawatts, Mr. Balole reckoned. But the city\u2019s electricity is controlled by the government utility company, and Virunga Energy could not get a distribution agreement for the city.To get around that hurdle, Virunga Energy organized a consortium of large businesses in Goma to prepurchase $2 million of electricity. They include cement, coffee and mattress factories, cold-storage facilities, hotels and others. These businesses want a steadier, more reliable supply than the shaky government one, whose irregular currents destroy machinery and equipment, Mr. Balole said.That money is helping to build power lines to Goma along an inhospitable dirt road, which is rutted with volcanic rock. Virunga Energy received another boost for that project with CDC\u2019s investment last year. The 10-year loan is the province\u2019s only development investment since the mid-1980s.If the rollout goes well, CDC will loan another $6.5 million for construction of two new run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants just outside the park that would generate 35 megawatts. For these plants, Howard Buffett is funding approximately $39 million and the Belgian government $4 million.Mr. Buffett increased his funding after other donors fell through. When that happened \u201cit basically underscored the point that it was going to be either us or no one,\u201d said Mr. Buffett. \u201cI believe that is the role of philanthropy \u2014 if philanthropists can\u2019t be the risk takers, who can?\u201dVirunga\u2019s unusual management team was also a positive factor. \u201cA company that\u2019s running a national park founded an electricity company \u2014 it\u2019s incredible. Hats off to them,\u201d said Martin Illner, an investment director at CDC.There is a delicate balance between pulling in big customers who make the hydroelectric power plants financially sustainable and connecting rural households whose demand for electricity and ability to pay is often overestimated. \u201cWe want the households to benefit, but power companies typically make a loss connecting them,\u201d said Richard Charlton, an investment manager at CDC. \u201cHow you get that mix is really important.\u201dThen there are the daily challenges of running a business in Congo: dealing with government officials who demand bribes, getting bureaucratic land concessions and licenses, working with everyone from local chiefs and villagers to investors and donors.\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how heavy it can be,\u201d said Mr. Balole about the stresses of his job. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how government structures can kill initiatives with a lot of taxes, unclear procedures and harassment. Someone who\u2019s not strong can flee away. This is not an enabling environment.\u201dAs Mr. de Merode piloted the Cessna south to return to the park\u2019s headquarters, he recounted some of the lessons he learned as a park director who unwittingly spearheaded energy and business development. \u201cIf you spread yourself thin, you do it quite badly,\u201d he said. Before the current business plan, Virunga also built health centers and schools. It now leaves that work to the European Union, nonprofits and other groups.Yet despite challenges like these, Mr. de Merode remains understated. \u201cWe learned from trial and error,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. We\u2019re just building a utility company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street, Climbing Sharply, Skips Washington\u2019s \u2018Soap Opera\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the disorder in Washington \u2014 with a revolving door at the White House and roadblocks on Capitol Hill \u2014 Wall Street and corporate America are booming.\u201cNone of the soap opera in Washington matters,\u201d said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. \u201cNobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia.\u201dWhat does matter, Mr. Sullivan said, is stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining and oil and gas, a weaker dollar that helps exporters, and a lighter regulatory touch by the new administration.The initial stock market rally that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November \u2014 the so-called Trump bump \u2014 was fueled by optimism among investors that long-sought action on tax reform and infrastructure spending might finally be at hand.Few analysts are so sanguine now, especially after Republicans could not agree last month on how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after years of promising to do so. If anything, simplifying the tax code or investing in new roads and bridges seems farther out of reach than ever.But a market surge based on political hopes has been replaced by one more firmly grounded in the financial realm.Besides steady economic growth or less regulation, investors also have been encouraged by the loose reins of central banks like the Federal Reserve, which have helped keep interest rates not far above their historic lows. Inflation, too, remains tame, with price increases in recent months actually falling short of the Fed\u2019s targets.At the same time, with yields on safe assets like government bonds so minuscule, there are few appealing alternatives to stocks for investors, according to Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.\u201cNo matter how you look at valuations, they are high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as money flows into pension funds every month and needs to be invested, why would I put it in bonds?\u201cCorporations in America and Europe are still inventing new products and finding ways of doing things more efficiently,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThis is separate from the political theater around the world.\u201dMoreover, corporate earnings \u2014 the fundamental driver of individual stock performance \u2014 have been robust.\u201cThe first six months of the year have been the best period for earnings growth since 2011,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.Still, many Wall Street investors who are bullish over the longer-term, including Mr. Orlando, concede that the risk of a stock market correction was rising.\u201cWe\u2019ve had this fabulous run since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut could we see an air pocket in the next few months? Absolutely. Our best guess is that the next 5 percent move is more likely to be down than up.\u201dBut for now, whichever way the stock market goes, most economic metrics like hiring, consumer sentiment and home prices continue to point in the right direction.\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of it in Cleveland, and small businesses are looking forward instead of over their shoulder,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, who is the older brother of Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican.\u201cWhen Washington practices the Hippocratic oath toward business \u2014 first, do no harm \u2014 it\u2019s amazing what the American economy can do,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the prior administration, you had a very, very aggressive regulatory environment in which businesses felt under attack.\u201dEasing regulation is also something Mr. Trump can do with the stroke of a pen or with appointments to agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve, which require confirmation but not legislation.To be sure, the glow from Wall Street extends only so far. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, less than 15 percent of American households owned individual stocks and only half had any exposure to the broader market, including through mutual funds or retirement plans.\u201cOnly people with assets like stocks and houses are benefiting, and that\u2019s why this recovery has been weak,\u201d Mr. Slok said.The contradictory signals between the markets and the political world are hardly unique to the United States. \u201cMost investors in Europe are rolling their eyes at the U.S., but what\u2019s ironic is that it\u2019s similar to the European situation,\u201d Mr. Slok said.As in Washington, Mr. Slok said, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Brussels and other capitals over major issues, including Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union, the economic drag from the continent\u2019s restrictive labor laws and Greece\u2019s fiscal problems.If the stock market\u2019s prospects are unclear, then the outlook in Washington six months into the Trump administration is downright gloomy.The year began with Mr. Trump promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act; pass the most significant overhaul to the tax code since 1986; and get Congress to pass legislation to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. None of that has been accomplished, as Republicans have struggled to shift from being an opposition party to one that governs.Beyond those disappointments, fiscal land mines lie ahead that could rattle the economy if Republicans and Democrats cannot cooperate.By the end of September, Congress must reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling and fund the government for the coming fiscal year. Republicans remain divided over whether conditions such as spending cuts should be attached to raising the statutory borrowing limit. A standoff with Democrats over Mr. Trump\u2019s request to finance a border wall could lead to a partial government shutdown.The lack of progress has only led to more sniping among Republicans. This week Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cI think what\u2019s hurting the legislative agenda is Congress\u2019s inability to get things passed.\u201dMr. Trump has pointed to the growing economy and strong employment figures as evidence that his agenda is thriving. The data is indeed encouraging, but not very different from the figures he used as a candidate to paint a picture of economic despair.Still, the stock market\u2019s gains were likely to hold up as long as earnings remained buoyant, said Laszlo Birinyi, a longtime stock market analyst.\u201cWhile people may have strong feelings in other areas, the stock market is predicated on dollars and cents,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Harvey Strikes a Powerful Blow to Texas, and Lingers", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROCKPORT, Tex. \u2014 Hurricane Harvey bombarded a stretch of the Gulf Coast in Texas on Saturday with home-ripping winds and epic rains. As emergency officials scrambled to assess the extent of the damage, hundreds of thousands of people were without power after utility poles were knocked to the ground as if they were twigs.The storm made landfall here in the coastal city of Rockport, ripping away roofs, leveling palm trees and road signs, and turning ranch land into lakes. Mayor Charles J. Wax said Saturday that conditions were too dangerous to send out emergency officials but that an initial review, as the storm\u2019s eye passed overnight, had found \u201cwidespread damage.\u201d\u201cWe took a Category 4 storm right on the nose,\u201d the mayor said.Those who rode out the storm were in awe of Harvey\u2019s power. Standing by his ripped-up home in Sienna Plantation, a community southwest of Houston, Jamie Ellis, 48, said he had been watching a movie about 1 a.m. Saturday when a tornado swept through that sounded \u201clike a freight train was coming.\u201d The lights went out, the upstairs French doors flew open, and objects began careening around inside his house. He, his wife, Stacie, and his son, Zach, took refuge in a bedroom closet.Harvey was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since 2005, and it was expected to hover over Texas until at least midweek. A fierce Category 4 hurricane when it struck land on Friday night, it eased by Saturday into a tropical storm. Still, meteorologists warned that as much as three feet of rain could fall across a vast area from Corpus Christi to Houston, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city.\u201cStorm surge is the most dangerous element of hurricanes,\u201d Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told CNN. \u201cIt has the highest potential to kill the most amount of people.\u201dBy midnight, the authorities had reported two deaths that appeared to be related to the storm, one in Rockport and the other in Houston. But forecasters warned that Harvey\u2019s onslaught was just beginning. In an advisory on Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was already producing \u201ctorrential rains,\u201d and it warned that \u201ccatastrophic flooding\u201d was likely in the days ahead.At a news conference in Austin, Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday afternoon that officials remained active in search and rescue efforts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any information right now that we can confirm\u201d about deaths, he said.The storm remained a hurricane well after it made landfall about 10 p.m. Friday, and the deluge of rain made it difficult for the authorities to conduct even preliminary damage assessments. More than 250,000 Texans were without electricity on Saturday, a figure that was likely to increase.The authorities ordered evacuations over a wide area of the state.A few miles outside Rockport, a recreational vehicle lay on its side in the middle of a two-lane highway with its roof ripped off and an orange X spray-painted on its bumper, an apparent signal by emergency workers that the vehicle had been checked for people inside and cleared. A small herd of longhorn cattle waded through a flooded field, searching for dry ground.\u201cIt was very frightening,\u201d said Gene Coxsey, 84, standing in the shadow of a severely damaged hotel. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why it didn\u2019t cross my mind a couple of times that I should have got the hell out of Dodge.\u201dIn Houston, the lights began to blink and, in some places, go out. The city\u2019s bayous were rising, and its roads, mostly quiet since Friday night, remained eerily empty. Although Houston, a city of about 2.3 million, is among the nation\u2019s most flood-prone major cities, the local authorities did not order an evacuation.Juan Cruz, 52, bought a tarpaulin from a Walmart north of downtown to help cover his leaky roof. He lived through Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and remembered how it had killed his neighbors, flooded roads and torn up bridges.\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be that bad,\u201d he said of Harvey. \u201cIt depends on God.\u201dNearby, a homeless man, Roy Joe Cox, 63, pulled a rolling suitcase. \u201cA hurricane is coming, and I have nowhere to go,\u201d he said.Tears formed in his sky blue eyes. He normally lives under a nearby bridge, he said, and was hoping to get a blanket to protect him from the incoming storm. \u201cI\u2019m not a thief,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was going to steal it, because I don\u2019t have any money.\u201dPresident Trump, facing the first significant natural disaster of his administration, issued a federal disaster declaration on Friday. The order, requested by Mr. Abbott, covers six Texas counties and opens the spigot for federal aid.The storm forced hundreds of flight cancellations, partly because Southwest Airlines and United Airlines have major presences in Houston, according to FlightAware, which monitors air traffic. Two cruise ships that were scheduled to return to Galveston, Tex., on Saturday were diverted to New Orleans.The storm took an unusual path toward meteorological infamy. The system first became Tropical Storm Harvey on Aug. 17, when it was about 250 miles east of Barbados. Two days later, it disintegrated into a tropical wave. But on Wednesday, the system gained new and startling power, and forecasters issued the first hurricane watches for the Texas coast.By Friday night, fed by stable air and the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s warm waters, it had grown into a Category 4 storm with sustained wind speeds of 130 m.p.h. In years past, major hurricanes caused immediate spikes in oil and gasoline prices, but as hard as Hurricane Harvey has hit the region\u2019s refineries, the impact at the pump has so far been muted.However, it may take days before the full impact of the storm is known. Roughly a million barrels a day of refining capacity has been shut down on the Gulf Coast, and nearly a quarter of gulf offshore production has been shut. The Corpus Christi shipping terminals responsible for importing and exporting oil and refined products are also closed. And if the ship channel between Port Aransas and Aransas Pass is badly damaged, it could take weeks for products to leave South Texas refineries, even if the plants are not harmed.Gasoline shortages are already appearing around Houston, where drivers have been waiting in long lines to fill up. Dozens of gasoline stations have run out of fuel in the metropolitan area, and prices at the pump have risen about 3 cents a gallon around the city this week.Few if any places in the world have as much energy infrastructure in harm\u2019s way as the Gulf of Mexico coast. Houston, Corpus Christi, Texas City and other cities have vast refineries and natural gas terminals, which make and store dangerous chemicals. The gulf itself is crisscrossed by oil and natural gas pipelines that connect production platforms to pipelines onshore. The potential for environmental catastrophe, or at least a crippling blow to the national economy, is always there when a hurricane strikes.The region\u2019s energy complex has dodged many bullets over the years, but damage assessments after a hurricane hits can take weeks.The last time a hurricane hit Texas was 2008, when Hurricane Ike barreled into Galveston, only miles from Texas City and the Houston Ship Channel and their high concentration of refineries and chemical plants. There was no disaster, but the ports of Freeport, Texas City and Lake Charles, La., remained closed for days, and extensive flooding crippled some refineries and left them without power for more than a week.Manny Fernandez reported from Rockport; Alan Blinder from Houston and Victoria, Tex.; and Simon Romero from Albuquerque.

In a move that follows in the footsteps of a clutch of European cities, New York is to appoint a director of night life, or a DON \u2014 an ambassador tasked with giving after-dark activities a more congenial reputation.\u201cNight mayors,\u201d as they are commonly known, are popular in Europe, where these figures are chiefly concerned with how people can have a good time after dark in their cities. London, Paris and Zurich all have them \u2014 and now the initiative is making its way to New York, where night life is in great need of attention.\u201cNow more than ever, as we are seeing more and more music venues, bars and restaurants shutting their doors; more notably in its D.I.Y. scene, the city needs to stop the bleeding of its cultural hubs, or risk becoming corporatized and homogenized,\u201d said Rafael Espinal, a New York City Council member who first proposed the bill.\u201cThe role of the director of night life will be to create a plan for cities and establishments so that they may coexist and to actively develop the cultural and monetary growth night life contributes to New York City,\u201d Mr. Espinal said.\u201cThe night is always treated differently to the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there is a problem at night, the first reaction of city officials or police commissioners is to stop it. Instead what you would do in the day is bring all the stakeholders together and try to at least make the situation a bit better.\u201dMr. Milan\u2019s flagship project has been the introduction of ten 24-hour venues on the western outskirts of the city. The idea was to alleviate the pressure on the city\u2019s heaving center and create a purpose-built nighttime district. The area contains several multidisciplinary venues, including art galleries and co-working spaces, as well as bars and clubs.Granting these establishments 24-hour licenses means the venues can set their own operating hours, offering more flexibility for locals and tourists as well as reducing loitering on the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s something you see happening everywhere in the world \u2014 all venues close at the same time,\u201d Mr. Milan said. \u201cSo people spill out onto the street at the same time, which of course causes a lot of problems and nuisance for people living in these areas.\u201dHowever, like Amsterdam\u2019s night mayor, Ms. Lam\u00e9 emphasized that her role goes beyond pubs and clubs. \u201cI realized from the beginning this is much bigger than just night life, this job is about life at night, which encompasses every aspect of life in London,\u201d Ms. Lam\u00e9 said.She said that she spends much of her time working with London\u2019s deputy mayors for policing and crime, transport, culture, planning and housing. \u201cIf you take a slice of everything they do and flip it into the dark, that is my brief,\u201d she said.Michele Acuto, a professor of urban theory at University College London, said that night mayors are more than a ceremonial role. \u201cThe concept of a nighttime economy is longer lived than the recent trend of night mayors,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the real value lies. It\u2019s a sign by a city like New York or London that it is thinking strategically about the night.\u201dAcuto said that New York is now following in the footsteps of London and Amsterdam by creating a formal mechanism for operating as a 24-hour city. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole infrastructure for the city that goes for 24 hours,\u201d he said, pointing to fact that while London\u2019s nighttime entertainment industry is estimated to employ just under 50,000 people, its health and social care industry provides over 100,000 jobs at night, as does the transport sector.The hope with these initiatives is that they start with a night mayor focused on culture and then mature to tackle bigger issues like workers rights, transport, waste management and planning \u2014 all the necessary infrastructural elements that make working or living in a city after dark accessible.\u201cNew York is the city that never sleeps, but not all of those people are going to parties,\u201d Mr. Acuto said. \u201cYou can assume that the majority of them are going to a health care job.\u201dAn article on Thursday about New York City\u2019s new director of night life erroneously included one European city on a list of those with similar positions, commonly known as \u201cnight mayors.\u201d Berlin does not have a night mayor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump on Taxes", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1991, when Donald Trump was merely a real estate developer, he gave Congress some advice about tax reform. It\u2019s worth hearing again.But not everyone remembers 1986 with such fondness. President Trump, who has often compared himself to President Reagan, was a fierce critic of the tax legislation. The concerns that he expressed could prove instructive as the Mr. Trump looks to sell his own ambitious tax plan this year. Never one to be shy, Mr. Trump told lawmakers that the 1986 tax act was essentially wrecking the economy. The central problem, he explained, was changes that were harming the real estate industry, which he described as a keystone to the labor market. A higher capital-gains tax rate and limits on deductions for \u201cpassive losses\u201d that were ushered in by the overhaul put downward pressure on property prices.\u201cThis tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for the country, for the real estate industry, and I really hope that something can be done,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who as president has faced questions about whether he favor laws that help developers.Some in the Trump administration have hinted that tax cuts for most Americans should be paid for by tax increases on the wealthiest. Mr. Trump recently doused this idea, calling for deep rate cuts for everyone.That was not Mr. Trump\u2019s view 26 years ago. The Reagan tax cuts brought the top individual tax rate down from 50 percent to 28 percent, putting it at parity with a higher capital gains tax rate. According to Mr. Trump, this stunted the incentive for people to invest. At the hearing, he argued that the top rate should be raised to make investment a more attractive option. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re no different right now than the Soviet Union,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey have no incentive, and we have no incentive. And if something isn\u2019t done to quickly put the incentive back, this country is going to be in very deep problems.\u201dMr. Trump has made a habit of questioning the wisdom of experts, instead trusting his own instincts and business acumen.Asked at the hearing about how his proposed changes to the tax code could still be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d Mr. Trump suggested that the accountants were looking at things the wrong way. Reinstating his prized deductions, he argued, would stimulate enough economic activity to easily make up for a revenue shortfall. \u201cNow an accountant will tell you, \u2018We\u2019re going to lose $5 billion,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut in actuality it could spur hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of work.\u201d If such optimism sounds familiar, it is because Mr. Trump and his economic advisers have said that they will be counting on a surge in economic growth to help pay for the deep tax rate cuts they are planning.Mr. Trump is known to exaggerate to help close a deal or make a sale. As a presidential candidate, he painted the relatively strong economy as \u201ccarnage\u201d to make the case that the policies of Democrats had failed.Mr. Trump showed the same tendency in 1991 when he argued that Mr. Reagan\u2019s tax act needed major fixes. \u201cThe fact is that the one word that nobody up on the panel has mentioned is the word depression, and I truly feel that this country right now is in a depression,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a recession. People are kidding themselves if they think it\u2019s a recession.\u201d \u201cThey heard the word tax shelter and they thought the word tax shelter was a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He argued that the incentives to invest in real estate were actually a boon for the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exploring the Sources and Consolations of Poetry, in Prose", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAll this to say, I am not sure I understand the stated premises of either Bialosky\u2019s book or Matthew Zapruder\u2019s \u201cWhy Poetry\u201d: that the reaction I describe above \u2014 an erotic push-pull with language that poets revel in and non-poets might find uncomfortable \u2014 can and should be overcome. Bialosky is the editor/gatekeeper of the hallowed Norton poetry list. She is also a well-known poet and memoirist in her own right. The book\u2019s title and structure are everything. \u201cPoetry Will Save Your Life: A Memoir.\u201d Each section \u2014 a random sampling includes \u201cDanger,\u201d \u201cMemory,\u201d \u201cDeath,\u201d \u201cFirst Love\u201d and the above-mentioned \u201cMortality\u201d \u2014 pairs a basic reading of a poem or two or three with a short narrative about the situation and significance of the poems in Bialosky\u2019s life. (\u201cMortality,\u201d the Hopkins-Wordsworth section, curiously, relates to Bialosky\u2019s late-life care of her mother; the epic shifts in understanding that occur as one moves from daughter to mother, child to adult to childlike again; and the slow discovery of the humanity of our parents and elders, rather than dealing with the problem of literary ambition or coming to voice that I see as central to the conversation between the two poems. But that proves one of her main points: \u201cA poem doesn\u2019t just have one life or one influence on a single life.\u201d We are different, Jill Bialosky and I, and we read through our self-goggles.)The poems she chooses are mostly well known. I did not catalog them, but I wondered whether they were not all cross-referenceable in a Norton anthology. That isn\u2019t a dig. These poems were lovingly chosen \u2014 treasures \u2014 and I soften toward the book\u2019s conceit when I consider that. We are comrades in our sense that poetry is a kind of gift, there for anyone to take. Still, the notion that generates such an anthology-memoir, the idea that poems must be filtered through a scrim of ordinary language and life in order for us to commune with them, in order that they be \u201cunderstood\u201d in some definite way, is wrongheaded and, indeed, condescending. Bialosky gets it, but you don\u2019t?How does the life work to make words mean differently? What is the relationship between meaning and experience? These questions are posed by the book and dropped when they get hot.Matthew Zapruder wants us to get that poets deal in the archival set of common understandings about cognitive and sensory disorder in human language (an art of producing dis-understanding in order to know things better). If this is true \u2014 and I think it is true \u2014 I have the same question for him that I have for Jill Bialosky: Who is the audience for this book?He writes, convincingly, rather beautifully: \u201cPoetry is a constructed conversation on the frontier of dreaming. It is a mechanism by which the essential state of reverie can be made available to our conscious minds. \u2026 Poems make possible a conscious entry into the preconscious mind, a lucid dreaming.\u201d Elsewhere he describes the effect of poetry on the mind as \u201cdreamlike,\u201d \u201cassociative,\u201d a \u201cdrifting feeling.\u201d What he calls, fittingly, the poetry \u201cmachine,\u201d the poem itself, constitutes these effects and also enacts them in a kind of zoned-out feedback loop. (In my experience, in the act of writing a poem, it\u2019s not clear where the formal and structural intentions or ideas I bring for the poem end and \u201cdrift\u201d begins, or vice versa. Rather than \u201cdrift,\u201d I think of the mind-state of composition, only partially achievable as an end-user of the poem, as being inside the mind-state of the particular poem, which is a state of willed or controlled subconscious dwelling. Perhaps this state is the opposite of dreaming and is, instead, an experience of what Emerson called practical power.)Zapruder\u2019s book makes me think of all this, and because of that I think it is a roaring success. Is it necessary? Is it designed primarily to be purchased and read by students being introduced to the reasons for and methods of reading poetry? I don\u2019t know. Zapruder is an editor at Wave Books \u2014 publisher of, among other excellent things, \u201cWhat Is Poetry (Just Kidding, I Know You Know): Interviews From the Poetry Project Newsletter (1983-2009),\u201d edited by Anselm Berrigan, which can be seen as a book of common prayer of late 20th- and 21st-century innovative poetry, a new classic for the ones who already know the songs. I understand Zapruder\u2019s interest in preaching to the unconverted. I suspect he is a terrific teacher. His readings of poems are subtle and convincing. I found myself thinking, \u201cGosh, I never saw that obvious thing in quite that way before,\u201d many times during my reading, which is precisely what should happen when reading about literature: We are humbled by its operations on our own minds and the need for others to read with us.While the formulation and reformulation of \u201cPoetry is\u201d-type sentences is the problematic problem that I refuse at the center of both these books, I loved many of Zapruder\u2019s phrases. They struck me as fresh and true: \u201cThe poem makes poetry happen in the mind of the reader or listener. It happens first to the poet, and in the course of writing, the poet eventually makes something, a little machine, one that for the reader produces discoveries, connections, glimmers of expression.\u201d Lovely.Take all of this with a grain of salt. I am not a professional reviewer of books. I am a poet and a teacher of literature. There is no separation at all between my life \u2014 as a human, a woman, a black woman, a mother, a working person deeply involved and interested in the political economies of intellectual life \u2014 and my work. I work to live. As a result, I\u2019m in the take-it-or-leave-it school of poetry making and reading. Poetry isn\u2019t magical or removed from dirty, compromising political and personal acts, pettiness, racism, sexism, suffering. Absent the intervention of many other sociopolitical acts, poetry won\u2019t save your life. To suggest otherwise is a kind of offense against poetry\u2019s insistence on complexity, the multidimensionality of understanding. Taking it seriously as a carrier of information about the real matrix between language and power, which is truly upsetting \u2014 mind-blowing \u2014 when we come near to it, changes the way you live. Believe it.A review on Aug. 6 about \u201cPoetry Will Save Your Life,\u201d by Jill Bialosky, referred incorrectly to the author\u2019s responsibilities at W.W. Norton & Company. She oversees the trade poetry list there, but she is not involved with the Norton anthologies.Simone White\u2019s most recent volume of poetry is \u201cOf Being Dispersed.\u201d Her new collection of criticism and poems, \u201cDear Angel of Death,\u201d will be published in September.Advertisement"}

But there is a sense among central bankers that they are doing what they can, and that growth remains slow because of structural problems that require other kinds of policy interventions.\u201cSome of you flew 10, 15 hours to get here, and you\u2019ve been sitting here and you haven\u2019t heard anything about monetary policy,\u201d joked Jason Furman, who was head of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. Then he dived into an unrelated talk about the benefits of government spending.The world\u2019s major economies are all growing for the first time since the crisis, but the expansion is tepid and fragile.The most immediate threat is posed by the looming deadline for Congress to raise the federal \u201cdebt ceiling,\u201d allowing the government to borrow money to pay its bills. Federal debt is widely viewed as the world\u2019s safest investment, and even a temporary break in payments could cause a financial crisis.Mr. Powell, a Republican who helped persuade his party to raise the debt ceiling in 2011 and 2013, warned in a pair of interviews on the financial networks CNBC and Fox Business that a default would deliver \u201ca major shock to the economy.\u201d That is \u201cnot something we need right now,\u201d he added dryly. Mr. Powell also emphasized that the Fed could not shield the economy from the consequences.Much of the formal discussion was devoted to the global turn toward protectionism. The trend is highlighted by Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union, and by Mr. Trump\u2019s scattershot threats to impose restrictions on imports to the United States. It can also be seen in a decline of trade as a share of global economic activity in the decade since the crisis.\u201cPeople are concerned whether openness is fair, whether it\u2019s safe and whether it\u2019s equitable,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Economists have long preached that trade among nations is all of those things, and many at the conference view the backlash as a public relations problem.Trade, in this view, has become a scapegoat for issues including the decline of manufacturing in developed economies and the rise of income inequality. The evidence suggests technological change has played the predominant role in reducing manufacturing employment; globalization is a bit player by comparison.Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton University, observed that people generally accept job losses that they attribute to technological change but are angered by job losses that they attribute to trade policies. The economic effects are basically identical; the political consequences are remarkably different.Referring to the founding father of the economic analysis of trade, Mr. Blinder said, \u201cWe economists think that David Ricardo got it mostly right 200 years ago, and a lot of people think he got it badly wrong, and we haven\u2019t convinced them in 200 years.\u201dBut there is an emerging mountain of evidence that economists also have significantly and systematically understated the disruptions caused by increased trade for workers, particularly in manufacturing, their families and their communities.The idea that developed nations should focus on reaping the benefits of trade, and then worry about offsetting the costs, has produced large benefits, particularly for the wealthy \u2014 and large uncompensated costs, particularly for the workers.Peter Schott, an economist at Yale, said researchers needed to understand why workers had struggled to find new jobs. While the shock of increased trade with China was a one-time event, Mr. Schott said such research could shape public policies that would help workers displaced by other shocks, like improved technology.Ms. Yellen devoted her keynote address at the conference to a careful defense of the changes made after the financial crisis that aimed to improve the resilience of the American financial system. The Trump administration is pushing to loosen those ties, and Ms. Yellen warned that anything more than modest changes could be bad for the economy.\u201cEnhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, thereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad,\u201d she said.Mr. Draghi touched on the same theme at the end of his speech.\u201cThere is never a good time for having lax regulation,\u201d he said.Even the protesters gathered outside the conference changed their tone. The liberal group Fed Up was founded four years ago for the purpose of urging the Fed to pursue faster economic growth. This year, however, members of the group donned \u201cYellen wigs\u201d and held a rally in support of a second term for Ms. Yellen.Ms. Yellen\u2019s four-year term as Fed chairwoman ends in early February, and Mr. Trump has said he is considering whether to replace her.The protesters said they were not satisfied with the economic recovery. The share of American adults without jobs remains higher than before the crisis, and the numbers are significantly worse among minorities. Wage growth remains weak.But they are worried that Ms. Yellen\u2019s departure would make things worse. A new Fed chairman might be inclined to raise interest rates more quickly. They see a longer-term risk, too, that less regulation would lead to another economic crisis.\u201cYellen\u2019s work is not done,\u201d said Apryl Evelyn Lewis, 34, from Charlotte, N.C. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the Fed\u2019s recent decisions to raise rates. But Yellen\u2019s record over the years shows that, over all, she cares about people like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Syria Refuge, Extremists Exert Greater Control", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 After surviving a siege by Syrian forces, Firas al-Rahim and his family were removed from a rebel-held area of Homs province in central Syria and taken to an impoverished territory in the northwest.But since Mr. Rahim, his wife and their four children arrived in Idlib Province in May, they have struggled to find food and shelter, and the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda has come to dominate the area, raising fears that bombs targeting the jihadists could fall on them.\u201cWe, the civilians, are stuck between an organization with an extreme ideology and an international community willing to fight it at all costs,\u201d Mr. Rahim, a teacher, said by phone from Idlib Province.After six years of war, Syria has been shattered into jagged chunks divided by hostile front lines maintained with the help of foreign powers and their spheres of influence: Turkey, Iran, Russia and the United States have all put forces on the ground to help their allies.In that scramble for control by President Bashar al-Assad, by rebels and their international backers, and by radical jihadists, Idlib has become an end-of-the-line dumping ground for fleeing civilians and the largest bastion of the heavily armed local branch of Al Qaeda.Western powers like the United States that would like to fight the extremists in Idlib are leery of endangering civilians and have invested heavily in local groups that oppose the jihadists.The Syrian government and its allies, however, say Idlib is little more than a terrorist haven, where jihadists have imposed their control \u2014 a view some American officials share.Aid workers and residents say the situation there is more complicated, with a patchwork of groups struggling to provide necessary services to the civilians from all over Syria who have been bused to Idlib to live out the war. Though the extremist groups are militarily strong and the civilians have protested their presence, the militants have not systematically interfered with aid \u2014 at least not yet.The province\u2019s population has swelled to two million, with nearly half those people displaced from elsewhere, the United Nations said.That many needy people in one place has led to a large aid operation, with scores of groups sending food and other supplies across the border from Turkey, and establishing medical facilities and other projects in Idlib.The future of those projects was thrown into doubt last month when clashes between the area\u2019s armed groups left the Levant Liberation Committee as the dominant force. Though the group changed its name last year and said it had broken its ties with Al Qaeda, American officials dismissed the claim as propaganda.They still consider the group to be a dangerous terrorist organization, as does Turkey, which has restricted the passage of commercial goods across its border, fearing that they would benefit the jihadists.The border crossing where most of the province\u2019s aid and commercial goods pass has long been a moneymaker for whoever controls it, and it appears that the jihadists are in a position to do so now.Aid groups say they have not been forced to pay, presumably because the jihadists know that such demands would halt aid that people need. The jihadists have said they will create a civilian body to govern the province, but it remains unclear when that could occur or what such a body would look like.The recent infighting between armed groups in Idlib has threatened the province\u2019s economy, which residents said had been improving. Though no official cease-fire covers the area, it has been spared from Syrian and Russian airstrikes in recent months.Some residents see Idlib as the last stand of the anti-Assad uprising and the start of a new Syrian society. Thousands of people in one town, Saraqib, participated in local elections last month, and the president of Idlib University was voted out of office recently \u2014 something the faculty noted had never happened to Syria\u2019s president.\u201cIt is like a phobia,\u201d said Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to stay as president for a long time.\u201dBut as the rebels\u2019 foreign backers, including the United States, have cut their support, the Assad government, backed by Russia and Iran, is expanding its control. At some point, most expect, the fight will come to Idlib.\u201cWe are just going from one tragedy to a bigger tragedy,\u201d said Muhammad Jaffa, an engineer who helps resettle displaced people. \u201cThey are sending everyone here and we don\u2019t know what will happen to them in the end.\u201dShould new violence erupt, civilians have few options. Many fear arrest or conscription if they return to government areas, and Turkey has closed its border, where guards shoot \u2014 and sometimes kill \u2014 people sneaking across.Ali al-Juma, a doctor who fled to Idlib from his home farther south, said he again feels trapped.\u201cIt is now living in a minefield on the edge of another minefield,\u201d he said.Hwaida Saad and Nada Homsi contributed reporting from Beirut, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew 3% in 2nd Quarter, Fastest Pace in 2 Years", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe current recovery has entered its ninth year \u2014 long by economic standards \u2014 but it is showing some unexpected vigor.Mr. Trump talked up the latest figures in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., laying out his plans for tax overhaul. Despite nearly uniform skepticism from mainstream economists, he insisted that much faster economic growth was within reach.\u201cI happen to be one who thinks we can go much higher than 3 percent,\u201d the president said. \u201cThere is no reason why we should not.\u201dThere are several reasons that his goal is probably far-fetched, namely the country\u2019s aging work force and slower population growth than in the past. Combine that with low productivity growth, and hitting Mr. Trump\u2019s target begins to look like a Sisyphean challenge.The president also suggested that other economies overseas were growing at two or three times the American rate. \u201cYou look at other countries and what their G.D.P. is, they are unhappy when it is 7, 8, and 9,\u201d he said.Still, with personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of economic output, the new willingness of shoppers to open their wallets is a good sign.\u201cThe economy is stronger than you think,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, the chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in New York. \u201cBet on it.\u201dThe improvement was driven in large part by strong consumer activity, with purchases of durable goods like automobiles and appliances rising strongly. Increased business spending also helped lift the latest estimate above Commerce Department\u2019s initial reading of 2.6 percent for the quarter.The surge in consumer spending stands in stark contrast with the problems plaguing brick-and-mortar stores like Sears and Macy\u2019s, which have been forced to close dozens of locations this year amid fierce competition from online retailers like Amazon.com.The government\u2019s data reflects all purchases, whatever the retail channel, which explains why malls and street-level stores may be suffering even as consumers become more bullish and the broader economy powers ahead.Most economists are expecting the economy to expand at a rate of roughly 3 percent in the second half of 2017. That pace should be strong enough to keep job growth and wages on track for further gains, while keeping the threat of inflation modest for now.Besides wild cards like Hurricane Harvey\u2019s impact on a broad swath of the Gulf Coast, and political uncertainty about issues like tax overhaul and a possible increase in infrastructure spending, traders are also keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve.Most experts believe the central bank will raise interest rates just once more this year, but a faster economy or an increase in wages or inflation could prompt policy makers to move more quickly to tighten monetary policy and shrink the Fed\u2019s balance sheet in 2018.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, and other policy makers will also be closely watching data expected on Friday morning from the Labor Department on hiring, wages and unemployment in August. Economists estimate that the economy added 180,000 jobs, but a stronger gain, like July\u2019s 209,000 jump, or an uptick in wages, would focus more investor attention on the Fed\u2019s next meeting on Sept. 19 and 20.The acceleration in spending suggests that a so-called Trump bump \u2014 improved sentiment among consumers and more optimism among business leaders \u2014 may be translating into concrete actions like homeowners buying new appliances and companies investing in new software or equipment.\u201cThe consumer is in the driver\u2019s seat in terms of economic growth,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \u201cIt puts us on a stronger path going into the third quarter, although Hurricane Harvey introduces some uncertainty.\u201dMr. Anderson expects growth in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent in the current quarter, but he said the hurricane could shave as much as 0.3 percentage points off that figure. A hit like that would mostly be reversed in the year\u2019s final quarter as rebuilding efforts kicked in, he added.It will take more than one quarter\u2019s data for the White House or congressional Republicans to be able to claim credit for lifting the economy\u2019s growth trajectory. Under President Barack Obama in 2013 and 2014, quarterly growth occasionally exceeded 3 percent. But, in contrast to what happened during recoveries in the 1990s and mid-2000s, annual growth never passed that threshold.If the economy were to sustain the current pace of expansion, it would be a significant uptick from the 2 percent annual growth rate that has mostly prevailed since the recovery began.A difference of a single percentage point may not sound like much, but the stakes are huge in a $19 trillion economy. The acceleration could also help lift wage growth, which has been frustratingly slow for years despite steady hiring, a surging stock market and rising home prices.Private-sector estimates of third-quarter growth have also inched higher lately. Macroeconomic Advisers now forecasts a 3.4 percent expansion rate for the current quarter, up from the 2.9 percent figure it forecast earlier this month.Increases in consumer spending and business investment powered nearly all of the revision issued on Wednesday. Factors like net exports and residential investment barely changed, while government spending added only 0.1 percentage points.The Commerce Department offers three estimates of growth as more data becomes available, with the final figure for second-quarter economic activity to be released on Sept. 28.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colin Meads, Revered New Zealand Rugby Star, Dies at 81", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColin Meads, one of New Zealand\u2019s greatest and most revered rugby players, died on Sunday in Te Kuiti, New Zealand, his hometown. He was 81.Bill English, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, announced the death. Meads learned he had pancreatic cancer in 2016.That his death was a matter of state reflected both rugby union\u2019s importance to New Zealand \u2014 the All Blacks national team has won the last two World Cups and has an all-time winning percentage of .788 \u2014 and Meads\u2019s prestige there, or what New Zealanders call his \u201cmana,\u201d an indigenous Maori word.For many countrymen and women he epitomized the nation\u2019s rugged image of itself. But he also came to represent a politically conservative strain there when he led a team on a tour of South Africa in defiance of sanctions against its policies of apartheid.Meads played for the All Blacks for 14 years, from 1957 to 1971, and in 55 international matches, at a time when rugby was an amateur pursuit and a playing career of five years and 20 matches was reckoned substantial.Nicknamed Pinetree \u2014 in his prime he was a strapping 6-foot-3 and 220-plus pounds \u2014 Meads was a remorseless force of nature on the field, ripping the ball from opponents with powerful hands that, when he was a child, had been severely weakened by illness.His athleticism and ball skills were far ahead of those of most players in his position, lock forward. But he was also bruisingly physical, in keeping with the style of play during the All Blacks\u2019 heyday in the 1960s, a stark contrast to the free-flowing teams that have dominated rugby in the 21st century.\u201cIf you play in All Black, there\u2019s not much doubt what your game plan will be,\u201d the Australian forward Stan Pilecki once said.It was an elbows-out approach that Mead himself summed up after a hard-won victory over France: \u201cHeads down, bottoms up and drive, drive for 80 minutes.\u201d And it was ruthlessly effective.There was no World Cup before 1987, but there is little doubt that the New Zealand team would have been a winner had the championships been held in the 1960s. Unbeaten in runs of 17 matches between 1961 and 1964, followed by 17 consecutive victories from 1965 to 1969, the All Blacks set new marks for consistency and have rarely been matched since.Other players from the era also qualified as great, among them the team captains Wilson Whineray and Brian Lochore, the prop forward Ken Gray and Meads\u2019s younger brother, Stan, his partner at lock in the middle of the decade.But Meads, the only one present for the entire 17-match winning run, was the driving force and point of continuity. The scrum-half Chris Laidlaw reckoned him a player \u201cwithout any detectable weakness.\u201dWhen Meads retired in 1971, his 55 caps \u2014 appearances in a match at the international level \u2014 were a record for any country. Only three other New Zealanders had even half as many.\u201cIt was as if God had distilled in him the essence of competition,\u201d the English journalist John Reason wrote.That ferociously competitive drive, taken sometimes beyond the limits of the acceptable, made Meads a somewhat ogre-like figure to fans from other countries. In 1967, playing against Scotland, he became only the second player \u2014 and the last New Zealander until July 2017 \u2014 to be sent from the field for the remainder of the match for misconduct in an international contest.In a match a year later, when the Australian scrum-half Ken Catchpole lay trapped in a pile of players, Meads wrenched one of his legs with such force that the injuries ended Catchpole\u2019s career.Laidlaw recalled Meads as an archetypal New Zealander \u2014 \u201ca non-lover of publicity,\u201d as he put it \u2014 whose \u201cpleasure is the simple enjoyment he gets out of the game.\u201dMany saw Meads, a farmer away from the rugby field, as personifying the conservative, male-dominated rural society of midcentury New Zealand, when agriculture still defined both the country\u2019s economy and its psyche. A famous picture of him led to the legend that he trained by carrying sheep around, the duller truth being that the animal was unwell.When New Zealand was torn in the 1980s by disputes about whether to go on playing South Africa despite its apartheid policies, Meads was firmly on the side of maintaining contact. In 1986, defying international prohibitions on sports engagements in South Africa, he was manager of a \u201crebel\u201d tour of the country by a New Zealand team after a scheduled All Blacks tour had been canceled.That action denied him a role at the inaugural World Cup, in 1987. But he managed the All Blacks\u2019 1994 and 1995 teams.Meads received numerous honors. His appointment to the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2001 became a knighthood in 2009, when titles were reintroduced, although he was wont to say, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Sir.\u201dThe journalist and historian Ron Palenski equated Meads with Edmund Hillary, New Zealand\u2019s conqueror of Mount Everest, as \u201cSir Ed in rugby boots.\u201d In 2005, New Zealand newspapers wrote, without apparent irony, of visiting British rugby fans having \u201can audience\u201d with him.His memoirs, published in 1974, sold 57,000 copies at a time when New Zealand\u2019s population was just below three million.Colin Earl Meads, a descendant of three generations of farmers, was born on June 3, 1936, in Cambridge, in the Waikato region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, to Vere Meads and the former Ida Grey. When he was 7, his parents moved to a hill farm in the rugged King Country, in the heart of the North Island.As a child, Meads contracted scarlet and rheumatic fevers, which left him so weakened that he was taught to knit lest his hands become deformed.At Te Kuiti High School, he was a reluctant student given to taking time off to help his father with sheepshearing and other tasks. Early on, he played for local rugby teams.He retired from farming in 2009. He is survived by his wife, the former Verna Laing; five children; and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.His final public appearance was in June in Te Kuiti, where he watched the unveiling of a statue of him in his youth on the rugby field.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Bankers Are Selling Trump\u2019s Tax Plan. Is Congress Buying?", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin have spent months behind closed doors with Republican congressional leaders sketching the contours of an elaborate and politically difficult tax overhaul that is President Trump\u2019s top priority.Mr. Trump hopes to jump-start the process on Wednesday, traveling to Springfield, Mo., for a speech calling for large tax reductions and a long-anticipated revamping of the code. But he has largely left it to Mr. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, both new to government, to devise and execute a winning legislative strategy. And their involvement has some conservatives for whom tax cuts are a signal issue deeply concerned.\u201cThey are facing big frustration among policy makers, the business community and investors that there\u2019s been months of inaction, and the perception out there among investors is they don\u2019t think this is going to get this done this year,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump during the campaign.Already, their ambitions have drifted from the president\u2019s original mark: A 15 percent corporate tax rate proposed in April is now likely to move to the 20 to 25 percent range, say two people familiar with the officials\u2019 recent thinking. And a proposed 35 percent ceiling on the highest personal income tax rate could be shelved altogether, leaving the current 39.6 percent cap intact.For Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin, quiet competitors since their days as new partners at Goldman Sachs more than two decades ago, the task is a consequential test of whether real-world experience in finance has equipped them to carry out a delicate political negotiation, and whether two New Yorkers who have been lavish supporters of Democrats can succeed in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\u201cGoldman has thrived by hiring strong individuals with very different backgrounds and putting them together on a team,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in an email. \u201cGary and Steven are both steeped in that tradition from their years working side by side on the trading floor \u2014 not a bad training ground for the pressure cooker that is Washington.\u201dBehind the scenes, there have been differences of style and substance.Mr. Cohn \u2014 who wears monogrammed shirts, gold cuff links and a Rolex watch next to a brown leather bracelet with a \u201cpeace\u201d tag and a black beaded one with silver skulls \u2014 has brought a brash style and a take-no-prisoners approach to the tax issue. He is facile with data and has a keen understanding of the economy, according to people who have attended meetings with him, and he moved quickly to hire several experienced and well-connected aides \u2014 including Jeremy Katz, his deputy, and Shahira Knight, a former tax-writing congressional aide \u2014 who have been drivers in the private talks with Congress.But Mr. Cohn has also rankled lawmakers in both parties with comments that they suggest betray a lack of understanding about the political process and the intricate policy trade-offs that undergird a large tax rewrite. In a meeting with a group of Senate Democrats this year, according to people who were present, Mr. Cohn jokingly dismissed concerns about the wisdom and cost of repealing the estate tax, remarking, \u201cOnly morons pay the estate tax.\u201dA source close to Mr. Cohn denied that he had used the word, saying he had been referring to \u201crich people with really bad tax planning.\u201dMr. Mnuchin, bespectacled and crisply formal in his slim-cut business suits, is more reserved and careful than Mr. Cohn. A quick study on economic policy matters, he talks frequently about his level of access to the president and the strength of their relationship, making it clear to members of Congress as well as tax lobbyists that he has Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and is speaking for him on the tax plan. Mr. Mnuchin has been deferential to lawmakers, indulging House Republicans for weeks in talks about their idea of imposing a 20 percent border adjustment tax even after it became clear that the idea did not have enough support to be included in the plan.\u201cGary is pretty direct \u2014 he\u2019s come to the whip team meeting and he\u2019s probably less politically correct, and I use that in a loving way,\u201d said Representative Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe secretary is more correct. They complement one another.\u201dEarly in their respective roles on Trump\u2019s team, the two appeared to be jockeying for position in what one person who observed the dynamics described as an \u201cunholy alliance.\u201dDuring the transition, Mr. Mnuchin made a surprise visit to Mr. Cohn\u2019s job interview with Mr. Trump, greeting Mr. Cohn in the 26th-floor lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan to escort him to the president-elect.In meetings early this year before Mr. Mnuchin was confirmed, Mr. Cohn told key lawmakers that he would be leading the tax effort for the administration as the chief architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, according to several people familiar with the conversations who spoke about them on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Mnuchin appeared \u201czen\u201d when he learned of the meetings, said one person who was aware of the tension, assuring staff members that Mr. Cohn, whose job does not require Senate confirmation, was doing the right thing.Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin declined to be interviewed for this story.Aides to both deny any ill will or any attempt at one-upsmanship, describing any friction as a result of stylistic differences. And the two men have been virtually inseparable while working on the tax rewrite, talking at least once a day, dining together more than once a month at such popular Washington spots as Rasika and the Trump International Hotel, and keeping a singular focus on achieving the biggest tax cut possible in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s desires. Mr. Cohn was invited to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s recent wedding to the actress Louise Linton, said a person who was aware of the invitation, although he did not attend.The men have tried to avoid the mistakes that plagued the collapsed effort to repeal and replace the health care law, placing a premium on communicating with key members of Congress and finding a common approach to which the White House and Republican lawmakers could agree.\u201cI credit Secretary Mnuchin and Director Cohn for playing a key role in the work we have done to unify behind bold principles for tax reform, which really wasn\u2019t the case in health care,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.They recently intensified their efforts to present a united front. Last week, Tony E. Sayegh Jr., a top public affairs official at Treasury, was detailed to the West Wing to work with Hope Hicks, the interim White House communications director, on messaging for the tax push.\u201cThis is an administration where everyone is celebrating Festivus every day and airing grievances, and there\u2019s none of that here,\u201d said Rohit Kumar, a tax specialist at the accounting firm PwC and a former deputy chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.Still, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin have yet to produce the kind of comprehensive plan Mr. Trump has promised. A hastily compiled one-page document they presented in April proposing an array of tax cut bullet points in different fonts and type styles drew private ridicule from lawmakers in both parties and tax specialists throughout Washington as the mark of an administration wholly unprepared for the heavy legislative lift it was about to undertake.In mid-May, a few weeks after the one-page principles were issued, Treasury officials presented a more refined version to the president; his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner; Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist; and others: a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a 35 percent ceiling on the personal tax rate, said one person briefed on it, insisting on anonymity to describe private deliberations. Mr. Cohn, who attended the meeting but let Mr. Mnuchin and his deputies take the lead, had approved the plan beforehand with little argument, this person added.But in the weeks since then, the process has not always been smooth. Ms. Knight has advocated the elimination of the corporate interest deduction as a way of offsetting the cost of tax cuts without adding to the deficit, while Mr. Mnuchin has resisted the move, which would be costly to Wall Street firms and the real estate industry, according to two people briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.Mr. Cohn\u2019s staff felt frustrated to discover that Craig Phillips, the Treasury counselor most involved with planning structural reforms to the government-backed mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had been meeting with key players in the private sector to discuss potential policy without alerting the National Economic Council.Those divisions are slight compared with the vast disagreements between Democrats and Republicans on taxes, which the two have so far done little to bridge.\u201cYou get the sense that they think that somehow when they offer up all of this bravado about the deadlines and the plans that all of this is going to pop out of the oven like a cake fully baked,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the ranking member of the Finance Committee who has co-written two bipartisan tax rewrite proposals but said he has yet to be asked to meet one-on-one with either Mr. Mnuchin or Mr. Cohn.\u201cFrom the standpoint of getting real tax reform, which takes buy-in from both sides, they have just frittered months and months away needlessly,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.A White House spokesman said Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin have already met with Finance Committee members in larger groups and plan on reaching out to Mr. Wyden and other key Democrats in September, once their legislative push on taxes begins.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Kate Kelly from New York.Advertisement"}

But search and rescue operations were just getting underway.\u2022 While the extent of the devastation was not yet known, emergency officials reported heavy building damage in Port Aransas and in Rockport on Saturday, with shredded trees and blown-off roofs.\u2022 The system was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday afternoon, and is expected to produce a \u201cmultiday rainfall disaster\u201d over the next five to six days, according to the National Hurricane Center.\u2022 Follow Times correspondents tracking the storm on Twitter: @mannyNYT in Rockport, Tex.; @alanblinder in Victoria; @julieturkewitz and @ckrausss in Houston; @viaSimonRomero in Albuquerque, N.M.; and @jswatz in New York.Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday said that his primary concern remains \u201cdramatic flooding\u201d in the wake of the storm.Speaking at a televised news conference in Austin, Governor Abbott said state and other agencies remained active in search and rescue efforts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any information right now that we can confirm\u201d about fatalities, he said.He warned Texans to be vigilant and to stay away from rising water, noting that it can be far deeper, with swifter currents, than it may appear.\u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown. Don\u2019t risk your life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important thing all Texans can do is to put your life and the protection of your life first and foremost.\u201dThe storm remained a hurricane well after landfall, and conditions, including tornado warnings, made it difficult for the authorities to begin even preliminary damage assessments.More than 250,000 customers were without electricity early Saturday, a figure that was likely to increase. Corpus Christi urged people who were still in the city to boil water.Images and videos on social media showed substantial damage to buildings, including roofs and walls pulled away. Power lines were toppled, and phone service was down.Early rainfall totals were staggering. The National Hurricane Center said that an automated rain gauge near Victoria, a city of about 68,000 in the path of the storm, had recorded more than 16 inches in 24 hours.Rockport, a coastal city of about 10,000 that was in the hurricane\u2019s path when it came ashore. Charles J. Wax, Rockport\u2019s mayor, said that conditions were too dangerous on Saturday morning to deploy emergency officials across the city, but that an initial review, as the storm\u2019s eye passed overnight, showed \u201cwidespread damage.\u201d\u201cHomes and businesses completely destroyed, lives disrupted,\u201d said Mr. Wax, who said that a Fairfield Inn and Suites had sustained heavy damage. \u201cWe do not know if there is any loss of life, but that may be because we haven\u2019t been able to assess.\u201dHouston residents woke to light rain and an overcast sky. At a Walmart north of downtown, a few people came in for last-minute supplies. But some shelves had been emptied by hurricane-wary residents the night before. Employees said they would close the store at noon.Juan Cruz, 52, wheeled a cart out the door. He\u2019d noticed that rain from the night before had caused his roof to leak, and he\u2019d bought a tarp to cover it, hoping to stay dry if things got worse. Mr. Cruz, a mechanic, said he lived through Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and remembered the devastation. The storm killed his neighbors, flooded roads and tore up bridges, he said.As thousands of coastal residents were ordered to evacuate on Friday, and others chose to leave on their own, inland cities welcomed an influx of evacuees on Friday.Gov. Greg Abbott said the state government was preparing to assist up to 41,000 evacuees. As many as 54 shelters would be open, officials said, with the potential for that number to grow.Dallas opened a shelter for up to 500 people, and was ready to open two more if needed, officials there said.\u201cWe are prepared to handle much more than we are right now,\u201d said Rocky Vaz, director of the Dallas Office of Emergency Management.In Austin, the American Red Cross scheduled an \u201curgent shelter volunteer training\u201d session on Friday as officials prepared for more evacuees to arrive.San Antonio was also bracing for a possible uptick in homeless pets, and was offering incentives for people to help clear space in local animal shelters.In years past, major hurricanes caused immediate spikes in oil and gasoline prices, but as hard as Hurricane Harvey has hit the region\u2019s refineries, the impact at the pump has so far been muted.The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in Texas was $2.17 a gallon on Sunday morning, up only 2 cents from the beginning of the week, according to the AAA motor club, below the national average of $2.36 a gallon, also up 2 cents this week. The reason is a glut of oil and gasoline in storage, due to a frenzy of drilling in shale fields across the country, but especially in Texas, in recent years.Few, if any, places in the world have as much energy infrastructure in harm\u2019s way as the Gulf of Mexico coast. Houston, Corpus Christi, Texas City and other cities have vast refineries and natural gas terminals, which make and store dangerous chemicals. The Gulf itself is crisscrossed by oil and natural gas pipelines that connect production platforms to pipelines onshore. The potential for environmental catastrophe, or at least a crippling blow to the national economy, is always there when a hurricane hits. But the region\u2019s energy complex has dodged many bullets over the years.The last major hurricane to hit Texas was Ike in 2008. It barreled into Galveston, Tex., only miles from Texas City and the Houston ship channel, and its high concentration of refineries and chemical plants. There was no disaster, but the ports of Freeport, Texas City, and Lake Charles, La. remained closed for days and flooding knocked out power to some refineries for more than a week.More serious was the potential for trouble on the seas. Several drilling rigs were destroyed and underwater pipelines were damaged, but it appears that leaks were limited.For all its faults, Twitter has given us all a great way to watch weather events unfold. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of deep expertise in the Twittersphere, delivering stunning satellite images, storm track predictions and, of course, 140 well-chosen characters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Knows How to Push Our Buttons", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAddressing patrolmen and officers assembled in the Van Nostrand Theatre on Long Island on July 28, Trump was fully aware that his remarks would prove incendiary:When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon \u2014 you just see them thrown in, rough \u2014 I said, please don\u2019t be too nice. (Laughter.) Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you\u2019re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? Like, don\u2019t hit their head and they\u2019ve just killed somebody \u2014 don\u2019t hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, okay?Underlying Trump\u2019s defiance of law enforcement norms is a calculated strategy advocating the use of force, with the twofold goal of pushing liberals back on their heels and affirming the instincts of his most avid supporters.Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on liberal orthodoxy highlight how Democrats are themselves bound \u2014 hogtied is not too strong a word \u2014 by the conflicting needs and goals of the various constituencies in their multiracial, multiethnic coalition \u2014 a coalition that has been vulnerable to wedge issue attacks for 50 years.The survey asked whether seven statements apply more to Democrats or Republicans \u2014 \u201cwill take the right approach on health care,\u201d \u201cunderstands what it is like for regular Americans;\u201d \u201cwill fight for people like you,\u201d \u201cwill reduce the power of special interests in Congress,\u201d \u201cwill cut taxes for the middle class,\u201d \u201cwill do more to ensure that people are rewarded for hard work\u201d and \u201cwill help improve the economy and create jobs.\u201dDemocrats held the advantage on one of the seven, health care, and that was by four points. Republicans were ahead on every other issue. Most important, Republicans led Democrats by a solid 19 points on ensuring that people are rewarded for hard work and by a devastating 35 points on improving the economy and creating jobs \u2014 just what \u201cA Better Deal\u201d claims to do.When Schumer, Pelosi and other Democrats seek to make the case for a \u201cbetter deal,\u201d they face an audience primed to disbelieve every word they say.I asked Pete Brodnitz, the founder of Expedition Strategies, one of the firms that conducted this survey, whether he thought there was a link between Trump\u2019s emphasis on immigration, Latino gangs, and crime and the Democrats\u2019 efforts to shift the agenda to economic policy.\u201cThis has been building for months but it has become pronounced recently,\u201d he wrote in an email. The Trump administration hopes \u201cDemocrats will react by defending immigration and look \u2018soft on gangs,\u2019 \u201d aware that \u201cif they push the envelope on this issue they can get coverage for their efforts and drown out Democratic efforts to change the topic.\u201dBrodnitz described Trump\u2019s tactics as offering \u201cideas that sound really outlandish but that they believe have popular support \u2014 at least with their core voters\u201d and that the Long Island speech was based on \u201cthe hope that Democrats would look more concerned about criminals than about crime and its victims.\u201dTo put it mildly, it has been difficult for the Democrats to recruit key white voters to consider an economic agenda in the face of concerted efforts by the Trump campaign and his administration to shift the focus to crime.I asked a prominent political scientist \u2014 a man with generally moderate views \u2014 for his reaction to Trump\u2019s comments in the Long Island speech. His answer surprised me. Requesting anonymity in order to speak candidly, he replied:I think, yeah, a lot of people, whites anyway, think that the police are too constrained. When I watch the anarchists tear up Oakland, which happens pretty regularly, a part of me thinks \u201cwhere are the 1968 Chicago police when we really need them?\u201d These thugs behave the way they do in part because there are no consequences. Also, we see a lot of cases on TV where someone is resisting arrest, the police wrestle him down and hit him a few times, and then there are complaints about excessive force. Heavens\u2019 sakes, if someone doesn\u2019t comply with an order, what are the police supposed to do?One question Haidt\u2019s survey asks respondents is whether they agree or disagree with the idea that \u201ca criminal should be made to suffer in the same way that his victim suffered.\u201dHaidt said \u201cprogressives strongly reject it, and it correlates fairly well with politics \u2014 the farther right you are, the more you endorse it.\u201dWhat, then, does Pinker make of Trump\u2019s Long Island speech?It appeals to one of our worst angels, the desire for \u201crough justice\u201d \u2014 quick and brutal revenge inflicted on a suspected wrongdoer. The ultimate evolutionary rationale for revenge, vendettas, blood feuds, mob violence, summary justice, lynching, vigilantes, deadly ethnic riots, the code of the streets, and other forms of rough justice is deterrence: if a person anticipates getting beaten up for exploiting people, he\u2019ll think twice about exploiting them.Trump, in Pinker\u2019s view, has focused on the most primitive and regressive emotions among voters:So yes, Trump is wisecracking about overturning millennia of progress in taming our brutish instincts for instant retaliation, and discarding the norms and institutions of justice that our better angels have crafted and perfected.Pinker sees this as part of an ongoing struggle.The appeal of regressive impulses is perennial. The forces of liberalism, modernity, cosmopolitanism, the open society, and Enlightenment values always have to push against our innate tribalism, authoritarianism, and thirst for vengeance.And yes,at times in history the darker forces prevail \u2014 the two world wars, the American crime wave from the 1960s to early 1990s, the rise of civil war in the developing world over that same period. These darker forces, moreover, are not just raw instincts, but often rationalized in ideologies.The connection may not seem obvious at first, but Pinker\u2019s comments are directly relevant to the Democratic Party\u2019s attempt to counter Trump with liberal economic policies.Not only is their adversary a man ungoverned by rule or tradition, but he is a man who has taken \u201cour impulses of authoritarianism and tribalism,\u201d to quote Pinker one last time, and constructed \u201can edifice of rationalization around them.\u201dThis puts the Democrats in a dangerous position. The more they succeed in pushing Trump up against a wall, politically speaking, the more they risk the possibility that the he will inflict real damage, whether it is hostile engagement abroad or increasingly aggressive attacks on democratic institutions at home.It is ominous that Trump has already hit upon the use of force as his preferred solution when confronting domestic law-and-order issues. One hates to think of what a man with his mind-set can do with a nuclear arsenal and the world as his stage.the strange specter of an American president\u2019s seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians created such a cognitive dissonance among my generation of conservatives \u2014 who had come of age under existential threat from the Soviet Union \u2014 that it was almost impossible to believe.Conservativeshave maintained an unnerving silence as instability has ensued. To carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical faculties.What Flake recognizes, and what Democrats are only coming to realize, is that Trump represents a systemic assault on the legitimacy of America\u2019s democratic processes, an attack that needs to be countered by far more that a modest collection of economic policies organized under the rubric \u201ca better deal.\u201dFlake\u2019s open defection is an important step. If it is to become a serious problem for Trump, Flake\u2019s Republican colleagues \u2014 Susan Collins, Bob Corker, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Lisa Murkowksi, Rob Portman and Ben Sasse come to mind \u2014 will have to join him and not just one vote at a time. For a challenge to Trump to be effective, Republicans\u2019 \u201cunnerving silence\u201d will have to crack.Advertisement"}

Eddie Calvo.Mr. Trump said: \u201cI have to tell you, you have become extremely famous all over the world. They are talking about Guam; and they\u2019re talking about you.\u201d And when it comes to tourism, he added, \u201cI can say this: You\u2019re going to go up, like, tenfold with the expenditure of no money.\u201dMr. Calvo agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s a paradise. We got 95 percent occupancy and after all this stuff calms down, we\u2019re going to have 110 percent occupancy.\u201dThe president responded, \u201cYou just went to 110, I think.\u201dEfforts to reach the White House on Saturday for comment were not immediately successful.Guam\u2019s $5 billion economy is fueled mainly by tourism and the United States military, which occupies about 30 percent of the island and is looking to expand. The island, roughly the size of Chicago and home to about 160,000 people, is about 2,200 miles southeast of North Korea.\u201cWe are with you 1,000 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the call to Mr. Calvo, who invited the president to the island. \u201cYou are safe. We\u2019re with you 1,000 percent.\u201dMr. Trump added of Guam: \u201cIt just looks like a beautiful place.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis is between you and I. But you don\u2019t talk like they talk. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that with people like us.\u201dWhile Guam has generally been calm about the escalating threats of a missile attack, some were not thrilled by the tone of the conversation between the two men.\u201cListening to that call left me feeling disgusted,\u201d said Andrea Nicole Grajek, a local artist from Dededo village. \u201cI was so shocked I was actually crying. They\u2019re leaders discussing a rise in fame and tourism, while the world is watching our island carefully to see if we\u2019ll still be here tomorrow.\u201dActivists who are advocating Guam\u2019s independence from the United States argue that the presence of the military installations has made the island a magnet for attack. Others contend that the presence of the United States defense system is necessary, given the threats in the region.\u201cI think Guam is being used as a kind of pawn in this game,\u201d said Robert Underwood, president of the University of Guam. \u201cI think it\u2019s like our role in life.\u201dMr. Underwood, a former Guam delegate to Congress, said Guam should find a way to take advantage of its relationship with the federal government if the island continues as the platform to project the United States\u2019 military power in Asia.\u201cI think we should get more out of this relationship than what we are getting now,\u201d he said.Mr. Calvo, however, told Mr. Trump that he had \u201cnever felt more safe or so confident than with you at the helm. So, with all the criticism going on over there from a guy who is being targeted, we need a president like you. So I\u2019m just so thankful. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re holding the helm.\u201dMr. Trump responded: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a great job. You don\u2019t have to worry about a thing. They should have had me eight years ago, somebody with my thought process.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnd frankly, you could\u2019ve said that for the last three presidents.\u201dGlenn Thrush contributed reporting from Bedminster, N.J.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Cohn and Mnuchin Tackle Taxes", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has largely left management of his administration\u2019s tax overhaul to the former Goldman Sachs executives Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin. That is making some conservatives nervous.There is also the question of whether their experience in finance is enough to succeed in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\u2022 Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that he has Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and is speaking for him. He is also more careful and more reserved than Mr. Cohn \u2014 and more deferential to lawmakers.The advisers have tried to avoid the mistakes that plagued the effort to repeal and replace the health care law, placing a premium on communicating with key members of Congress.Still, they have yet to produce the kind of comprehensive plan Mr. Trump has promised. And some worry that the men have made little progress.That might seem surprising as Houston is the fourth-largest American city and the center of a metropolitan area with economic output of half a trillion dollars a year. And indeed, the area does face years of rebuilding.And, while it is a macabre form of accounting, the need to repair buildings could create a surge in output.Still, the storm continues to wallop the Gulf Coast and it is too early to say that the economy is in the clear. But so far, the human damage is the greatest.Worth noting: Day traders have been pouring into the most arcane corners of markets, betting on whether the VIX, or the so-called fear gauge, will rise or fall.These wagers on expected volatility have traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors. But since the financial crisis, investment banks have offered VIX-linked products for purchase on the stock exchange, much like buying shares in IBM or Microsoft.But are all the investors aware of what they are getting into?\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d said Robert E. Whaley, a financial professor at Vanderbilt University known as the father of the VIX for his work on developing it. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was.

{"Headline": "Fleece of the Century", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BoxingLAS VEGAS \u2014 The world finally had the two of them contained Saturday night, in a roped-off ring where they had to remain silent and just get on with it. Two mouthy welterweights, neither the best role model for his respective legion of young fans, throwing mocking looks and punches in a spectacle of the inevitable.So, then: Do the math.\u201cI thought it was close,\u201d said McGregor immediately after the fight, to the concurrence of no one.Mayweather, looking as though he had just returned from a light jog, summed things up with a charitable: \u201cI think we gave the fans what they wanted to see.\u201dPerhaps. Some wanted Mayweather to win, some wanted McGregor to overcome impossible odds \u2014 and some hoped that the two would manage to knock each other out. Mayweather has another record, a criminal one for hitting women, while McGregor has demonstrated a capacity for low verbal blows touching on race, misogyny, Mayweather\u2019s struggle with reading, you name it.They staged their performance before 14,623 fans at the T-Mobile Arena, many of the men in sharp suits and no socks, many of the women in cocktail dresses and heels, as if attired for a garish wake. There were A-list celebrities, D-list celebrities, people who consider themselves celebrities, swarms of Irish people wrapped in their country\u2019s tricolors, and a posse of young women wearing shirts emblazoned with the name of a company whose website requires that you confirm you\u2019re an adult. Also, some boxing fans.Then there were the rest of us, the world, with the combat-sport spectacle available for broadcast in more than 200 countries and territories. Millions of viewers eager to pay to see a pugilistic confection.Willing suckers, all.For months the two men had worked as hard in ginning up the match as training for it. During a four-city tour to promote the fight, they had engaged in foul-mouthed antics that reinforced how insufferable they might be in private company.In this arena, at least, McGregor outdid his opponent, wearing a suit that spelled out an expletive in pinstripes, and telling Mayweather to \u201cDance for me, boy.\u201d Mayweather is black, while McGregor has the type of white Irish skin that the comedian George Carlin once called \u201cphosphorescent.\u201dBut now it was time to bite down on a mouth guard and keep lips closed.In one corner fidgeted McGregor. He grew up in the somewhat scrappy Crumlin section of Dublin and chucked a job as a plumber\u2019s apprentice to focus on mixed martial arts. He has since become the sport\u2019s most popular star, with assorted championships and controversies under his belt.He is a working-class god to some in Ireland, a cringe-inducing embarrassment to others, especially given his habit of wrapping himself in the Irish flag as if it were a beach towel. He is quick-witted but crass, his lavish spending habits recalling for some the gross materialism that defined the rise and collapse of last decade\u2019s Celtic Tiger economy.In the other corner waited Mayweather, one of the most divisive sports figures of his day. Born in Grand Rapids, Mich., he grew up poor in a family dogged by drugs and crime, but rose to become arguably the best pound-for-pound boxer of his generation. His athletic skills and business acumen \u2014 in real estate, clothing and marketing, among other ventures \u2014 have made him astoundingly wealthy, an achievement he underscores by posing for photographs with stacks of money, the way that others might pose with their children.Now the bell sounded, and the veteran and the rookie \u2014 fighting at the super-welterweight level of between 148 and 154 pounds \u2014 approached each other on a blue mat sporting the name of a beer company. They raised their gloved hands.Or was it a reflection of \u2014 maybe even a distraction from \u2014 the times we live in, this Trumpian age when so much seems unsettled, if not unmoored? North Korea. Russia. Afghanistan. Sanctuary cities and border walls, the toppling of Confederate statues and the rise of white supremacists? In other words, race plus?Perhaps bits of all these themes were at play. So, too, was the age-old attraction of violent combat between men, the bloodlust we pretty up with smiling ring girls and tuxedoed announcers. But in the end, all the hype, all the blather, all the posturing, all the media, was about only one achingly obvious thing: money.As Paul Rouse, a professor at University College Dublin who specializes in sport, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big ball of candy floss being confected by a small group of men who are making themselves extremely rich by packaging up something that people have always done and selling it through modern telecommunications.\u201dDo some more math. With the fight\u2019s purse, plus merchandise sales, plus pay-per-views at $100 apiece, it is estimated that Mayweather \u2014 whose nickname is, in fact, \u201cMoney\u201d \u2014 will earn more than $200 million. McGregor, it is thought, will earn a paltry $100 million. Fitting, then, that the event took place in Las Vegas; staging it anywhere else would have been an affront to the mercenary gods. The match belonged here \u2014 deserved quarantining here \u2014 along the Strip, where any authenticity is often just another act of illusion that leaves you double-checking your wallet\u2019s whereabouts.A walk to the venue from any approach reinforced this belief, but a logical path to take was one effectively controlled by MGM Resorts International, the hospitality and entertainment behemoth that was a partner in the Mayweather-McGregor circus.This walk began at the Mandalay Bay resort, which rises from the sun-baked Nevada flatness like a 43-story stack of gilded bricks. Here, as everywhere, the twinned half-visages of Mayweather and McGregor glowered from posters and video screens, an Orwellian pair of Big Brothers on watch for any flagging in the suspension of disbelief.Not far from one of these advertisements there was a memorabilia store in which another sportsman claiming royalty, the former baseball star Pete Rose, often sits. Banned from Major League Baseball for gambling and denied induction into the Hall of Fame, the so-called Hit King has a regular gig here as a window-display attraction.The day before the fight, the squat legend was once again at his position, giving forced smiles for photographs and signing his name for money, each autograph like an author\u2019s signature on a book telling the cautionary tale of a fallen king.The mall led to the Luxor Las Vegas, a 30-story casino pyramid with an ancient Egyptian motif. Among its many attractions is one called \u201cBodies: The Exhibition,\u201d an intriguing look at the miracle of the human form that leaves presumably unmentioned the damage done, say, from repeated blows to the head.The Luxor then led to the Excalibur, a casino whose Medieval theme includes nightly jousting tournaments, which then led to New York-New York, a casino that does not, does not, evoke the city of its name.

The storm has dropped more than 30 inches of rain in some areas, with more expected, and even when the waters recede, many lives will not return to their normal rhythms for months or years, if ever, as displaced families make their way back home, take stock and begin arduous cleanups. Homes, businesses and other structures will be beyond repair, forcing residents and government officials to make difficult decisions about whether to rebuild and how. The oil and gas industry concentrated on the Texas coast could be disrupted for weeks or longer, sending ripples across energy markets and the economy.To do right by the people in Texas, Congress should do more than simply cut a check for relief funds when it returns to work next week. The National Flood Insurance Program, for instance, is badly in need of reforms that encourage local governments and developers to adopt better building standards and reduce flood risks, not just in Texas but in Louisiana and other flood-prone states.When calamity strikes, this country always seems to be looking in the rearview mirror, lamenting its failure to heed long-ago warnings.

{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma Beats Back No-Confidence Vote in South Africa", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 President Jacob Zuma of South Africa survived a no-confidence motion in Parliament on Tuesday, but by a much narrower margin than expected, revealing the extent to which accusations of graft and mismanagement have weakened his party\u2019s hold on power.After hours of heated debate, the motion was defeated, with 177 lawmakers voting yes, 198 voting no and nine abstaining.If Mr. Zuma had lost, he would have had to resign, along with his entire cabinet. Although he prevailed, his standing within the African National Congress, which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid, has eroded, perhaps beyond the point of repair.Opponents had hoped that anonymous voting would embolden disaffected A.N.C. loyalists to defect and vote against Mr. Zuma without fear of reprisal. It appeared that many did so: The A.N.C. controls 249 seats in the 400-member National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of Parliament; the motion needed 201 votes to pass, and it fell only 24 votes short.As the debate proceeded, crowds massed in Cape Town, the seat of the legislature, to listen to the proceedings, which were streamed and broadcast live. Protesters also gathered in Johannesburg and Pretoria.\u201cThis president must just be removed,\u201d said one marcher, Godfrey Dromp, 54, a supporter of the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who replaces him.\u201dA.N.C. loyalists held a rival march outside City Hall, where Nelson Mandela addressed huge crowds after being released from prison in 1990. \u201cThis is where our democracy began,\u201d a party activist, Nobuntu Kuse, told supporters. \u201cThe A.N.C. freed this country. We aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201dMr. Zuma\u2019s opponents said the vote was essential to restoring confidence in the government and improving the economy. They repeatedly cited a lengthy controversy involving the Guptas, a powerful family that has extensive business holdings and is so close to Mr. Zuma that they were commonly called the Zuptas. Leaked emails have led to accusations of influence peddling and calls for investigations.He urged lawmakers to \u201cvote with your conscience and remove this corrupt and broken president from office.\u201d\u201cWe are not here today to remove the democratically elected government of the A.N.C., which was voted for by our people in 2014,\u201d he said, referring to the last national election.The vote, he said, was \u201cnot against the A.N.C.\u201d but against its leader, whom Mr. Malema called \u201cthe most corrupt individual in this country.\u201dMangosuthu Buthelezi, 88, a veteran of the struggle to topple apartheid and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, said that the \u201cpoisoned seed of corruption\u201d had been planted well before South Africa\u2019s transition to democracy, but that misrule by Mr. Zuma had \u201creached the point that the unthinkable became possible.\u201dUnder Mr. Zuma, he said, the country was for sale \u201cto the highest bidder.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis motion of no confidence is not against the A.N.C. We are not here to say \u2018A.N.C. must fall.\u2019 It is against corruption, it is against state capture, it is against one man.\u201dPieter Groenewald, the leader of Freedom Front Plus, a party of white Afrikaners, urged members of the A.N.C. to abstain rather than vote against the resolution, warning that if they kept Mr. Zuma, voters would blame them, not just the president.Mr. Zuma\u2019s term as president runs until 2019, but the party is gearing up to meet in December to choose new party leaders for the next five years. Mr. Zuma\u2019s narrow victory on Tuesday could empower his critics within the party and weaken supporters like his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is a former home affairs minister and a contender to succeed him as party leader.\u201cThe court of public opinion must not be allowed to become the benchmark of decision making,\u201d Mr. Mabe said. \u201cThis is even more important today, where social media seeks to influence the outcomes, even without subjecting itself to the test of veracity.\u201d\u201cWe are not sellouts,\u201d Ms. Dlakude said.\u201cThe A.N.C. I saw in today\u2019s debate was very different from the arrogant party we normally see in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Mathekga said. \u201c It was a complete shift in tone from previous motions of no confidence where they have defended Zuma.\u201dKimon de Greef reported from Cape Town, and Sewell Chan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Handouts to Drivers Could Help Steady Uber", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsUber has dug itself into a hole.The ride-hailing service could help dig itself out by giving drivers shares, but because they are not considered employees, the Securities and Exchange Commission would have to sign off.Such a plan could bolster Uber\u2019s damaged brand and help retain unhappy drivers. Other gig-economy workers might gain, too. But existing investors could present a roadblock.Asset managers including Vanguard and T. Rowe Price have marked down sharply the value of their holdings in Uber, previously estimated in private markets at nearly $70 billion, after a monthslong public relations nightmare, headlined by claims of sexual harassment and bias. A rash of executives recently left the company, while Benchmark Capital, a major shareholder, is suing to oust Travis Kalanick, the former chief executive, from the board. A drain of drivers in the United States adds to its list of troubles.The S.E.C. provides limited exemptions from the securities registration process for private companies issuing stock to non-employees. Consultants and advisers qualify, and Uber has held talks with the regulator about whether independent contractors could be included.A decision by the watchdog could also apply to others, such as workers for the delivery service Postmates or Handy Technologies\u2019 home repair and cleaning personnel. Previously, the commission has said that exemptions for stock compensation can apply to independent sales representatives and bookkeepers.If it gets the go-ahead, Uber could base stock handouts on a driver\u2019s time worked or number of trips, for example. Rewarding its loyal contributors could help improve Uber\u2019s image and prevent those who complain about pay and expenses from jumping to rival services. It could, however, bolster the arguments of those who claim that drivers are de facto employees and should collect the associated benefits.Another potential problem for Uber is that investors who are already upset over mismanagement could be further irked by any dilution of their holdings. Though Uber has tapped most sources of start-up capital already to build a large cash cushion, it still burns through dollars and may need investors to pitch in again in the future.Uber has already tried to improve driver morale by introducing tipping in certain cities. Finding other ways to keep them happy while also regaining investor confidence will help the company avoid another pileup.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Doesn\u2019t Want What\u2019s Best for Us", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionGoogle processes more than three billion search queries a day. It has altered our notions of privacy, tracking what we buy, what we search for online \u2014 and even our physical location at every moment of the day. Every business trying to reach mass-market consumer demand online knows that Google is the gatekeeper.The fact that it is a monopoly, with an almost 90 percent share of the search advertising business, is a given that we have all come to accept. It\u2019s Google\u2019s world; we just live in it. So it matters how this company works \u2014 who it hires, who it fires and why.When a company is dominant enough, it sets the tone for an entire era. In the fall of 1985, I was working as a vice president in the media mergers and acquisitions group at Merrill Lynch in Los Angeles. I would occasionally have to show up for a meeting at 5 a.m. in the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert. I would do this because Mike Milken, the king of junk bonds at Drexel, would demand it \u2014 once the trading day started at 6:30 a.m., he was unavailable.Executives were terrified that Drexel would start a raid on their companies. Politicians would seek Mr. Milken\u2019s counsel and his money. His \u201cwho\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d attitude was the perfect libertarian credo for the Reagan era of deregulation. Drexel gave us culture, too \u2014 \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d and Gordon Gekko in \u201cWall Street\u201d telling us that \u201cgreed is good.\u201d But Drexel flew too close to the sun. Mr. Milken went to prison and Drexel is no more.Today, the great fortunes are not made at companies like Drexel but at companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon. And the rules set by Google are the rules we all abide by.\u201cPortions of the memo violate our code of conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote in a companywide email.It\u2019s impossible to believe that Google or other large tech companies a few years ago would have reacted like this to such a memo. In 2011 when CNN filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the workplace diversity data on big tech companies, Google, among others, asked the Department of Labor for its data to be excluded. The company said that releasing that information would cause \u201ccompetitive harm.\u201d It was not until 2014 that Google began to disclose statistics showing that only 17 percent of its technical work force was female.If women should not even have the vote, why should we worry about gender diversity in the engineering ranks?Today Google is under growing scrutiny, and the cognitive dissonance between the outward-facing \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d stance and the internal misogynistic \u201cbrogrammer\u201d rhetoric was too extreme.Google had to fire the offending engineer, James Damore, but anyone who spends time on the message boards frequented by Valley engineers will know that the \u201cbro\u201d culture that gave us Gamergate \u2014 an online movement that targeted women in the video game industry \u2014 is much more prevalent than Mr. Pichai wants to acknowledge.The company canceled a planned all-hands meeting on Thursday, citing concern about harassment.The effects of the darker side of tech culture reach well beyond the Valley. It starts with an unwillingness to control fake news and pervasive sexism that no doubt contributes to the gender pay gap. But it will soon involve the heart of Google\u2019s business: surveillance capitalism. The trope that \u201cif you are not paying for it, you aren\u2019t the customer \u2014 you\u2019re the product\u201d has been around for a while. But now the European Union has passed the General Data Protection Regulation, which will go into effect next May. This regulation aims to give people more control over their data, so search engines can\u2019t follow them everywhere they roam online. It will be an arrow to the heart of Google\u2019s business.We have an obligation to care about the values of the people who run Google, because we\u2019ve given Google enormous control over our lives and the lives of our children. As the former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris points out, \u201cWithout realizing the implications, a handful of tech leaders at Google and Facebook have built the most pervasive, centralized systems for steering human attention that has ever existed, while enabling skilled actors (addictive apps, bots, foreign governments) to hijack our attention for manipulative ends.\u201dThe future implications of a couple of companies\u2019 having such deep influence on our attention and our behavior are only beginning to be felt. The rise of artificial intelligence combined with Google\u2019s omnipresence in our lives is an issue that is not well understood by politicians or regulators.America is slowly waking up both culturally and politically to the takeover of our economy by a few tech monopolies. We know we are being driven by men like Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos toward a future that will be better for them. We are not sure that it will be better for us.As George Packer, writing in The New Yorker in 2011, put it, \u201cIn Thiel\u2019s techno-utopia, a few thousand Americans might own robot-driven cars and live to 150, while millions of others lose their jobs to computers that are far smarter than they are, then perish at 60.\u201dSomehow the citizens of the world have been left out of this discussion of our future. Because tools like Google and Facebook have become so essential and because we have almost no choice in whether to use them, we need to consider the role they play in our lives.By giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the present, we cede our freedom to choose our future.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Whiniest \u2018Victim\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump is the reigning king of American victimhood.He is unceasingly pained, injured, aggrieved.The primaries were unfair. The debates were unfair. The general election was unfair.People refuse to reach past his flaws \u2014 which are legion! \u2014 and pat him on the back. People refuse to praise his minimal effort and minimal efficacy. They refuse to ignore that the legend he created about himself is a lie. People\u2019s insistence on truth and honest appraisal is so annoying. It\u2019s all so terribly unfair.In this way he was a perfect reflection of the new Whiny Right. Trump is its instrument, articulation, embodiment. He\u2019s not so much representative of it but of an idea \u2014 the waning power of whiteness, privilege, patriarchy, access, and the cultural and economic surety that accrues to the possessors of such. Trump represents their emerging status of victims-in-their-own-minds.The way they see it, they are victims of coastal and urban liberals and the elite institutions \u2014 economic, education and entertainment \u2014 clustered there. They are victims of an economy evolving in ways, both technical and geographic, that cuts them out or leaves them behind. They are victims of immigration and shifting American demographics. They are victims of shifting, cultural mores. They are victims of Washington.No one speaks to these insecurities like the human manifestation of insecurity himself: Donald Trump.Donald Trump is their death rattle: That unsettling sound a body makes when death nears.But, Trump\u2019s whining is not some clever Machiavellian tactic, precisely tuned for these times. Trump\u2019s whining is genuine. He pretends to be ferocious, but is actually embarrassingly fragile. His bravado is all illusion. The lion is a coward. And, he licks his wounds until they are raw.Now, pour into this hollow man Steve Bannon\u2019s toxic, apocalyptic nationalism and his professed mission \u2014 \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d \u2014 and you get a perfect storm of extreme orthodoxy and extreme insecurity.Trump becomes a tool of those in possession of legacy power in this country \u2014 and those who feel that power is their rightful inheritance \u2014 who are pulling every possible lever to enshrine and cement that power. Suppressing the vote. Restricting immigration. Putting the brakes on cultural inclusion.Make America great again. Turn back the clock to a time when privileges of whiteness were supreme and unassailable, misogyny was simply viewed as an extension of masculinity, women got back-alley abortions and worked for partial wages, coal was king and global warming was purely academic, and trans people weren\u2019t in our bathrooms or barracks. The good old days.Now the power of the presidency is deployed in this pursuit. The only thing that holds the line against absolute calamity is the fact that Trump lacks focus and hates work.He may keep himself busy with things he considers to be work, but his definition of that word and mine do not seem to be in alignment. Twitter tantrums, obsessive television viewing, holding campaign-style rallies to feed his narcissistic need for adulation. Those things to me do not signal competence, but rather profound neurosis. True productivity leaves little space for this extreme protestation.And, not only is he a lazy whiner, he\u2019s also a projectionist: He is so consumed by his insecurities that he projects them onto others. Trump branded Ted Cruz a liar, when he himself wouldn\u2019t know the truth if it slapped him in the face. He blasted Hillary Clinton as being crooked, when he himself was crooked. He sneered at President Obama\u2019s work ethic \u2014 among many other things \u2014 but Trump\u2019s own work ethic has been found severely wanting.In 2015, Trump said, \u201cI would rarely leave the White House because there\u2019s so much work to be done.\u201d He continued: \u201cI would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.\u201dLies.Trump has spent an unseemly amount of time away from the White House, playing golf, and is at this very moment on a 17-day vacation.Trump is like the unfaithful spouse who constantly accuses the other of infidelity because the guilt of his or her own sins has hijacked their thinking and consumed their consciousness. The flaws he sees are the ones he possesses.This projection of vice, claiming of victimhood, and complaining about vanishing privileges make Trump an ideal front man for the kind of cultural anxiety, desperation and anger that disguises itself as a benign debate about public policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Thriving City, SoHo\u2019s Soaring Rents Keep Storefronts Empty", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of the recession, as most of the country struggled, SoHo thrived. Between 2010 and 2014, rents for stores in the former industrial district in Lower Manhattan soared by 75 percent, to an annual $860 a square foot, or $4.3 million a year for a 5,000-square-foot storefront, as national chains pushed into the neighborhood, willing to pay seemingly any price to get a piece of the action.Those were the good old days.Now, with the city\u2019s unemployment at near historic lows and the economy humming along, empty storefronts dot SoHo\u2019s streets, with 16 in the six-block stretch of Broadway between Houston and Canal Streets, the area\u2019s retail spine. More stud the Belgian-blocked side streets, dark gaps between boutiques selling high fashion and designer furniture and the occasional remaining art gallery.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing no velocity in leasing,\u201d said C. Bradley Mendelson, vice chairman of Colliers, a real estate brokerage, and a longtime retail broker. \u201cNo one\u2019s taking space.\u201dAcross the country, retailers have been wounded by competition from Amazon and other internet sales sites, prompting caution in opening new stores, be it in the suburbs, in SoHo or on Fifth Avenue. But the problems in New York City, and in particular SoHo, go beyond that, brokers and retail experts say.\u201cRight now, it feels like retail is on pause,\u201d said David LaPierre, a retail specialist and a vice chairman at CBRE, a real estate services company. \u201cRents need to get to a much more realistic level.\u201dSoHo was once home to small factories, wholesalers and workshops. In the 1960s, artists in search of low rents and big spaces moved into the lofts, often illegally. Over time, art galleries, small boutiques and furniture designers followed, giving the neighborhood cultural cachet. Starting in the 1990s, though, more stores moved in, the galleries decamped for Chelsea and other neighborhoods, and the streets filled with tourists from around the world, often laden with shopping bags.But rents escalated far faster than retail sales throughout Manhattan. Between 2010 and 2014, retail sales in Manhattan climbed 31.9 percent, while rents soared by 90 percent, according to CBRE.In SoHo, big commercial real estate firms like Thor Equities, 60 Guilders and Premier Equities bought out longtime small-scale landlords, pushing rents there even higher.The area also became a hub of flagship stores, for which chains pay top dollar to expand their brand identity and don\u2019t mind breaking even, or even losing money. Typical is the five-story, 55,000-square-foot Nike behemoth at Broadway and Spring Street that opened last winter.\u201cEverything became a flagship,\u201d said Mr. Mendelson of Colliers. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have one on Fifth, one in Times Square and one in SoHo. Flagships don\u2019t make money. They\u2019re ad vehicles to promote the retailer.\u201dOnly the biggest brands can afford that kind of promotion. \u201cAt those levels, many retailers simply can\u2019t afford their store,\u201d said Mr. LaPierre of CBRE. \u201cI don\u2019t know any retailer who can survive while paying 50 percent of their revenue in rent.\u201dAfter rents peaked in 2014, vacancies began opening up and rents slipped. By the spring of 2017, the average asking rent for shop space on Broadway had fallen 21 percent, to $678 a square foot per year, according to CBRE.And still, there are plenty of locations to choose from.Some landlords have started finding ways to generate income. Pop-up stores \u2014 which take over a space temporarily, with a predetermined end date \u2014 offer landlords what Beth Rosen, a retail broker at RKF, a national firm, calls a \u201ckind of a band-aid for the space,\u201d bringing in revenue but not foreclosing the possibility of a permanent rental paying the higher asking rate. Ms. Rosen said that SoHo landlords are more willing than ever to permit the short-term stores, \u201cif they can\u2019t get the rents they want, and it\u2019s a way for the tenant to get comfortable.\u201dSome landlords are offering short term leases while they hunt for higher-paying long-term tenants, giving store owners months free for a limited period, or offering money or a discount on the rent to be used toward building a store.Cases like Milady\u2019s, where an older business closes and then the storefront sits fallow for months or even years, can seem puzzling.But building owners who purchased their properties in recent years with the expectation that rents could only continue to rise may be in a bind. To secure financing, they would have to project a certain level of income, and if they accept less than that, they run the risk of being in default, or having their lender require them to put more equity into the building. At some point, Mr. LaPierre said, those owners will lose their buildings or have to find a partner willing to invest money in the property.\u201cWe\u2019d been asking ourselves, when is this bubble going to burst?\u201d said Sean Sweeney, a SoHo resident since the 1980s and a leader of the SoHo Alliance, a group of residents and longtime shop owners who want to preserve their vision of SoHo, with its narrow streets, low-scale buildings, artists\u2019 lofts and independent retailers.The Alliance, along with the Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer, have pushed the city to enforce the special zoning restrictions in SoHo, like the one that limits the size of stores to no more than 10,000 square feet, which would rule out many of the big national chains. Mr. Sweeney bemoaned the fact that Broadway now looks more like an open-air mall than the home to cutting edge designers and boutiques.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing creative about sneaker stores,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said, a crack at the Nike store. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be known as Herald Square South.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the Untuckit store, it is on Prince Street, not Spring Street, and the storefront identified in a photo caption was occupied by an Old Navy, not a New York Sports Club.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Could Lose $1 Billion in Exports Under U.N. Measure", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States hit North Korea at the United Nations on Friday with a proposed set of unprecedented economic penalties, punctuated by a one-third cut in its export revenue, to punish the isolated country for its missile and nuclear tests.Under North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, the country has boasted of its increasingly sophisticated missiles in rejection of United Nations prohibitions. The North has also threatened to punish the United States and its other perceived foes \u2014 South Korea and Japan \u2014 with a \u201cnuclear sword of justice.\u201dThe American-drafted resolution, which was circulated on Friday to all 15 Security Council members, is scheduled to be put to a vote on Saturday afternoon.It was circulated after American diplomats held extensive discussions about the language with China and Russia, suggesting that the two will back the measure or at least not block it with their veto power.Support for the draft resolution from China, North Korea\u2019s most important trading partner, is considered critical. If achieved, it will partly reflect what diplomats have called China\u2019s waning tolerance for Mr. Kim\u2019s belligerent behavior.The draft resolution, which needs at least nine yes votes for approval, would be the most punitive of any resolution over the past 11 years aimed at pressuring North Korea into abandoning its nuclear arms ambitions.A Security Council diplomat told reporters that the draft resolution\u2019s provisions banning North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood would together lop roughly $1 billion from the country\u2019s $3 billion in annual export revenue.The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with protocol, said it was the first time that entire sectors of North Korea\u2019s export economy would be banned. He called it \u201cthe most impactful and expansive set of sanctions to date.\u201dThe draft resolution, which \u201ccondemns in the strongest terms\u201d the July 4 and July 28 missile tests, would also place new limits on North Korea\u2019s joint ventures and Foreign Trade Bank, and prohibit the country from sending more workers to overseas jobs \u2014 another important source of revenue for the impoverished nation of 25 million people.Nonetheless, the draft resolution did not go nearly as far as what the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, had demanded after the July 4 ballistic missile test.Declaring American exasperation with the ineffectiveness of existing sanctions, Ms. Haley called for cutoffs of North Korea\u2019s access to foreign money and oil for its military. Those steps were not taken.Whether the resolution\u2019s penalties would have much effect on North Korea\u2019s actions is a matter of debate. Despite the country\u2019s longstanding economic isolation, it has repeatedly defied Western-led efforts to change its behavior through sanctions.\u201cThis might be the gradual wringing of the neck of North Korea, but we\u2019ve been down this road many times,\u201d he said. \u201cNorth Korea has always been able to find loopholes.\u201dMr. Tillerson\u2019s outreach was the Trump administration\u2019s first serious attempt at a diplomatic opening to North Korea. His remarks were welcomed by China, which has repeatedly called for calm among all antagonists in the long-running Korean Peninsula crisis.But the United States has sent a mixed message, diplomacy coupled with a display of military strength. It tested its own intercontinental ballistic missile in the South Pacific on Wednesday, within hours of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s remarks. And last weekend, the United States flew two strategic bombers across the Korean Peninsula in a military exercise with South Korea, its ally.Mr. Kim has thus far shown no intention of relinquishing his nuclear arsenal. If anything, he has vowed to strengthen it.American intelligence assessments have generally concluded that the North Korean leader has no incentive to negotiate with the United States until his country emphatically shows that it could arm a missile with a nuclear weapon that could reach the American mainland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Isn\u2019t a Threat to Our Democracy. Hysteria Is.", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "Supported byOpinionSince Donald Trump\u2019s election, the United States has been gripped by tyrannophobia. Conspiracies against democracy are everywhere; truth is under siege; totalitarianism is making a comeback; \u201cresistance\u201d is the last refuge of citizens.The initial fearful reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s election was understandable. He cut a new figure in recent politics. His indefensible slurs against his fellow citizens and offensive plans for the weak were a shock. His frequent breaches of political norms seemed to pose an imminent hazard for democracy. They may have been too chaotic to be truly sinister, but the danger seemed clear and present.A little more than six months into the Trump presidency, though, it now seems clear that the most frightening threats to ordinary politics in the United States are empty or easily contained. Starting with the Trump administration\u2019s original version of the travel ban, the president\u2019s most outrageous policies have been successfully obstructed, leaving largely those that any Republican president would have implemented through executive order. The menace the commander in chief poses to the world, as his impulsive warning to North Korea suggested, may be another matter. But there is no real evidence that Mr. Trump wants to seize power unconstitutionally, and there is no reason to think he could succeed.There is certainly evidence of Russian interference in the election, and the hacking of the Democratic National Committee is serious. But that hardly amounts to a long-term design on American democracy from some kind of fifth column, backed by Moscow\u2019s \u201cAuthoritarian International\u201d and propagated by fake news. Even if it were true that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is attempting an illiberal putsch, he is still far from achieving this goal. Paranoia alone explains why fear that the republic is in imminent danger has been the dominant response.The sky is not falling and no lights are flashing red, but Americans have nonetheless embraced a highly charged, counterproductive way of thinking about politics as a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d between democracy and totalitarianism. The works of Hannah Arendt and George Orwell have risen on the best-seller charts. Every news story produces fear and trembling.History raises serious doubts about how helpful this tyrannophobic focus on catastrophe, fake news and totalitarianism really is in dealing with the rise of the populist right, of which this bumbling hothead of a president is a symptom. Excessive focus on liberal fundamentals, like basic freedoms or the rule of law, could prove self-defeating. By postponing serious efforts to give greater priority to social justice, tyrannophobia treats warning signs as a death sentence, while allowing the real disease to fester.If there is one lesson from the 20th century worth learning, it is that an exclusive focus on the defense of liberal fundamentals against a supposed totalitarian peril often exacerbates the social and international conflicts it seeks to resolve. This approach to politics threatens to widen the already yawning gulf between liberal groups and their opponents, while distracting from the deeply rooted forces that have been fueling right-wing populist politics, notably economic inequalities and status resentments.The anti-communist politics in the United States of the early 1950s were rooted in assumptions that had much in common with those of anti-Trumpism today. There was, it was claimed, a serious risk to liberal democracy from American subversion within, in alliance with the Russians without, peddling seductive untruths. Other goals \u2014 like the creation of a more just and equal society \u2014 had to take second place to the country\u2019s military posture.The absolute priority given to liberal fundamentals also promoted serious misunderstandings of the rest of the world. Capitalism (though not democracy) had to be defended at all costs, while foreigners were commonly viewed as subject to brainwashing, manipulation and mass irrationality \u2014 just what we fear today in the United States itself. And while those assumptions led to terrible mistakes and cost millions of lives in American military interventions, the end of the Cold War only reinforced the tyrannophobic worldview in an even purer form \u2014 now including liberal democracy and even freer markets.The ease with which the Soviet-bloc regimes collapsed seemed to prove that communism had no foundations other than manipulation and repression. Now that the tyrants had been brought down, equality was unimportant and markets could be left to work their magic. Communism in the Eastern bloc was certainly moribund, but the liberals who urged its replacement with market fundamentalism have lessons to learn, not to teach.The rude awakening has been a long time coming, and even now has not fully occurred. The 2008 financial crisis failed to dent the political establishment\u2019s complacency, even though it had become very clear that market-friendly policies were helping to destroy the social mobility and economic opportunity that underpins a well-functioning democracy.And while the shock of the 2016 election caused unprecedented soul-searching, tyrannophobia is blinding many to the real warnings of the election: A dysfunctional economy, not lurking tyranny, is what needs attention if recent electoral choices are to be explained \u2014 and voting patterns are to be changed in the future. Yet there is too little recognition of the need for new direction in either party. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York recently declared that the Democrats have merely failed to get their message across. Many Republicans are convinced that the party can correct its Trumpian aberration by reasserting the status quo ante of free markets and social conservatism. Neither side, it would seem, is ready to depart from its prior consensus.The threat of tyranny can be real enough. But those who act as though democracy is constantly on the precipice are likely to miss the path that leads not simply to fuller justice but to true safety.Samuel Moyn is a professor of law and history at Yale University.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Been Magical. It Can\u2019t Last.", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesSome things just can\u2019t last. The nearly magical stock market that has persisted so valiantly this year is one of them.The stock market has been so placid that declines of a mere 1.5 percent have been treated like real news. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped that much on Thursday. Days like that can be unsettling, but in the span of market history, they amount to the slightest of headaches.The deeper news isn\u2019t immediately visible day to day, but it is this: The stock market has been operating in an extremely rarefied world of heightened calm, one that is unlikely to continue. It is as if, after the election in November, Wall Street entered an enchanted zone. That is bound to end.Several statistical measurements demonstrate how unusual this market environment has been.The most obvious is the bull market\u2019s longevity, fueled largely by the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultralow interest rates and voracious bond buying. The upward trend in stocks already ranks as the second longest in American history since 1900 and the third highest in percentage gains, according to a tally by Bespoke Investment Group. From the trend\u2019s start, in 2009, through its latest high, on Aug. 7, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has risen 267 percent.\u201cIt is difficult to appreciate how unusual 2017 is,\u201d Mr. Mehta said, \u201cor to use the distant past to draw lessons about it.\u201d Clearly, though, neither then nor now, political turmoil had little or no effect on the pervasive calm in the stock market.Mr. Mehta, the former director of research and analytics for the Treasury\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, pointed to several other indicators of uncanny market placidity this year.And despite occasional bursts of market-driven angst, the downturns so far in 2017 have been paltry. Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial, has found that the S.&P. 500 through Friday has not had a 5 percent decline, from peak to trough, since June 28, 2016. That sell-off, 6.1 percent over several days, occurred after Britain\u2019s surprise vote on June 23, 2016, to leave the European Union.Other measurements show the same pattern. For the three weeks through Aug. 10, the closing levels of the S.&P. 500 never had a daily swing of more than 0.3 percent, Mr. Detrick said: \u201cThat never happened before in the history of the S.&P. 500.\u201d And for 2017 so far, the average daily trading range has been 0.55 percent, the lowest ever.\u201cWe have been living in a very unusual world,\u201d Mr. Detrick said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think we are going to stay here for very long.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Mehta said that this stretch of smooth sailing has gone on for so long that it has become statistically improbable. That isn\u2019t a firm prediction of a decline because the future is uncertain. But, he said, it is quite likely that a stock market decline of at least 5 percent \u2014 from peak to trough \u2014 will be coming in the not-too-distant future.\u201cMere reversion to the mean is likely,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. \u201cFrom a probability standpoint, the run we\u2019ve been on is very rare, and it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll return to something more normal relatively soon.\u201dWill there be a downturn big enough to derail the bull market? Of course. But, alas, no one knows when it will happen.In traditional Wall Street parlance, a bull market ends and a bear begins with a drop of 20 percent from the market\u2019s last peak, which happens to have occurred on Aug. 7, when the S.&.P. closed at 2,480.91. The market has dropped 1.9 percent since then. It hasn\u2019t had a 3 percent decline since before the November election, in the longest such streak since 1995, Mr. Detrick said.We are long overdue, he said, adding that he expected \u201ca very healthy decline of 5 percent or more,\u201d which would be \u201ca buying opportunity for people who have stayed out of the stock market.\u201d Stock valuations are stretched, he said, but when you factor in low interest rates and low inflation, current prices are reasonable, in his view.\u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age, they die of excesses,\u201d Mr. Detrick said. And there is no indication, he added, that an end to the market\u2019s long-term rising trend is imminent.One of these days, these various streaks will end. A big stock market decline could well precede and predict a recession. But barring a disastrous geopolitical, economic or financial shock \u2014 there are plenty of possibilities, take your pick \u2014 it is likely that both the bull market and the economic recovery will keep grinding on for a while.But don\u2019t count on it. We are pushing our luck. Even if you believe in magic, the markets rarely stay calm and buoyant for such an exceedingly long time.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Have a Say Over the Subways, From Hundreds of Miles Away", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert G. Ortt is a Republican state senator from the Niagara Falls area who \u201chasn\u2019t had a recent experience with the NYC subway system,\u201d according to an email from his spokeswoman.Joseph A. Griffo, another Republican from upstate New York, who is the deputy majority whip in the State Senate, is not big on the subway when he visits the city. \u201cHe usually either walks or takes an Uber or taxi,\u201d his spokesman explained.The future of the nation\u2019s busiest subway system, which has become engulfed in crisis, could well depend on New York State lawmakers like Mr. Ortt and Mr. Griffo, who live hundreds of miles from the city and do not have day-to-day familiarity with its dilapidated transit infrastructure. But since they have a say over the finances of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, they can influence the lives of millions of subway riders.And in the drama that is state government in New York \u2014 with its complicated relationships between the mayor and the governor, as well as between the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled State Senate \u2014 the Legislature has not always been kind to the needs of the city\u2019s aging public transit system.Either approach would require the Legislature\u2019s approval, and winning passage would be difficult, if not impossible. The Senate has been particularly averse to imposing any new taxes or fees that would flow directly to the city.\u201cThe political dynamics of the State Senate have allowed New York City to be consistently outmaneuvered,\u201d said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor at New York University and the director of its Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management.\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of the upstate legislators treating New York City as if it was a wayward, profligate political entity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is just the reverse \u2014 upstate gets a disproportionate amount of attention and resources, given its half-century of economic decline, and that\u2019s hurt the New York metropolitan area, which is driving the state\u2019s economy.\u201dThe New York Times contacted the remaining 37 about when they last visited New York City and whether they took the subway during the trip. Eleven replied.Among them was Carl Marcellino, a Republican from Long Island, who said the subway was generally \u201ca good way to go,\u201d although he did not take it on his last trip to the city, after the birth of a grandchild about a month ago. He said he rode the Long Island Rail Road to Pennsylvania Station and then took a taxi to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center on the Upper East Side.He said he opposed both the millionaires\u2019 tax and congestion pricing. Of the mayor and the governor, he said, \u201cThey should come together and stop playing silly games.\u201dBut it is not just Republicans in the State Senate who are not regular riders. David J. Valesky, a Democrat who represents part of the Syracuse area, said through a spokeswoman that it had been several years since he had taken the subway.George Latimer, a Democrat from Westchester, said he usually travels to Manhattan a couple of times a month. The last time, on July 31, he took the subway, but said he prefers to walk when he can. He also said he was wary of raising taxes, given the property taxes that Westchester residents already pay.The mayor\u2019s proposed tax would raise about $700 million a year, with nearly three-fourths going toward capital costs for new subway cars and $250 million funding half-price fares for low-income riders, a plan that is gaining momentum among some lawmakers. City officials estimated that about 32,000 people earn enough to be subject to the new tax.Mr. Cuomo argues that the severity of the subway system\u2019s problems has shifted both the political landscape and public opinion and has made congestion pricing \u201can idea whose time has come.\u201d But Mr. de Blasio said last week that he \u201cdoes not believe\u201d in the proposal.\u201cI\u2019ve never been in favor of this strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an example of it that I thought was fair.\u201dIt was another governor who wrested control of the subways from the city: Nelson A. Rockefeller, in the 1960s. In the process, he displaced Robert Moses, who had shaped the physical and political landscape in New York for generations and whose many titles had included chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The authority had a large amount of surplus cash on hand. Rockefeller and William J. Ronan, whom Rockefeller named to run the new Metropolitan Transportation Authority, wanted to use money from the bridge-toll surplus to avoid a subway fare increase.\u201cThe city was pleased to shed the responsibility for operating and financing the transit system,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Peter W. Herman, who later became chairman of the Regional Plan Association, wrote in an article in 1970 for a law review journal that the creation of the transportation agency was \u201ccertainly a high-water mark in outside control over what was once a municipally owned and operated transit system.\u201dMr. Herman, who stepped down as chairman of the planning group in 2010, was asked recently if the city\u2019s transportation system was at the mercy of upstate lawmakers, Mr. Herman said, \u201cIt absolutely is, and always has been.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why a Republican legislature is so ignorant or selfish,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cMaybe, that they don\u2019t understand the economy of the entire state will be harmed if New York City\u2019s own economy is harmed.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the future of the New York City subway misidentified the person who said that \u201cthe city was pleased to shed the responsibility for operating and financing the transit system.\u201d The comment was by Mitchell L. Moss, a professor at New York University \u2014 not by Robert Moses, the noted New York City builder. (Mr. Moses died in 1981.)Advertisement"}

With more than two million visitors descending on the Alhambra, a Unesco World Heritage site, every year, the city\u2019s tourism industry had settled into a somewhat formulaic routine of shuttling visitors in and out of the city in about 24 hours. But recently some other ancient structures have been restored, and the region\u2019s distinctive gastronomy has come into its own. The city that was home to the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, the painter Jos\u00e9 Guerrero and the composer Manuel de Falla has deep cultural roots, but now a new crop of small foundations and independent exhibition spaces has revived its arty buzz.

{"Headline": "The Benefits of Standing by the President", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe heaped praise on Jared Kushner at a private gathering of bankers and corporate executives in December, congratulating President Trump\u2019s son-in-law on the surprise election triumph.He stood up again in May before a group of corporate leaders on the 39th floor of Citigroup\u2019s offices to remind them of all the good the Trump administration could do for the economy and the country.And at a meeting on Monday with his employees, as Mr. Trump\u2019s support in corporate America began to crumble over remarks about white nationalists, he condemned the violence in Charlottesville, Va., but not the president\u2019s response to it. By week\u2019s end, a rebellion among corporate leaders led to the disbanding of business advisory councils to the president.Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant Blackstone and the leader of one of the councils, has not been alone on Wall Street in his embrace of the Trump presidency, particularly after the corporate world endured eight years of Obama-era regulation. But in each of these private meetings, recounted by people who attended them, Mr. Schwarzman emerged as one of the president\u2019s most respected and reliable allies in high finance.People close to Mr. Schwarzman say he does not view himself as a member of the president\u2019s inner circle, but rather as an independent businessman who gives the White House advice on trade and the economy.In May, while the president was visiting Saudi Arabia, Blackstone announced the agreement to manage the fund, the largest in the world to invest in infrastructure projects. The announcement was made at the royal palace in Riyadh as Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner looked on.Blackstone has noted that it has a long-running relationship with Saudi Arabia, which had invested in Blackstone before, and said Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s support for the president had nothing to do with the infrastructure deal, which it believes would have happened regardless of who was president. The agreement was the \u201cculmination of a year\u2019s discussions\u201d with the Saudis that began during the Obama administration, the company said.Still, interviews with four people briefed on the deal revealed that the Saudis had been discussing a possible partnership with a number of other firms as well, and formally decided on Blackstone \u2014 a fund-raising juggernaut that manages funds larger than the economies of some nations \u2014 only after Mr. Schwarzman had started advising the president.In addition to Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s prominence, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund was drawn to the firm\u2019s record of generating huge investment returns and building new business lines, from real estate to hedge funds, according to the people with knowledge of the deal.There is no suggestion that Blackstone did anything wrong. Instead, the company\u2019s experience illustrates the incentives that corporate leaders have to develop strong ties with Mr. Trump \u2014 the country\u2019s businessman in chief \u2014 and the reputational risks associated with those relationships when Mr. Trump veers off course, as he did this past week.\u201cPublic service is a core value for people of my generation,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to be asked to help the country \u2014 even if it occasionally comes with some degree of criticism.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia pushed the Blackstone deal forward so that it could be announced while the president was there, two people briefed on the agreement said. And the new fund, which plans to invest in projects like aging bridges and roads primarily in the United States, is expected to benefit from any federal infrastructure plan that may materialize under the Trump administration.A Blackstone spokeswoman said that while a federal plan \u201cwould be helpful, our business is not at all dependent upon it since state and local governments \u2014 which build the vast majority of projects \u2014 are already pursuing billions of dollars in public-private partnerships.\u201dSome of the other investment firms that were in discussions about a Saudi partnership, including Brookfield and the Carlyle Group, had more experience in managing infrastructure funds and are still in talks with the Saudis according to the people who were not authorized to speak about a private deal.But the Saudi sovereign wealth fund saw that as a benefit for Blackstone: Without its own infrastructure fund, the company would have the flexibility to build one from scratch to the liking of the Saudis. Blackstone, which has invested in infrastructure projects but does not have a stand-alone fund, is expected to raise at least another $20 billion for the Saudi fund.Other deals involving chief executives with ties to Mr. Trump were announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia.In all, there were more than 40 signed agreements between Saudi Arabia and largely American corporations, including General Electric and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin. The deal signings, which Mr. Trump said were valued at nearly $400 billion, came on the same day that about 50 chief executives from the United States and Saudi Arabia had gathered at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh to discuss business opportunities.It is routine for the Commerce Department to advocate American companies \u2014 and for trade missions to lead to the signing of partnerships \u2014 but the scale of the Saudi event was unusual compared with previous United States-Saudi gatherings, according to people who attended.The Saudi sovereign wealth fund did not respond to requests for comment.While Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s support for the president caused a public relations headache for Blackstone this past week, friends say he is not the type of corporate leader to express regrets about taking on a prominent role in Washington.\u201cSteve Schwarzman is not a person who second guesses himself, and I don\u2019t believe anything catches him off guard,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group focused on economic policy.Ms. Wylde said she had spoken this month with Mr. Schwarzman, who is co-chairman of the group\u2019s board, and found him to be in good spirits. \u201cHe was speaking from a position of strength,\u201d she said.Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Trump are hardly old friends.Mr. Schwarzman, a Republican billionaire, did not support Mr. Trump during the election and gave no contributions to his campaign. Two of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s top deputies at Blackstone are big Democratic donors.But while Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s alliance with Mr. Trump is new, his ties to Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, run deeper. Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, attended Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 70th birthday party in February at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., near Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.In 2013, well before Mr. Trump was even a candidate, Blackstone financed the purchase of a few warehouses and industrial buildings by Mr. Kushner\u2019s family company, according to a person briefed on the transaction.Blackstone also made a loan, which has since been paid off, to Kushner Companies on a Rector Street property in Manhattan. And last summer, an entity controlled by Blackstone lent $376 million to Mr. Kushner\u2019s company to purchase a large property in Brooklyn that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had operated for many years, real estate records show.Mr. Kushner is also friendly with Jon Gray, a senior Blackstone executive who runs its real estate business. (Blackstone is the largest commercial real estate investor in the world.)Mr. Kushner and Mr. Gray, a Democrat, have been photographed together at Manhattan social events, and before the election, Mr. Kushner urged the staff at the Commercial Observer newspaper, which Mr. Kushner used to run, to place Mr. Gray higher on its list of \u201cPower 100\u201d real estate executives, according to a former employee with knowledge of the list. In 2016, Mr. Gray was No. 1 on that list.Blackstone said it had no knowledge of efforts to influence the ranking, but Mr. Gray often lands at the top of lists of leading players in real estate.Separately, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump invested up to $500,000 in a fund that Blackstone manages. The couple is now in the process of divesting, according to the couple\u2019s financial disclosure. Blackstone declined to comment on specific investors, but a spokeswoman noted that the firm had thousands of investors across its many funds.Shortly after the election, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Schwarzman to lead the Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of executives from big banks and other companies that would advise the president on economic issues. The group met only twice before being disbanded this past week in the wake of the president\u2019s comments about Charlottesville.In those two meetings, the group discussed issues important to business like infrastructure and regulations. Within hours of the first meeting in February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to roll back Obama-era financial rules.Weeks after the group met in April, Mr. Schwarzman addressed the board of the Partnership for New York City. He made a case that Mr. Trump was good for business and in turn the country, according to two people who attended. Unlike many people in Washington, Mr. Schwarzman said, Mr. Trump could accomplish tax policy reform and an infrastructure overhaul.Blackstone manages about $370 billion. But the private equity firm is always on the hunt for more \u2014 and Saudi Arabia was ripe for the picking.The kingdom has been looking to diversify its economy beyond fossil fuels and to make investments in other areas like tech and infrastructure.Last year, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund began soliciting bids from multiple investment firms to manage an infrastructure fund, according to two people briefed on the matter. Blackstone and other American asset managers were among those to have discussions with the kingdom, the people said.In May 2016, Mr. Schwarzman flew to Riyadh to speak with Mohammed bin Salman, then the deputy crown prince of the Saudi royal family. The prince, who has since ascended to become first in line to the throne, was overseeing the sovereign wealth fund, known as the public investment fund. Mr. Schwarzman and the prince met again about a month later in New York, in part to discuss infrastructure, a person briefed on the meeting said.It was not until months later that the selection process formally gained momentum \u2014 and by then, a lot had changed. The newly elected Trump administration signaled that its policies, particularly the president\u2019s hard line against Iran, would be more amenable to the Saudis than President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda for the region.In March, the Saudis hired an American adviser to help vet the investment firms vying for the infrastructure deal. By April, Blackstone stood out as the winner, a person briefed on the deal said. (Some of the other firms are still discussing other infrastructure projects with the kingdom.)The timeline for announcing the infrastructure fund manager was suddenly accelerated when the White House said in early May that Mr. Trump would make Saudi Arabia the destination of his first foreign trip as president.It was a big moment for the kingdom. After years of complex relations with Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump offered the Saudis a more straightforward alliance.\u201cThey felt they could do business with the Trump administration without any real focus on thorny issues such as human rights or questions of governance that have complicated bilateral ties with other presidencies in the past,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.The Saudis scrambled to put together a business meeting on the same weekend as Mr. Trump\u2019s visit \u2014 when the world\u2019s news media would be glued to the new president\u2019s first foreign trip.Dow Chemical\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Liveris, worked with the Saudis to organize a meeting that would showcase the country\u2019s many opportunities for global businesses.By then, Blackstone was exchanging formal documents with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. But if it wanted the infrastructure deal to proceed, Blackstone had to agree to a nonbinding version of the deal in time for the president\u2019s visit.Dozens of chief executives from across the United States faced pressure over the meeting. Some of them, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they had felt they had no choice but to go if they wanted to do business in Saudi Arabia. One executive said that he had planned to send a subordinate, but that an event organizer had told him that he should attend.The guest list included an oil executive, defense contractors and a college president. Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, was also at the meeting. In April, his bank had received a capital markets license in Saudi Arabia that would allow it do more business there, after being frozen out for many years.Mr. Schwarzman and other American executives had joined Mr. Dmitriev\u2019s international advisory board seven years earlier, but most resigned after Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Crimea.The celebration in Saudi Arabia stretched throughout the weekend, highlighted by a lunch at the royal palace and a dinner at the home of Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, the fund that is working with Blackstone, according to people who attended the dinner.The day after the deals were announced, Mr. Trump gave a speech, thanking the Saudis for their hospitality and their willingness to cooperate on terrorism and business matters.The president also called the deals that Americans companies had struck \u201cblessed news.\u201dReporting was contributed by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Jesse Drucker, Susanne Craig and Sharon LaFraniere.

{"Headline": "Countering West Coast Pull, by Helping Finance Start-Ups Sell in New York", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jeff Bezos, then a New York hedge fund employee, decided to start Amazon in 1994, he quickly moved to the West Coast. So did Mark Zuckerberg, who moved from Harvard to California in 2004 to find the technology talent and financing needed to build up Facebook.Today, the West Coast exerts a similar tidal pull for start-up companies in finance. Nine of the 15 United States financial technology \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 companies worth $1 billion or more, as tracked by CB Insights \u2014 are in the San Francisco area. These Bay Area companies, which are not public, include the online payments processor Stripe, the online lender Social Finance and the finance website Credit Karma.For the last seven years, a New York business-backed program \u2014 the FinTech Innovation Lab \u2014 has been working to stem that West Coast tide by helping financial services start-ups sell their services in New York in an industry where the city clearly dominates: big banks and other finance companies.The program\u2019s backers include Henry Kravis, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Fred Wilson, a co-founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures; and James D. Robinson III, a former chief executive of American Express.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason New York should not be the fintech capital of the world,\u201d said another program backer, the internet entrepreneur Kevin Ryan. He is a former chief executive of the online advertising pioneer DoubleClick and a founder of the flash-sale platform Gilt Groupe and the business news website Business Insider.The term \u201cfintech\u201d covers a group of start-ups, often funded by venture capital investors, that aim to apply new technology in areas like online lending, investing and payments. These start-ups have surged in popularity among investors as banks have had to focus on complying with regulations and rebuilding capital.The FinTech Innovation Lab is a so-called accelerator that annually gives a half-dozen start-ups the chance to interact with top financial firms, hone their products and learn how they can fit into what Accenture, a management consultant, estimated was a $270 billion technology budget for banks worldwide.Tim Estes, the president of Digital Reasoning in Nashville, which uses artificial intelligence to spot compliance and reputational risks for banks in routine employee emails, said that going through the lab program in 2012 was \u201ctransformative for the company, opening up doors across Wall Street as advertised.\u201dAs Digital Reasoning won business from Wall Street, it opened a New York office near Union Square, which now has about 30 employees and is the firm\u2019s second-largest office. Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse Group have become investors.Mr. Estes said Goldman was an early customer, two years after the investment bank\u2019s chief executive was attacked in televised congressional hearings over a subprime debt sale that one Goldman staff member had described in an email as a bad deal. As firms like Goldman realized other such \u201ctime bombs\u201d might be in their email files, \u201ceveryone wanted a better bomb detector,\u201d Mr. Estes said.Another start-up that won business through the lab, in 2012, was True Office, which turns compliance training into a game experience for employees. Adam Sodowick, the chief executive of True Office, had first met Maria Gotsch, a lab co-founder, at a dinner event at a Flatiron district loft. Morgan Stanley signed as a client and invested in True Office, which eventually moved its headquarters from Boston to New York and was acquired in 2014 by the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange resold it this year.The best-known firm to go through the program, in 2015, was the blockchain start-up Digital Asset, shortly after it recruited Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase derivatives pioneer, as its chief executive. Accenture soon invested in the company, which aims to improve Wall Street trade processing.The New York lab is one of hundreds of incubators and accelerators that have sprung up throughout the country to help start-ups, such as Y Combinator in Mountain View, Calif; Techstars in Boulder, Colo.; and Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, Calif. Though many programs require start-ups to give them an equity stake of 5 percent or more, the New York lab gets only 0.5 percent.The lab began in 2010 as a way to bolster the New York City economy after the 2008 financial crisis. It is co-sponsored by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City, an arm of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City \u2014 a business-backed civic group formed in 1979 by David Rockefeller.The lab is designed for companies that want to become partners with big financial institutions, rather than compete with them. One goal, said Mr. Robinson, an investor at RRE Ventures since 1994, is to \u201cexpose the big banks and insurers to early-stage companies doing interesting things in this area.\u201dJean Donnelly, the executive director of the Boston accelerator FinTech Sandbox, said, \u201cNew York has come up pretty quickly as No. 2\u201d behind Silicon Valley in fintech venture investments.Accenture says data from CB Insights indicates that Silicon Valley\u2019s lead in fintech debt and equity financing has narrowed. In 2012, the gap was 4.5 to 1, as valley fintechs raised $1 billion against $225 million for New York fintechs. In 2016, the gap was just 1.1 to 1, with $2.65 billion for Silicon Valley and $2.41 billion for New York.Some West Coast venture investors acknowledged the city\u2019s progress. The gap between Silicon Valley and New York has narrowed, said Pat Grady, a partner who focuses on fintech at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif.But he added: \u201cIf you want to build the next Apple or Airbnb, you come to Silicon Valley. The unmatched talent, risk-taking culture and relentless optimism mean that you have a better chance of outsized success here than anywhere else in the world.\u201dNew York can be fertile ground for \u201cbusiness to business\u201d start-ups selling to banks, Mr. Grady said. But some of the largest United States fintechs, like Social Finance and Credit Karma, cater directly to consumers and have potentially larger markets, he said.So how does the FinTech Innovation Lab work?Every year, the staff and a sponsor committee choose 20 to 25 start-ups from more than 100 applicants to meet with about 35 banks and other sponsoring institutions. The sponsors, in turn, collectively choose six to eight winners for the three-month program.Banks that once had to be \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d to participate in the lab are now waiting in line to check out the start-ups, said Matt Harris, a partner in Bain Capital Ventures. Lately, out-of-town banks like KeyBank in Cleveland and U.S. Bank in Minneapolis have joined.Companies selected to participate this year included Cutting Edge, Nova Credit and BehavioSec. Cutting Edge, a cybersecurity firm, helps protect customers\u2019 locations and identities on the internet. Nova Credit processes and provides credit data from foreign institutions on individuals so banks can lend more readily to immigrants. BehavioSec helps confirm customer identities by analyzing how they type, click and swipe on their devices.The lab featured 19 events over three months, including meetings with Mr. Kravis and James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Kravis stressed the importance of company culture, and Mr. Gorman fielded questions about Wall Street\u2019s use of artificial intelligence and how investment banks do business with start-ups. There was also a practice pitch session at the office of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.This year\u2019s lab culminated with a Demo Day on June 22 at a packed 215-seat auditorium at Bank of America\u2019s New York office. Each entrepreneur was introduced by a Wall Street mentor and then gave a brief pitch for his business.Mr. Robinson and other venture investors strolled a hall with exhibit tables for each start-up. David Reilly, a senior technology executive at Bank of America, said the program was useful because big banks \u201ccan be exceptionally difficult to sell to.\u201dStill, none of the three New York fintechs that raised the most financing in 2016 were alumni of the FinTech Innovation Lab, according to the Accenture data.In one of last year\u2019s largest New York financings, Oscar Health Insurance, the lone New York fintech unicorn on the CB Insights list, raised $400 million. Oscar was co-founded by Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and backed by the younger Mr. Kushner\u2019s Thrive Capital.Other New York fintechs that raised the most money in 2016 included the online student lender CommonBond, which raised $612.5 million, and Payoneer, a global payments platform, which raised $180 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron Takes On France\u2019s Labor Code, 100 Years in the Making", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 It is a mind-numbing 3,324 pages long and growing. Of those, 170 pages govern firings, 420 regulate health and security, 50 temporary work and 85 collective negotiations. Hundreds more are devoted to wages, specific industries and overseas departments.It is France\u2019s infamous, almost indecipherable labor code, the Code du Travail, both revered and reviled. Unions hold its protections sacred. Employers blame it for making it expensive to hire new workers and difficult \u2014 and even more costly \u2014 to fire them.France\u2019s energetic young president, Emmanuel Macron, has made lightening the code \u2014 a touchstone of French economic life for over a century \u2014 the centerpiece of his promise to revitalize the economy. He wants to have his changes in place by September.A former investment banker sympathetic to business, Mr. Macron is aiming for nothing less than to remake French capitalism. His success or failure may be the single most important test of his mission to renew France.The code is regarded by many as the wellspring of the country\u2019s malaise and the chief obstacle to generating jobs, leaving the country with an unemployment rate that hovers persistently around 10 percent.But changing it is no easy task. Every such fundamental economic reform in France for at least the last quarter-century has foundered in the streets of Paris, overwhelmed by sometimes violent union demonstrations. Already, Mr. Macron\u2019s ambition to roll back worker protections has helped dent his approval ratings.Unions, now in contentious negotiation with Mr. Macron\u2019s government over the details, have not misunderstood what is at stake.Mr. Martinez promised antigovernment demonstrations for Sept. 12, after the return from summer holidays. \u201cThe workers have got to react,\u201d he said.But Mr. Macron might be the one to break the mold.Already the Parliament, controlled by representatives of his own political movement, has voted to let the president pass the reforms by ordinance, a shortcut past parliamentary debate and amendment. Once the details are worked out \u2014 and assuming France\u2019s administrative high court signs off \u2014 the reforms become law.It would be a major departure for France. For now, the labor code is so complex, and violating it is so risky, that many French employers keep it in a separate room and speak of it with awe. Only specialists, on their staff or outside it, are allowed to consult the oracle, they say.Mr. Macron has set in motion a reform that, if it passes, would effectively keep the thick red book locked in its room, gathering dust.The Macron changes would help employers set the rules on hiring and firing, ignore the crippling restraints in the code that discourage taking on new workers, and limit unions\u2019 ability to get in the way. Instead, individual agreements would be negotiated at the company or industry level between bosses and workers.Mr. Macron\u2019s labor minister, Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, made the government\u2019s intentions clear as she introduced the bill allowing Mr. Macron to act.\u201cThe company itself is the space where the creation of social standards\u201d \u2014 the protections, rights and obligations of workers \u2014 \u201cmost efficiently fulfills the specific needs of workers and companies, in the construction of the best compromise, closest to the ground,\u201d she said.The goal, she declared, is \u201cto renew the French social model.\u201dThat notion, unremarkable in the Anglo-Saxon world, represents a seismic shift in France. Every aspect of worker-employer relations will now be on the table.The long epoch of the Jacobin, the centralizing and controlling hand of Paris in the grit of France\u2019s economic life \u2014 present since the Napoleonic era \u2014 will be unraveled if Mr. Macron gets his way.That hyper-regulation of much of French life, including labor, was formed in the early 19th century as part of the country\u2019s escape from the chaos of the French Revolution.\u201cThe emerging law,\u201d a prominent Socialist wrote triumphantly in 1903, seven years before the birth of the labor code, \u201cis a Socialist law.\u201dIndeed, at the heart of the code\u2019s language is the notion that the worker is inevitably an exploitable object needing blanket protection from rapacious capitalist predators.Over time, that idea has been woven into the fabric of the society and economy. Even today, St\u00e9phane Sirot, a labor historian, said, \u201cIt is the state that makes the law.\u201dBut if Mr. Macron prevails, the historic French opposition, even hatred, between worker and employer that is enshrined in the code will no longer be the guiding philosophy in labor relations.\u201cThis will make the French labor market more flexible, and allow companies to adapt,\u201d said Gilbert Cette, an economist at the University of Aix-en-Provence who was Mr. Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my\u2019s co-author.That is not the case today. For now, a company with 48 workers hesitates to go to 50, even if orders are expanding. Two more workers bring with them a host of new obligations under current law.Those include structured negotiations with unions and workers and onerous new taxes. These barriers have become known as France\u2019s infamous \u201csocial ceilings.\u201d\u201cThere is a discouragement, for sure, on the hiring of new people,\u201d said Catherine Guerniou, who owns a small window-making company in the Paris suburbs.\u201cThe ceilings are a barrier,\u201d she said. \u201cSure, we\u2019d like to grow,\u201d expanding from the eight she now employs. \u201cBut I\u2019m scared. There are so many constraints.\u201dWith the philosophical shift proposed by Mr. Macron, those constraints could disappear. \u201cThe actors themselves would work out the agreements,\u201d Mr. Cette said. \u201cThey become the authors.\u201dThe unions are wary. Not least, under Mr. Macron\u2019s proposals, labor courts \u2014 institutions going back to Napoleon and 1806 \u2014 could lose much of their power.They tilt heavily in favor of labor, and at their discretion can award big payouts to workers who are dismissed. Those penalties have become among the chief disincentives to new hires.On a recent afternoon at the austere glass-fronted labor court headquarters in the north of Paris, a lawyer for one union plainly acknowledged that the workers he represented had quit after being burned out from grueling workdays.He nonetheless asked the panel of judges to recast the resignations as a firing \u2014 and hand them tens of thousands of euros in indemnities.The request would be unthinkable in the United States, labor experts said, but in France the judges hardly blinked and appeared sympathetic.Pierre Kuchly, a maker of industrial valves outside Paris, has been condemned by a labor board for wrongful firing. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve done it right, but then you have to pay,\u201d he said.With a growing international business, he would like to add to his staff of 30. \u201cObviously, I hesitate to hire. If you want to separate from someone, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to let people go without creating problems,\u201d he said. The code is not a help. \u201cIt\u2019s so complex, I don\u2019t even look at it,\u201d Mr. Kuchly said.The language of the code itself is extraordinarily mystifying, even in the judgment of experts. One passage in the section on firing states:\u201cIf, in the case of the definitive and total closing of the company, the judge cannot, without being unaware of the autonomy of this reason for the firing, deduce the fault or the blameworthy frivolity from the sole absence of economic difficulties, or, in the contrary case, deduce the absence of fault from the existence of such difficulties, it is not forbidden to him to take into account the economic situation of the company in order to evaluate the conduct of the employer.\u201dAnd also that a shuttered company\u2019s profits don\u2019t necessarily point to an employer\u2019s guilt.The hazards embedded in that complexity scare employers into paralysis, experts and employers themselves say.\u201cWe are in permanent fear of facing a Code du Travail that is more and more complex, of always having one more obligation,\u201d said Ms. Guerniou, the window maker.Recently, she hired a temporary worker to help with a surge in orders, intending to make the person full time. But then she decided against it.\u201cWe felt that it was someone who really knew the Code du Travail,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had caused problems at the SNCF,\u201d the French state railroad, \u201c\u2018You owe me this, you owe me that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Guerniou said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone too far.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home Health Care: Shouldn\u2019t It Be Work Worth Doing?", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAnd that\u2019s if you are lucky. If you live in rural America, you may already have a hard time finding somebody to look after you. Paul Osterman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management calculates that if nothing is done to draw more workers into the field, there will be a shortage of at least 350,000 paid care providers by 2040.This, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree, makes little sense.And yet despite their critical importance to the well-being of tens of millions of aging Americans, one-fourth of these aides live in poverty. The jobs are so unappealing that it is hard to keep workers in them: four in 10 leave the occupation entirely within a year. Many prefer the fast-food business.\u201cHome care is absolutely the bottom rung on the ladder, but home-care workers are the people that spend the most time with the client,\u201d said Adria Powell, who runs Cooperative Home Care Associates, a worker-owned long-term-care agency in New York.As President Trump promises to recover the jobs of an ancestral age populated by well-paid coal miners, steelworkers and assemblers of air-conditioners, he is missing one of the most critical challenges of the American work force: transforming long-term care into a higher-quality, better-paid job that could support the middle class of the future.There are a few reasons long-term care is such a bad job. \u201cMost people see it as glorified babysitting,\u201d said Robert Espinoza, vice president for policy at PHI, an advocacy group for personal care workers that also develops advanced training curriculums to improve the quality of the work force.The fact that most workers are immigrant women does not help the occupation\u2019s status. Occupational rules that reserve even simple tasks for nurses, like delivering an insulin shot or even putting drops into a patient\u2019s eye, also act as a barrier against providing care workers with better training.But perhaps the most important barrier is the government\u2019s budget: Medicaid \u2014 funded by federal and state governments \u2014 picks up more than half the tab for the $300 billion or so spent every year on long-term care.States spend about $200 billion of their own funds on Medicaid. It is the second-biggest item on their budget, after education. To raise reimbursement rates for long-term care agencies, they would have to find the money elsewhere.Still, Professor Osterman points out that shortchanging long-term care is shortsighted. Home health aides trained to do more \u2014 to spot patients\u2019 health problems, to keep track of their pills and doctors\u2019 appointments and to offer advice on healthy living \u2014 could wring billions of dollars in savings from the health care system.Better-trained aides could help patients manage chronic conditions like obesity and diabetes. They could also help manage the transition out of a hospital, ensuring that patients took their medication and followed up with the doctor, to prevent them from having a relapse or ending up in a nursing home.Marisol Rivera offers a glimpse at how this could be done. After 16 years as an aide for Cooperative Home Care Associates, she was promoted to senior aide, assisting less-experienced aides in the field. She reminds them how to use the Hoyer lift to get patients out of bed and into their wheelchair. She keeps tabs on hospital discharge papers to make sure patients \u2014 which the firm calls members \u2014 make their next doctor\u2019s appointment. \u201cMost of time the reason members go back to hospital is because they don\u2019t check back with the doctor,\u201d Ms. Rivera said.Ms. Rivera offers some hope for the profession. Her hourly wage went from $11 to more than $15. Still, her situation is rare. Worker-owned Cooperative Home Care Associates has only two senior aides like her. What\u2019s more, she says, \u201cI still live week by week.\u201dChanging the system of long-term care, to give more responsibilities to better-trained, higher-paid aides will not be easy. For starters, there is the awkward question of the distribution of costs and benefits. Medicaid pays for most long-term care, but Medicare would reap most of the potential cost savings from things like fewer hospital readmissions.Then there are the powerful nursing unions, ready to fight tooth and nail to keep aides from encroaching on their turf. Carol Raphael, former chief executive of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, the largest home health agency in the United States, told Professor Osterman that when the association tried to expand the role of home-care aides, the \u201cnurses went bonkers.\u201dEven advocates for older Americans have lobbied against tighter rules covering things like training for long-term care workers. Many of them also opposed covering aides under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as states facing overtime payments might cap the workweek for aides at 40 hours. If a relative were caring for you and the government said that she could work for only 40 hours, how would you get more hours if you needed them?Still, overhauling long-term care seems within reach. Penalties for excessive readmissions are already encouraging hospitals to rethink the role of home-care aides. And Obamacare is changing the health care industry in ways that would support a better-trained, better-paid home-care work force, pushing providers to manage the overall health of patients rather than offer health services for a fee.\u201cThere is a light bulb that is sort of going off,\u201d Ms. Powell said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we figure out how to leverage this work force and invest in this work force to reduce hospitalization, to reduce E.R. visits, to manage chronic diseases that are so expensive?\u201dThis is encouraging the formation of health teams, in which long-term-care aides \u2014 who are cheaper than doctors or nurses \u2014 could have a larger role in managing patients\u2019 well-being.You might think of it in terms of demographics. By 2040, there will be more than 50 million disabled people in the United States needing some form of long-term care, 12 million more than today. Most will be cared for by family members, but the demand for care workers will explode.It makes sense for these workers to be better trained and empowered to offer better care. If nothing is done to improve the quality of their jobs, many will go unfilled \u2014 losing the competition for workers with McDonald\u2019s.In the end, the issue is not just who will care for you when you are old and frail. The broader issue is what American society will look like then. Because these are the jobs of America\u2019s future.

Mrs. Clinton was in the middle of her first political campaign, running to be New York\u2019s junior senator.Donald J. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were on good terms back then. He donated money to her candidacy and called her \u201ctough and smart.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Trump was skilled in the art of spinning his associations with celebrities into publicity.This was particularly true at Trump Tower.Johnny Carson, Liberace and Paul Anka had condominiums there in the 1980s, and Michael Jackson rented one in the 1990s. In 2000, Bruce Willis closed on a place too.Pre-opening reports of Prince Charles and Princess Diana moving in turned out to be false, but that didn\u2019t stop Mr. Trump from using them to his advantage. The \u201csale that never occurred,\u201d as Mr. Trump called it in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d was \u201cthe one that most helped Trump Tower.\u201dThe completion of a grand tower in Midtown\u2019s high-end retail district cemented Mr. Trump\u2019s status as a force to be reckoned with in New York while also setting him apart from his father, the developer Fred C. Trump, who made his fortune with an empire of middle-class housing units in boroughs outside Manhattan.Then Mr. Trump went to the nearby Olympic Tower for a dinner held by the Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, encountered a living room bigger than his own and decided to remodel.By the time Trump Tower opened, more than half the building\u2019s condominium units had been sold, and all but a small percentage would be gone within the next few years. Paul Goldberger, then The Times\u2019s architecture critic, whom Mr. Trump had once called \u201can idiot,\u201d sounded amazed by how much he actually liked it.\u201cIf overbearing publicity and overdressed guards do not a good building make, neither do they a good building deny,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTrump Tower,\u201d he added, \u201cis turning out to be a much more positive addition to the cityscape than the architectural oddsmakers would have had it.\u201dFew residents garnered as much publicity for the building as Michael Jackson, who for 10 months around 1994 rented a duplex apartment near the top and turned one of the bedrooms into a mirrored dance studio.Mr. Trump made Mr. Jackson\u2019s acquaintance in 1988, when he attended a Madison Square Garden concert that was part of the singer\u2019s tour in support of his \u201cBad\u201d album. After the show, he made a backstage visit.In 1990, Mr. Trump persuaded Mr. Jackson to show up at the opening of the Trump Taj Majal in Atlantic City, parading him in front of camera crews and reporters. The next day, Mr. Jackson\u2019s friend Ryan White died of AIDS, and the developer accompanied him on a visit to the grieving family in Indianapolis, bringing along a journalist to document the deed.After Mr. Jackson moved into his Trump Tower apartment, Mr. Trump took him to a low-key dinner at Le Cirque. \u201cThere was no entourage, no posse,\u201d said Mario Wainer, the restaurant\u2019s longtime ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel. \u201cHe came as a guest of Mr. Trump, and that was it.\u201dMr. Jackson barely touched his risotto, Mr. Wainer recalled, and Mr. Trump had fish and drank no alcohol.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s feuds with celebrities such as Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Snoop Dogg, it may not come as a surprise that some of his relationships with well-known tenants ended poorly.A few years later, Mr. Trump traded insults with the singer and actress Pia Zadora during a dispute with her husband, the dime-store magnate Meshulam Riklis, who rented office space in the building.Later, when Ms. Zadora heard Mr. Trump using similar language in his feuds with Megyn Kelly and Ms. O\u2019Donnell, she realized \u2014 as she said in an interview last week \u2014 \u201cI was a pioneer!\u201dAs Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987 best seller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d \u201cthe cycles of buyers at Trump Tower were always something of a barometer of what was going on in the international economy.\u201dThe first group, Mr. Trump wrote in the book, included many people hailing from the Middle East, some of them from nations the newly elected president would later seek to put on a travel ban list. There have also been residents of Mexico, a country Mr. Trump targeted through his candidacy. Juan Beckmann Vidal, who has a majority stake in Jose Cuervo Tequila, purchased and combined three units on the 31st floor in 2007.Although Mr. Trump called himself \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d in 2016, his namesake tower has been welcoming to those who have run afoul of the law.\u201cCriminals got to go somewhere,\u201d said Robby Browne, a broker at the Corcoran Group.After being charged with drug trafficking, Mr. Weichselbaum rented an apartment owned by Mr. Trump himself at the Trump Plaza building on East 61st Street. Mr. Trump wrote a letter on his behalf to the presiding judge in the case, calling him a \u201ccredit to the community\u201d shortly before Mr. Weichselbaum pleaded guilty and was given a three-year sentence.In 1988, Jay Weinberg, a New York-bred career criminal, moved into Unit 63-A while under indictment for running what prosecutors said was the largest Medicaid fraud in history. After being convicted of using his low-cost, Brooklyn-based medical clinic to improperly bill Medicaid for $16 million in fees from 381,000 appointments that never took place, he was sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison. As prosecutors noted, he was literally robbing the poor to feed the rich.At least Mr. Nahmad and Mr. Trincher have not been charged in connection with anyone\u2019s death, a dubious distinction held by Isaac Chehebar, a real estate investor and scion of the 1,300-store Rainbow retail chain.Mr. Chehebar served a four-and-a-half-month sentence for criminally negligent homicide. In 2006, Mr. Chehebar spent $4.3 million for a 2,200-square-foot apartment on the 42nd floor of Trump Tower, property records show.Steven Hoffenberg, who was convicted in 1997 of bilking investors of Towers Financial Corporation of $462 million, leased office space on the 16th floor shortly after his legal difficulties began.Asked last year by Bloomberg why Mr. Trump rented to him when he was facing charges of running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history, Mr. Hoffenberg said: \u201cHe\u2019s very objective. Renting space has nothing to do with color or race \u2014 or indictment. It has to do with if you can pay the rent.\u201dSince Mr. Trump\u2019s political career took off, there have been questions about his possible ties to Russia. In January 2017, he took to Twitter saying, \u201cI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA \u2014 NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201dBut in 2002, the Bayrock Group, a real estate investment fund run by two Russian-born entrepreneurs, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater, moved into office space on the 24th floor of Trump Tower, where they began work on the future Trump SoHo and used their connections to explore a possible Trump building in Moscow.He avoided jail time by becoming a government informant who, according to the former attorney general Loretta Lynch, provided crucial intelligence about a variety of international crime syndicates.Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to play down his involvement with Mr. Sater.In 2007, he told The Times that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know [Mr. Sater] very well.\u201d In 2015, he told a reporter from The Associated Press that he was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d with him.In 2017, Mr. Sater met with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, at the Loews Regency on Park Avenue. There, Mr. Sater gave him a letter proposing the lifting of sanctions against Russia.The letter, The Times later reported, was delivered to Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser at the time. The next week, Mr. Flynn was fired.Of late, Mr. Trump has also been distancing himself from another Trump Tower resident with ties to Russian interests. In addition to holding the deed to an apartment on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower since 2015, he was for several months last year the manager of his landlord\u2019s presidential campaign.His name: Paul Manafort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Brexit Britain Can Reset the Immigration Debate", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The Labour Party is surging in British polls. That\u2019s after a June general election in which it unexpectedly won a remarkable 40 percent of the vote under the leadership of the much-derided Jeremy Corbyn. Young and previously disengaged voters were galvanized by a left-wing policy platform that pledged to deal with the wealth inequalities and economic hardships that affect so many people today.The challenge for the Labour Party is to devise a policy that honors Brexit voters\u2019 decision but doesn\u2019t dishonor its own values. That\u2019s an especially tough circle to square when it comes to immigration. During the recent general election campaign, Labour conceded that the right to free movement within the European Union for member-state citizens would end post-Brexit. But the party leadership also championed migrants\u2019 vital contributions to Britain, while promising to scrap the \u201cbogus immigration targets\u201d that have been set by the Conservative government and to guarantee the rights of European Union citizens living in Britain.This balancing act seemed to work for Labour\u2019s alliance of Leave and Remain voters, consolidating support. But it involves delicate positioning.Some sections of the party are still urging Mr. Corbyn to harden his stance on the issue to appease the party\u2019s traditional working-class base \u2014 which, according to this analysis, is never as ethnically diverse as, in actual fact, it is. Nevertheless, Labour will need to show how removing from millions of people the right to move and work freely across the European Union is a progressive policy.This is not impossible. Arguably, free movement of labor has made migration harder for those outside the European Union, whereas a Labour Brexit policy could equalize the criteria for all. But this approach might go awry if the European Union makes preferential trade access for Britain contingent on preferential treatment of migrants from within the union. Plus, of course, Labour would still have to sell the policy to a public that wants more immigration controls. So we\u2019re back to where we started.The solution for Labour must be to be as bold in its desire to shift the migration narrative as it has been to move the national debate on economic issues. If the party is riding a progressive wave, there is an opportunity to bring more of the public on board \u2014 including people worried about immigration.With policies like the nationalization of rail and energy companies, a higher minimum wage and higher taxes on the top 5 percent of earners, the Labour Party succeeded in recapturing some voters who had been won over by the pro-Brexit, anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party. Thousands of Labour campaigners, enthused by the Corbyn leadership, engaged in doorstep discussions that destigmatized migrants by shifting blame for people\u2019s hardships onto a more deserving target: the government.Of course, racism is an animating force of its own. Bigotry is not tied to economic fortunes, and some will always resent hearing languages other than English spoken on their street. But those who hold such sentiments are a minority and not likely to support progressive parties, in any case. So it makes no sense for Labour to formulate its strategy with this cohort in mind.Most crucial in a hostile climate, the party\u2019s language should stick with its manifesto promise that Labour \u201cwill not scapegoat migrants nor blame them for economic failures\u201d \u2014 and sound less like Mr. Corbyn\u2019s recent comments about foreign workers. Even optimistic experts agree that on the issue of immigration, long-incubated antipathies take time to change. But if it is possible to shift the mood on this, it is surely within the power of Labour\u2019s current leadership, with its populist left-wing platform and an army of enthusiastic, progressive and campaign-ready supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Intellectual Property Theft Must Stop", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsPresident Trump on Monday instructed the office of the United States Trade Representative to consider an investigation into China\u2019s sustained and widespread attacks on America\u2019s intellectual property. This investigation will provide the evidence for holding China accountable for a decades-long assault on the intellectual property of the United States and its allies.For too long, the United States has treated China as a developing nation to be coaxed and lectured, while tolerating its bad behavior as merely growing pains. There has been an expectation that as China\u2019s economy matures, it will of its own accord adopt international standards in commerce, including protection for intellectual property. There has also been a tendency to excuse mercantilist behavior, including industrial espionage, as a passing phase, and to justify inaction as necessary to secure Chinese cooperation on other, supposedly more important, issues.Chinese companies, with the encouragement of official Chinese policy and often the active participation of government personnel, have been pillaging the intellectual property of American companies. All together, intellectual-property theft costs America up to $600 billion a year, the greatest transfer of wealth in history. China accounts for most of that loss.Intellectual-property theft covers a wide spectrum: counterfeiting American fashion designs, pirating movies and video games, patent infringement and stealing proprietary technology and software. This assault saps economic growth, costs Americans jobs, weakens our military capability and undercuts a key American competitive advantage \u2014 innovation.Chinese companies have stolen trade secrets from virtually every sector of the American economy: automobiles, auto tires, aviation, chemicals, consumer electronics, electronic trading, industrial software, biotech and pharmaceuticals. Last year U.S. Steel accused Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets related to the production of lightweight steel, then turning them over to Chinese steel makers.Perhaps most concerning, China has targeted the American defense industrial base. Chinese spies have gone after private defense contractors and subcontractors, national laboratories, public research universities, think tanks and the American government itself. Chinese agents have gone after the United States\u2019 most significant weapons, such as the F-35 Lightning, the Aegis Combat System and the Patriot missile system; illegally exported unmanned underwater vehicles and thermal-imaging cameras; and stolen documents related to the B-52 bomber, the Delta IV rocket, the F-15 fighter and even the Space Shuttle.President Trump\u2019s action on Monday acknowledges the broad scope of the challenge. Central to Chinese cybersecurity law is the \u201csecure and controllable\u201d standard, which, in the name of protecting software and data, forces companies operating in China to disclose critical intellectual property to the government and requires that they store data locally. Even before this Chinese legislation, some three-quarters of Chinese imported software was pirated. Now, despite the law, American companies may be even more vulnerable.For decades, successive American administrations have concluded that some level of exposure to China\u2019s depredations against our intellectual property is simply the cost of doing business with the world\u2019s now second-largest economy. This is not acceptable. Although China is an important trading partner with the United States, it is imperative to establish a fair and level trading environment.Driving down intellectual-property theft by China and other countries is vital for America\u2019s economic well-being and national security. We urge American companies, as well as our allies abroad, who share these interests, to work with the administration through this process.There is intellectual-property protection on the books in China, and some American companies have been successful bringing cases in Chinese courts. The time may come when China applies the same efforts to protecting intellectual property that it now does to stealing it. However, for now, the United States and other developed countries must look to their own laws and actions to protect their companies from loss and ruin.President Trump\u2019s action on Monday is a major step in the right direction. If the investigation proves extensive Chinese government support for intellectual-property theft, it could trigger retaliatory action by the American government, based on the Economic Espionage Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the National Defense Authorization Act.The government should lead in this effort, but it can\u2019t go it alone. A broad, sustained campaign bringing together the government, the private sector and our allies is the only way to halt this hemorrhaging of America\u2019s economic life blood.Dennis C.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "It\u2019s not a stretch to say that the future of aerospace and related IT commerce is in Florida. Ask Frank DiBello and he\u2019ll agree. As president and CEO of Space Florida, the state\u2019s spaceport authority, he\u2019s charged with attracting private-sector aerospace firms and the IT businesses that support them. \u201cAs the space commerce industry evolves, we expect to be the global leader, able to partner with other nations to achieve a new kind of space economy,\u201d says DiBello. These goals may seem like a moon shot, but if Florida\u2019s legacy of innovation is any indication, such a trajectory is right on the mark.When the skies over Cape Canaveral filled with a crackling and mighty roar on July 24, 1950, no one guessed how common such an occurrence would become. The bellowing thrust from the Bumper 8 rocket as it pushed spaceward marked the first launch from Florida\u2019s Space Coast. For the nascent space race, Florida provided the perfect launchpad for getting humans and robots into orbit and giving industries a boost. Those industries supported NASA\u2019s space missions and became an unprecedented economic engine: New cities were built, new freeways were laid and educational institutions thrived. Iconic space missions from Apollo to the space shuttle galvanized the nation\u2019s place in aerospace history.When NASA\u2019s space shuttle program ended in 2011, many wondered about the future of the state\u2019s aerospace sector and its associated IT industries. \u201cWe had, at the height of the shuttle, about 15,000 employees. Everyone knew there would probably be layoffs coming,\u201d recalls Lisa Malone, former director of public affairs at NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center.\n  Pair the end of the shuttle program with miles of white sand beaches, sapphire blue waters, tropical climate and a general appeal to holidaymakers, and it\u2019s easy to think that Florida\u2019s space days might be over, replaced by a healthy tourism economy.Malone thinks those assumptions are premature, though, and that the Space Coast is in the middle of a renaissance, centered on one-of-a-kind facilities to process launch vehicles. \u201cThis is the only place on this continent where humans are launched into space,\u201d says Malone. Couple that with the fact that Florida\u2019s universities are among the top national producers of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) degree graduates and you have a formula for success. \n  The state has developed a strategy to attract companies in sectors that build on its strong aerospace legacy. New industry has more than replaced the 9,000 jobs that were lost after the shuttle program ended. \u201cWe are no longer just launching rockets, we\u2019re building the rockets that we launch here,\u201d says DiBello. Already private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic and most of the world\u2019s best-known aerospace and IT brands have a presence here.These are just a few of the things that attracted OneWeb, a startup backed by European aerospace giant Airbus. In March the company broke ground on the world\u2019s first facility for high-volume satellite production at Exploration Park, adjacent to the launch facilities at the Kennedy Space Center. The production and launch of satellites are secondary to OneWeb\u2019s overall mission, though, which is to provide satellite-based global internet access.A favorable tax environment, a streamlined permitting process, existing infrastructure and a robust talent pool made Florida a no-brainer when OneWeb wanted to further develop its aerospace and IT products. \u201cThe Space Coast has one of the highest densities of engineers of any place in the U.S., primarily from its large base of aerospace and other technology companies,\u201d says Greg Wyler, OneWeb\u2019s founder and executive chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s a very well-run state that operates without debt and has affordable housing, so our dedicated engineers can also have a great quality of life.\u201dWyler has big plans for the future, centered on OneWeb\u2019s proprietary orbital internet technology, which is built into the satellites that its aerospace and IT talent will manufacture and launch in Florida. \u201cOur goal is to connect every school in the world by 2022 and to bridge the digital divide by 2027,\u201d he says. \n  It\u2019s clear Florida and the enterprises that choose to do business here have a lot of faith in aerospace and IT as economic drivers for the future. Business leaders like DiBello are even convinced that investing in aerospace will strengthen the American economy as a whole and make Florida the Silicon Valley of the Southeast. \u201cWhenever a nation invests in doing difficult things, they advance technology,\u201d says DiBello.  \u201cThey create a culture of innovation that eventually permeates every aspect of their society and that lifts the nation up.\u201d The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "France, Facing Criticism, Promises the Bare Essentials for Migrants", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 After banking on neglect, hostility and mistreatment to discourage a steady trickle of migrants, the new French government was ordered by France\u2019s highest administrative body to do better this week and at least provide water and toilets to the people.That order has defused, for now, a new migrant crisis brewing at the northern port of Calais, the favored would-be jumping off point for Britain. Yet a permanent solution to France\u2019s slow-boiling migrant problem still appears to be distant.That has not stopped the French authorities from trying. In recent days, President Emmanuel Macron proposed opening European-run reception centers in Africa \u2014 perhaps in Niger, Chad or even Libya \u2014 to discourage migrants from risking the journey across the Mediterranean Sea.Critics quickly pointed out the fierce determination of Africans to make the journey, regardless of counsel to the contrary, and the huge numbers intent on doing so.Up to one million migrants are in refugee camps in Libya alone, as Mr. Macron pointed out in a speech in which he highlighted his own recent peacemaking initiative for Libya. He also called for broader European involvement in African development as a long-term solution to the migrant crisis.The migrants have made thousands of attempts to enter the tunnel and board trucks bound for England since the beginning of the year, the police say.The French migrant numbers are small compared with the thousands pouring into Italy. There, about 95,000 migrants have arrived from across the Mediterranean this year.But that lower court order was upheld Monday by the Council of State, which criticized Mr. Macron\u2019s government for \u201cinhuman and degrading\u201d treatment of the newest migrants at Calais, in northern France.On Monday, the council blasted the government\u2019s \u201cmanifestly insufficient\u201d accounting for \u201cthe elementary hygiene and water needs\u201d of the migrants at Calais by compromising \u201cin a serious and obviously illegal way, a fundamental right.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, immediately promised water, showers and toilets for the migrants at Calais, as well as two new regional reception centers where demands for asylum could be processed more quickly. He also promised an investigation into the police\u2019s conduct.\u201cI can\u2019t accept the putting in place of facilities which will once again facilitate the creation of encampments and slums,\u201d she said in a statement late on Monday.The majority of residents of Calais might agree. The leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, won a majority of the vote against Mr. Macron in the second round of the presidential election in May.Mr. Macron wants a fresh start on policy regarding migrants, but until last week he had mainly allowed his tough-talking interior minister to set the tone: no coddling of migrants at Calais and harsh words for the humanitarian organizations working there.The government wanted to avoid setting up new reception centers at Calais or do anything that would encourage migrants to head to that English Channel port, further exasperating local officials.It has also pledged to step up the expulsion of economic migrants looking for work, as opposed to those seeking political asylum. Less than a third of the 91,000 illegal migrants arrested in France last year actually left the country.Mr. Macron turned his attention to migrants last week in a speech in Orl\u00e9ans, vowing then to end the phenomenon of migrant encampments in France. \u201cThe first fight is to house everybody decently. Between now and the end of the year, I want no more men and women in the streets, in the woods, or lost,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of dignity, it\u2019s a question of humanity, and of efficiency also,\u201d he said at the end of a ceremony to swear in new French citizens.\u201cMost of those who are, dreadfully, called migrants today, are not all men and women demanding asylum, coming from countries where their lives are in danger,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cThere are many, more and more, who come from peaceful countries, and are following the economic migration routes, who are financing the smugglers, the bandits, even terrorists, and in those cases we need to be strict, tough even, rigorous, with those coming by those routes. We can\u2019t welcome everybody.\u201dHe promoted his own \u201cmuch more ambitious\u201d European development policy, called the Sahel Alliance, intended to keep the migrants in Africa.While Africans have welcomed these outlines of initiatives, many reacted angrily to remarks Mr. Macron made at the Group of 20 summit meeting about Africa\u2019s \u201ccivilizational challenge.\u201d\u201cWhen you have countries where there are still seven to eight children per woman, you can decide to spend million of euros, nothing will be stabilized,\u201d he said.Despite the angry African reaction, Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks are consistent with the demographic reality in several West African countries that are sources of European migration.The new president turned aside from the migrant issue in his first months. Instead, he has been preoccupied with reforming France\u2019s economy and meeting foreign leaders, a suddenly plunging popularity rating and a raft of inexperienced parliamentary deputies in his own political movement.But politically hazardous images of African migrants camping out \u2014 in the streets of Paris, at Calais or near the Italian border around Nice \u2014 keep turning up in the French news media.Last month the police in Paris carried out their 34th evacuation of migrants since 2015, removing nearly 3,000 from the Porte de la Chapelle, then busing them to gymnasiums in the region for processing.Advertisement"}

The political and economic upheaval in his country was not going to deter him.Even on the heels of a new scandal erupting in May that rocked the markets, the hedge fund firm he co-founded here, Adam Capital, started raising money for its newest fund. It is expected to be a $6.1 billion macro global fund, or one that invests based largely on the political and economic prospects of various countries.If it succeeds, the firm could become one of the top independent asset managers in Latin America, based on total assets under management, and among the largest worldwide of its vintage.Mr. Appel is going solo as Brazil\u2019s hedge fund sector is growing even though the short-term prospects of the economy remain uncertain.Total assets under management in June increased to $85 billion, a jump of 15 percent from the $74 billion in June 2016, according to data provided by the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association, known by its Portuguese acronym Anbima.Brazilian macro funds had a total under management of $30.79 billion (or 97 billion reais) in June, a 51 percent increase from the same month one year earlier. Just in the first six months of this year, that figure grew by 18 percent.Such funds are more and more sought after out here. They received a net increase of $5.3 billion (or 16.7 billion reais) in the first half of this year, a turnaround from the net outflow of $412.7 million (or 1.3 billion reais) over the same period last year, according to Anbima.Even with all that money going into hedge funds, it is still an unusual time to form a new investment vehicle here and court investors.Brazil\u2019s president continues to be investigated for corruption, his low popularity has eroded even further, and his ability to shepherd unpopular reform measures considered by bankers as essential to turn around the economy has diminished.Yet Adam Capital\u2019s founding partners, Mr. Appel and his longtime colleague Andr\u00e9 Salgado, are no strangers to crisis.\u201cBrazil is a very good place to make money. It always has been,\u201d said Mr. Appel in a recent interview at the firm\u2019s office in the upscale Leblon neighborhood near the beach.From 2001 to 2008, Mr. Appel led asset management at the Spanish banking giant Santander\u2019s Brazil subsidiary. Then he did that for Banco Safra from 2008 to October 2015. There he gained acclaim for his performance with their Galileo fund, which gained 199.43 percent during his tenure, according to the brokerage firm XP Investimentos.But, he said, \u201cI always dreamt of opening my own firm.\u201dThe two founding partners met while at Santander \u2014 Mr. Salgado headed its brokerage house from 2003 to 2010 and later held a similar role at Safra.Adam Capital opened its initial funds in April last year. Two weeks earlier, Brazil\u2019s lower house had voted to move forward the impeachment process of Dilma Rousseff, then president.Still, the firm ended up raising $2.9 billion for its flagship macro fund and accumulated a total of about $3.3 billion in under nine months. That was in part because several private banks, including Itau Unibanco and Safra, agreed to be distributors, providing access to their private banking clients.Adam Capital \u201chas had very strong success in raising funds,\u201d said Michael Viriato Araujo, a professor of finance at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based business school Insper. \u201cFor Brazil, the speed at which they raised was impressive,\u201d he said.The firm\u2019s performance has been well above benchmarks. As of July 31, the flagship fund is up 27 percent since inception. That is about 1.65 times the return of the CDI, a type of certificate of deposit common among Brazilians and considered risk-free as it is tied to local interest rates, which have long been sky-high.The firm currently holds about $4.51 billion in assets under management, according to Mr. Salgado.That ranks it first globally among hedge fund managers established in 2016 or later and based on total assets under management, according to the research firm Preqin.Black and White Capital in the United States is in second place with $2.8 billion. Only two others have surpassed the $1 billion threshold in assets under management. Those are the Holocene Advisors and Sagewood in the United States.Adam Capital so far has focused on investing in equities, mostly indexes, foreign exchange and interest rates. It has done so in the United States, Japan, and Europe as well as in emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and Mexico.Until May, the firm kept about a 50/50 split between investments in Brazil and overseas, its founders said. The leak of a taped conversation between Joesley Batista, chief executive of J & F Investments, the parent of the meatpacking giant JBS, and Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, who seemed to endorse Mr. Batista\u2019s bribery, resulted in a market panic.Immediately afterward, Adam reduced everything related to Brazil: stocks, local interest rates and the real. Its flagship fund fell 3.52 percent that month.Yet the firm\u2019s funds have since rebounded, as has their exposure to Brazil, including even betting on the real over the dollar. \u201cAs of today, we\u2019re just back to pre-Batista levels,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back to 50/50.\u201dThey also feel like they passed an important test during that episode. \u201cGenerally I think it was bad because nobody likes to lose money,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cBut we managed to prove to the market that our size was manageable even with an event of this proportion.\u201dIn Brazil, several factors have buoyed independent asset managers. Interest rates falling significantly in the past year forced normally conservative Brazilian investors to start taking more risks. The emergence of new brokerage firms, some online, has also cut into the dominance banks used to have in controlling hedge funds.Large banks are starting to sell to independent managers, said Mr. Appel. \u201cThat is what allowed us to get that big that fast,\u201d Mr. Salgado noted.That bodes well for other firms, too. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely the industry will continue to grow,\u201d said Professor Viriato, the hedge fund expert at Insper.The minimum amount needed to invest has also fallen, making the funds more accessible.\u201cHedge funds in the past were for the ultrarich in Brazil,\u201d said Mr. Salgado. Now a hedge fund investor needs only a minimum investment of $3,175 and can make that through his bank or other firms.Reflecting that change, Adam Capital already has about 18,000 individual investors in its funds.Mr. Salgado said that to put money in hedge funds in Brazil today, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a millionaire anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Weary Wisconsin Town, a Billionaire-Fueled Revival", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "Diane Hendricks and her late husband saw opportunity in Beloit, a decaying industrial town. Now, she dreams of turning it into a mecca for start-ups.Supported byBELOIT, Wis. \u2014 When Diane Hendricks sees something she doesn\u2019t like here, she buys it.A bankrupt country club. A half-empty mall. Abandoned buildings. The rusting foundry down by the river.\u201cI see old buildings, and I see an opportunity for putting things in them,\u201d says Ms. Hendricks, 70, who got her start fixing up houses here as a single mother and made her billions selling roofing felt, copper gutters and cement with her late husband, Ken.Now Ms. Hendricks is fixing up Beloit.She took the library from its historic location downtown and resurrected it inside a failing mall at the edge of town, replacing the original with a performing arts center where dance and music students from Beloit College can study and perform each year. Then she scooped up nearly every building on a downtown block and knocked each one down, making way for a sushi restaurant, a high-quality burger joint and modern apartments with marble countertops and exposed-brick walls.She called the complex the Phoenix. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re beautifying the city, but we\u2019re really beautifying the economy,\u201d she says, casting her piercing blue eyes out of the window of her office in Ironworks, the old foundry complex she converted into a commercial space.She has wooed several start-ups, persuading them to set up shop in the old foundry building \u2014 one with the help of Wisconsin\u2019s governor, Scott Walker, who personally called the co-founders on her behalf.Ms. Hendricks, a major Republican donor, was briefly thrust into the national spotlight a few years ago when she was recorded asking Mr. Walker to break up the labor unions. He then introduced a bill limiting the ability of public workers to bargain over wages. In response, protesters occupied the halls of the Capitol for weeks.Not long ago, Beloit\u2019s economy was ugly. Like many American cities \u2014 Detroit, Youngstown, Gary \u2014 it had fallen victim to the damage that is wrought when one major industry vanishes from town, reversing local fortunes.Beloit is different today. That\u2019s because this town of nearly 37,000 has a billionaire who has gone to great lengths to help it turn a corner.In a nation with countless struggling towns and small cities, Beloit is not a model for economic revival that is easily replicated, although a few others have tried.Ms. Hendricks\u2019s project has not been cheap.Buying and fixing up the foundry alone has cost Ms. Hendricks around $40 million, according to Rob Gerbitz, the president and chief executive of Hendricks Commercial Properties. The Phoenix complex has cost $7 million (with a $1 million assist from the city).And, of course, money doesn\u2019t solve everything. Ms. Hendricks\u2019s overhaul faces challenges big and small, including skepticism. Early on, some residents joked about giving the city a new name: Hendricksville. Unemployment remains stubbornly high, as does poverty.Her activities on Beloit\u2019s behalf are complicated by the fact that not everyone agrees with Ms. Hendricks\u2019s political views. She was an early supporter of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign here in Wisconsin, a state with a history of progressive politics, and that has pitted her against some current and former students at Beloit College, a liberal arts school and one of Beloit\u2019s other big employers. (Ms. Hendricks sits on the college\u2019s board of trustees.)\u201cDiane Hendricks is the most powerful woman in Wisconsin,\u201d says Charlie Sykes, a former talk-show host in Milwaukee.In Beloit, she\u2019s so influential that some worry about what would happen if someday she walks away. \u201cWill the kids take over?\u201d asks Rod Gottfredsen, a local barber, referring to her seven adult children.Mr. Gottfredsen has had a front-row seat to Beloit\u2019s travails for nearly 40 years. He\u2019s been cutting hair and trimming beards since 1978, when he took over Austin\u2019s Barbershop on one of Beloit\u2019s main streets downtown.On a clear June day, one of Ms. Hendricks\u2019s sons, Brent Fox, is in his white Ford Super Duty truck driving through the lush tree-lined streets around Beloit College. This is the neighborhood where Ms. Hendricks and her husband got their start a half-century ago, buying and fixing up homes, in the 1960s.\u201cMom wanted me to show you these,\u201d Mr. Fox says as he stops outside two Craftsman-style homes where trucks marked CCI, a Hendricks-owned construction company, are parked. \u201cOne of the biggest problems we find is suitable housing stock, so we decided to buy old, stately houses,\u201d says Mr. Fox, who is also the chief executive of Hendricks Holding Company.\u201cAs long as we can break even or make a dollar, we\u2019ll keep doing it,\u201d he adds.Mr. Fox drives north, past Beloit\u2019s industrial sites, through the town\u2019s history. The red roof of ABC Supply comes into view, overlooking Beloit from a slight hill. When the Hendrickses bought the property in the 1990s, it was an abandoned factory that had once made diesel backup engines for military submarines.We pass the Eclipse Center, which in its heyday in the 1960s was the biggest mall in Rock County. By the 1980s, it had become better known for a notorious double murder at the Radio Shack. The place was half empty when the Hendrickses stepped in.He stops at the Beloit Club, a beleaguered country club near the Rock River, which cuts through the town. Ms. Hendricks bought it several years ago, possibly saving the club from an ignominious fate as a gravel pit.\u201cFrom a business perspective, it was a horrible decision,\u201d he says of the purchase. But if Beloit was to be reimagined as a modern city, the thinking went, it needed a club for golf.Beloit\u2019s Hendricks-fueled revival happened largely by chance.Ms. Hendricks grew up 200 miles away from Beloit, on a dairy farm, with eight sisters. As a child, she yearned to work outdoors on the farm, but her father forbade it. A surprise pregnancy at 17 and her short marriage to Mr. Fox\u2019s father brought her to Janesville, to work briefly in the Parker Pen factory, where women assembled fountain pens.Soon she divorced. She had to find a way to support herself on her own, as a single mother. She switched to selling real estate, and had gotten her broker\u2019s license by the time she turned 21.Before long, she had found a business partner, a roofing contractor who had dropped out of high school, named Ken Hendricks. Together the two bought old houses in Beloit, fixed them up and rented them out. They married in 1975 and moved on to buying industrial spaces at around the same time. They found a rundown sugar beet plant in Janesville, 20 miles up the road from Beloit.When Mr. Hendricks went to a Janesville bank to finance the purchase of the plant, he was turned away. \u201cThe banker said, \u2018We don\u2019t do business with entrepreneurs, and we don\u2019t want your business,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hendricks recalls.It was a turning point. The couple turned their backs on Janesville, focusing instead on Beloit.They would move from renting local apartments to starting ABC Supply in 1982, buying up distributors nationwide.Beloit at the time was on the cusp of a steep decline after successive economic blows, among them the grinding to a halt of Fairbanks Morse, a diesel engine maker and a onetime major employer.Like struggling cities and towns across the country, Beloit went through a period of Band-Aid-like efforts. By the 1980s, local businesses were petitioning the city to change its image by cleaning up the riverfront, where vacant stores sat along the banks of the river, and by reviving the withering downtown. The initiatives barely made a dent.Into the 1990s, at least, the town still had its foundry, Beloit Corporation, by that time owned by a Milwaukee company, Harnishfeger Corporation. At its height, Beloit Corporation had employed more than 7,000 people building papermaking machines. Late into the night, the flickering light from the welding in the foundry would light up the Rock River.In 1999, the foundry went bankrupt, leaving behind an empty, sprawling complex the size of 15 football fields. Beloit\u2019s downtown became a bleak landscape of \u201cdecayed, bombed-out buildings,\u201d recalled Jeff Adams, who moved to Beloit to teach economics at Beloit College in the early 1980s and was involved in early initiatives to try to fix the town.But if Beloit was sinking, the Hendrickses were riding high. Their business was booming, and they saw opportunity in the desolation.One day, a few years after Beloit Corporation went bust, the two were riding their Harley-Davidsons past the abandoned factory and noticed someone wandering around the property. They stopped to ask what he was doing. The man, Samuel Popa, turned out to be looking for a place to put his aluminum business.On a whim, the Hendricks decided to buy the 800,000-square-foot building. They knew it had the potential to one day become commercial space, perhaps residential, too. They ended up becoming a partner in Mr. Popa\u2019s company, American Aluminum Extrusion.Next, they bought the old mall on the edge of town, which they planned on turning into \u201ca community and civic center,\u201d Ms. Hendricks says.Around the same time, Ron Nief, the director of public affairs at Beloit College, and two of his friends had an idea that in almost any other dying industrial town would not have gotten out of the starting blocks: Let\u2019s start an international film festival.They approached Beloit\u2019s billionaire benefactors about the idea, and in 2006, the festival opened on a frigid Wisconsin weekday in January.Despite the fact that its debut occurred the same week as the much more famous Sundance Film Festival, it has thrived. Jon Voight, Melissa Gilbert and David Zucker, the director of \u201cAirplane!,\u201d have attendedMr. Nief recalls a conversation with Mr. Hendricks, who had told him to aim high with the film festival idea. Mr. Nief said to him, \u201cIt needs to be special, but it doesn\u2019t need to be, say, the Toronto Film Festival,\u201d referring to the giant on the festival circuit.\u201cKen said: \u2018Why not? Why don\u2019t you want to be the biggest and the best in the world?\u2019\u201d Mr. Nief said.But tragedy struck one evening, just days before Christmas in 2007. Mr. Hendricks fell through the roof of his home after inspecting some renovations; he died from the injuries.Mr. Hendricks\u2019s death led residents in Beloit to worry that Ms. Hendricks would sell ABC and abandon the couple\u2019s efforts to revive the town.Then came the 2008 economic crisis. Housing and construction, the very businesses on which the Hendrickses\u2019 fortune had been built, suffered through one of the worst downturns in decades.ABC pulled through, and grew in part by buying its biggest rival, Bradco. Today ABC is a private company and the largest wholesale distributor of roofing, windows, siding and gutter materials. It has 715 stores across the United States and employs 656 people in Beloit alone.Ms. Hendricks also began putting to use the industrial buildings that she and her husband had bought over the years. She turned the foundry into a commercial space with high ceilings, dubbing it Ironworks, and turned to a political ally, Mr. Walker, to help attract at least one tenant.The move worked.\u201cI had 17 employees at that moment, and the governor of Wisconsin told me my business mattered to him,\u201d recalled Kerry Frank, the co-founder with her husband, Dude Frank, of Comply365, which makes software used by airline pilots to complete their flight paperwork. Started in the Franks\u2019 basement, the company is now housed in Ironworks and counts Southwest Airlines among its biggest clients.In 2011, after Illinois created a new law to collect sales tax from online shoppers, the Rockton online coupon company FatWallet needed to find a Wisconsin town for its headquarters. Ms. Hendricks worked with the city to make Beloit, just over the state border, FatWallet\u2019s first choice. The company is now based in Ironworks.\u201cThe advantage here in Beloit is that the same type of engineer that you hire in Silicon Valley can have a large house,\u201d says Ryan Washatka, general manager in Beloit for Ebates, FatWallet\u2019s parent company.Still, few people in the start-up world outside of Wisconsin know much about Beloit. It certainly was not on the radar of Chris Olsen, a former executive at Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, whose Ohio venture capital firm Drive Capital is now one of Comply365\u2019s biggest investors.After several airlines told him to look at Comply365, Mr. Olson found himself looking at a map. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know where Beloit was,\u201d he jokes.In part to address problems like that, Ms. Hendricks has sent members of her property company, Hendricks Commercial Properties, to Madison to talk to venture capitalists. \u201cCandidly, I wasn\u2019t looking at Beloit,\u201d said Joe Kirgues, a co-founder of Gener8tor, a tech incubator, who one day found himself at a table with Ms. Hendricks\u2019s team.He said the pitch to him had boiled down to: \u201cTell us what resources you need.\u201d Today, Gener8tor has an office in Ironworks and is working with several local start-ups.What\u2019s more, many new jobs are filled by people who commute to Beloit from nearby cities. At AccuLynx, a software company based in the Ironworks, just 17 percent of the employees live in Beloit. The rest live in nearby towns in Wisconsin and just over the border in Illinois.And many of the new jobs require technical skills, like engineering, that residents who once worked in manufacturing often lack. \u201cI know that there are parts of Beloit that are not sharing in this renaissance,\u201d says Scott Bierman, president of Beloit College.Mr. Bierman credits Ms. Hendricks for providing a vision of how things can be. Still, he says, \u201cI worry a lot.\u201dWhile he does see signs that what Ms. Hendricks has built can be sustainable, \u201cWe\u2019ll know a lot more once we get through the next recession,\u201d he said.For now, around 1,000 people currently work out of Ironworks, according to Mr. Gerbitz of Hendricks Commercial Properties. \u201cOur goal is to get to 5,000, which was what was lost when Beloit Corporation went away,\u201d he said.Ironworks today is a far cry from its foundry origins. At AccuLynx, the software firm, there is a giant slide running down from the second floor to the first, a video-game console and a giant gold bell that is rung when sales are made.AccuLynx\u2019s founder, Rich Spanton, described the day his grandfather, who had worked at the foundry as a superintendent for nearly a half-century, visited the building, where he had spent a career assembling steel parts for paper machines. He was astonished at what he saw.\u201cHe walked in,\u201d Mr. Spanton recalls, \u201cand he said, \u2018Jeez, we couldn\u2019t have gotten any work done if this had been our office.\u2019\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts by Diane Hendricks to remake Beloit, Wis. misidentified the company led by Brent Fox, one of Ms. Hendricks\u2019s sons. It is Hendricks Holding Company, not ABC Supply. The article also referred incorrectly to Ms. Hendricks\u2019s ranking among the richest women in the United States. She is the second-richest self-made woman, according to Forbes magazine, not the second-richest woman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unemployment in Black and White", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialUnemployment rates among black workers give a similarly gloomy picture. The jobless rate for black Americans is generally about twice that of white Americans, a ratio that improves only somewhat in \u201cgood\u201d times, like the present, and persists no matter the level of educational attainment. The overall unemployment rate for black workers is now 7.4 percent and for white workers is 3.8 percent. For college-educated workers, the recent average jobless rate was 4.2 percent for blacks, compared with 2.5 percent for whites.The hard truth is that the persistence of twice-as-high joblessness for black workers has led policy makers to accept it is as normal. Just look at the Federal Reserve. Monetary policy is supposed to foster stable prices and full employment. But the Fed has historically favored inflation fighting over boosting employment, a policy bias that generally leads it to raise interest rates before the job market is as strong as possible, as measured by low unemployment and rising pay for all groups of workers. The Fed has already raised rates twice this year and many Fed officials appear to favor a third increase by year\u2019s end, with evident disregard for the fact that black unemployment is now at levels that prevailed for white workers in 2012, when the economy was still very much in the shadow of the Great Recession.Another hard truth is that even when the economy picks up and employers are on a hiring binge, black people have a harder time getting jobs and are paid less than similarly situated white workers. That is exactly what happened from 1996 to 2000, the last genuinely hot job market, and it points clearly to racial discrimination, not just in hiring, but in a range of public policies that disproportionately affect black people. These include the dearth and high cost of child care, which harms single mothers the most; poor public transportation in many rural and suburban areas, which makes keeping a job difficult; and mass incarceration of black men and the barriers to employment that go with it.Other factors include erosion and weakness in the enforcement of labor standards and legal safeguards. The wage gap between black and white workers is larger now than it was in 1979 or in 2000, and has grown the most for college graduates.The whole economy is weighed down by the higher unemployment among black Americans, in part because it deprived the economy of consumer demand, the main engine for growth. Worse, the job and wage gap signals a loss of human potential, a singularly valuable form of capital. The economy cannot be said to be at full employment while black workers lag behind their white counterparts. Nor can the society be said to be just or healthy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P.

{"Headline": "Federal Electricity Study Hints at Future Support for Coal", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday released a major report urging actions to protect the \u201creliability and resilience\u201d of the nation\u2019s electric grid, a move that could lay the groundwork for future support of America\u2019s ailing coal and nuclear industries.More than 200 coal plants and five nuclear reactors have closed across the United States since 2010, and President Trump has vowed to revitalize both industries, though doing so would require resisting powerful market forces reshaping the energy landscape.The Energy Department report concedes that the nation\u2019s electricity system remains reliable today, even with a sharp rise in intermittent wind and solar power, in part because natural gas generators and existing hydropower can easily fill any gaps in renewable generation.But the study raises concerns that a future grid with fewer \u201cbaseload\u201d coal and nuclear plants, which are capable of producing electricity around the clock, could pose challenges to grid operators trying to keep the lights on.\u201cThis report seriously overstates the challenges associated with new energy resources,\u201d said Graham Richard, chief executive of Advanced Energy Economy, a coalition of clean-energy companies. He noted that new technologies like battery storage and distributed solar power \u201care helping to make the electric power system more flexible, reliable, and resilient.\u201dThe Energy Department study hints, among other changes, that the federal regulatory commission may need to reconsider market rules to prevent negative pricing.There\u2019s no single solution for climate change, but there is one that would be more effective than others. What do you think it is?Grid operators also have a number of programs in place to ensure that there are always enough spare power plants that can fire up quickly in case of power failures or other emergencies. Yet the report notes that these programs may be inadequate to deal with certain situations.A power system that is heavily dependent on natural gas may be vulnerable to pipeline disruptions or gas shortages during severe winters akin to the \u201cpolar vortex\u201d in 2014, during which power failures occurred across the Northeast.\u201cMore work is needed,\u201d the report says, \u201cto understand what can be done to maintain resilience in a variety of conditions as the grid changes over the coming years.\u201dExperts who read the report said that any market changes pushed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could potentially benefit renewables and other clean energy technologies as well, noting that wind power played an important role in keeping the power system operating during the polar vortex.

But she likes to take her time and have coffee. She keeps the lights low and the house quiet and Zen-like. \u201cI just can\u2019t rush like that,\u201d she said.When the second alarm goes off at 3:45 \u2014 a reminder to leave for the train in 15 minutes \u2014 her morning shifts from leisure to precision.It is a seven-minute drive to the station, where she catches the Altamont Corridor Express train.It takes her four minutes to find parking and walk to the platform, where she waits for the train on the same rectangle each day with her roller bag and floral print lunch bag. When the 4:20 train pulls in, she is in front of her preferred door, and she walks to the rear-facing seat that she favors.\u201cIt\u2019s like school,\u201d she said.ACE ridership has doubled over the past decade, to about 2,500 people a day, though the figure is still dwarfed by the number who commute by car from San Joaquin County to the Bay Area. On that recent early morning, as the train wound toward the Altamont Pass, traffic was already forming on the freeway outside the window.While drivers sat alert and watched the road, the train looked more like a red-eye flight. Blankets, pillows, earplugs, eyeshades. The few people who were not sleeping distracted themselves with smartphones, laptops and the occasional printed book.One thing people did not do was talk. Even outside the quiet car, there were few audible conversations.That was starting to change by the time the train pulled into the Pleasanton station. The sun was rising over a bus that waited on the other side of the station\u2019s parking lot.Ms. James and a crowd of other commuters crossed the parking lot to the bus, which was headed to the Bay Area Rapid Transit station. As the bus idled and waited for stragglers, a woman urged the driver to get going so she could make her next train.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how this commute makes infants of adults,\u201d Ms. James said.Ms. James used to live closer, in Alameda, Calif., about 15 miles across San Francisco Bay from her work. But three years ago, after a developer bought her building and evicted Ms. James and her neighbors, she moved to Stockton.Stockton has more for the money: Ms. James pays $1,000 a month in rent for her three-bedroom house, compared with $1,600 for the one-bedroom apartment she had in Alameda. She can work from home some of the time, so she now has a home office with a desk and a computer, as opposed to the \u201chome corner\u201d she had in her apartment.The trade-off is a brutal commute.As more people move inland, home prices are rising faster in the Central Valley than anywhere else in the state: In San Joaquin County (which includes Stockton) and neighboring Merced County, prices are up about 12 percent in the last year.Prices are so high, and people are commuting so far, that gentrification has moved well beyond prime city neighborhoods to secondary cities and even far-reaching suburbs. \u201cOakland used to be a relatively affordable city where homes were $500,000 three years ago,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. \u201cNow, it\u2019s almost $700,000, and I can guarantee you incomes have not kept up with that.\u201dWhen Ms. James\u2019s bus arrived at the BART stop, people ran and scootered across an overpass to the station. But Ms. James was not one of them: Just as with her morning routine, she took her time and walked slowly.Ms. James could get up at 3:50 and bolt out the door. But she likes having a leisurely morning of the sort she had in Alameda, and she clings to that routine by getting up extra early.Sometimes she gets off the BART train before her usual stop so she can walk a few more blocks to work, though not this day. Just before 7 a.m., when the train arrived at her final stop at San Francisco\u2019s Civic Center, Ms. James allowed herself an indulgence. She skipped the stairs and took the escalator.\u201cIt\u2019s these little things you have to give yourself,\u201d she said.Ms. James then began the last leg of her journey: a three-minute walk from the station to her job at the Federal Building.Facing the day ahead, she was mindful that it would end with another three-hour commute that would deliver her home 12 hours later.Text by Conor Dougherty, and photographs and video by Andrew Burton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Comment on Venezuela Makes a Bad Situation Worse", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 No one should be worried about American military action anywhere in Latin America. The notion is risible.But President Trump\u2019s cavalier remark last week referring to a \u201cpossible military option\u201d to deal with the increasingly dictatorial regime led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela has real consequences. Such bluster could adversely affect the United States\u2019 relations with its closest neighbors and make it even more difficult to resolve the hemisphere\u2019s worst crisis.Especially in Latin America, the remark evoked the Cold War era, when the United States sent troops to Central America and the Caribbean (though never to South America, where Venezuela is), often with unhappy results. The last time the United States used military forces in Latin America was in Panama, nearly three decades ago. Mr. Trump seems unaware that the hemisphere has fundamentally changed since then.The timing of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was particularly infelicitous. First, Latin American governments, whose response to Venezuela\u2019s dramatic deterioration had been disappointingly slow and tepid, have recently ramped up diplomatic pressure on Mr. Maduro to adhere to the constitution and restore democratic rule.The absence of the United States from the meeting reflected concerns that the conferences\u2019 decisions would seem to have been dictated from Washington. It is also a measure of the declining good will between the United States and the region. Referring to a possible American military option in Venezuela surely did not sit well with governments whose opening paragraph in their declaration emphasized the principle of \u201cnonintervention.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s remark is likely to produce even greater resentment and distrust between the United States and Latin America \u2014 which is already aghast at the rhetoric and policy toward Mexico \u2014 and will complicate efforts for effective action on Venezuela.Most crucially, Mr. Trump\u2019s remark about a military option could backfire in giving a political lifeline to the increasingly desperate Maduro government and in further dividing Venezuela\u2019s opposition. Hugo Chavez, the charismatic leader of the Bolivarian revolution who took office in 1999 and ruled until his death in 2013, repeatedly referred to the \u201cimperio,\u201d or empire, in his attacks against the United States. It was a powerful rallying cry.But over the years the \u201cimperio\u201d line has lost traction with the Venezuelan people. This is, in part, why Mr. Maduro has responded to a collapsing economy with heightened repression. Today, few people in Venezuela believe that the United States is to blame for their widespread misery and hunger. Yet Mr. Trump may have inadvertently boosted Mr. Maduro and given credence to Mr. Chavez\u2019s favorite boogeyman. Predictably, Mr. Maduro and other senior Venezuelan officials have reacted defiantly, invoking the principle of national sovereignty. On Monday, Mr. Maduro asked Venezuelans to prepare themselves \u201cto defend the peace, with tanks, planes and missiles.\u201d He also ordered the armed forces to carry out exercises throughout the country later this month.Mr. Trump\u2019s mention of a military option also puts Venezuela\u2019s opposition in a tough spot, just when it is trying to regroup following the Maduro government\u2019s egregious power grab that installed a new congress, removing any trace of democratic order. Mr. Maduro, and Mr. Chavez before him, have always accused the opposition of being puppets of the United States. Some in the opposition, which is already divided by personality and policy differences, are concerned that their ranks could fracture even further as they respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to military action.It now looks like the president has confused United States policy and given Mr. Maduro a gratuitous gift. Mr. Trump has thrown the opposition off balance, further alienated regional allies, and made his vice president clean up after him. Venezuelans will be the ones to suffer.Michael Shifter is president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy forum on Western Hemisphere affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alaska Warily Eyes Change Bringing Suburbs and Amazon Boxes", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALMER, Alaska \u2014 For years, pet owners in this Anchorage suburb of big homes and lawns have fretted over snares set in the local parks by fur-trappers going after fox, lynx and rabbits. But in a quiet revolution this spring, dog lovers got the upper hand, and after a series of public meetings where few trappers showed up to fight back, trapping was banned by the borough council. The suburbs had won.\u201cThat part of old Alaska is moving further out into the bush,\u201d said Mike Albright, 44, a business owner who was lounging at a park with his three dogs on a recent afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201dAlaska will always be different, if only by its size, climate and the grandeur of its open spaces. Senator Lisa Murkowski\u2019s recent votes against repeal of the Affordable Care Act in Congress also reinforced the perception that people here are go-it-alone independent thinkers, shaped by their far remove from the more settled, politically divided lower 48.But many longtime residents, writers and businesspeople here said that the sense of \u201conly in Alaska\u201d exceptionalism underlying this place and its identity for generations is fading. Improvements in communications and transport are shrinking the sense of physical distance. High-speed internet is reaching tiny villages, opening communities and families to greater connection with the outside world for everything including social media and commerce.\u201cAnchorage doesn\u2019t look that much different than Seattle,\u201d said Chad R. Farrell, a sociology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, referring to the new demographic tide. But, he added, not all Alaskans are comfortable with that idea.Dan Fischer, an artist in the fishing and tourism town of Homer, a five-hour drive south of here, saw a more ambivalent culture change in his corner of the state with the arrival of Amazon Prime and free shipping.\u201cWe gained access, but lost some of our uniqueness,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.Charles Wohlforth, an author and columnist who has written about the state for decades, said the old oil economy propped up the sense by many Alaskans that life was inherently different here, through the blue-collar jobs it created by the thousands and the taxes that oil companies paid. The State Legislature has now been considering new taxes to replace lost revenue from the oil decline, and those taxes look a lot like the ones that people pay in the rest of the country.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be kind of a regular place,\u201d Mr. Wohlforth said. And it won\u2019t, he said, look like the hip, thriving cities of the East and West Coasts. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to look like the middle of the country, which is kind of a declining blue-collar area that has lost its main economic reason to exist and bounces along with whatever we can manage.\u201dVictor Fischer, who came here in 1950 and helped lead the drive for Alaskan statehood in 1959, says the gloomy talk of lost distinctions and decline is wrong. The next chapter of Alaska will be unquestionably different, said Mr. Fischer, who is 93. With fewer oil jobs, there might even be something like a return to the old smaller, tougher state where great jobs didn\u2019t grow on trees, he said. But young people looking for a place with fewer boundaries will still come, he said, and in that there is hope.\u201cThere are young people still coming to Alaska with a gleam in their eye,\u201d said Mr. Fischer, who is no relation to Dan Fischer, the artist. \u201cThey come because Alaska is still a frontier, because they care about the environment, climate change and polar bears,\u201d he said. \u201cSmaller would not necessarily be worse \u2014 in some ways it might be better.\u201dPeople in both parties have said they intend in coming elections to strongly go after native Alaskan voters in rural areas, who have supported both Republicans and Democrats in the past.Out-of-the-way places that once were more likely to fight over the idea of whether or not to have a traffic light have also been pulled into the fray.\u201c \u2018We\u2019re giving to the A.C.L.U. instead,\u2019 \u201d said Sallie Rediske, the group\u2019s president and chairwoman, quoting one donor.Mr. Albright, the park visitor who was sitting with his three dogs (a Yorkie, a Westie and a Pomeranian-poodle crossbreed), said new Alaska and old might not quite have settled their differences, either. For many Alaskans, rules are meant to be broken, he said, and despite the ban on trapping, you still see some traps.\u201cSome people are probably just going to keep doing it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s still Alaska.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Lessons from California", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorStanford, Calif. \u2014 California faces serious risks from climate change. Some are already being felt, like the severe heat this summer and recent episodes of extremely low snowpack in the mountains, which the state depends on for much of its water. Those are among the key messages in a new climate science report now under review in the White House. The good news is that California has been working hard to catch up with the climate change that has already happened, and to get ahead of what is still to come.The past five years have painted a clear picture of what is in store for California, according to numerous scientific studies that underpin the new assessment: Rising temperatures will bring more frequent and severe hot spells, intensifying heat stress; more precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, increasing storm water runoff; snow that does fall will melt earlier in the year, leaving less for the warm, dry season; and more moisture will be drawn out of soils and vegetation, increasing stress on crops and ecosystems. All of this will lead to more frequent and severe water deficits, punctuated by wet periods with increasing flood risk.Add rising sea levels, more extensive flooding during storm surges and the acidification of the coastal ocean, and California faces a phalanx of climate-related dangers to human health, agriculture, industry, economic productivity, and terrestrial and marine ecosystems.As the new report makes clear, California is not the only state facing such risks. However, California has been particularly ambitious in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience in the face of climate change uncertainty. The state\u2019s hard work over the past two decades has yielded several lessons for cities, states and countries that face intensifying climate-related stresses.This goal is ambitious and provides a powerful example for those seeking to simultaneously create jobs, stimulate innovation and reduce emissions. But the reduction still won\u2019t be enough to stabilize the climate. That will require bringing global greenhouse gas emissions effectively down to zero, so still greater reductions will be needed to meet the United Nations targets.In contrast to the obfuscation and denial about climate science by the Trump administration and much of the Republican congressional caucus, California has invested heavily in understanding climate change and in finding \u201cclimate-smart\u201d solutions that can create jobs, improve energy efficiency and decrease emissions, while also building resilience to the climate change that has happened and to a range of possible future outcomes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Dare to Think Big on Climate Change", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe one bright spot amid the generally gloomy news about climate change, and the Trump administration\u2019s resistance to doing anything about it, is the determination of a number of state governments to take action on their own.The nine states require power plants to buy permits to pollute. Over time, these permits decline in quantity. The idea of such cap-and-trade systems is to put a price on emissions, giving utilities an incentive to figure out ways to reduce emissions. Utilities can trade permits with one another. Since it began, the initiative has raised $2.7 billion, which the states have invested in energy efficiency, in helping low-income people pay electricity bills and in renewable sources of power like wind and solar. (The other R.G.G.I. states are Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.)Other states in the area, like Pennsylvania, ought to consider joining, as well. And given the potential for interstate trading of permits, R.G.G.I. might over time connect to California\u2019s recently strengthened cap-and-trade program. The R.G.G.I. agreement will be the subject of a public meeting in Baltimore on Sept. 25, after which states will incorporate it into their laws and regulations.Many of these targets are, at the moment, aspirational. But that does not mean they are unachievable, and in any case their ambition and that of the governors behind them, people like Andrew Cuomo of New York, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Jerry Brown of California, shame President Trump and his appointees.Advertisement"}

How Much Should Big Business Now Love It Back?", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftEven before the damage from Hurricane Harvey is tallied, big corporations are breaking out their checkbooks.The help Houston has given businesses over the years raises an important question: What is the moral obligation of big companies \u2014 especially those that have benefited from a region\u2019s largess \u2014 after such a major disaster?Bob Mitchell, the president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, an organization that represents local businesses, told me that Houston\u2019s big businesses are generally \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the local community. But he said the hurricane\u2019s aftermath would offer the true test.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in the weeks and months to come?\u201d Mr. Mitchell asked. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s more important than what\u2019s happening right this minute.\u201dThe donations announced for Harvey relief are generous by the standards of corporate philanthropy. Some of the donations are smaller, though, than the amounts many companies have gotten from the region\u2019s generous economic development programs.A Chevron spokeswoman said that the company \u201cis proud to have created jobs that added millions of dollars in economic benefit to Houston and the State of Texas.\u201dBut the incentives also help corporate bottom lines. And after a major disaster like Harvey, it seems worth reminding companies that they have flourished, in part, thanks to the Houston area\u2019s generosity.\u201cThose corporations ought to feel some additional obligations, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d said Ben Means, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies corporate governance. \u201cIt\u2019s not because there\u2019s a quid pro quo. They\u2019ve been part of the community, and they have the capacity to help, and they ought to use their resources in socially constructive ways.\u201dExxon Mobil, in an email, said: \u201cIn 2016, together with employees and retirees, the ExxonMobil Foundation and Exxon Mobil Corporation contributed more than $25 million in charitable donations to organizations in the greater Houston area.\u201dDisaster relief isn\u2019t limited to the private sector, of course. Billions of dollars in federal, state and local government money will also be needed to help the area recover from the flooding and other damage. Big businesses, which often have valuable supplies and resources, can still play a useful role. Corporations with offices in and around Houston can provide temporary housing to displaced residents, help transport supplies to flooded areas and offer support to small and medium-size local businesses. Some could also chip in on big infrastructure projects, such as fortified levees, that would help protect the region from future storms.\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility for industry to provide leadership and resources for recovery,\u201d said Sam Brody, a flood expert and professor at Texas A&M University at Galveston. \u201cIt\u2019s not just their facilities. It\u2019s their communities they need to look out for.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to be cynical about the idea of corporate philanthropy, especially in a time of disaster, when companies stand to burnish their images by giving back. But corporations helping Houston recover from the storm\u2019s effects aren\u2019t just acting altruistically or buffing their reputations. They are holding up their end of the deals they made, in which they got financial breaks in exchange for investing in local communities.That investment has never been more vital than now, as companies weigh the responsibility of staying to help Houston versus the benefits of moving to less-waterlogged areas.\u201cIf those corporations stick around more than they would have otherwise,\u201d Mr. Means said, \u201cthat will tell us that these investments in attracting businesses are worthwhile.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Vacation: Printed, Framed and Delivered to Your Door", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayAnd so this year, I explored a few companies (including one that had just been founded when I was testing all those printing services) that allow you to upload a digital photo, have it matted, framed and delivered to your door in a matter of days. After the first framed photo arrived in the mail, I knew I\u2019d never go back to just plain old prints.Below, a look at a few companies that offer printing and framing. And for those who just want a few prints to pin to a cubicle wall or post on a refrigerator, I\u2019ve included some apps and websites that will print your photos for less than a dime and, in some cases, free (though you pay for shipping).The process is easy. I began by clicking the \u201cstart framing\u201d button. Then it was time to upload a photo and crop it. The photo sizes you\u2019re offered are based on your photo\u2019s resolution. (If you already have a print and want it framed, Framebridge will send you prepaid packaging so you can ship it to them.)Now it\u2019s time to choose a frame. If you want some advice, one of the site\u2019s designers will suggest some mat-and-framing combinations (a free service), or you can choose your own frame and mat. Then you\u2019ll see a preview of your framed art, along with the price. If you want to make changes to the mat and the photo size, you can do so from this page. Once you\u2019re happy, you simply add the project to your shopping cart.Shipping is where a lot of photo websites dent your wallet, but I was delighted to find that shipping through Framebridge was included in the price. It also makes you feel like you\u2019re not being nickeled and dimed.My gallery frame arrived at my doorstep nine days after I ordered it, faster than the delivery times of certain companies that only print photos. (If you want expedited shipping, it\u2019s $15 to $40, depending on the size of your art.) I opened the package, which was well-padded, to find the image just as I had hoped it would be: in a crisp, white mat and a white wood frame, ready to be hung on the wall. My printed photo, a 14x18 frame, mat and shipping was $79, and worth every penny.There is shipping and handling, which varies depending on the price of your order and how fast you want it. Shipping a 14x11, deep-set, $99 frame to New York ranged from $18.99 for the least expensive option to $41.99 for the most expensive.But let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want a frame. On the other end of the photo-printing spectrum are small, cheap prints you don\u2019t think twice about putting pushpins through. And there are plenty of places to get them.The app requires access to the photos on your phone, which may be a deal breaker for some. The desktop version allows you to drag an image onto the page so that Printage doesn\u2019t have access to all your photos. You\u2019ll have to sign up with an email address or through Facebook if you want to continue after that. A dozen 4x6 prints were $2.83 and 14 cents tax for a total of $2.97.Bottom line: Cheap, though not necessarily fast, prints are but a few taps away if you\u2019re not a stickler for professional-quality images. If you want your vacation photos framed on your wall, give a printing and framing site a try. My framed photos take me right back to those special trips. Now I just need to get around to hammering some nails.Advertisement"}

The strategy has helped Japan\u2019s exporters but has done little to increase domestic income or spending.That may be changing.Spending by Japanese consumers and businesses contributed more to the latest expansion than trade with the rest of the world did, the data showed, in a positive sign for the outlook of the world\u2019s third largest economy, after the United States and China.Japanese gross domestic product increased by 4 percent in annualized terms in the three months through June, the government\u2019s Cabinet Office said in a preliminary estimate on Monday. The economy has now expanded for six consecutive quarters, the first time it has gone that long without a contraction since the 2005-6 period.The pace of expansion also accelerated from the previous quarter, and was stronger than economists had expected. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast a growth rate of 2.5 percent.From Japan, unusually. Foreign trade had done most of the heavy lifting since the start of the expansion, aided by a broadly recovering global economy and the weak yen. Abenomics calls for Japan\u2019s central bank to inject more money into the financial system. That weakens the country\u2019s currency, which makes Japanese cars, electronics and other products more competitive when sold abroad. Multinationals like Toyota have profited, but the tactic has failed to significantly bolster consumer spending at home.Exports are still crucial to the economy. But Japanese are buying even more goods from abroad: A surge in imports last quarter meant that trade was a net drag on G.D.P.By contrast, the domestic side of the economy jolted to life. Consumer spending grew by 3.7 percent in annualized terms, the data showed, while business investment expanded by nearly 10 percent \u2014 a sign that companies are becoming more optimistic that the good times will last.Japan has the largest public debt in the world, relative to the size of its economy, but ultralow interest rates let the government borrow cheaply. The central bank is, in effect, underwriting public spending by buying up government bonds \u2014 an arrangement criticized as reckless by fiscal conservatives, but welcomed by others who say Japan needs the pump-priming.Advertisement"}

For America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, the biggest problem is at home, not abroad, and its latest view on the economy, released last week, shows it may not have a handle on it.As Fed officials try to make sense of how low unemployment, which should drive up wages and prices, persists side by side with low inflation, most simply assume that inflation will rise by next year as labor demand lifts wages and higher wages lead to rising prices. This belief has led to two interest rate increases so far this year, in effect tapping the brakes on growth to fight inflation, with another rate increase expected this year. A more plausible view is that persistently low inflation shows the economy is more fragile than policy makers want to admit, and needs to be helped, not handicapped.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has fallen short of the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target every month for five years, and decent pay raises for most working people have been few and far between, even as unemployment has dropped by nearly half, to 4.3 percent. The Fed has had to continually pull back its inflation projections.Another sign of weakness is that eight years into an economic expansion, the share of employed workers ages 25 to 54 is less than before the Great Recession.Much of this is beyond the Fed\u2019s control. Among the barriers to employment are the rising use of opioids and dismal job prospects for people who have been arrested or imprisoned. Better drug treatment and health care, and sentencing reform, could help, but they are not within the Fed\u2019s purview. The Fed also cannot create a plan to bolster jobs by rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. Nor can it enact an immigration plan to compensate for an aging population and smaller labor force that can restrict economic growth.The Fed is also not responsible for advancing labor standards that help to lift wages. Republicans oppose a meaningful rise in the minimum wage, which was already inadequate when the current $7.25 hourly rate took effect in 2009. The Trump administration is undermining an Obama-era effort to lift middle-class pay by updating rules for paying time-and-a-half for overtime to salaried workers.That said, the Fed should acknowledge the weakness in the job market and keep rates low until clear signs of wage and price increases emerge. Instead, the Fed seems to be grasping at straws to support the assumption that low unemployment will automatically lead to higher inflation.The Fed has been a deft steward of the economy since the Great Recession. But many Americans are still struggling, and careful thinking, not wishful thinking, is needed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Apple Is Experiencing Another Growth Spurt", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At 41 years old, Apple is a respected elder of the tech industry. But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201dFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.In the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.The iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.In a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201dMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.Even Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.Apple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201dBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.Still, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.The risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said.Advertisement"}

As the group noted on its website, Google\u2019s director of policy communications, Bob Boorstin, emailed the Rose Foundation (a major funder of Consumer Watchdog) complaining about Consumer Watchdog and asking the charity to consider \u201cwhether there might be better groups in which to place your trust and resources.\u201d Mr. Boorstin later apologized for his attempts to cripple a Google critic, but there is no evidence that the use of this kind of tactic has ended.So when these supposedly neutral organizations weigh in on issues that involve Google, you should take their advocacy with a grain of salt. In the coming months, privacy legislation put forward by Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, and modifications to the Safe Harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act advocated by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, will come before Congress. Google does not want either of these laws to pass, and you can be sure that papers from major think tanks will be part of the policy discussion.Perhaps more important, the discussion that is beginning to take place on both sides of the political aisle on whether companies like Google and Amazon are too big will continue.

{"Headline": "New Worries About Storm Damage as Beaumont\u2019s Drinking Water Shuts Off", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith drinking water cut off, its river still rising, and most routes in and out of the city flooded, Beaumont suffered the worst of Texas\u2019 hardships on Thursday, and they showed no sign of abating.Flooding shut down the pumping plants that supply water to Beaumont in the morning, prompting a hospital to transport its patients out of the city, and trucks carrying bottled water struggled to reach the largely isolated city.The Neches River surged far beyond its banks, into streets, houses and businesses in the city of almost 120,000 people 70 miles east-northeast of Houston, reaching six feet above the previous record by afternoon, the National Weather Service reported. It was projected to rise another foot by Friday afternoon.The loss of water was just one of a host of new dangers emerging in the aftermath of Harvey, a storm system that pounded southeast Texas with record rainfall for several days before blowing across Louisiana and into Mississippi. Once a Category 4 hurricane, Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical depression.A series of small explosions shook a chemical plant about 25 miles northeast of downtown Houston on Thursday and more blasts were expected, after floodwaters shut down the cooling systems that kept the chemicals stable. Twenty-one emergency workers were treated for exposure to the resulting fumes and smoke, which were described as a lung and eye irritant.It appeared that the health and safety risk from the plant was limited. But in a region dotted with chemical factories, oil refineries and natural gas plants, the explosions at the Arkema plant near Crosby, Tex., underscore the worries that many people have about the lingering dangers that damage from the storm poses to the region\u2019s infrastructure, economy and health.Houston officials ordered mandatory evacuation of areas around the Barker Reservoir, as flooding from that basin, and the nearby Addicks Reservoir, continued to pour into neighborhoods on the city\u2019s western edge. In other parts of the city, floodwaters receded, exposing countless losses and new hazards, like ruined and abandoned vehicles blocking roads, damaged electrical systems, and mold.As residents of the region tried to assess the damage and some returned to their homes, weather forecasters had some bad news: More rain is expected early next week.Read the words of people who requested rescue online.More updates:\u2022 Local officials blamed the storm for 39 deaths in Texas, cautioning that the number could go higher.\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence and other cabinet officials visited the region to meet with storm survivors.\u2022 President Trump plans to donate $1 million to help storm victims in Texas and Louisiana, the White House announced.\u2022 Tom Bossert, the White House official who is spearheading the administration\u2019s storm response, estimated that 100,000 houses in Texas and Louisiana have been damaged or destroyed, and said Mr. Trump will seek billions in aid in the coming weeks.\u2022 More than 30,000 people remained in shelters in the region. Houston fire officials said they would begin going door to door to search for victims, a process that could take up to two weeks. \u201cThe shelter mission is the biggest battle that we have right now,\u201d said Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u2022 FEMA reported that 95,745 people in Texas had been approved for emergency assistance, including rent, repairs and lost property. The agency has so far paid out about $57 million.Arkema officials said the site had been without power since Sunday and the water was six feet deep in some areas. Organic peroxides stored there need to be refrigerated or they become unstable. With a storage warehouse warming up, the crew transferred the chemicals to diesel-powered refrigerated trailers.But the backup generators flooded as well, and the units apparently warmed to the point where the chemicals, which are used in making plastic and other materials, exploded overnight.The blasts were not expected to affect chemicals in other parts of the plant, said Mr. Rennard, the company official, and the company was able to monitor the status of the containers remotely.Vice President Pence and several cabinet officials arrived to a sunny, hot and humid Corpus Christi around midday before heading to nearby Rockport to speak with victims of the storm.\u201cThe American people are with you,\u201d he told a crowd outside a Rockport church that was damaged by the storm. \u201cWe are here today, we will be here tomorrow and we will be here every day until this city and this state and this region rebuild bigger and better than ever before.\u201dAbout 21,000 federal workers have been mobilized in response to the storm and Congress is expected to debate passage of a multibillion-dollar emergency aid package in the coming weeks.Mr. Trump, who visited the area earlier in the week, is expected to return to Texas on Saturday.Taps in Beaumont ran dry, and officials there said they could not predict when homes and businesses in the city of almost 120,000 residents would have running water again. The city manager, Kyle Hayes, said at a midday news conference that he would not be able to assess flood damage to the city\u2019s water pumps, or give a timeline for fixing them, until water began to recede, which he said would happen no earlier than Saturday. He added that the city was working on setting up bottled water distribution centers.The storm dropped 47 inches of rain in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area, and most roads into the cities remain impassable, making relief shipments of bottled water difficult.The city\u2019s Baptist Beaumont Hospital began to transport most of its 193 patients by ambulance and helicopter to other hospitals outside the area, and to discharge those who could safely go home, said Mary Poole, a hospital spokeswoman.Christus Southeast Texas-St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont decided not to evacuate, but until the city water supply resumes, it will only admit new patients who need critical or emergency care, officials there said.State figures showed nearly 150,000 water connections were affected by boil-water notices. Nearly 32,000 of those connections were in Victoria, which has struggled to provide clean water since late last week. Bryan Simons, a spokesman for the county\u2019s emergency operations center, said part of the delay was the state process to recertify the system after concerns about its integrity arose.\u201cOur community is very understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand the circumstances behind it. They\u2019re sort of just rolling with it at this point.\u201dParts of Houston began to dry out, exposing daunting expanses of muck, vehicles and waterlogged homes, but other areas of the city remained under water or impassable. Rescues of stranded people continued, though at a much-reduced pace.Some people tried to go back to homes they had fled, but officials urged caution and patience.With much of the nation\u2019s oil refining capacity shut down by the storm, a fuel shortage began to be felt across the region, which experts said will continue for weeks. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, warned gas stations not to take advantage of consumers. The attorney general\u2019s office has received more than 500 complaints, including cases in Dallas where customers were charged $6 to $8 per gallon.Record flooding continued on the Buffalo Bayou in the western suburbs, a surge that will eventually flow downstream through Houston and pose a continued risk to parts of the city. In addition, the Addicks and Barker reservoirs continued to release water into the Buffalo Bayou.The city advised people to wash their hands after coming into contact with floodwaters, which may carry toxic chemicals and diseases, and warned against eating any food that had come into contact with the water. Some trash collections resumed.The Houston Independent School District announced that classes would not resume until Sept. 11. Superintendent Richard Carranza said that more than 10 percent of the city\u2019s schools sustained water damage or lost power. The district relaxed its school uniform rules through January. All of the city\u2019s public school students, regardless of family income, will be eligible for three free meals per day for the entire school year.When Hurricane Harvey made landfall, its winds smashed some things and spared others. Houses were pushed off their foundations, while shacks next door were spared. Big trees stood as small trees toppled.At Spanky\u2019s Liquor on the main street of Port Aransas, the windows shattered, the walls collapsed. \u201cThe roof? It\u2019s about 100 feet that way,\u201d the owner, Tom Hamilton, said as he paused from sweeping up the pieces and pointed toward a house with a boat capsized against the porch and a surfboard lodged in a tree.But nearly every bottle of liquor was still intact on the shelves now open to the sky.Like many on the island, Mr. Hamilton and his staff were beginning the long ordeal of loss and recovery. Christy Lambert pulled out her phone to find a photo of her home in Aransas Pass, just across the bay. There was nothing left but a single kitchen wall. Most of her possessions had blown away.\u201cWhen I saw it, I cried, I cried for hours,\u201d said Ms. Lambert, who fled the storm and returned on Monday.\u201cI don\u2019t really have anything but a few things I packed and $40,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to come back from that, but as long as I can keep working, I\u2019ll be O.K.\u201dReporting was contributed by Rick Rojas from Beaumont, Tex.; Dave Philipps from Port Aransas, Tex.; Alan Blinder from Houston; and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Henry Fountain, Timothy Williams, Niraj Chokshi, Jonah Engel Bromwich and from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Of Course Abortion Should Be a Litmus Test for Democrats", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI relate to the flailing panic that is no doubt undergirding such a morally putrescent idea. Nineteen hyenas and a broken vacuum cleaner control the White House, and ice is becoming extinct. I get it. I am desperate and afraid as well. I am prepared to make leviathan compromises to pull us back from that brink. But there is no recognizable version of the Democratic Party that does not fight unequivocally against half its constituents\u2019 being stripped of ownership of their own bodies and lives. This issue represents everything Democrats purport to stand for.To legislatively oppose abortion is to be, at best, indifferent to the disenfranchisement, suffering and possibly even the death of women. At worst it is to revel in those things, to believe them fundamental to the natural order. Where, exactly, on that spectrum is Luj\u00e1n comfortable placing his party?Democratic candidates are perfectly welcome to refrain from terminating their own pregnancies. But to be anti-choice on a policy level is absolutely indefensible from an economic justice, racial justice, gender justice and human rights standpoint. And if the Democratic Party does not stand for any of those things, then what on earth is it?It\u2019s true that the left will have to choose (and soon) between absolute ideological purity and the huge numbers required to seize the rudder of the nation and avert global catastrophe. But abortion is not valid fodder for such compromise, nor is racism, nor is L.G.B.T.Q. equality, nor is any issue that puts people\u2019s fundamental humanity up for debate. Abortion is not a fringe issue. Abortion is liberty.I hear from some people on the left that Donald Trump\u2019s victory was at least partially the fault of \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2014 of feminists pushing too hard, of Black Lives Matter being too aggressive, of trans people needing to go to the bathroom \u2014 as though the violent suppression of a movement points more toward its irrelevance than its necessity. What the Democrats need to do, I often hear, is to move away from issues of \u201cidentity\u201d and toward purer, broader issues of economic equality.But there is no model of economic equality that does not reckon with \u201cidentity politics.\u201d There is no economic equality without the ability to terminate a pregnancy. There is no economic equality without the overthrow of white supremacy. What good is an economic opportunity if large swaths of the population can\u2019t access it? Telling minority groups that it\u2019s their responsibility to sit back and wait, to subordinate their needs for the good of the party \u2014 that implies that \u201cthe party\u201d is not theirs as much as everyone else\u2019s. And it sounds a lot like the people we\u2019re trying to defeat.Yes, abortion does draw certain groups to the polls. Trump\u2019s success among evangelicals can almost certainly be attributed to their belief that he will appoint justices who will bring about the end of Roe v. Wade (a promise that, it seems, with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, he intends to fulfill). But that is why Republicans vote; it\u2019s not why Democrats vote.Abortion is not controversial on the left. So what does it say that so many lefty men are willing to scrap it in an attempt to pander to some vague fantasy of a vast, disgruntled, anti-choice center? What kind of cringing, bewildered invertebrates roll over and capitulate to the losing side of a debate at a time when they\u2019ve never had more leverage? What contortionist of logic came up with the proposal that alienating 75 percent of one\u2019s constituents, and declaring half to not deserve control over their bodies, can strengthen a party\u2019s numbers? This is not broadening our coalition; it\u2019s flagrantly shrinking it.There has never been a more opportune moment for the Democratic Party to demand compromise \u2014 not from the left but from the center. What are anti-choice Democrats going to do? Become Republicans? Now? Jump into the abattoir of clown meat whose top policy priority seems to be \u201cpoor people deserve to die of preventable diseases\u201d?Come on, Democrats. Be something. Unite and move left. The center will follow or lose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Blowhard Blow Us Up?", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A couple of chubby brats with big missiles and short fuses.Is nuclear winter coming?Fire and fury, the likes of which the world has never seen, are bellowing from a posh golf club in New Jersey while fire and doom emanate from a medieval police state in Asia.Ever since Donald Trump was elected, the mandarins and chatterers of the capital have been alarmed that we would get to this precipice of blustery, threatening exchanges between Trump and Kim Jong-un about thermonuclear annihilation, and that when we did, it would be parlous.Fear, Xanax and Ambien abound here.The rest of what Trump does may be loudmouth blather, but this is real. Now, in the advanced beginner stage of his presidency, he faces the most severe test since the Cuban missile crisis.As the Obama defense secretary Leon Panetta told Wolf Blitzer in an emotional interview Friday night, this is not reality TV or a time for \u201cloose talk\u201d: \u201cWhat I\u2019m sensing here is a situation that could get out of control\u201d and lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in South Korea. So much for John Kelly curbing the crazy.The jitters of world leaders and markets were not soothed by the fact sheet issued by Guam\u2019s homeland security office \u2014 after North Korea said it would launch a missile strike toward that American territory and Trump riposted that would mean \u201cbig, big trouble in North Korea.\u201dTwo of the admonitions are: \u201cDo not look at the flash or fireball \u2014 it can blind you\u201d and \u201cDo not use conditioner in your hair because it will bind radioactive material to your hair.\u201dAdministration officials have been trying to reassure journalists that James Mattis, John Kelly and Rex Tillerson have a pact designed to ensure that one of them is always in the country to watch over Trump in case he goes off the deep end.In all my interviews of Trump over the years, he never seemed very chesty about foreign intervention. \u201cIf only we could have Saddam back, as bad as he was, rather than $2 trillion spent, thousands of lives lost and all these wounded warriors,\u201d he told me during the campaign.His pitch was mostly about turning inward, so America could shore up its economy, security and infrastructure. \u201cUnlike other candidates, war and aggression will not be my first instinct,\u201d he said in his maiden foreign policy speech on the trail.But the White House brings out a lot of gremlins in presidents as they deal with the wind shear of history. Now, in case North Korea is too far away, Trump is threatening \u201ca possible military option\u201d closer to home, in Venezuela.Watching Trump, 71, and Kim, 33, trade taunts is particularly disturbing because they mirror each other in so many unhinged ways. Trump is a democratically elected strongman and Kim is a fratricidal despot, but they both live in bizarro fantasy worlds where lying and cheating is the norm.They\u2019re both spoiled scions who surpassed less ruthless older brothers to join their authoritarian fathers in the family business. They both make strange fashion statements with their hair and enjoy bullying and hyperbole. They both love military parades, expect \u201cDear Leader\u201d displays of fawning and favor McDonald\u2019s and Madonna.They both demand allegiance. When Trump feels he isn\u2019t getting it or paranoia takes over, he publicly mocks his lieutenants or jettisons them. Kim simply gets out his antiaircraft machine guns and calls up his nerve-agent assassins. He had his uncle killed for, among the reasons, clapping halfheartedly, The Times reported.Pyongyang goaded Trump on Friday with this nutty line: \u201cWe consider the U.S. no more than a lump which we can beat to a jelly any time.\u201d\u201cKim understands Trump better than Trump understands himself,\u201d Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio told me. \u201cHe is only comfortable dominating and forcing others into submission. When that\u2019s not happening, he experiences an almost physical discomfort because he feels unsafe.

But with exit negotiations underway in Brussels, Britain\u2019s longer-term plans for trade ties with the European Union remain as unconvincing as ever.For months, Britain\u2019s cabinet has been divided between those like Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who want to prioritize the interests of the economy over control of immigration, and the hard-line supporters for Britain\u2019s exit, or Brexit, who are eager to sever ties with the bloc without regard to the economic ramifications.On Tuesday, Mr. Hammond seemed to emerge the victor in one battle, securing cabinet support for the soft transition from membership of the customs union. Introducing the plan, David Davis, Britain\u2019s main Brexit negotiator, noted that other European Union nations, which export more goods to Britain than it sends back, have an interest in making it work.Under the proposal, Britain would quit the customs union, but seek to join something almost identical for a period. During that time, it would want to be allowed to sign \u2014 but not put into effect \u2014 trade deals with other partners.That stipulation \u2014 like everything else \u2014 has to be agreed upon with the other 27 European governments, which may oppose such a move. And experts say that countries like the United States or India would not be in a position to strike trade deals with Britain until they know more about its future economic relationship with the European Union.In any event, the British plan was given a cool reception by European Union officials, who said there would be no negotiations on that point until \u201cdivorce\u201d issues have been settled, like the exit bill London would have to pay and the rights European Union citizens in Britain would have. Hence, the talk about \u201cfantasy\u201d from Mr. Verhofstadt.More important, the lack of any convincing scheme for the longer term underscores the unresolved divisions in the government over whether Britain should gamble with its ties to the giant European economic free trade area on its doorstep in the hope of negotiating separate agreements that would limit the damage from leaving the customs union, in part or even entirely.Supporters of Brexit fought back, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker, who argued that Mr. Chapman wanted to overturn the will of the people, and said that rather than the Democrats, his party should more accurately be called the Oligarchs.Meanwhile, what Britain wants from long-term Brexit trade negotiations \u2014 let alone what it can get \u2014 seems almost as opaque as ever, with Tuesday\u2019s document suggesting two strikingly different options.One would allow for very different British and European Union customs systems, but rely on technology to prevent trucks backing up at ports \u2014 a challenge for which Britain and its neighbors would certainly need to prepare.The second, \u201cpartnership\u201d approach would align some British and European Union rules, doing away with any customs border between Britain and the European Union at all, as at present. The British government acknowledged that it would be \u201cchallenging\u201d to do this in a way that was compatible with Britain\u2019s desire to strike broader global trade deals.Keir Starmer, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on Brexit, argued that the cabinet remained \u201csplit on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\u201d\u201cThese fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\u201d Mr. Starmer said in a statement.Though Mr. Davis insisted that discussions in Brussels were going well, even he made little attempt to conceal the scale of the task ahead when asked about the pace of talks.\u201cThis is probably the most complex negotiation in history,\u201d he told the BBC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Audi Engineer Implicates Superiors in Diesel Case, Lawyer Says", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A cloud of suspicion hanging over Volkswagen thickened on Monday after a lawyer for a jailed former engineer said his client implicated top managers of the German carmaker\u2019s Audi luxury brand in a continuing diesel cheating scandal.The steady drip of revelations shows how difficult it has been for Volkswagen to move beyond the emissions scandal, nearly two years after it first became public. On the contrary, the scandal has only widened.Volkswagen, which has admitted to outfitting its diesels in the United States with software to evade emissions rules, has paid out tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements over the deception, and several executives have been arrested. Now, its operations in Europe are coming under greater scrutiny, as prosecutors attempt to pressure lower-level employees, like Mr. Pamio, to testify against their superiors.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Mr. Pamio has told prosecutors in Munich that top Audi managers were aware as early as 2006 that vehicles made by the division could not meet American and European emissions standards, according to Walter Lechner, a defense attorney for the former Audi engineer. The cars could not carry an adequate supply of a urea solution known as AdBlue used to neutralize harmful tailpipe fumes.Like its parent company, Audi solved the problem of faulty pollution equipment by deploying software that fooled regulators. The cars were programmed to deliver low emissions during conditions that matched those used during compliance tests. At other times, Volkswagen has admitted in court, the cars polluted far more than allowed.Prosecutors have interviewed Mr. Pamio 10 times, Mr. Lechner said, and will speak to him again later this week. Mr. Pamio has also provided investigators with emails and other documents to substantiate his verbal testimony, according to the defense attorney. In addition, Mr. Pamio has spoken to United States investigators, Mr. Lechner said.Spokesmen for Audi and Volkswagen said on Monday that they could not comment on a continuing investigation.Mr. Pamio has been held in a Munich jail since July at the request of American investigators, who are expected to file a formal request for extradition in the coming days. Mr. Pamio is at least the third former Volkswagen employee to cooperate with investigators, a number that is likely to rise.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. Lechner, the defense attorney, declined to say which managers Mr. Pamio implicated. The testimony covers a period beginning in 2006, when Martin Winterkorn was chief executive of Audi and chairman of the unit\u2019s management board. A year later, he became chief executive of Volkswagen, and was replaced by Rupert Stadler, who had previously been the Audi board member responsible for finance.Mr. Winterkorn resigned in September 2015 after the emissions cheating scandal came to light, but Mr. Stadler has remained in his post as chief executive of Audi. Mr. Stadler, who is also a member of the Volkswagen management board, is not officially considered a suspect, said Karin Jung, a spokeswoman for the Munich state attorney\u2019s office.A lawyer for Mr. Winterkorn did not reply to a request for comment.Current members of Volkswagen\u2019s leadership also have ties to Audi during the time period covered by Mr. Pamio\u2019s testimony. Matthias M\u00fcller, who replaced Mr. Winterkorn as chief executive of Volkswagen, was head of product management at Audi until 2007, when he assumed the same position at the Volkswagen brand. Mr. M\u00fcller has said he had no knowledge of the illegal software.German prosecutors are investigating about 40 people. The vast majority are German citizens who according to German law cannot be extradited to the United States. As a citizen of Italy living in Germany, Mr. Pamio does not enjoy the same protections.Mr. Lechner said Mr. Pamio was suffering in jail and being treated unfairly by authorities simply because he is Italian.\u201cHe is the only one who has cooperated fully,\u201d the lawyer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Developmentally Disabled, and Going to College", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "Supported byHalf a dozen students, some in Syracuse University T-shirts, sat around a conference table joking about appropriate job interview outfits. No bathing suits, pajamas or Halloween costumes. Added their instructor, not joking: \u201cNo tank tops.\u201dThen Brianna Shults, leading the workshop with a kindhearted but no-nonsense approach, launched into the Q. and A. section. \u201cSo if I identify my interview outfit, should I wear it to bed the night before so I\u2019m all dressed and ready?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d the group responded in unison.\u201cAnd before you put your clothes on, what\u2019s the most important step?\u201d\u201cShower!\u201d a few called out.Ms. Shults, an internship and employment coordinator, closed the conversation with a sartorial tip that experience has taught her needs mentioning: \u201cNo dirty clothes!\u201dWhy not? Meghan Muscatello piped in: \u201cBecause then you\u2019d be smelly.\u201d The room erupted in laughter. \u201cAnd if you have a cat or a dog, make sure you leave it hanging so they don\u2019t get it all hairy.\u201dThe students \u2014 about 60 are expected this fall \u2014 have various degrees of disability, often with related developmental disorders. One communicates through a picture board and an iPad; a helper supports her arm as she taps out words. Another, a movie buff who wrote a play for his theater class, has Asperger\u2019s syndrome. A sports enthusiast who interned this past spring with the Syracuse Orange men\u2019s basketball team has Down syndrome.During the first three years, the students choose \u201cmajors\u201d and audit five to six college classes that align with their interests. They complete homework and take tests, ungraded, with the help of note takers, who are supplied by the university to sit with them in class. Popular majors: disability studies, sport management and food studies. Favorite classes: first aid, \u201cAnimals and Society\u201d and \u201cPeoples and Cultures of the World.\u201d The students also take a spattering of electives, like hip-hop dance, jewelry-making and photography. For their fourth year, they intern on campus. All the while, they attend workshops \u2014 on email etiquette, workplace chitchat and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing \u2014 and spend time with student volunteers at trampoline parks, basketball games and pizza parlors. The goal: to become employable.Fifty years ago, young people with intellectual disabilities were often institutionalized or kept home, out of the public eye. Thanks to 1975 legislation now called the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, more than 90 percent of them now go to public schools with mainstream students.And that, experts say, has altered expectations around what they ought to achieve.Brian Skotko, the co-director of the Down syndrome program at Massachusetts General Hospital, sees 250 patients with the condition a year. He makes this observation: \u201cParents with newborn babies now want to know, \u2018What are the possibilities for school? What are the college and independent living opportunities?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe hope for their children is that they can learn to shoulder jobs and live quality lives.Today, there are some 265 work-readiness college programs for students like the ones at InclusiveU, according to Think College, a federally funded coordinating center at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. That\u2019s a big leap from 2004, when there were just 25. Unlike programs for high-functioning students on the autism spectrum, these award certificates, not degrees.What the students want upon graduation are good jobs, not short-term gigs restocking shelves or handing out fliers on street corners but employment that relates to their interests and plays to their strengths. Therapists, economists and philosophers have long equated happy, fulfilling lives with meaningful work, no matter one\u2019s intellectual ability.Syracuse University, which has offered a loosely monitored class-auditing program since 2009, has struggled to get its students paid positions. It has not tracked employment, but informal interviews with 30 certificate recipients indicated that only about a third were employed for at least two days a week this past spring, making at least a minimum wage. One graduate had landed a position in the campus parking permit office after an internship there. Not so lucky was a 2012 graduate who got a job wearing a billboard sign outside a pizza chain. He promptly quit. Another did volunteer work checking patients in at a hospice.To improve outcomes, the university overhauled the program in 2014, rebranding it as InclusiveU. And with a $2 million federal grant, Ms. Shults was hired to design the internship year and workshop curriculum, which replaced a fourth year that had been purely academic. The first class will graduate in 2019, but already Cate Weir, Think College\u2019s program director, cites InclusiveU as a model.Beth A. Myers, the director of the Taishoff Center, said that students in the newly revised program begin brainstorming their career plans when they arrive as freshmen, and are guided to think deeply about their interests, their strengths and their weaknesses.The challenge is striking an honest balance between being too optimistic and not stretching them enough. \u201cLow expectations is a serious issue with this population,\u201d said Bud Buckhout, who oversees the program. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to overwhelm people, either.\u201dFor some, striking that balance has led to disappointment. Bob Pangborn, a 22-year-old dramaturge with autism, spent his teens performing in community theater. At Syracuse he learned that acting was an unreliable profession. He was encouraged to consider something more practical, like ushering at a movie theater.5 PhotosThe conversations led Kaitlyn O\u2019Reilly, who was born with a rare chromosome abnormality, to take a disability studies class popular among sociology majors. Her end-of-semester assignment was an evaluation of campus crosswalks unfriendly to visually impaired students. She and her note taker had created a map showing where to put raised street markings and audio boxes.The room was silent as Ms. O\u2019Reilly, who has a speech impairment that can make it difficult to understand her, stood next to a podium and went through the locations on the map, displayed on a whiteboard.\u201cThese ones are good, these ones are bad and these ones are half not O.K., half good,\u201d she said, pointing at green, yellow and red dots on the map \u2014 a color-coded grading scale.After her presentation, her professor wondered if crosswalks deep inside the campus were more problematic than ones in areas popular with visitors. Ms. O\u2019Reilly said yes. Then a student told the class that she herself had noticed how unsafe one of the crosswalks Ms. O\u2019Reilly had mentioned was, even for students who are not impaired. Ms. O\u2019Reilly nodded knowingly. \u201cYeah, you don\u2019t know where you can walk across the street.\u201dMs. O\u2019Reilly, who is in her first year in the program, said the presentation had given her a sense of her own power. \u201cI felt very proud of myself,\u201d she told me. Ms. Shults sees her getting an internship at one of the campus\u2019s disability centers. Ms. O\u2019Reilly says she thinks she\u2019d like to work with children.Ms. Muscatello, who at 28 is in her final year, knows exactly what kind of career she wants. She envisions herself in an office wearing nice clothes, answering phones, filing papers and having lunch with colleagues.InclusiveU helped her develop that vision.With an I.Q. around 65, she finds simple things like work manuals and basic textbooks challenging. Big words confuse her, and her math skills don\u2019t go past third grade. But she is funny and warm, with an easy smile. She likes Harry Potter books, natural disaster movies and her cat. And \u201cI love it here,\u201d she said of the campus.Ms. Muscatello spent her teens in a special program in high school and then entered a life skills program for students with intellectual disabilities. On completion, she landed a job at a Price Chopper, stocking shelves. At first, she liked unloading jars of applesauce and cans of tomato soup. But eventually the work felt demeaning.When mayonnaise jars broke or one-pound bags of flour cracked open, it was Ms. Muscatello who was asked to do the cleanup. \u201cI\u2019d go home all covered in flour,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could stick me in the oven and bake me like a cake.\u201d She would cut her hands when cleaning up glass. Her mother, a labor and delivery nurse, wanted more-challenging work for her daughter and more respect. \u201cI wanted more of a people job for her.\u201d Ms. Muscatello did, too.This past year, she participated in three campus internships. In the fall, she interned in the repair shop. The first few days, the program\u2019s job coach shadowed her as she learned how to fill out work order forms when complaints came in that light switches or elevators weren\u2019t working. Once on her own, Ms. Muscatello found the work manageable but boring. For her second job, she worked in the day care center reading to preschoolers, helping them with yoga poses and, once, calming them when a raccoon got stuck in the playground. But she found the work exhausting.She found her sweet spot in her third internship, working as an assistant in the quiet, carpeted offices of the Institute for Veterans and Military Families. The hope was that maybe she could stay on after the internship.I first met Ms. Muscatello in the office break room at the institute. She was learning how to deliver mail and deal with the stubborn paper shredder, and trying to remember who was whose assistant.When an officemate teased her that the boxes she was delivering might be too heavy for her, she insisted: \u201cI\u2019m capable of carrying some of the heavy boxes.\u201d She does not want to be underestimated.\u2022Once the group had settled in the auditorium, Paul Cavanagh, the senior director, told parents about the 3:1 student-to-staff ratio, the extensive job training (traditional college classes, internships at nearby hotels and restaurants) and life skills classes (banking, budgeting, cooking, apartment living). But the school has not kept records of postgraduate employment.Parents took notes. During the questions segment, one parent wanted to know whether there were enough athletic activities. (Yes, baseball and volleyball games are organized by the students.) Was there an I.Q. cutoff? (No.) What is the screen-time policy? (Students manage their own screen use.)Touring classrooms, computer labs and a coffee house where students hold meetings, talent nights and parties, parents talked about their dreams and concerns. A New Jersey mother of an 18-year-old with a developmental disability thought the time away from home would be good. \u201cFor him, not me,\u201d she said woefully.Many of the parents said they were looking for something new for their sons or daughters: an environment where not everybody catered to their every whim, where they were allowed to stumble a bit and take some risks, which they hoped would allow them to build the kind of resilience necessary for independent lives and fulfilling jobs.New York Institute of Technology has the priciest of the programs, at $50,730 in tuition a year (plus $12,220 for room and board). The Syracuse program averages around $23,200, depending on what classes a student takes. (It will host its first boarder this fall.) Both fees include the cost of mentors and note takers. Nationally, the average cost without support staff, according to Think College, is $11,000.Some take issue with the programs for supporting what they consider an impractical but prevalent idea \u2014 that everyone should go to college \u2014 and giving students a false sense of academic accomplishment while costing taxpayers and parents. Instead, they believe these students ought to be funneled into more cost-effective and targeted vocational training programs and apprenticeships.\u201cIf we are going to really help people with significant disabilities, it\u2019s not by pretending they can go to college and do college work,\u201d said James M. Kauffman, a professor emeritus of education at the University of Virginia who has written extensively on special education.Ms. Weir of Think College says such thinking too narrowly defines how a college education benefits students, ignoring much of the socio-emotional learning that happens for those in their late teens and 20s \u2014 with disabilities and without \u2014 while clocking time on a campus. Further, she says, just because students don\u2019t get 100 percent of what is taught in a class does not mean they haven\u2019t benefited.\u201cThis isn\u2019t for everybody,\u201d Ms. Weir said. \u201cBut it should be a choice. Students with disabilities shouldn\u2019t be told, \u2018You can\u2019t have a choice other people have.\u2019\u2009\u201dBut even as she stridently supports the existence of the programs, Ms. Weir concedes that there are serious challenges. Programs are not accredited, leaving many families more or less in the dark about their quality. For the past few years, a 15-person task force organized by Think College has worked to develop a set of accreditation standards. The report was delivered to Congress last year. Ms. Weir says the next step is to persuade colleges to agree to an accreditation process.Advocates say that the biggest issue isn\u2019t so much with the programs as with the work force. Many employers worry about the expense and training required when hiring someone with a disability. And low-skilled jobs that might have once been appropriate for this population are disappearing in our increasingly tech-centered economy.Jonathan Lucus, managing director of the Arc, a job-training service that connects companies with applicants who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, says college programs need to do intense outreach with local businesses. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to constantly go out there,\u201d he said, \u201cand shake hands and greet people and kiss babies and talk to these employers and say: \u2018Look what we are doing. How can we work together?\u2019\u2009\u201dMs. Muscatello\u2019s journey illustrates how hard that can be.When I went to visit her a second time at her internship, she was sitting quietly behind the front desk dressed in black slacks and golf shirt. She had a laminated cheat sheet on the desk by her side that her job coach, Angela McPheeters, had made for her. It had all the staff names, their job titles and their extensions in large print.An administrative assistant sat by her side, giving her the day\u2019s assignment: to empty black binders that had been used for a recent conference, remove the tabs, and place them in a box on the floor. Ms. Muscatello also worked the phones. But when she picked up a call for someone in the entrepreneurship office, she got confused and couldn\u2019t say the word. Another time, pressing the buttons gave her trouble. Her supervisor had told her that if she got better with the phones, there was a good chance they\u2019d hire her.When Ms. McPheeters got wind of this, she sent Ms. Muscatello home to practice with a photocopy of a telephone with the numbers pad on it and her cheat sheet. She spent days on it, after work and on weekends, announcing: \u201cHi, I.V.M.F. This is Meghan. Can I help you?\u201d She tapped on the paper numbers with her index finger, as if she were transferring the calls.But when the semester ended, the supervisor said that funding had been cut and they were not going to be able to hire Ms. Muscatello. \u201cI was a little bit disappointed,\u201d she told me.A few weeks later, in a cap-and-gown ceremony at a chapel on the main quad, this year\u2019s graduates received their certificates. One now has a job doing clerical work in a municipal office. Another has a position as a shop technician at a carpet cleaning company.As for Ms. Muscatello, she spent weeks eagerly waiting, her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, letter of recommendation and interview outfits, free of cat hair, ready to go. Then one morning she was called in for an interview \u2014 and aced it. This month she is expected to begin working the front desk at a YMCA. She got her dream job.An article on Page 16 this weekend about students with developmental disabilities in special college programs refers incorrectly to a legislative act passed in 1975 that opened the way for such students to attend mainstream classes. When it became law, it was the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (and was later reauthorized as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act); it was not known as the Individuals With Disabilities Act in 1975 or at any other time.Kyle Spencer writes frequently for The Times on education.

{"Headline": "As Europe Sours on Diesel, Germany Fights to Save It", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Britain and France want to end the sale of diesel cars. Madrid and Athens are banning them entirely. Automakers like Volvo are switching to electric engines.In Germany, those developments have created something akin to a national emergency, threatening an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people.As others have increased investment in electric cars and pushed tougher rules threatening diesel, though, German auto executives and political leaders meeting in Berlin on Wednesday appeared determined to rescue the technology.After a largely stage-managed meeting \u2014 described as a \u201cdiesel summit\u201d \u2014 they announced plans to update the software in 5 million cars to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, the byproduct of diesel most harmful to human health.The German manufacturers also said they would contribute to a fund worth 500 million euros, or $590 million, to finance measures to reduce urban pollution, for example by modernizing bus fleets or building bike paths.Most of the software upgrades had already been announced by the German manufacturers, while politicians and automotive executives alike rejected calls by environmental groups to force carmakers to add antipollution hardware like better catalytic converters. And they were unanimous in opposing plans by some cities to ban diesels from downtown areas.\u201cThe government\u2019s chumminess with the auto industry continues,\u201d Oliver Krischer, a leader of the opposition Green Party, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWhile China, California, Norway and many others are tackling electromobility, the government is turning Germany into a diesel museum.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In fact, as far as auto industry leaders were concerned on Wednesday, diesel remained central to their ambitions.\u201cFuture mobility will definitely depend on state-of-the-art diesels as well,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, the chief executive of BMW, said in a statement. The carmaker said it would offer a bonus of up to \u20ac2,000 to anyone who traded in an older diesel vehicle for a new BMW electric or hybrid car \u2014 or a diesel that met the latest emissions standards. Volkswagen and other carmakers said they would offer similar incentives.Wednesday\u2019s meeting between ministers, state leaders and car company chiefs was an attempt to contain a crisis of confidence that threatens Germany\u2019s most important industry, and perhaps even its national identity, ahead of elections next month.Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW confront growing public outrage domestically and overseas for underplaying the health effects of diesel fumes and, in at least some cases, misleading customers about how much harmful nitrogen oxides their cars produce in everyday use.Leaders of both major political parties, meanwhile, face criticism that they have been too cozy with carmakers, blocking stricter European Union regulation of diesel emissions while providing tax breaks on diesel fuel.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under particular pressure ahead of the election on Sept. 24, in which she is seeking a fourth term in office. She has a long record of advocating for the auto industry, once even complaining about California\u2019s strict limits on vehicle emissions while visiting the state\u2019s governor at the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger.Despite the announcements, there were hints of conflict among the participants at Wednesday\u2019s meeting.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Horst Seehofer, prime minister of the state of Bavaria, called for the government to provide financial incentives for Germans to trade in old vehicles. But Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, blamed automakers for the diesel crisis and said they should not expect government help.Foreign manufacturers, including Ford of Europe, which is based in Cologne, drew sharp criticism Wednesday after they declined to participate in the \u20ac500 million fund to improve urban air quality. Ford said it would take other measures to reduce emissions, including incentives for people to trade in older cars.Vehicles are Germany\u2019s single most important export product and, in many parts of the world, the most visible symbol of German engineering prowess. Within the country, BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes and Porsches are a source of considerable pride and an essential part of the postwar national self-image.Diesels are particularly important to German carmakers, and the technology has a long history here \u2014 Rudolf Diesel, a German, invented the diesel engine. Because of diesel\u2019s superior fuel economy today, it is a popular option with buyers of the large luxury cars that are profit centers for the industry. Until recently, Diesels outsold gasoline cars in Europe, thanks in part to de facto subsidies.Last week, a lower court judge in Stuttgart ruled that a ban on diesels in the city center was the only way to address nitrogen oxide pollution that frequently exceeded levels considered acceptable.

Word of mouth, reviews, a trusted friend?Like a lot of people, I find it hard to find books that I want to read. I quite often read several books from the same author once I have found him or her. I read reviews, and they often alert me to a book that I am going to like, and I often get ideas from others, especially other historians and novelists who are as picky as me.What\u2019s your idea of great summer reading?What do you think makes for good historical fiction? Who are your favorite writers in the genre?What I don\u2019t read is historical fiction in the period that I am writing. Firstly, the characters as described by anyone else drive me mad. The idea of Katherine Howard as a sinless victim or a willful slut is so offensive. Surely we all accept by now that women are never one dimensional? Not apparently if they\u2019re in a hood. Also, I dare not read historical fiction when I am researching the period, in case the author has inserted something wrong or something fictional that may stick in my head. But I suffer terribly from Pen Envy \u2014 when I read a good book I wish I had written it, when I read a poor book I am furious that the author has spoiled the story. That\u2019s why I only read very, very good novelists \u2014 only with them can I sit back and enjoy the experience. What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?I found Jane Wallace\u2019s \u201cTeaching Children to Ride\u201d most educational, and the most helpful fact is that with young children you need two people: one to hold the pony, one to hold the rider. My grandchildren are really pleased that I read this book before I started teaching them. My own children were on and off for years.Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time?I recently read the entire Forsyte Saga, by John Galsworthy. I\u2019d read the first part years ago, but I had forgotten that it goes on for generations. It was completely absorbing and a wonderful example of the narrator changing his view of a character and taking the reader with him.Which genres do you avoid?Lord, Lord, tell me! Why does anyone write pornography? If you have the good fortune to find a motif that floats your boat, why would you give it away? Why would you risk it losing its potency? Isn\u2019t good sex so much better than publishing? And why does anyone write lazy, sloppy genre novels? The typing alone is so exhausting \u2014 surely if you\u2019re going to undertake 150,000 words, you might as well have something interesting to say? Why do people write crime novels with blindingly obvious murderers? Why do they write love stories with idiotic heroes? (Oh, perhaps see above, re pornography.) Writing should be both individual and universal. Choosing to write a genre novel is like fencing the universe because you are afraid of space.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night?This is incomprehensible in a way \u2014 determining how I like to read is like determining how I like to breathe! I read all the time, all day, and I read a chapter of something before I go to sleep at night. I study with hardback books because they are old or specialist, so most of the day in my study I am reading from paper. At lunchtime I read a paper newspaper; I have a ridiculous, old-fashioned prejudice against newspapers online, but somehow it seems perfectly well mannered to read a newspaper at the lunch table where it would seem rude to read from a screen. In the evening, I read fiction on my e-reader, and before I sleep I might read fiction or a history book on my e-reader.How do you organize your books?I love my shelves, which are now so many and so loaded that I can call them a library. Sometimes, I think fondly of going the full Dewey. I started buying secondhand hardbacks when I was a student, and so I have all the classics in hardback, and even a couple of inherited first editions. I now buy in book and e-book form, and my books are arranged by author\u2019s name, alphabetically. I have thousands of books now and 554 on my three-year-old Kindle, of which I have read all but a handful. I love the serendipity of the library that puts Austen beside Althusser and E. P. Thompson beside James Thomson, Tennessee Williams beside Raymond. I have created a cozy space in the bookshelves that line the room \u2014 for my reading corner and for the one-legged rescue kestrel who lives with me while learning to fly free. She likes a classic hardback under her foot.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?I have to observe that I have an odd section on witchcraft and a section on skiing history \u2014 this is like the fossil record of my research eras.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?My godfather gave me a beautiful illustrated Children\u2019s Book of Poetry when I was about 7, and I started with the limericks and comic poems and went on to the great heart-wrenching story-poems. I kept the book and read them to my children.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?For memorable glamour \u2014 a Georgette Heyer hero. I adored Vidal in \u201cDevil\u2019s Cub.\u201dWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I was a solitary child, and I read voraciously. I used to borrow four books a week from the library, and this is why I strongly support public libraries now. The books that have stayed with me are the childhood classics: Elizabeth Goudge\u2019s \u201cThe Little White Horse,\u201d Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cStalky & Co.,\u201d Alison Uttley\u2019s \u201cA Traveller in Time.\u201d As a teenager I adored Georgette Heyer and E. M. Forster.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?You would be mad to invite three writers to dinner, but if you had Ernest Hemingway, Dorothy Parker and Christopher Marlowe then the inevitable fight would be interesting.Whom would you want to write your life story?Picking my biographer is a game I have recently learned to play. It\u2019s about as much fun as picking out the smuggler when you\u2019re in a line waiting at immigration. (Oh, doesn\u2019t everyone do that?) It came with the horrified recognition that people are now writing about me (Ph.D. theses, blogs, journalism, reviews) and sooner or later someone is going to want to Plumb the Depths. As a highly private person who loves publicly talking about my work but hates talking about my life, this is a nightmare. I was raised by a mother who talked about \u201cNever Doing Dirty Washing in Public\u201d (the capitalization is all hers and has to be heard to be fully enjoyed). Her metaphor is dated \u2014 it obviously precedes launderettes \u2014 but the message was a powerful one.So I have chosen my biographer, and she is a young woman writer of talent who understands my horror of my own biography, my love of the novel as a novel, my commitment to my own privacy and my determination that my family and friends who have never been recruited for publicity are not signed up to speak. She is a writer who understands the power of an empty page, of silence. I have given her the task of not writing my biography, and I think she will fulfill it beautifully.What do you plan to read next?I am currently reading around the topic of medieval women, with particular attention to how and why women get squeezed out of the marketplace, out of the law, and out of public service, and out of sight. I can\u2019t describe how compelling and fascinating this research is. I am reading a new book every day, and I go to bed with my head whirling with comparisons between women then and now, and with women in different societies around the world.

{"Headline": "Fed Officials Confront New Reality: Low Inflation and Low Unemployment", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials are struggling to make sense of a new economic reality in which low inflation and low unemployment are persisting side by side.At the July meeting, the Fed left its benchmark rate in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. It also said it planned to start reducing its asset holdings \u201crelatively soon.\u201d The minutes said some Fed officials were ready to announce a starting date for the reductions, but most favored just a little more patience. Analysts expect an announcement after the Fed\u2019s next meeting, Sept. 19 and 20.The timing of the Fed\u2019s next rate move is considerably less certain. The Fed entered the year predicting three rate increases of a quarter-point each; so far it has delivered two, with a third seen possible in December.But the weakness of inflation, which the Fed now expects to remain below its target annual pace of 2 percent for the fifth-consecutive year, is prompting some Fed officials to hesitate.Most Fed officials subscribe to a view of inflation in which prices rise more quickly as unemployment declines. The basic idea is that companies must offer higher and higher wages to keep their workers.Now, the Fed is confronting \u201cthe coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment,\u201d a phenomenon that inverts the \u201cstagflation\u201d experience of the 1970s, when both inflation and unemployment climbed.The meeting account said most officials continued to regard low unemployment as the most important factor. They said inflation was rising slowly because of temporary factors, like a decline in cellphone service prices. And they remain inclined to raise the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate later this year.But as low inflation persists, alternative theories have blossomed. Some Fed officials see evidence that the low unemployment rate overstates the health of the job market, and therefore that the Fed should wait to raise interest rates. Low rates support job growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking.Others see evidence that the connection between unemployment and inflation has been overstated.Some Fed officials have suggested that the public is losing confidence that the Fed will raise inflation back to a 2 percent annual pace, which could make it harder for the Fed to do so, because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling.The account said some voting members of the Fed\u2019s policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, wanted reassurance that inflation was rising before voting to raise rates again.The slow pace of wage growth is driving a parallel debate. Wages have increased modestly in recent years, and the minutes noted again there was \u201clittle evidence of wage pressures.\u201dSome officials see further confirmation that the economy is weak.Others, however, see the data as misleading. One possibility, advanced by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is that aggregate wage measures remain low because the baby boomers are retiring. In this view, older, high-wage workers are being replaced by younger workers who make less simply because they are at an earlier stage in their careers. That is holding down measures of average wages, but individual workers may still be seeing healthier wage growth.And there are also those who contend that wage growth is doing about as well as one would expect given the slow growth of productivity.Fed officials continue to retreat from the expectation that the Trump administration will deliver a large dose of fiscal stimulus, whether in tax cuts or increased infrastructure spending. The Fed reported that companies, too, are losing hope.\u201cUncertainty about the course of federal government policy, including in the areas of fiscal policy, trade and health care, was tending to weigh down firms\u2019 spending and hiring plans,\u201d the minutes said.The Fed also included in the minutes a warning about the Trump administration\u2019s plans to reduce what it regards as overly burdensome financial regulation.\u201cIt would not be desirable,\u201d the minutes said, \u201cfor the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a re-emergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter: @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Boring Little Budget Office That Trump Hates", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Congressional Budget Office never exuded sex appeal, at least not until recently. Its bland office building, which sits unobtrusively by a freeway in southwest Washington, houses an often-overlooked assemblage of wonkish economists whose idea of professional happiness is producing 10-year fiscal forecasts.Nevertheless, it\u2019s an agency of indispensable importance that is now coming under attack not only from Critic-in-Chief Donald Trump but from a broad array of Republican leaders, including even Speaker Paul Ryan.If, as Oscar Wilde said, that you can judge a man \u2014 or in this case an institution \u2014 by the quality of its enemies, then the C.B.O. has chosen very well.The current Republican beef with the C.B.O. is that it has repeatedly (and undoubtedly correctly) concluded that conservative proposals to gut the Affordable Care Act would cost tens of millions of Americans their health insurance.Amazingly, in July, the White House even put out a 45 second video contending that \u201cthe Congressional Budget Office\u2019s math does not add up.\u201d A few days later, two senior Trump aides labeled the C.B.O.\u2019s health care scoring \u201cfake news\u201d in a Washington Post Op-Ed. In 40 years of observing the budgeting process, I can\u2019t recall anything remotely like this criticism of the C.B.O.Developing long-term projections \u2014 particularly for complex policies like health care \u2014 is exceptionally difficult. And by no means do C.B.O. analyses invariably prove correct.But passing sweeping legislation without input from the budget office would be like planning a picnic without checking the weather forecast. Meteorologists are not always right either but imagine what life (and businesses such as agriculture) would be like without them.Health insurance changes may now be on hold for the moment, but other critical policy issues \u2014 notably, tax reform and next year\u2019s spending \u2014 are moving to the front burner.The C.B.O. was established in 1974 to do precisely what Republicans now don\u2019t want it to do: serve as an independent counterpoint to the Office of Management and Budget. As a creature of the executive branch, the O.M.B. is often, and appropriately, criticized for lacking that nonpartisan viewpoint.Keith Hall, the current director of the C.B.O., was selected two years ago by the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill \u2014 some of the same individuals who are now attacking the agency\u2019s credibility.\u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, has the day of the C.B.O. come and gone?\u201d O.M.B. director Mick Mulvaney \u2014 himself a former House member \u2014 asked in May.More recently, a group of conservative House Republicans proposed slashing the C.B.O.\u2019s budget and cutting its staff of 235 by 89 employees.In a burst of bipartisanship unusual in today\u2019s Washington, all eight of the previous directors sent a letter in late July to congressional leaders expressing their \u201cstrong objection to recent attacks on the integrity and professionalism of the agency.\u201dMore support has come from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, with which I\u2019m affiliated. \u201cYou don\u2019t beat up the referee just because you don\u2019t like the score,\u201d President Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.Their pushback rests on strong footing: The C.B.O.\u2019s analysis of the impact of Obamacare were closer to the mark than those of most other forecasters.For example, back in 2010, the agency projected that the number of people without insurance would drop to 30 million in 2016. The actual figure in that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was 28.6 million (a drop of 20 million from 2010).Yes, the C.B.O. initially overestimated marketplace enrollment and underestimated Medicaid enrollment. But it was closer on the top line estimate than forecasts from many other organizations, according to a 2015 study by the Commonwealth Fund.Healthcare is not by any means the only policy area where the Trump White House has tried to fudge the numbers to a degree not seen in many decades.The administration\u2019s first full budget proposal, issued on May 23, included a number of absurd assumptions, particularly about the pace of economic growth and the impact of the president\u2019s still-vague tax plans.Happily, the C.B.O. weighed in and concluded that instead of a small surplus in 2027, the O.M.B. proposal would instead result in a $720 billion deficit.In particular, the budget office focused on the administration\u2019s wildly optimistic assumption that the economy would grow at a 3 percent annual rate over the next decade. Instead, the agency agreed with most private forecasters that 1.9 percent was a more realistic assumption.That conclusion will put much needed pressure on the White House to propose a more responsible tax package, and on Congress to act judiciously.As we face an era of widening budget deficits and the increased fiscal burden of an aging society, having the independent voice of the Congressional Budget Office is more important than ever.The only way to deal with bullies like Mr. Trump and his lackeys is to stand up to them. Capitol Hill legislators \u2014 who have mostly been curiously silent \u2014 need to come to the defense of an agency essential to the policy process.Advertisement"}

She and her 77-year-old husband, Ray Bluhm, moved this month to a retirement community in Lake Ridge, Va.Before the move, their two adult children took a handful of items, including a new bed and a dining table and chairs. But Mrs. Bluhm could not interest them in \u201cthe china and the silver and the crystal,\u201d her own generation\u2019s hallmarks of a properly furnished, middle-class home.The competitive accumulation of material goods, a cornerstone of the American dream, dates to the post-World War II economy, when returning veterans fled the cities to establish homes and status in the suburbs. Couples married when they were young, and wedding gifts were meant to be used \u2014 and treasured \u2014 for life.But for a variety of social, cultural, and economic reasons, this is no longer the case. Today\u2019s young adults tend to acquire household goods that they consider temporary or disposable, from online retailers or stores like Ikea and Target, instead of inheriting them from parents or grandparents.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re seeing a kink in the chain of passing down mementos from one generation to another,\u201d Ms. Buysse said in a telephone interview from the group\u2019s headquarters in Hinsdale, Ill.Accordingly, the senior move management industry has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, Ms. Buysse said. These move managers usually charge an hourly rate, typically $50 to $125. They spend time with clients, helping them sort through years of accumulated possessions and make decisions about what to dispose, what to donate to charities and what to try to fit into their new living spaces.Final costs of the service, which may also involve an estate sale, can be $2,500 to $5,000 or more, depending on the size of the home and the density of its contents.\u201cWe found that seniors have more needs than just the sale of their estates,\u201d said Tracy Niro, a managing partner of Wise Moves, a move management company in Gaithersburg, Md.Once the children have picked over what they want, and the items slated for the next home have been boxed up, the question is, what becomes of the rest?\u201cSome goes to auction, some goes to eBay, and some goes to our retail shop,\u201d said Chris Fultz, an owner of Nova Liquidations, an estate liquidation company in Luray, Va., that works closely with companies like Wise Moves.Ms. Niro said her company also works with nonprofits, like Habitat for Humanity, to find new homes for discarded items. Yet even these operations are feeling overwhelmed by the growing inventory of household goods delivered at their doorsteps.\u201cWe are definitely getting overrun with furniture, and about 20 percent more donations of everything than in previous years,\u201d said Michael Frohm, chief operating officer of Goodwill of Greater Washington, in a telephone interview.Changing aesthetic tastes are also responsible for the overflow.\u201cThe whole \u201990s were the English country look, collections, chintz,\u201d said Jennifer Lacker, an antiques appraiser in Mystic, Conn., who cited the influence of the interior designer Mario Buatta (known as the \u201cPrince of Chintz\u201d). The look, she added, was decidedly \u201crich and lavish.\u201dMillennials are also less inclined to want their parents\u2019 household goods simply because they have no place to put them.As his parents begin to contemplate moving from their two-story colonial home in Annandale, N.J., to a smaller living space, Travis Miscia, a 30-year-old lawyer, would like to lay claim to a good number of his family\u2019s belongings. But he and his wife live in a two-bedroom apartment in Jersey City that is too small to hold them.\u201cI am very interested in family history, and I would like a lot of my parents\u2019 things on some level,\u201d Mr. Miscia said, \u201cbut I have had to limit myself to taking what I would call primary-source documents, like books and some pictures.\u201dYet often this strategy only postpones the inevitable.\u201cSome children take the objects just to keep Mom and Dad quiet,\u201d said Roger Schrenk, Mr. Fultz\u2019s business partner at Nova Liquidations. \u201cThey\u2019ll take them and store them until Mom\u2019s dead, and then they can\u2019t wait to get rid of them.\u201dWith this in mind, Mrs. Bluhm, whose adult children only wanted the new bed and dining set, recommends a philosophical approach to the process of letting go of possessions that children may not cherish but others may.\u201cBy donating them to charity, I knew they weren\u2019t going to go into a Dumpster and that someone who really wanted them would purchase them,\u201d she said. Though the items are no longer hers, she said, many of her familiar household objects are not altogether gone.\u201cWhat I had left were the memories attached to them, in my heart and in my head,\u201d Mrs. Bluhm said.An article last Sunday about heirs who do not want all of their parents\u2019 belongings misstated the job held by Jennifer Lacker. She is an antiques appraiser, not an antiques dealer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan May Free Up Corporate Dollars, but Then What?", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd as Mr. Trump prepares to outline his corporate tax overhaul ideas in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., economists and tax experts warn that the path is likely to be treacherous.A pro-growth tax policy would presumably aim not only to reach profits kept abroad as a tax dodge, but also to encourage companies to use that money to expand their business and hire more workers.\u201cRepatriation has little effect on real investment in the United States,\u201d said Alan Viard, a tax expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.That\u2019s because repatriation is not really about geography. Most of the money is not stashed in some underground vault overseas, but already in American financial institutions and capital markets. Repatriation is in effect a legal category that requires a company to book the money in the United States \u2014 and pay taxes on it \u2014 before it can be distributed to shareholders or invested domestically.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that giving them an even higher share of profits, or a windfall, is going to lead to extra investment,\u201d she said.A recent survey of business leaders by the international accounting and advisory firm Friedman, for example, found that just 23 percent would reinvest repatriated funds. Most would use the money to pay dividends or engage in share buybacks.\u201cAnd we have low average rates\u201d \u2014 because of all the loopholes \u2014 \u201cwhich indicate that we\u2019re not collecting as much as we used to, given the very high level of corporate profits.\u201dThe crucial questions are how to pay for a lower rate and how to prevent abuses. Corporate tax cuts that lead to huge deficits could hobble the economy. And a territorial system without sufficient safeguards could end up encouraging even more businesses to shift profits, operations and jobs to countries with lower tax rates.Mr. Gardner argued that a broader definition of American competitiveness is needed that includes not only the tax system, but also the business infrastructure that the tax system supports \u2014 bridges and roads, health care, education and research and development. \u201cIf all you think about is the tax rate, then it should be zero,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetitiveness is about finding the right balance.\u201dThe damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey on Texas \u2014 which Mr. Trump has promised to help address with federal money \u2014 shows how quickly new budget demands can materialize.In general, though, Mr. Stiglitz argued that the link between tax cuts and economic growth is vastly overstated. \u201cThere is no evidence that cutting the tax rates stimulates more investment,\u201d he said.\u201cGrowth is low because labor force growth is slow,\u201d and it is only going to grow slower because of immigration restrictions, he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not investing in education and research, which is why productivity is slow. The notion that changing taxes is going to lead to a growth spurt is pure nonsense.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @patcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Danger From Low-Skilled Immigrants: Not Having Them", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneLet\u2019s just say it plainly: The United States needs more low-skilled immigrants.\u201cTen years from now, there are going to be lots of older people with relatively few low-skilled workers to change their bedpans,\u201d said David Card, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat is going to be a huge problem.\u201dThe politics of immigration are driven, to this day, by the proposition that immigrant laborers take the jobs and depress the wages of Americans competing with them in the work force. It is a mechanical statement of the law of supply and demand: More workers spilling in over the border will inevitably reduce the price of work.Immigration\u2019s bad reputation is largely due to a subtle yet critical omission: It overlooks the fact that immigrants and natives are different in consistent ways. This difference shields even some of the least-skilled American-born workers from foreign competition.Not speaking English, the newcomers might bump their American peers from manual jobs \u2014 say, washing dishes. But they couldn\u2019t aspire to jobs that require communicating with consumers or suppliers. Those jobs are still reserved for the American-born. As employers invest more to take advantage of the new source of cheap labor, they will also open new communications-heavy job opportunities for the natives.Similar dynamics operate in other industries. The strawberry crop on the California coast owes its existence to cheap immigrant pickers. They are, in a way, sustaining better-paid American workers in the strawberry patch-to-market chain who would have to find a job somewhere else if the United States imported the strawberries from Mexico instead.A critical insight of the new research into the impact of immigration is that employers are not the only ones to adapt to the arrival of cheap foreign workers by, say, investing in a new restaurant or a new strawberry-packing plant. American-born workers react, too, moving into occupations that are better shielded from the newcomers, and even upgrading their own skills.\u201cThe benefits of immigration really come from occupational specialization,\u201d said Ethan Lewis, an associate professor of economics at Dartmouth College. \u201cImmigrants who are relatively concentrated in less interactive and more manual jobs free up natives to specialize in what they are relatively good at, which are communication-intensive jobs.\u201dInterestingly, the most vulnerable groups of American-born workers \u2014 men, the young, high school dropouts and African-Americans \u2014 experienced a greater shift than other groups. And the wages of communications-heavy jobs they moved into increased relative to those requiring only manual labor.It is not crazy for American workers who feel their wages going nowhere, and their job opportunities stuck, to fear immigration as yet another threat to their livelihoods. And yet for all the alarm about the prospect of poor, uneducated immigrants flocking across the border, this immigration has been mostly benign.As the National Academies noted about its report, \u201cThe inflow of labor supply has helped the United States avoid the problems facing other economies that have stagnated as a result of unfavorable demographics, particularly the effects of an aging work force and reduced consumption by older residents.\u201d There will be an employment hole to fill.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Kenya\u2019s Vote Nears, Fear That \u2018Fake News\u2019 May Fuel Real Bloodshed", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byELDORET, Kenya \u2014 Fake news. Odd plot twists. Tit-for-tat accusations. One candidate calling another \u201ccrooked.\u201dThose political phenomena, familiar to voters in the United States and Europe, have surfaced in Kenya ahead of a tightly contested presidential election on Tuesday. But in a country with a history of election violence, the addition of such toxic behavior has further fanned fears about whether the country can pull off a credible and peaceful vote.In the latest development, just two days before Election Day, the main opposition coalition, the National Super Alliance, accused Mr. Kenyatta of ordering an armed raid on one of its tallying centers. The accusation was reported by some media outlets but dismissed by others as false.\u201cThere is an ecosystem of fake news around this election,\u201d said Alphonce Shiundu, editor of Africa Check, a fact-checking organization. \u201cKenyans really don\u2019t know what the truth is.\u201d\u201cThis makes me worried,\u201d Mr. Shiundu said.\u201cAfter what happened in 2007, no one wants the same,\u201d said Vanity Kosgi, 37, a politician in Eldoret. \u201cPeople learn.\u201dAlfred Agisu, 35, the leader of a scraggly troupe of young drummers in Eldoret, urged residents not to succumb to violence. \u201cWe make music to preach peace,\u201d Mr. Agisu said.Facing no limits on campaign financing, politicians have spared no expense. They have showered voters with money and even hired helicopters for their campaigns. The common belief is that once voted in, lawmakers, whose official salaries are 25 times higher than those of average Kenyans, will redistribute some of that wealth to their supporters.Eldoret, for example, is a stronghold of Vice President William Ruto. It has some of the best roads in Kenya. Its city center is a hive of businesses and hotels. There is little garbage on the streets. Outside town, lush cornfields and banana forests stretch as far as the eye can see. (Mr. Ruto\u2019s country estate, which was breached by an unknown assailant who was later shot dead by members of the security forces, has a well-manicured garden decorated with pink bougainvillea.)If the election is transparent and credible, it will send a powerful message to Kenya\u2019s neighbors, where longtime leaders are holding on to power, as is the case in Ethiopia, Uganda and Rwanda, or have taken a despotic turn, as in Tanzania.President Kenyatta, 55, who leads the Jubilee Party, will face off against Mr. Odinga, 72, a former prime minister who leads the National Super Alliance. Both men are wealthy scions of post-independence leaders, and their families have largely dominated Kenyan politics for decades.Mr. Odinga, who is running for a fourth time, says he was robbed of victory in the previous two contests. In 2013, Mr. Kenyatta won by a tiny margin, prompting Mr. Odinga to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate the election. Mr. Odinga is now rousing supporters by warning that this year\u2019s election could also be stolen, which critics say is an incitement to violence.Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga were virtually tied in recent polls, but neither is drawing more than 50 percent. They are running on similar platforms \u2014 economic development \u2014 and have mostly appealed to voters based on ethnic affiliation.The Kikuyus and Kalenjins, who make up a large chunk of Kenya\u2019s population, are mainly supporting Mr. Kenyatta. The Luos, Luhyas, Kambas and other smaller ethnic groups are backing Mr. Odinga.For most Kenyans, unemployment and the high cost of living are the dominant issues, intertwined with deep-rooted ethnic allegiances, which were entrenched under Britain\u2019s colonial rulers, who pursued a policy of divide and rule.Although the economy has been growing at an annual rate of 5 percent in recent years, inflation, partly caused by drought, is whittling away at Kenya\u2019s fragile middle class and creating a vast underclass. Many Kenyans cannot afford to buy staple foods or pay school fees. Electricity and water shortages are common. Youth unemployment is high.\u201cWhat do you want us to do, steal?\u201d asked Vincent Losano, an unemployed man in Eldoret. \u201cWe need jobs.\u201dKenyans, still smarting from past violence, are hopeful that this year will be different. One reason is that the two ethnic groups that fought each other in 2007 and 2008 \u2014 the Kikuyus and the Kalenjins \u2014 are now in the same camp. (President Kenyatta is a Kikuyu; his running mate, Mr. Ruto, is a Kalenjin.)Many Kenyans interviewed for this article also expressed optimism that, despite the gruesome murder of the election official, the vote would be fair and credible \u2014 as long as the technology did not fail. Kenya will be using biometric technology to identify voters and transmit results electronically, which should diminish the chances of fraud.In June, KPMG, the auditing firm enlisted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, recommended that more than 92,000 dead voters be removed from the registration rolls.Before his death, the election official, Christopher Msando, reassured the public that the collection and tallying of votes was watertight. The commission, he said, had invested in satellite technology in case phone networks failed, as well as backups. It even ordered, for each of the country\u2019s 40,883 polling stations, more technology kits than necessary to identify voters and transmit the results.There are other reasons for optimism. \u201cA lot of work has gone into institutions, at the grass-roots level,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, who leads the European Union\u2019s Election Observation Mission. \u201cYou have a new Constitution, and that has put in place checks and balances. These are the kind of steps that have been meaningful compared to even five years ago.\u201dCandidates who are not affiliated with any party or driven by ethnic interests have also started to emerge.Boniface Mwangi, 34, a photojournalist and activist who gained prominence for his work documenting electoral violence a decade ago, formed a party and has become popular on social media sites. He is the leading candidate for a seat in Parliament representing Starehe, a constituency in Nairobi.Mr. Mwangi said voting habits were starting to change, especially among young people, who make up more than half the electorate and who, he said, \u201care tired of party and tribal politics.\u201d He said that by the next election, in 2022, he expected the dominance of the two political families to have diminished.Kenyans, he said, are beginning to pay more attention to economic issues than to ethnic and party loyalties. \u201cWhen they get even more broke they will start to look at actual ideas,\u201d he said.Mr. Mwangi said that a decade ago, when he traveled around Kenya taking photographs of the violence, he was struck by haunting images of \u201cthe poor killing the poor.\u201d\u201cThe poor should be smarter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t die for Boniface Mwangi. They shouldn\u2019t die for Raila Odinga. They shouldn\u2019t die for Uhuru Kenyatta.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major Rental-Home Companies Set to Merge as U.S. House Prices Recover", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the housing market collapsed more than a decade ago, new investors poured in to buy foreclosed homes and rent them out. Now, a $4.3 billion deal suggests that the bargain-hunting binge in housing is finally over.Two of the biggest institutional single-family landlords in the United States said Thursday that they planned to merge, an indication that the housing market has recovered much of the ground it lost in the financial crisis. And as home prices rise in many areas, affordable housing, for deep-pocketed investors and young first-time buyers alike, is becoming harder to find.The two institutional landlords, Invitation Homes, a rental business spun out of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group, and Starwood Waypoint Homes said they would combine to create an entity with about 82,000 homes in more than a dozen big markets.The deal could set the stage for other institutional investors to join forces. With fewer opportunities to buy homes at a discount, the keys to growth will be reducing operating costs, gaining market share and potentially increasing rent.With consolidation, Wall Street-backed firms\u2019 once-bold strategy of cleaning up the mess created by the crisis by going to foreclosure auctions and snapping up hundreds of cheap homes has ended.Wall Street jumped into foreclosed homes reckoning that there would be a fundamental shift in housing, with millions of people losing their houses and becoming renters \u2014 at least until they could repair their credit scores.On the eve of the crisis, the rate of homeownership \u2014 the percentage of households that own a home \u2014 hovered around 69 percent. Today, it is 63.7 percent, according to the United States Census Bureau. And last year, the number of new renters again outpaced the number of new homeowners, according to Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.But the economics of buying recently foreclosed homes to rent out have become more challenging for Wall Street firms that seek to generate double-digit returns for investors, and for publicly traded real estate investment trusts that promise shareholders hefty quarterly dividends.For the past year or so, many institutional investors have had to compete with potential homeowners shopping for foreclosed homes posted for sale on multiple listing services.\u201cAs home prices rise, most of the institutional investors are dramatically slowing the rate at which they buy new homes,\u201d said Laurie Goodman, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Housing Finance Policy Center. \u201cAnd with the easy money days behind them, they need a more efficient cost structure.\u201d She said the merger was a way accomplish that by gaining further economies of scale.Blackstone was one of the first private equity firms to begin buying foreclosed homes in the wake of the financial crisis, fixing them up and renting them out. The firm, which began buying homes in earnest in 2011, is estimated to have spent $10 billion on its foreclosed-home-to-rental bet.Invitation Homes, which emerged from that push with almost 50,000 homes, is a company that Blackstone built from scratch.Purchases by Invitation Homes have dropped sharply since 2013, when it was buying hundreds of homes each week. Its acquisitions are down more than 90 percent from then, and the period of \u201chyper growth\u201d for the industry has passed, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.In all, institutional investors have bought an estimated 200,000 single-family homes to operate as rentals.But that is a fraction of the overall number of rental homes in the United States. According to housing industry estimates, there are as many as 17 million single-family rentals across the country, most owned by mom-and-pop landlords or firms operating fewer than 100 such homes.Before the crisis, there were about 10 million rental homes, an indication of how many homeowners were displaced by the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression.Consolidation among institutional investors began three years ago with American Homes 4 Rent, which owns 49,000 rental homes, buying Beazer Pre-Owned Rental Homes. A few months later, Starwood Waypoint bought Colony American Homes in an all-stock deal that valued Colony American at $1.5 billion. Most of the mergers since then have been small, and the deal between Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint would be the biggest in an industry that did not exist a decade ago.The move by institutional investors into the housing market has been credited by some with helping to stabilize the sharp and steady decline in home prices early in the financial crisis. The presence of private equity firms and hedge funds in the market also helped attract the interest of smaller investors.But big firms like Invitation Homes and American Homes have drawn criticism from housing advocates for renting their homes at prices that are unaffordable for the working poor.Few renters with federal rent subsidies known as Section 8 live in homes owned by Invitation Homes and other institutional investors. That is partly because such investors have tended to operate in largely suburban communities and have avoided buying homes in urban areas.In the past, Blackstone has said that 72 percent of houses owned by Invitation Homes have monthly rents within federal affordability guidelines for the markets where it operates.This year, housing advocates and some legislators criticized Fannie Mae, one of two government-controlled mortgage finance giants, for agreeing to guarantee a $1 billion financing deal for Invitation Homes without getting any assurances that the company would do more to provide affordable housing.Kevin Stein, a lawyer and deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a group that supports the rights of tenants and homeowners, said he was concerned that the merger of Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint would increase their power to raise rents.\u201cWhat is the level of concentration? This is a concern to our members,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cThere are so many communities in California where people are being driven out because of housing costs, and this is part of the dynamic.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal announced on Thursday, each Starwood Waypoint share will be converted into 1.614 Invitation Homes shares. The total enterprise value of the combined company, including debt, would be $20 billion, the companies said.Invitation Homes\u2019 shareholders will own roughly 59 percent of the combined company\u2019s stock, while Starwood Waypoint\u2019s investors will own the rest.Blackstone, which took Invitation Homes public in January in an offering that raised $1.7 billion in net proceeds, would continue to have a stake in the combined company.After the merger, which is subject to the approval of shareholders, is completed, John Bartling, Invitation Homes\u2019 chief executive, will step down. Fred Tuomi, the current chief executive of Starwood Waypoint, will be the chief executive of the combined company.The new company\u2019s 11-member board will include six members of the Invitation Homes board, including the chairman, Bryce Blair, who will be chairman of the new company\u2019s board. Jonathan D. Gray, head of global real estate for Blackstone and an architect of its single-family rental trade, also will be on the board.The combined company will operate as Invitation Homes and trade under the Invitation Homes ticker symbol.On a day when a nervous stock market declined, shares of both Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint surged. Invitation Homes\u2019 shares gained 3.91 percent; Starwood Waypoint\u2019s shares rose 5.15 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.R. Rao, Pioneer of India\u2019s Space Program, Dies at 85", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe roof leaked and equipment was being transported by ox carts and bicycles, but in the abandoned St. Mary Magdalene Church, along the southern coast of India, there was no room for pessimism. There, in 1962, with rocket prototypes crowding the pews, India\u2019s space program was being born.And helping to steer it was U. R. Rao, who believed that science \u2014 particularly aerospace science \u2014 could help his country solve its food shortages and eradicate its poverty. He would begin toiling there, pursuing his vision with other scientists, from offices in a converted bishop\u2019s house.Eighteen years later, on Nov. 21, 1980, their efforts bore fruit when the former churchyard became the scene of India\u2019s first rocket launch, giving the country a foothold in an exclusive club of spacefaring nations.Professor Rao, who helped India propel its first satellites into space as a chairman of the program, died on July 24 at 85 at his home in Bengaluru, India, according to the Indian Space Research Organization, which did not provide a cause.The location for India\u2019s first control center \u2014 a remote fishing hamlet on the Indian Ocean \u2014 was chosen for its proximity to the Equator. With its magnetic properties, the area was of great fascination for scientists interested in the ionosphere, which plays an important role in long-distance radio communication.Unlike the United States and the Soviet Union, which originally sought scientific advances in space exploration for military purposes, India looked to the stars on a quest for self-sufficiency.Professor Rao worked alongside Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan, the first leaders of the Indian Space Research Organization, the country\u2019s equivalent of NASA, to establish a complex in Bangalore and secure a budget from the Indian government. By the time he took over as chairman in 1984, he was overseeing 14,000 employees.But critics in other countries would ask why, with all its problems of poverty and overpopulation, of malnutrition and poor health and illiteracy, India should be spending millions of rupees to go into space.The economy would grow, he said. Communication would be better. It would \u201cchange the face of rural India.\u201dProfessor Rao was credited with sending 20 more satellites into space, including some of the first to combine communication and meteorological capabilities. Other satellites took crop inventories and looked for signs of underground water reserves. Soil erosion and snow runoff were monitored to help forecast floods.The astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, 35, was tasked with seeing if yoga exercises could help astronauts tolerate motion sickness and muscle fatigue, problems that come with weightlessness.The cosmonauts he traveled with, aboard a Soviet Soyuz T-10 spacecraft, were amused with his plan \u2014 to practice three yoga exercises several times a day for five days over the eight-day journey. The results were inconclusive.There was a lot for India to learn. But Professor Rao was known as a methodical visionary who was realistic about India\u2019s constraints. He found himself having to navigate a tricky path between the competing interests of the United States and the Soviet Union as India looked to both countries for help.\u201cIt was a delicate balance between the two,\u201d Rudrapatna Ramnath, a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who knew Professor Rao during his fellowship there, said in an interview. \u201cHe navigated this troublesome tide quite skillfully.\u201dUdupi Ramachandra Rao was born on March 10, 1932, to Laxhminarayana Rao and his wife, Krishnaveni Amma, in a small village near Udupi, in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.He received his education in India: a bachelor\u2019s from Madras University in 1951, a master\u2019s from Banaras Hindu University in 1953 and a Ph.D. from Gujarat University in 1960.He was director of Indian Space Research Organization\u2019s satellite program from 1972 to 1984 and chairman of the organization from 1984 until 1994.Professor Rao helped India develop its rocket technology, including the first Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, which is still used today to send its own equipment into space. In February, India launched 104 satellites from a single rocket, breaking Russia\u2019s record of 37, set in 2014.In 2014, India sent a spacecraft to Mars for $74 million to prove that the country could succeed in such a highly technical endeavor.

{"Headline": "Deal-Making Is Alive and Well, but the Market Is Changing", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe urge to merge is alive and well.Companies are tying the knot, unperturbed by persistent doubts surrounding the Trump administration and Britain\u2019s forthcoming exit from the European Union.An absence of organic growth and ready access to low-cost debt are sending them down the aisle in record numbers.Cross-border deals between the United States and Europe are up more than 80 percent this year, led by a succession of blockbuster deals, including Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $29 billion takeover of Actelion Pharmaceuticals and the eyewear giant Luxottica\u2019s $50 billion merger with Essilor. This action follows the golden years of 2015 and 2016, a honeymoon period when global merger volumes hit record highs.But the dynamics of the market are changing.Like Newton\u2019s third law, for every action taken to combine two companies, there is an equal and opposite reaction to keep them apart.An array of forces, like takeover rules, antitrust reviews and industrial policy, are helping to break up the party.In the past, these forces in Europe were largely restricted to southern European countries like Spain and Italy, where governments historically have intervened to influence foreign investment in strategic sectors like infrastructure and utilities.Yet today, interventionism is spreading across Northern Europe, from Germany to the Netherlands to even Britain, traditionally one of the most open markets \u2014 but which is now witnessing a gradual upsurge of political rhetoric in the service of \u201ccritical interests.\u201dIn Germany, the government voiced concerns after a Chinese bid for a robotics company, Kuka. In Britain, government intervention has grown after Kraft\u2019s bid for Cadbury. It has also been a feature of failed bids like Pfizer\u2019s bid for AstraZeneca and Kraft Heinz\u2019s approach to Unilever.The challenge with big cross-border deals is often that the companies in question have become the corporate equivalent of a national treasure. When approached, these companies by default turn to politicians, drawing upon nationalistic and social concerns as a defense to avoid engaging and moving a deal forward.In the United States, the forces of protectionism are better organized. The Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States, which has the power to veto any transaction injurious to the nation\u2019s interests, is the No. 1 weapon in the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist arsenal, the ultimate regulatory bazooka.It\u2019s so powerful, in fact, that European Union officials are now considering whether to introduce similar legislation to adjudicate deals in Europe.Global mergers activity started 2017 with a bang. But for the rest of the year, my view is that growing regulatory intervention is going to make chief executives hit pause on major, transforming cross-border deals.They won\u2019t want to take the risks associated with a long and drawn-out regulatory review where even if a deal gets done, they may not get their hands on the company for 12 to 18 months.\u201cWhat will the economy and target company look like in a year and half\u2019s time?\u201d they ask. To make a commitment of more than $10 billion without knowing exactly what you\u2019re getting would be too great a risk for most.In the meantime, the perennial need for growth persists. Therefore, so does the appetite for mergers and acquisitions. In the months ahead, it is likely that company bosses will shy away from megadeals in favor of a greater number of smaller, less contentious transactions.Of course, there is a solution to the problem of protectionism. As in any marriage or partnership, the situation can be vastly improved with a little bit of give and take.This is most relevant in dealings with China. As state-owned Chinese companies appear to pause their global shopping spree, Europe and the United States are wondering if it will allow greater foreign investment in its own assets.I am optimistic. As China transforms from the factory of the world to its model 21st-century consumer, it can\u2019t stop doing deals. To get them done, it knows it needs to be more flexible. It understands the notion of reciprocity.My prediction is that merger volumes will match those of 2016, made of a greater number of smaller deals. But as for the future of the megadeal, the complex prenuptials involved are likely to send all but the most fearless running for the hills.Hernan Cristerna is co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fidget Spinner and the Fall of the Well-Managed Fad", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyA fad changed Osborne\u2019s life, much for the better, shortly after she opened her original toy store, named Wonder Works, in the 1990s. In those early days, Osborne tried selling board games and science kits, but she was struggling to find customers. Then, in 1994, a family visiting from Chicago walked through her doors and asked if she had any Beanie Babies.Osborne had never even heard of them. But almost immediately, she started hearing about nothing else. Later that week, someone called asking if she had Quackers the Duck. The next day someone inquired about Happy the Hippo. Osborne quickly learned that Beanie Babies were stuffed animals that, truth be told, weren\u2019t all that distinguishable from other stuffed animals. But for some reason, they had become playground must-haves. \u2018\u2018And that\u2019s when I knew,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me, \u2018\u2018if we could just get our hands on Beanies, it would be our ticket.\u2019\u2019Talking to her suppliers, Osborne eventually figured out that Beanie Babies were made by Ty, a company in Westmont, Ill. Ty didn\u2019t actually manufacture Beanie Babies \u2014 that was outsourced to China \u2014 but it did everything else. The previous year, Ty\u2019s executives began an extensive campaign to identify the nation\u2019s most influential specialty gift and toy stores. Then, rather than advertise Beanie Babies to the public, executives quietly distributed small numbers of them to these retailers, often extracting a promise they would not sell more than a few Beanies to any single customer.Ty fiercely controlled retailers\u2019 inventory of Beanies based on a complicated formula that was updated with each day\u2019s sales and trends. If a store degraded the Beanie brand by discounting the toy or employing unfriendly salespeople, Ty would cut them off. As particular animals \u2014 like Peanut the Elephant \u2014 became popular, Ty ceased manufacturing them altogether. When Wal-Mart and Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us asked to carry Beanie Babies, Ty refused.Osborne was accustomed to toy manufacturers begging her to carry their products in her store. With Beanie Babies, everything was reversed. Osborne tracked down a Ty sales rep named Joyce and pleaded with her. \u2018\u2018I started in with the charm,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me. \u2018\u2018I would telephone nearly every afternoon and tell her we would do anything to get some stock.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, Joyce relented, and Wonder Works began earning thousands of dollars a week from Beanie Baby sales.But as the months passed and the women continued talking, Joyce began asking for favors of her own. Ty\u2019s executives wanted to know Osborne\u2019s opinion on her customers\u2019 tastes. Did they respond to primary colors? To sparkly bows? Why was Manny the Manatee so popular, but Darling the Dog a bust? Based on such conversations with Osborne and countless other toy-store owners, Ty\u2019s executives made hundreds of tiny shifts in their manufacturing, marketing and distribution over the years, turning what began as a fad into a perennial best-seller, one that earned hundreds of millions of dollars each year and helped Ty employ thousands of people. As for Osborne, she used her Beanie profits to expand Wonder Works to four locations. Today, more than two decades later, Beanie Boos, one of Ty\u2019s latest iterations, are still among her top-grossing items.For fidget spinners, as Osborne well knew, no one was going to manage the buzz, strategize about inventory and plan marketing the way Ty had for Beanie Babies. \u2018\u2018Now, in less than half a year, spinners are done,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m moving on to squishies\u2019\u2019 \u2014 squishable toys that are also (questionably) marketed as attention aids. \u2018\u2018I think they\u2019ll last at least a few months.\u2019\u2019Within economics, this transition to direct selling \u2014 of cutting out sales reps like Joyce in lieu of websites like DHgate.com \u2014 is known as disintermediation, and it\u2019s one of the defining characteristics of the internet age. Companies like Uber, Amazon and Priceline have succeeded by disintermediating enormous industries (taxi dispatchers, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel agents). The logic of disintermediation seems self-evident: By putting factories directly in contact with stores, by helping customers order directly from manufacturers, by letting riders coordinate with drivers, you cut out a needless source of waste and inefficiency. Middlemen (and middlewomen), so this theory goes, have simply been gobbling a slice of the pie they never really deserved.In reality, though, all these middlemen were often crucial to ensuring that the pie was baked at all. As Osborne learned when she started selling Beanie Babies, middlemen like Joyce are often the ones who turn a fad into a sustainable business that creates jobs. You might think a company\u2019s main function is to make stuff. But that\u2019s usually wrong. Making stuff is often the easiest part of what a company does. It\u2019s everything else \u2014 marketing and defending intellectual property, coming up with distribution strategies and knowing when to stop manufacturing Peanut the Elephant \u2014 that\u2019s the hard part. That\u2019s what middlemen do.Or, at least, it\u2019s what they did, before the digital economy made their jobs disappear. Take, for instance, the travel industry: As Youcheng Wang of the University of Central Florida notes, the industry as we know it was built, over decades, by hundreds of thousands of middlemen at travel agencies, tour operators, hotels and airline bucket shops. \u2018\u2018There were layers of jobs and experts,\u2019\u2019 Wang says. \u2018\u2018They convinced people to visit new places and helped resorts find new customers.\u2019\u2019 Today, however, many of those jobs and experts are gone, replaced by disintermediators like Trip\u00adAdvisor (3,000 employees) and Priceline (18,500 employees), which are built on what middlemen created, but which employ far fewer people. And the impact of losing all those jobs will have ripple effects that we can\u2019t even predict. Who, in the absence of those middlemen, is today persuading travelers to dream bigger about their vacations, to open their wallets to support off-the-beaten-track destinations, to help new hotels find their clienteles? \u2018\u2018Without intermediaries,\u2019\u2019 Wang points out, \u2018\u2018it can be difficult to get discovered.\u2019\u2019It was a fun idea, retailers said. It could probably help fidget spinners make the transition from a fad into a sustainable product. If it worked, it would create jobs and help toy stores prosper. But Osborne and others cautioned Zing against making the investment. It would take at least six months to design and manufacture the new item, and by then, the fidget spinner craze would most likely be over. So Zing shelved the idea \u2014 and the new hiring it would have triggered.\u2018\u2018Now a fad is just a fad,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018And that makes things harder for all of us.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Janet Yellen Goes, the Fed\u2019s Current Policy May Go With Her", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 Liberal activists who stage an annual protest in favor of lower interest rates at the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual conference here are planning a different kind of demonstration this year. They plan to don \u201cYellen wigs\u201d on Friday to demonstrate in support of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, whose first term ends in February.President Trump must soon decide whether to renominate Ms. Yellen or pick someone similarly inclined to emphasize economic growth. Or, instead, he could accede to the wishes of many conservatives for a Fed chairman more worried about inflation.The looming decision is injecting an element of uncertainty into monetary policy after years of relative stability. Ms. Yellen continued the aggressive economic stimulus campaign that was launched by her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, during the financial crisis that began 10 years ago, and she has moved slowly to end it.Gene B. Sperling, the former director of President Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council, said the choice was a \u201cfascinating test\u201d for Mr. Trump, pitting conservative ideology against \u201cthe stark reality of politicians worried about how the economy performs.\u201dThe approaching fork in the road is likely to be a major topic of conversation as Fed leaders, central bankers from other countries and academic economists gather in Grand Teton National Park on Friday and Saturday for an annual policy conference.The basic question nearly everyone is asking is how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates.The Fed already has raised its benchmark rate twice this year, to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. Officials are debating whether to raise rates for a third time, but no decision is expected before the final meeting of the year in December.That would leave the benchmark rate at a level Fed officials regard as neutral. Low rates increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, while high rates weigh on economic growth by reducing those activities.Mr. Trump has said that he is considering another term for Ms. Yellen. But Gary D. Cohn, the director of his national economic council, is also a candidate. Ms. Yellen has not commented on her own plans, beyond committing to serve out her term.Mr. Trump has not named other candidates, but likely possibilities for any Republican president include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; John B. Taylor, an economist at Stanford University; and Glenn Hubbard, an economist at Columbia University.Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about his priorities. In public comments, he has repeatedly described himself as a lover of low interest rates. But last month, he nominated Randal K. Quarles, a financial industry executive who has advocated the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly, as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision.The Trump administration also plans to nominate Marvin Goodfriend, a Carnegie Mellon University economist who is an even more outspoken critic of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign, to an open seat on the Fed\u2019s board.Regulatory issues may prove an even more important consideration. Mr. Trump wants to relax some of the restrictions placed on the financial industry in the wake of the 2008 crisis. Ms. Yellen has agreed that there is room for improvement, but she has cautioned against any significant reduction in regulation.Ms. Yellen is scheduled to speak here about financial regulation on Friday morning.Mr. Cohn has rarely spoken publicly about his views on monetary policy, but he is a key adviser to Mr. Trump on the administration\u2019s plans to cut financial regulation.In addition to criticism from conservatives, Ms. Yellen also has faced criticism from liberals who argue that the Fed is moving too quickly to raise rates.Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups, has made a tradition of bringing protesters to the Jackson Hole conference to press for more stimulus, and it staged a teach-in on Thursday to emphasize that the economic recovery remains incomplete.\u201cLet\u2019s not prematurely choke off this recovery,\u201d Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University, told the activists gathered outside the conference hotel.But this year, the group is less concerned about what Ms. Yellen might do, and more concerned about someone else taking her place.Mr. Sperling, who also addressed the protesters, compared Ms. Yellen to Jim Harbaugh, the University of Michigan football coach who has improved the performance of that program but not yet beaten its archrival Ohio State.\u201cThe Bernanke and Yellen Fed do deserve praise for very expansive and creative monetary policy and that there has been real policy since 2010,\u201d Mr. Sperling said. \u201cWe should also equally recognize it doesn\u2019t mean things are good enough.\u201dThe choice confronting Mr. Trump parallels the Fed\u2019s internal policy debate.Inflation remains persistently sluggish. The Fed aims for 2 percent annual inflation, and it expects to miss that target for the fifth-straight year. Some Fed officials want to wait for evidence that inflation is rebounding before raising rates again.Most officials, however, see the low level of unemployment as a sufficient reason for confidence that inflation will rebound. \u201cI think we should continue with the gradual rate path,\u201d Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the annual monetary policy conference here, told CNBC. \u201cWhile we haven\u2019t hit 2 percent, I\u2019m reminded that 2 percent is a target over the long term, and in the context of a growing economy, of jobs being added, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue that we should be particularly concerned about unless we see something change.\u201dBoth Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen were nominated in October, but there is little sign that the Trump administration is moving toward a quick decision. Mr. Trump had told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to make a decision by the end of the year.That would leave relatively little time for the person selected by Mr. Trump to be questioned and confirmed by the Senate before Ms. Yellen\u2019s term ends in February.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Linking Public Works to Local Hiring Faces a Trump Challenge", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is a classic win-win for Chicago,\u201d Mayor Rahm Emanuel said last year when he announced the contract and the 170 jobs that the factory would create, in addition to training programs and community hiring.Now the Trump administration may rescind an Obama-era initiative that allows hiring preferences on transportation and construction projects in states like New York, California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, a prospect that has alarmed advocates of such programs.Jobs to Move America was one of several groups that spent years working with transportation officials in the Obama administration on a pilot project to test whether local hiring preferences reduced competition or drove up prices. In January, days before President Trump was sworn in, the Transportation Department extended the experiment, taking place in more than a dozen cities, for five years so that research could be completed.The agency\u2019s move troubled officials both within and outside the affected cities.Cleveland, which is not a part of the pilot project, has been fighting for its own local hiring ordinance in the courts, Washington or the Statehouse since it was first adopted in 2003.Citing federal restrictions, however, the Federal Highway Administration still ended up using its discretionary power to withdraw funding for a project there because of the Lewis law. And in 2009 during the recession, President Barack Obama\u2019s transportation secretary rejected Cleveland\u2019s request to apply its provisions to the city\u2019s share of federal stimulus money.The ban, Attorney General Mike DeWine of Ohio argued in his appeal, \u201cprotects construction workers from residency quotas\u201d like those that exist in Cleveland and Akron, and \u201callows construction workers to live where they want without losing out on available work.\u201dMayor Frank G. Jackson of Cleveland countered that cities often spend huge sums on development activities, but \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily see the benefits going back to their citizens, in terms of contracts and wages.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t do this willy-nilly,\u201d he said of the city\u2019s hiring law. \u201cThis is just common-sense stuff.\u201dAccording to figures compiled by the mayor\u2019s office, one-fifth of all work hours went to Cleveland residents and 11 percent of those Cleveland hours went to low-income residents.\u201cThere are still a lot of hurdles to navigate this issue, and we haven\u2019t figured any of this out yet,\u201d said Bryan Luellen, vice president for public affairs and communications at IndyGo, the city\u2019s public transportation corporation. Even though the bulk of the project may be financed with city money, he said, \u201cthe you-have-to-hire-locally piece is not something we\u2019re going to be able to do without special permission from the Federal Transit Administration.\u201dIn March, CRRC broke ground on the new factory in Chicago\u2019s Hegewisch neighborhood.

California, under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, dropped Columbus Day as a state holiday in 2009 as a cost-cutting measure.The move in Los Angeles was made over the objections of Italian American groups that view Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage. Some suggested a day honoring indigenous peoples could be held on another date.\u201cIt\u2019s not about that,\u201d she said.\u201cWe know of the brutality of Columbus,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I want Italians American to understand that this is not in any way to disparage them.

Local news media organizations with ties to Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party have accused the nonprofit of conspiring against him.On the Cambodia page of its website, the National Democratic Institute includes a critical description of the grip Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party has on the country.\u201cThe governing Cambodian People\u2019s Party continues to dominate after 30 years under the same leader,\u201d the site says. \u201cCitizens are limited in their engagement of elected officials, and mistrust between civil society and government impedes a fully inclusive and participatory democracy.\u201dThe action against the National Democratic Institute drew a sharp rebuke from critics of the government.\u201cThere have been multilevel efforts by the government and government institutions to restrict and repress the opposition party, civil society and the media,\u201d said Naly Pilorge, deputy director of advocacy at Licadho, a Cambodian human rights group.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the courts or the tax department or new legislation, all these mechanisms are being used by the government to crack down on its critics,\u201d she said.Also facing a tight deadline is The Cambodia Daily, an independent newspaper that has served as a training ground for local reporters and budding foreign correspondents alike.The newspaper has been issued a tax bill of more than $6 million, which it contests. On Tuesday, while at an environmental event in the capital, Phnom Penh, Mr. Hun Sen implied that the newspaper, which was founded by an American journalist, was a \u201cthief\u201d and said it needed to \u201cpack up and leave\u201d if it failed to pay back taxes. The deadline to pay is Sept. 4.The action has alarmed free-speech advocates, who say the paper has aggressively pursued worthwhile topics.\u201cThe Cambodia Daily has tried to apply international standards of news writing in Cambodia, and it has aggressively covered sensitive issues, like corruption, land-grabbing and illegal logging,\u201d said Moeun Chhean Nariddh, director of the Cambodia Institute of Media Studies. \u201cBut unfortunately Cambodian democracy is very young.

He warned against imminent attack and called for military exercises, an old trick to distract from an imploding economy and growing isolation.\u201cEveryone has to join the defense plan, millions of men and women; let\u2019s see how the American imperialists like it,\u201d Mr. Maduro said, announcing two days of exercises next week.The United States is always an outsize player abroad, its statements often carrying more effect in foreign lands than at home. But Mr. Trump\u2019s use of bald threats and warnings of military intervention have accelerated the laws of unintended consequences.\u201cNo one should be allowed to decide on a military action on the Korean Peninsula without South Korean agreement,\u201d Mr. Moon said, executing exactly the kind of split between Seoul and Washington that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has long sought.His declaration underscored how Mr. Trump\u2019s language, which took White House aides by surprise, is sowing division with an ally whose help would be vital to the success of any American military campaign on the divided peninsula.South Koreans have seen a lot of tensions with Washington, but they have never seen an American president explicitly threaten the North with talk of \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d or a declaration that American forces are \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a conflict.\u201cThe Americans had always been an ally who would prevent, not start, war on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d said Kim Ji-woon, a college student attending a rally on Monday in central Seoul that featured a large banner reading, \u201cTrump, shut up!\u201d\u201cWith his trash war talk,\u201d the student said, \u201cTrump makes me wonder what\u2019s the use of the alliance.\u201dMr. Moon has been careful to avoid any steps that his conservative enemies could use to accuse him of undermining the South\u2019s relationship with the United States. But all South Korean leaders have learned that it is politically untenable to look too weak to stand up to a bigger power, even if it happens to be the country\u2019s main ally.Many South Koreans have seethed in recent days over other comments by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, about how a conflict with the North would play out.\u201cIf thousands die, they\u2019re going to die over there \u2014 they\u2019re not going to die here,\u201d Mr. Graham said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, adding that Mr. Trump shared that view and was willing to use military force if necessary. \u201cHe\u2019s told me that to my face \u2014 and that may be provocative, but not really. When you\u2019re president of the United States, where does your allegiance lie?\u201dMr. Rouhani has no interest in watching the agreement dissolve: It is the core of Iran\u2019s new economic relationship with Europe, Russia and China. If the country raced again to produce near-bomb-grade fuel, an international movement could well arise to reimpose sanctions, unless Iran could successfully argue that Mr. Trump goaded the country into its actions.But Mr. Rouhani\u2019s statements to Iranian lawmakers were driven by a domestic imperative not to be seen giving in to American threats to pull out of the deal or renegotiate or widen it.\u201cIran cannot be allowed to use the nuclear deal to hold the world hostage,\u201d Ms. Haley said in the statement.The new United States sanctions on Iran, she said, were not a violation of the nuclear deal but part of an effort to \u201chold Iran responsible for its missile launches, support for terrorism, disregard for human rights and violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\u201dSeveral other Iranian officials have recently threatened to restart industrial-scale uranium enrichment. Ali Akbar Salehi, the president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and a key negotiator of the deal, said the country could go up to 20 percent enrichment of uranium to \u201csurprise the Americans and their supporters.\u201d While that level does not produce bomb-grade material, it is close \u2014 and when Iran began enriching uranium at 20 percent several years ago, it triggered one of the crises that led to threats of conflict and, ultimately, the negotiation over the nuclear deal.Mr. Maduro\u2019s move to rally Venezuela behind new military exercises seemed driven by a desire to remind Venezuelans of previous eras in which the United States meddled in Latin America. The country\u2019s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, warned that the United States sought the nation\u2019s oil supplies, an accusation straight out of the history books.Vice President Mike Pence, in a speech on Monday, struck a more conciliatory note, saying that a diplomatic approach must be employed to stop the country\u2019s slide into authoritarian rule.Mr. Trump, he said in a visit to Colombia, \u201cmade it very clear that we will not stand by while Venezuela collapses into dictatorship.\u201d\u201cA failed state in Venezuela threatens the security and prosperity of our entire hemisphere and the people of the United States of America.\u201d But Mr. Pence never explained what, if any, military solution to the problem was available.His hosts bristled at Mr. Trump\u2019s threat. \u201cThe possibility of a military intervention shouldn\u2019t even be considered,\u201d President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia said during Mr. Pence\u2019s visit.An earlier version of this report incorrectly attributed a quote to President Trump. In fact, it was President Moon Jae-in of South Korea who said that \u201cNo one should be allowed to decide on a military action on the Korean Peninsula without South Korean agreement.\u201dThomas Erdbrink and Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

(He also lamented, incorrectly, that the press was downplaying that fact: \u201cMainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d)And on Thursday, Mr. Trump made clear that he thinks he deserves credit for the latest record high, tweeting, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!The Dow Jones average closed at another record high Thursday. But it was not long ago that Mr. Trump, as a presidential candidate bent on casting the economy as a disaster, said that the stock market was a bubble that should make investors wary.In the early days of his candidacy, Mr. Trump assailed the economic recovery as a mirage and mused about a potential conspiracy that was being plotted between Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, and President Barack Obama. The theory was that she was keeping interest rates low so that the president would not leave office as another recession began.Before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump decided to dispense some financial advice. The recent dip in stocks was a harbinger of worse things to come, he warned, and he hoped that the coming crash did not happen after Mr. Obama left office.Although he was feeling confident about locking up the Republican nomination in April 2016, Mr. Trump was feeling increasingly bearish about stocks. He told The Washington Post that they were overvalued and that the strong data that showed a healthy economy were essentially phony.By September, he was arguing that the Federal Reserve was propping up a \u201cfalse economy\u201d that is actually weak.Mr. Trump saved his most brutal assessment of the stock market, and the economy, for his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. In response to her criticism of his economic proposals, he said that the recovery was the worst since the Great Depression and that it would come crashing down the moment that interest rates rise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labour Party Seeks an Extended Brexit Transition for U.K.", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The opposition Labour Party called on Sunday for an indefinite \u201ctransition period\u201d of de facto membership in the European Union even after the formal deadline for an exit in early 2019, clarifying for the first time the party\u2019s advocacy of a gradual and narrow break with the continental bloc.It was the latest in a series of signs that momentum for a clean break with the European Union has faltered since the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority in June and started grappling with the weight of negotiating the departure.The party\u2019s new stance, he said, was \u201ca grown-up acknowledgment that bespoke transitional arrangements are highly unlikely to be negotiated, agreed and established in the next 18 months.\u201dThe Tories, on Sunday, dismissed the Labour proposal as \u201ca weak attempt to kick the can down the road.\u201dThose who oppose Brexit altogether were hardly more welcoming, saying Labour\u2019s \u201ctransitional period\u201d was nothing more than a diversionary stalling tactic.Fifty-two percent of voters chose to leave the European Union in a referendum a little more than a year ago, defying the recommendation of both major parties at the time.But the referendum results specified neither a timetable for the break nor priorities for the future relations with the continent. That has set off complicated debates within each of the major parties. Until now, Labour\u2019s leaders have sought to dodge the question while letting Conservatives feud among themselves.Both parties are now promising to preserve as much as possible of European free trade rules, which are vital to the British economy. But on immigration \u2014 an issue that fired up the referendum vote for an exit \u2014 both parties are also pledging to impose new restrictions on the free movement of people, a requirement for membership in the single market.By staking out a notably softer and more gradual approach, Labour has now set up the clearest contrast yet between the two parties.\u201cLabour would seek a transitional deal that maintains the same basic terms that we currently enjoy,\u201d Mr. Starmer wrote in the column published Sunday. \u201cThat means we would seek to remain in a customs union with the E.U. and within the single market during this period. It means we would abide by the common rules of both.\u201dBeyond this transition period, he wrote, Labour would seek \u201ca strong and lasting new relationship with the E.U. \u2013 not as members, as partners.\u201d Such a relationship \u201cmust extend far beyond trade and security to include education, science, technology, medicine and culture\u201d and retain \u201cthe benefits of the customs union and the single market,\u201d he wrote.But, Mr. Starmer added, the proposed \u201ctransitional period\u201d should not be a \u201cnever-ending purgatory,\u201d because that would not tackle \u201ccentral issues the referendum exposed \u2013 in particular the need for more effective management of migration, which Labour recognize must be addressed in the final deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Singleton was fired from his job as a senior adviser for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in February after previous writings critical of Mr. Trump came to light, yet he remained supportive. No more.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to continue to have hope for President Trump,\u201d Mr. Singleton said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to focus on complex policy issues when you have a country that is falling apart. It\u2019s difficult to focus on health care. It\u2019s difficult to focus on the economy. It\u2019s difficult to focus on infrastructure when you have people who dislike other people because of their ethnicity.\u201d\u201cThese people,\u201d he said, \u201cwere waving Nazi flags.\u201dAbout a dozen interviews with black conservatives like Mr. Singleton revealed the tough question they are wrestling with: How can blacks who have defended the Republican Party against accusations of racism for decades remain loyal to a president who has, wittingly or unwittingly, boosted and buoyed the racists?Republican lawmakers and other leaders have distanced themselves from President Trump since his comments on the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.If he wants absolution, they say, he needs to show contrition.Many black Republicans and their families have personally experienced racism \u2014 and in some cases witnessed violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan and other supremacist groups that lynched thousands of people, beat and murdered civil rights marchers, and supported segregationist policies that held African-Americans back.Black conservatives balked at Mr. Trump\u2019s lament that it was \u201csad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments\u201d as an uncompromising defense of Confederate memorials.And they fretted that he and his administration have made \u201claw and order\u201d a centerpiece of their response to Charlottesville.\u201cThe \u2018tough on crime\u2019 phrase in my mind is nothing more than a code phrase for imprisoning blacks and people of color,\u201d Mr. Cheadle said, before criticizing Mr. Trump for hiring only a handful of black people in the West Wing. \u201cMr. Trump waxes eloquent about providing jobs as the panacea for the racial divide and curing the woes of the inner city. The president would do well to lead by example.\u201dThe majority of black Republicans interviewed said they would continue to support the president even as they criticize him. Most said they hope that Mr. Trump will prove his critics wrong and usher in a new phase of conservative policies that will overhaul the tax code, create new jobs, transform the health system and revamp the country\u2019s entitlement programs.\u201cI don\u2019t know that you can designate everybody who went to the rally from the camp of KKK as being nasty, mean, or say that their intention is to physically assault people,\u201d said Chuck Linton, 70, a retired military veteran from Baltimore and an African-American. \u201cI know that a lot of them, their intention is to be violent, but I don\u2019t think all of them are.\u201d\u201cThe white supremacists and the left wing, and the right wing and the middle wing are all the same anyway,\u201d he scoffed.\u201cI knew after the news conference that he was going to want to see some positive coverage, probably some black folks in front of the screen saying really nice things about how he is awesome and he rocked that news conference,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be used as a puppet.\u201dMr. Caldwell added that it was \u201chard to defend President Trump when you know that no matter what happens in some days or weeks, he is going to step on the message and say something ridiculous and change the conversation.\u201dGoing forward, he said, \u201cIf there is a position that I can agree with him on, I will, but it is going to be with a much more critical viewpoint then there was before.\u201dHis position echoed Mr. Scott, who followed his Vice interview by saying on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the president could \u201cregain\u201d his moral authority by sitting down with \u201cfolks who have a personal experience, a deep connection to the horror and the pain of this country\u2019s provocative racial history.\u201dQuardricos Driskell, a Republican federal lobbyist and a religion and politics professor at George Washington University, never supported the president and said he believed early in the campaign that Mr. Trump held discriminatory views.\u201cThe moral dilemma I face at this very moment and the question I have to wrestle with is Trump being the head of the Republican Party and yet courting and being complicit with this very small group that has always been at the fringes of our society,\u201d said Mr. Driskell, who remains a Republican. \u201cHe has now helped to usher them into the mainstream. What does that mean as a black man who happens to be a Republican and happens to believe in conservative values and principles?\u201d\u201cWe are in the predicament that we are in now because of the fact that people did not read the writing on the wall,\u201d said Tamika D.

{"Headline": "Cracking the Airlines\u2019 Dress Code", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may matter what air travelers wear on the plane.But even for those paying regular fares, there is a dress policy, of sorts. United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines all list bare feet as grounds for removal from flights in their official contract of carriage documents, for example. United\u2019s policy also covers passengers \u201cnot properly clothed,\u201d and American\u2019s warns that the airline may refuse to transport passengers \u201cclothed in a manner that would cause discomfort or offense to other passengers.\u201d\u201cYou know, people would have told you two decades ago that it was a good idea to dress nicely on a plane, because you never know if the airline might take care of you, like maybe bump you up to business class or first class because you look nice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t really happen now. Airlines know who their best customers are, and they\u2019re the ones they\u2019ll bring up if there\u2019s a seat available.\u201dBut it may not be as simple as that.Mr. Hobica told of wearing a navy blue suit on a United flight a few years ago from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Los Angeles, where he lives.\u201cI was in the lounge, where everybody was dressed in sandals and gym clothes, and I heard them call my name,\u201d he said. He thought he was being bumped, but instead he was upgraded to first class.\u201cI don\u2019t have status on any airline,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I only buy based on price.\u201d He concluded that the freshly pressed suit was the source of his luck.Mr. Hobica then relayed tales of friends who had been upgraded while wearing clothes they considered nicer than what they might wear to the gym or the grocery store, and a conversation he once had with a gate agent friend at Lufthansa.\u201cShe told me she would upgrade people based on how good-looking they are, how pregnant they are, or how nicely they\u2019re dressed,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said: \u2018Look, we oversell flights and, of course, we go down the status list first. Absolutely, we look at your miles.\u2019\u201d But if no one on the flight warrants special privileges, the absence of ripped jeans or tattered sneakers can help, Mr. Hobica said.Ashton Morrow, a Delta spokeswoman, said her airline, like most, adheres to set corporate practices that do not take appearances into account in selecting passengers for unexpected perks.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of factors that go into upgrading, including loyalty and recent delays we might want to make up for,\u201d she said. \u201cUpgrading based on wardrobe is never our policy.\u201dStill, dressing well for flights may yield more subtle benefits.That does not mean, she said, that she will pour full cans of ginger ale for the well-dressed passengers while their neighbors in flip-flops receive half cans, or that she is more inclined to be especially attentive to those well-dressed passengers. But she said she remembered a time when most customers considered flying an occasion to dress up, and she suspects one result was increased civility for everyone on board, particularly those who paid closest attention to their appearance.\u201cMy personal opinion is that when you take pride in how you look, you take pride in how you act,\u201d she said.Nancy Marquis, another longtime United flight attendant, retired in 2007 but is still a frequent flier. She said she understood the inclination to dress \u201clike a slob\u201d on a plane.When she became a flight attendant in 1969, seats were bigger and security was not as much of a bother. Now, she said, \u201cyou have less personal space and fewer amenities, so you want to be as comfortable as possible.\u201dFor many, the democratization of air travel meant that buying a plane ticket no longer merited a trip to the dry cleaner. But one thing stayed the same, Ms. Marquis said: Regardless of where passengers were seated on a plane, in economy or in a premium section, everyone dressed similarly.Before deregulation, everyone was dressed for a business meeting and no one wore jeans, she said. Now, no one is dressed for a meeting and everyone wears jeans.There is a relatively new twist to that trend of dressing similarly. Airlines including American, United and Delta have started offering first- and business-class international passengers free pajamas on overnight flights in recent years, according to Mr. Sumers \u2014 something he said was more closely associated with Asian and European airlines.One result could be an antidote to the withering looks from passengers who do not approve of seatmates\u2019 hoodies and sweatpants, and an overall avoidance of skirmishes over what is appropriate airplane attire.\u201cThe pajamas are a wonderful trend,\u201d Mr. Sumers said. \u201cIt can be truly bizarre, because you\u2019ll have like 60 seats in business class, and 40 of the passengers have decided to wear the pajamas. So for like 10 hours, everybody is matching.\u201dMs. Marquis said everybody was probably more at ease, too.\u201cIf you look fabulous or you look horrendous on an airplane, you\u2019re going to stick out,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re dressed like everybody else, there are no extremes and you have nothing to worry about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Latin America, Pence Aims to Soften \u2018America First\u2019 Message", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 During a whirlwind trip to four Latin American countries this week, Vice President Mike Pence sought to soften the edges of the \u2018America first\u2019 worldview \u2014 the administration\u2019s first major effort to mend fences with a region rattled by President Trump\u2019s election.\u201cUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first,\u201d Mr. Pence said Wednesday in Chile during the third leg of a trip that began in Colombia and included stops in Argentina and Panama. \u201cBut as I hope my presence today demonstrates, \u2018America first\u2019 does not mean America alone.\u201dYet Mr. Pence\u2019s hopeful message of expanded economic and diplomatic cooperation did little to assuage fears among the region\u2019s leaders, who have been furiously planning for an era of diminishing returns in Washington by deepening regional trade relations and pursuing expanded commercial ties with Europe and China.Mr. Trump is widely loathed in Latin America, where his early moves have been interpreted as a return to an overbearing, security-obsessed American foreign policy. The contrast has been sharp with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, when Latin Americans felt they were treated with an unusual degree of deference and respect.The trip, which Mr. Pence cut short by a day to attend a national security meeting at home, was the latest example of the daunting task Mr. Trump\u2019s surrogates face as they set out to modulate and interpret the president\u2019s bellicose and impulsive remarks.During joint appearances with Mr. Pence, Presidents Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, Mauricio Macri of Argentina and Michelle Bachelet of Chile firmly opposed the prospect of an American military intervention in response to Venezuela\u2019s political and humanitarian crisis. \u201cChile will not support coups or military interventions,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said pointedly on Wednesday.\u201cIf I put myself in the shoes of an American citizen, I understand the appeal of trying to prioritize your national interests,\u201d said Camila Capriglioni, 21, a medical student in Buenos Aires. \u201cBut I really dislike everything he represents,\u201d she added, referring to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that he will find a way to get Mexico to pay for a border wall, his crackdown on unauthorized immigrants and his return to a confrontational stance with Cuba are among the main reasons the president is reviled in Latin America, analysts say.\u201cLatin America is in a situation where the United States has absolutely no interest in soft power,\u201d said Juan Gabriel Tokatlian, an international relations professor at the Torcuato Di Tella University in Buenos Aires.\u201cThe only thing he talks about are sticks,\u201d Mr. Tokatlian said, \u201cof being hard with Mexico, with Venezuela and that will only accelerate the process of countries moving away from Washington.\u201dDuring his stop in Chile, Mr. Pence proclaimed that \u201cthis is a new era in the new world\u201d as he vowed to find ways to build on strong commercial relations in the region. Yet he had little in the way of concrete measures to announce, except for deals to open the American market to Colombian avocados and for the United States to export rice to Colombia.As they warily watch the chaos in Washington, several governments in Latin America are hedging their bets.Mr. Trump \u201chas put the commercial ties to the region in doubt by questioning trade deals and promoting \u2018America first,\u2019 \u201d said Ra\u00fal Sohr, an international relations analyst in Santiago. \u201cThat raises huge questions regarding how commerce with the United States could be affected.\u201dMembers of Congress who have worked to build robust partnerships in the region say the new administration has done severe damage in a short time.\u201cWhile President Obama worked over eight years to build partnerships based on respect and common interests, in a mere six months, President Trump has jammed the policy into reverse,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said in an emailed statement.\u201cThe Latin countries, like many of our other friends and allies, are unsure of what the White House\u2019s intentions are and fear either a return to the days of U.S. arrogance and bullying or, at best, benign neglect,\u201d the statement said.Mari Carmen Aponte, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s top diplomat for Latin America, told her counterparts in the region to brace for change.\u201cI told them that they had to be realistic, that things were about to become more transactional,\u201d Ms. Aponte recalled. If they wanted to get on Washington\u2019s good side, she advised, \u201cthey had to emphasize not only what they could do with the United States, but what they could do for the United States.\u201dSeveral have followed that advice. Mr. Santos and Mr. Macri were among the first world leaders to travel to Washington after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Mr. Santos, seeking continued foreign aid for Colombia\u2019s peace process, praised Mr. Trump as a leader who \u201cknows a good deal when he sees one.\u201dOther governments, including Brazil\u2019s, have opted to lie low, said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas in S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cI think there\u2019s a notion among some of South America\u2019s elites that the best thing to do these four, eight years is not to raise your head much and stay off the radar,\u201d he said.Sergio Riveros, 35, a computer scientist in Santiago, Chile, said that a low profile might not help. \u201cWhat we worry about the most is the conflicts he has, like with North Korea,\u201d Mr. Riveros said of Mr. Trump. A rash decision \u201ccould spark a war that affects us all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an analyst in Santiago commenting on Latin American trade deals.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Barnstorms for \u2018Moral Responsibility\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was. And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201dThat was Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, across the table from me over breakfast here in downtown Austin late last week at the end of a mini-tour across the country during which he focused on topics usually reserved for politicians: manufacturing, jobs and education.He had just spent the prior day in Ohio, where he toured CTS, a technology company that produces the equipment that Apple uses to test water resistance and dust protection for the iPhone and the Apple Watch. He then flew to Des Moines, where he announced plans to make a $1.3 billion investment in a 400,000-square-foot data center in nearby Waukee to help store and move giant amounts of information for its services like iCloud and FaceTime. And he arrived here to announce that Austin Community College will begin offering its 74,000 students a curriculum that Apple developed to teach them how to write code to create apps for iPhones. Austin is one of 30 community colleges that will offer the curriculum.As Mr. Cook\u2019s breakfast arrived \u2014 two scrambled egg whites, crispy bacon (they didn\u2019t have his preferred turkey bacon), sugar-free cereal with unsweetened almond milk \u2014 he described his week, punctuated by a visit the night before to the L.B.J. Presidential Library, the museum of President Lyndon B. Johnson.\u201cOne of the things that hits you,\u201d he said, is \u201call of the major acts, legislation, that happened during just his presidency.\u201d His eyes widened as he listed some: \u201cYou have the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Act, you have Medicare, you have Medicaid, you have several national parks, you have Head Start, you have housing discrimination, you have jury discrimination.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your politics,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou look at it and say, \u2018My gosh.\u2019\u201dMr. Cook\u2019s comments weren\u2019t a dig at President Trump so much as they were a critique of Washington\u2019s seemingly perpetual state of gridlock.And now Mr. Cook is one of the many business leaders in the country who appear to be filling the void, using his platform at Apple to wade into larger social issues that typically fell beyond the mandate of executives in past generations.He said he had never set out to do so, but he feels he has been thrust into the role as virtually every large American company has had to stake out a domestic policy.He was vocal, for example, in criticizing Mr. Trump after Charlottesville in a memo to his staff: \u201cI disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans.\u201dWatching Mr. Cook over the years, I\u2019ve been fascinated to see how he has become as animated when talking about big issues like education and climate change as he is when talking about Apple.\u201cI think we have a moral responsibility to help grow the economy, to help grow jobs, to contribute to this country and to contribute to the other countries that we do business in,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI think there\u2019s still probably a more significant group that feels my sole responsibility is to Wall Street.\u201dHis critics will, of course, say all this happy talk is a P.R. ploy for a company that makes its most popular products on the other side of the world and keeps nearly a quarter-trillion dollars abroad, untaxed by Uncle Sam. In fairness, Apple is one of the largest taxpayers in the country, paying $28 billion in federal taxes between 2014 and 2016 at an average rate of 26 percent, which is in the middle for big multinational American corporations.And Mr. Cook is paid handsomely: On Thursday, as a result of the company\u2019s financial outperformance compared with its peers, Mr. Cook was given nearly $90 million of stock as part of his previously agreed upon compensation plan. (He has said he plans to give away all of his wealth.)But there\u2019s a more nuanced version of Apple\u2019s story \u2014 and Mr. Cook\u2019s transformation of the company after taking over as its chief executive in 2011 \u2014 that has been lost amid the din of nonstop chatter about the company in Silicon Valley and Washington.When Mr. Cook announced, for example, the new data facility in Waukee, he said it would run fully on renewable energy. But he slipped in another fact that has largely gone unnoticed: Over the past several years, Mr. Cook has gotten all of the company\u2019s corporate facilities in the United States to run on wind and solar energy \u2014 in their entirety.\u201cWe\u2019re running Apple a hundred percent on renewable energy today\u201d in the United States, he said over breakfast, \u201cand we\u2019ve now hit that in 23 other countries around the world.\u201dHe is hoping the curriculum turns into jobs. Last year, according to Apple, 150,000 new jobs were created through the App Store. Apple paid out $5 billion directly to app makers.He said he had chosen to focus on getting the curriculum to community colleges, rather than four-year colleges, because \u201cas it turns out, the community college system is much more diverse than the four-year schools, particularly the four-year schools that are known for comp sci.\u201d He noted that \u201cthere is a definite diversity issue in tech, in particular in coding and computer scientists.\u201dApple has already rolled out the curriculum in Alabama, Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other states. \u201cYou want it to increase the diversity of people that are in there, both racial diversity, gender diversity, but also geographic diversity,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cRight now, the benefits of tech are too lopsided to certain states.\u201d (Like California.)Students who take the classes learn the Swift language, which is used to make apps on Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad. Admittedly, Mr. Cook is not helping students learn how to code in languages for his competitors, but he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s significantly transferable.\u201dHe continued, with a laugh: \u201cWe know that people making a mobile app, many of them are going to make iOS apps and Android apps. And I wish they wouldn\u2019t, but they\u2019re probably going to.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to make money on it. It\u2019s a gift.\u201dAs for Mr. Cook\u2019s coding skills? \u201cI might fail a little bit on that.\u201dAs we finished up breakfast before we headed over to Austin\u2019s Capital Factory, an incubator for tech start-ups where he would announce the new curriculum, I mentioned a question that some in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have asked: Is his focus on jobs and speeches in front of American flags a hint at something bigger? After all, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s name is now regularly bandied about in discussions of potential presidential candidates.\u201cI have a full-time job,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cI appreciate the compliment,\u201d he added with a wry look, \u201cif it is a compliment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Samsung Executive Awaits Verdict, Company Surges", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Samsung Electronics became the world\u2019s most profitable technology company last month, its de facto leader was in jail.Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman and heir apparent to Samsung Group, faces charges that he bribed South Korean government officials to solidify his family\u2019s control of one of the world\u2019s biggest business empires. On Monday, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Lee should be sentenced to 12 years in prison.Samsung, by contrast, appears to be doing just fine without its boss. The conglomerate\u2019s electronics arm made $10 billion in profit last quarter, thanks in part to strong demand for its chips. Samsung has also begun to cast aside the cloud that fell over it last year when its Galaxy Note 7, a high-priced smartphone meant to challenge the Apple iPhone but which showed a proclivity to burst into flames, became one of the technology world\u2019s most spectacular failures.The question is how long Samsung can travel down both of these paths.Should Mr. Lee go to prison, or if his reputation is too badly damaged, experts say it remains unclear whether the cadre of professional managers that reports to the Lees can make the strategic decisions needed to keep Samsung on the rise.\u201cSamsung\u2019s recent performance has little to do with senior management,\u201d said Kim Woochan, a professor of finance at Korea University Business School in Seoul. \u201cIt\u2019s riding on the coattails of a rebounding semiconductor industry.\u201dMr. Lee said that he committed no crime but that as a senior figure at Samsung, he felt \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the scandal.\u201cI used to make a pledge to myself that when I am fully in charge of management, I would do things properly, abide by the law and do things right as well as become a businessman respected by society and people,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cI am filled with many emotions that I stand in court before I could live up to my words.\u201dNone of it seems to have slowed down Samsung in the short term.\u201cIn terms of crisis management, the company has been learning quite fast,\u201d said Yoo-Kyung Park, a specialist in corporate governance at APG Asset Management, a Dutch pension-fund firm that owns Samsung Electronics shares.Ms. Park credited Samsung Electronics managers for quickly cauterizing the wound left by the Galaxy Note 7. Many Korean companies, she said, would have been more reluctant to acknowledge failure \u2014 an approach she characterized as \u201cdelay, and deny, deny, deny\u201d \u2014 but Samsung scrapped the phone, absorbed the cost and moved on.Consumers seem to have moved on, too: The Galaxy S8, the next major product to launch after the Galaxy Note 7, is selling well, helping contribute to Samsung\u2019s rebound.In contrast, Apple, the perennial industry leader, earned $8.7 billion in the same period, though analysts expect Apple\u2019s profit to be larger than Samsung\u2019s for the year.Analysts say Samsung is also reaping rewards from past investments. A decade ago it plowed money into semiconductors and digital displays, crucial components of smartphones and other modern devices, and today it is the world\u2019s leading producer of both, with revenues to match.Even if Mr. Lee is not convicted, South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in, has promised to take steps to weaken dynastic control over the conglomerates, or chaebol, that dominate the Korean economy.The court proceedings, which prosecutors have billed as the \u201ctrial of the century,\u201d lasted four months and have been obsessively followed by the South Korean news media and public. Some of its 53 sessions finished after midnight. Fifty-nine witnesses appeared, including Mr. Lee, other Samsung executives and former cabinet members. Ms. Park refused to testify.Prosecutors on Monday accused Mr. Lee of deflecting blame onto subordinates. Earlier in the trial, Choi Gee-sung, the former chief of Samsung\u2019s Future Strategy Office, testified that he had signed off on donations to foundations controlled by Ms. Choi without informing Mr. Lee.Mr. Kim, the professor, said the trial and surrounding scandal had shown that, at the very least, Mr. Lee was not fit to run Samsung. But he predicted, based on the history of Samsung and other chaebol whose founders have fallen into legal trouble, that Mr. Lee would try to make a comeback regardless.\u201cIf the shares had fallen, they could have made the argument\u201d that Mr. Lee was crucial to Samsung\u2019s performance, he said. \u201cBut this hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201dChaebol leaders rarely spend time in prison, despite a history of convictions. Lee Kun-hee was convicted of breach of trust in connection with business deals in the 1990s that allowed Lee Jae-yong to cheaply accumulate shares in Samsung companies, but he was later pardoned.Mr. Kim said that with political and social scrutiny of chaebol stronger now, the younger Mr. Lee could face a tougher road.\u201cThe entire nation is watching,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Your Choices", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersA common theme was clear as readers offered more than 1,200 alternatives to the Democrats\u2019 new slogan, \u201cA Better Deal\u201d: The party needs to offer a positive, inclusive, empathetic message. Variations of \u201cWe the People\u201d and \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d were especially popular.We\u2019ve got to identify with the voters and show empathy. And we\u2019ve got to shake off the label \u201celitist.\u201d We, too, work, pay our bills, worship, love our families and respect the Constitution. The slogan is upbeat and rings true to our history of standing up for labor, economic growth, health care, public schools and other social goods.\u201cFor the People\u201dTheodore Roosevelt stood for the \u201cSquare Deal,\u201d his distant cousin Franklin pledged to the American people that they would get a \u201cNew Deal,\u201d and his successor, Harry S. Truman, believed in a \u201cFair Deal.\u201d \u201cA Better Deal\u201d clearly wilts alongside its three powerful predecessors.A strong, simple and meaningful phrase such as \u201cFor the People\u201d could work well for the Democratic Party in these times of economic inequality.TED PERLE, LAKE FOREST, CALIF.The writer is a member of the executive board of the California Democratic Party.\u201cThe Real Deal\u201d\u201cA Better Deal\u201d rests on a case of one-upmanship: What we offer doesn\u2019t have to be good, just better. That\u2019s dancing to someone else\u2019s tune.\u201cThe Real Deal\u201d reminds voters that Democrats are serious about governance; it isn\u2019t all hyperbole and empty rhetoric. It suggests that Democrats know how to deliver \u2014 on health care, job growth, banking protections, equality under the law. It showcases reality and the task of finding real solutions to America\u2019s problems. The president will continue to whine about \u201cfake news,\u201d while doing his best to gaslight the nation. This leaves Democrats with the great opportunity to define themselves as the enemies of unreality: We are \u2026 \u201cthe real deal.\u201dThe writer is the author of \u201cLiking Ike: Eisenhower, Advertising, and the Rise of Celebrity Politics.\u201d\u201cMake America America Again\u201dThis slogan addresses the fact that we have gotten away from the values that make America great \u2014 inclusiveness, the rule of law, opportunity for everyone, innovation, our can-do attitude, our work ethic and our faith in democracy. The Democrats would do well to inspire us to embrace these values again, and they could show how every program they propose would further these values.\u201cIt\u2019s My Party, and I\u2019ll Cry if I Want To\u201dI think that this slogan sums up my general frustration with the Democrats (with apologies to Lesley Gore).CARLA RECZEK, OAK PARK, MICH.\u201cMake America Work Again!\u201dI like it because it can refer to jobs and the economy \u2014 and is also a commentary on the Republican Party\u2019s inability to get anything done. It is also a play on President Trump\u2019s slogan and can imply that he has not been successful in achieving his goals.NANCY T. ROCKWELL, BROOKLYN\u201cStop the Madness\u201dAs much as I love my state\u2019s senior senator, Chuck Schumer, \u201cA Better Deal\u201d just doesn\u2019t do it for me. Democrats, the last nine months have been rough. But stop trying so hard. Speak from the heart, and say what we are all thinking. Stop this reality show. The kids have thrown their party, but now the parents must come home before the house burns down. Stop the madness.MARK KAPLOWITZ, ALBANY\u201cThe Party of Yes\u201dFor the entire Obama presidency, the Republicans reveled in being the Party of No. Now that they are the governing party, they continue to be purely negative, accomplishing nothing, excluding nearly everyone. Their only core belief is that government is not the answer, another negative, and to mindlessly cut taxes simply to \u201cstarve the beast.\u201d They do not have a single \u201cyes\u201d idea, as their failure on health care vividly displayed. Building on the Obama slogan, Yes We Can, the Democrats need to become the Party of Yes with constructive, positive answers to address the concerns of those who have been driven out, left out and left behind.CLAUDE SHOSTAL, NEW YORK\u201cYou Deserve Better\u201dThis slogan points out that the public certainly deserves better political representation than it is getting \u2026 but it also requires the Democrats to admit that they need to do better as well. It is an admission that they somehow managed to miss the anger and anxiety of a large swath of America and, in the process, disaffected millions to the degree that many were willing to look to Donald Trump as an acceptable alternative.MARILYN J. BELLOCK, NEW YORK\u201cMake America Great Again\u201dHow about if the Democrats turn the tables on President Trump and make their new slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Wait, what?Here\u2019s why it\u2019s genius: 1) It gives Democrats a golden opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s broken promises and present their better solutions. 2) It will generate plenty of free media exposure. 3) It co-opts Trump followers into being unwitting Democratic proponents. 4) Bonus: It will make Trump supporters\u2019 heads explode. In guerrilla warfare circles, this is known as a false flag attack.\u201cMake Reading the Newspaper Relaxing Again\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re By Your Side\u201dThis can be easily worked into broader messages. For example: \u201cWhen you need help with your medical bills, we\u2019re by your side. When you\u2019re worrying whether your child can afford to go to college, we\u2019re by your side. And when you\u2019re discriminated against for any reason, we\u2019re by you side.\u201d Not government on your back. Government by your side. The Democrats need a message that shows they care. And they need to drop their \u201cwe know better\u201d (even if it is true) attitude.JEFF LOWELL, NEW YORK\u201cFor the Many, Not the Few\u201dI was going to suggest a slogan along the lines of the British Labour Party\u2019s widely popular \u201cFor the Many, Not the Few,\u201d but that would require that the Democrats actually embrace that ethos.\u201cThe New American Dream\u201d The basic middle-class promise \u2014 if you work hard, you can have a decent home, a good job, affordable health care, quality education for your kids and a secure retirement \u2014 has been steadily eroding for decades. Democrats need to embrace a set of policies to bring back these five core elements for anyone willing to work hard \u2014 not by bringing back the jobs of yesterday but by growing the jobs of tomorrow and extending them to more and more people: millennials, minorities, women and, yes, white working-class men. The American dream still resonates, but in the 21st century it\u2019s different. It\u2019s new.PETER CUNNINGHAM, CHICAGO\u201cBetterTogether\u201dBetterTogether strikes at the heart of the deep divisions in our country that have inhibited our ability to govern our country effectively, and makes the point that we can do better only if we unite and do it together. This is what the Democratic Party must convey in order to succeed.\u201cDraw the Circle Wide\u201dI can\u2019t claim it as mine. It\u2019s part of a hymn: \u201cDraw the circle, draw the circle wide. No one stands alone, we\u2019ll stand side by side.\u201d I believe it to be a simple statement of what our national attitude and priorities should be, and what it will take to make this country work for everybody.\u201cJustice, Compassion and Jobs!\u201dIt speaks to the core values and, in the end, it\u2019s the economy, stupid!WYNN SCHWARTZ, BOSTON\u201cRestore Our Dignity!\u201dPresident Trump has trampled the dignity of the presidency, embarrassed the United States internationally and violated basic human decency by demeaning women, immigrants and minorities. That\u2019s why I suggest \u201cRestore Our Dignity!\u201d as a slogan for the Democrats. Making America truly great again requires reaffirming and protecting the basic human dignity of all people, a core American value.\u201cAn America That Works\u201dMy slogan works on a couple of levels \u2014 putting Americans back to work (as President Trump has pledged but so far has failed to do), and making government work for all people.And unlike \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d with its too-cute-by-half Trump reference, my slogan ignores the current administration entirely, and also eschews the wishy-washiness of \u201cbetter.\u201d We\u2019re not trying to make a good country better. We\u2019re trying to take a broken country and make it work.JAKE ALRICH, NEW YORK\u201cIntegrity. Opportunity. Prosperity.\u201dThe first word reminds us how important, and how currently lacking, is the element of trust in our elected officials.The second word calls to mind the very American ideals of social mobility and the possibility of achieving a better future.The final word underscores the goal of a higher standard of living and economic growth.In the end, most Americans aren\u2019t expecting to build a Utopian paradise. What most of us want is a level playing field and a shot at greatness.\u201cTogether, Wherever We Go!\u201dBecause it is inclusive as well as uplifting, I like the title of the song that Ethel Merman belted out in \u201cGypsy.\u201d It refers to our past, as it looks to the future.MICHELLE ROBINSON GERSTEN, MIAMI\u201cWe\u2019re Listening Now\u201dTo this end, the Democrats could establish \u201clistening posts\u201d \u2014 online sites where people could send their ideas and concerns, and receive actual replies rather than form letters. They could also conduct town hall-style meetings where representatives are there only to listen. Then the party should convene to read and discuss all the things their constituents have written and said, and devise a plan that meets the needs and desires of the citizens.ALISON DIDIER, ST. PAUL\u201cBy the People and For the People\u201dNo party is perfect. Far from it. But in recent times it has become overwhelmingly apparent that one party represents lobbyist groups and the wealthy. The other party represents what is in the best interests of all people and the environment. The Democratic Party would do well to remind Americans (and itself) of this mission. Therefore, \u201cBy the People and For the People\u201d should be its slogan.STEVEN SEIGEL, NEW MILFORD, N.J.\u201cAmerica\u2019s Party\u201dWhat the Democrats need more than a slogan is a strategy. I say this as someone who has spent a career writing slogans. I did some thinking about a new branding strategy last spring and arrived at nearly the same place as Thomas J. Lee, who in his July 31 to the editor suggested \u201cTruth, Justice and the American Way.\u201d I\u2019d go big, stealing all the thunder the Republicans have abandoned. The Democrats are \u201cAmerica\u2019s Party.\u201d\u201cWe are on your side.\u201dBut then they\u2019d have to prove it.\u201cHope and Change\u201dIf a slogan is worth anything, it should endure longer than just the next election. Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cHope and Change\u201d says it all and could become the mantra for all future political parties.No slogan.It\u2019s better because people want action, not slogans.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the letter from Minneapolis misstated the writer\u2019s name.

{"Headline": "China Steps Up Warnings Over Debt-Fueled Overseas Acquisitions", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China moved on Friday to curb investment overseas by its companies and conglomerates, issuing its strongest signal yet that it wants to rein in runaway debt that could pose a threat to the country\u2019s slowing economy.In the latest move, a statement published by China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, said the authorities would punish companies for violating foreign investment rules, and establish a blacklist of businesses that did so. The statement was attributed to the National Development and Reform Commission, the commerce ministry, the foreign ministry and the central bank.The statement pointed to acquisitions in sectors ranging from entertainment and sports clubs to hotels, but it was unclear whether or how the government would block deals.It reiterated a warning issued in December that restrictions on overseas investments were being imposed because of \u201cirrational\u201d investment trends.That statement said that the kinds of investments overseas it described were \u201cnot in accordance with macro-control policies.\u201d The government wants to \u201ceffectively guard against all sorts of risks,\u201d it said. The State Council document said the government nevertheless supported overseas investments in sectors such as oil and gas and in China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d program, which aims to promote infrastructure projects along the historic Silk Road trading route.\u201cIt\u2019s the loudest yet of wake-up calls that the government holds the keys to the lockbox of the country\u2019s wealth, public and private,\u201d Peter Fuhrman, chairman of China First Capital, an investment bank, said in an emailed response to questions. \u201cBad M&A is all but criminalized.\u201dA surge in overseas acquisitions by Chinese investors in recent years has ignited fears that soaring corporate debt levels could destabilize the country\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest, and further weaken its currency.Companies like Anbang Insurance Group, Fosun International, the HNA Group and Dalian Wanda Group have capitalized on cheap loans provided by state banks to snap up trophy assets such as the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and AMC Theaters.But while the latest statement from the State Council is likely to have an impact on mergers and deals, a lot of Chinese money is already offshore and thus not easily restricted by the government in Beijing, said Alexander Jarvis, chairman of Blackbridge Cross Borders, which has advised Chinese companies on several soccer acquisitions.\u201cDeals are still going to happen,\u201d Mr. Jarvis said. \u201cThere is plenty of Chinese capital overseas in offshore tax havens, in the U.S., across Europe, Hong Kong. I\u2019m not sure they can fully control that capital.\u201dGeoffrey Sant, a partner at New York-based law firm Dorsey and Whitney, said it is likely that the latest announcement from Beijing will result in a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d in overseas acquisitions.\u201cI think they are thinking there\u2019s a bit of irrational exuberance in the market right now and they just want to cool that off,\u201d said Mr. Sant, who represents Chinese companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to permanently ban some of these areas.\u201dIn recent months, the government has said it would increase scrutiny of companies\u2019 balance sheets, warning that some of the largest companies could pose a systemic risk to the economy.Encouraged by the slew of acquisitions made by some of the country\u2019s most powerful tycoons, many smaller Chinese companies started looking overseas, spurred by China\u2019s slowing economic growth to look for new markets.Many, however, had no experience running the businesses they were targeting. In one such example, Anhui Xinke New Materials, a copper processing company in central China, made a deal to buy Voltage Pictures, an American film financing and production firm, for $350 million. A month later, Anhui Xinke pulled out of the transaction.In other cases, it was not clear whether many of the big trophy acquisitions were actually good deals.\u201cI agree with the Chinese government. A lot of these deals are bad,\u201d said Mr. Jarvis.Companies have already started feeling the pinch of Beijing\u2019s clampdown on overseas investments, which started in earnest in December.Zhang Tiantian and Ryan McMorrow contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Qatar Restores Full Relations With Iran, Deepening Gulf Feud", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran on Thursday, the latest volley in an 11-week-old geopolitical feud that has set the tiny yet fabulously wealthy Persian Gulf nation against its neighbors and rattled a previously placid part of the Middle East.The Qataris gave no explanation for the sudden move. But the timing suggested a purposeful snub of Saudi Arabia, which along with three other countries began a punitive boycott of Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism and having a too-cozy relationship with Iran. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut their air and sea routes to Qatar, and closed its only land border, with Saudi Arabia.The crisis lapsed into a stalemate after Qatar refused an initial list of 13 demands, which included cutting all ties with Tehran. But things took a turn for the worse this week after a visit by a minor Qatari royal, Sheikh Abdullah al-Thani, to the Saudi ruler, King Salman, at his holiday villa in Morocco.Although there was no official explanation for the visit, the Saudi news media played up Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s visit as the beginning of a potential challenge to the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.Few analysts believe the emir faces a serious threat, but some Qataris took the move as a provocation, and as further evidence that the true intention of the Saudi- and Emirati-led boycott is to engineer leadership change in Doha.The diplomatic skirmishes are the latest moves in a crisis that, until now, has largely played out in the news media, amid accusations of hacked emails and fake news stories, and in fruitless efforts at conciliation led by worried Western allies like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.Qatar insists that it maintains cordial relations with Iran out of commercial necessity, in that the two countries share the world\u2019s largest gas field, the source of Qatar\u2019s vast wealth, and notes that the United Arab Emirates has a far greater trading relationship with Iran.Doha also says it has shown solidarity with its Sunni neighbors during disputes with Shiite-led Iran, particularly in the January 2016 attack on the Saudi mission in Iran, after which Qatar recalled its ambassador.Since the dispute flared in June, Iran has provided Qatar with sea shipments of fresh food and allowed a stream of Qatari airplanes to cross its airspace. On Thursday, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, welcomed the return of Qatar\u2019s ambassador to Tehran in a short statement. There was no immediate reaction from the four boycotting countries.Qatar has taken a defiant stance, introducing a raft of measures to ensure the country, whose population is 90 percent foreign, remains attractive to outside investors and workers.On Thursday, it enacted regulations that give greater protections to foreign domestic workers, many of whom work as nannies, cooks and cleaners. Their limited rights and often poor treatment in gulf countries like Qatar has frequently been a focus of Western human rights groups.But the strain of the crisis is starting to show on Qatar\u2019s economy and financial system. Depositors from boycotting countries withdrew billions of dollars from Qatari banks in June, forcing the treasury to step in. Qatar\u2019s rating with international credit agencies has also taken a hit.Qatar\u2019s imports fell 38 percent in June and recovered only slightly last month, according to official figures released on Thursday.Still, the sanctions have not affected Qatar\u2019s gas exports, the primary source of its wealth, which grew by 7.8 percent in July compared with a year earlier. Analysts say the effect of the sanctions may lessen as Qatar develops alternate sea and air routes.Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter @declanwalshAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Portugal Forest Fires Worsen, Fed by Poor Choices and Inaction", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2003, Mr. Muralha, 77, narrowly survived a huge forest fire that engulfed his house. In 2015, a fire destroyed his field. And this July, he watched anxiously as fire burned the trees above his property.\u201cThe fires are getting worse and worse, which means this place is going to become a desert,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m too old to move elsewhere, but more people, of course, decide to leave after every fire.\u201dWhat he describes is an increasingly urgent problem for his country. Hotter, drier summers are setting off more forest fires, which are accelerating a decades-old migration from rural areas, leaving lands untended. That, in turn, helps fuel new and more intense fires that spread and burn even faster.The deadly spiral, forestry experts and environmentalists say, has been worsened by political inaction, a history of poor land management and the prioritizing of firefighting over fire prevention, even in the face of more frequent tragedies.But Portugal has become a particularly stark case of what the future may hold if changes to land, climate and economies go mismanaged.The deaths in June provoked a fresh round of soul-searching and spurred an investigation, still continuing, into how and why the wildfire engulfed Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande, about 10 miles from where Mr. Muralha lives, close to Oleiros.Oleiros and its environs are a prime example of the changes to the landscape that have rendered Portugal ever more vulnerable to fire.The area is a hub for the country\u2019s wood industry. The hamlet where Mr. Muralha lives has just 12 residents, down from about 180 in the 1960s, he said.He and his neighbors say they are too old to cut down the brush that fuels forest fires and cannot afford to pay someone to clear it. \u201cNobody really cares about the forest, except when it\u2019s really on fire,\u201d said Mr. Muralha, who lives mostly on a monthly disability pension of 200 euros, about $235.This central region has been transformed since the 15th century, when native oaks were used to build caravels, the oceangoing ships that helped turn Portugal into a colonial empire, stretching from Brazil to Angola to Macao.Last century, the dictatorship under Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar reshaped the country\u2019s economy. Starting in the 1930s, despite protests from farmers, it planted trees in the north and central parts of the country, where the forest fires are now concentrated, to develop a wood industry.\u201cOur forest area grew very quickly, but as an industrial forest that was meant to produce timber and paper for exports rather than be well integrated into rural communities,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Pereira, a professor at the school of agriculture at the University of Lisbon.Many wood mills have since closed, but the industry continues to dominate life in places like Oleiros.Even so, Portugal\u2019s wood industry no longer relies on native species like oak and pine. Instead, it is increasingly built on eucalyptus, which feeds a pulp and paper sector that makes up 10 percent of Portuguese exports. The area of eucalyptus planting has more than doubled since the 1980s.Eucalyptus can be harvested in half the time needed for pine. And unlike other species, \u201cyou have absolutely no need for people on the ground\u201d to supervise its growth, said Jo\u00e3o Camargo, an environmental engineer.The tree, however, contains a highly flammable oil that helps fires erupt more easily, spread and intensify.Yet after every fire, more landowners switch to eucalyptus, hoping that a shorter production cycle can allow them to recoup their losses faster and to harvest their trees before the next fire erupts.It is an accelerating sequence that has turned Portugal \u201cfrom a pretty diverse forest into a big eucalyptus monoculture,\u201d Mr. Camargo said.The paper industry disagrees and argues that the expansion of eucalyptus is not the issue \u2014 its mismanagement is.\u201cThe fire problem is not rooted in the eucalyptus myth,\u201d said Tiago Oliveira, who is in charge of innovation and forest development at Navigator, Portugal\u2019s largest paper company.The pulp and paper industry manages only 20 percent of the eucalyptus in Portugal, under strict international certification standards, he noted.The problem comes from the remaining 80 percent, \u201cmostly owned by small private landowners typically not committed to fuel-management practices,\u201d Mr. Oliveira said.The authorities have shown little interest in supervising Portugal\u2019s forests, in part because only 3 percent of them are in state hands, by far the lowest level of public forest ownership in the European Union, Mr. Camargo said.Instead, Portugal\u2019s forests keep getting fragmented into smaller parcels, often inherited by people who no longer live anywhere near the land.About a fifth of Portugal\u2019s territory is now without any identified ownership. In the age of satellite imagery, Mr. Oliveira said, it was \u201cinexcusable\u201d that the country could not accurately map who owns the land.Ricardo Alexandre Vaz Alves, an officer in Portugal\u2019s environmental police department, said landowners often preferred to risk a fine rather than clear their forest, especially knowing that the police struggle to identify owners.The Socialist government has tried to use the Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o fire to revive changes to forestry laws. But a proposal to allow the state to take over forest land whose owners cannot be identified has run into significant resistance.Such legislative paralysis has long defined Portugal\u2019s response, or lack of it, to a fire crisis that increasingly costs the country both lives and money.\u201cObjectively, there is a big waste of public money in the fight against fires and almost nothing spent on prevention,\u201d said Maria Jos\u00e9 Morgado, a Portuguese public prosecutor.The disconnect is blamed for the repetition of calamity.After the tragedy, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, Portugal\u2019s prime minister at the time, and other politicians visited Oleiros.\u201cEvery politician made loads of promises to make everything better, start from scratch and remodel the forest, but then almost nothing at all happened,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Santos Marques, the mayor of Oleiros for 28 years.The most recent fire could have been worse, he said, were it not for an abrupt drop in wind and temperature.\u201cWe luckily escaped another major tragedy in July, but the situation of our forest is a lot worse and unmanaged than in 2003,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of improving anything, it seems we\u2019re only really waiting for the next fire.\u201dSuccessive governments in Lisbon, he said, have simply passed responsibility for managing the forest to local authorities whose budgets are already overstretched.Others, too, blamed politicians who \u201cdestroyed the public system of forest management to focus instead on fighting fires,\u201d said Felismino Serra, a forest engineer and former professional firefighter.\u201cWe now have fires that burn in two days what they burned in two weeks before, because neglect and abandonment mean there is a lot more fuel in the forest,\u201d he said.The reason? \u201cIf you invest in the forest, you get results in 20 years, but politicians need quick and visible results \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing more visible than firefighting,\u201d he argued.After Portugal emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s, joining the volunteer fire brigades became a badge of honor in Portugal\u2019s democratic society.\u201cEverybody in Portugal has a cousin who is a firefighter hero,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Gama, a lawyer and former secretary of state for local government. \u201cNo politician wants to even start the discussion about a system of volunteers that is really part of our society\u2019s culture.\u201dToday more than 25,000 volunteers operate alongside about 5,000 professional firefighters in Portugal.The system of volunteers has been affected by the migration from rural to urban areas, meaning young volunteers often need to travel long distances to reach a forest fire, which occurred with the tragedy at Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o in June.\u201cIn the U.S., it\u2019s forbidden for a firefighter to enter an unknown environment, but this now often happens here,\u201d said Emanuel Oliveira, a fire risk consultant and former firefighter.Jaime Marta Soares, the president of Portugal\u2019s league of firefighters, defended the know-how of the volunteers, and said that if anything were to blame for inadequate responses, it was failures of public administration.In particular, he pointed to the switch to an emergency communications system, known as Siresp, in 2006.Siresp \u201cwas never prepared to handle a large number of users at the same time,\u201d Mr. Marta Soares said. \u201cThat\u2019s incompetence and irresponsibility.\u201dC\u00e1tia Bruno contributed reporting from Lisbon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brutal Gang Assault, Two Skull Surgeries, and a \u2018Miraculous\u2019 Recovery", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "More than three months after a violent attack in the Bronx, Souleymane Porgo, a former street vendor, has made an improbable comeback.Supported byMore than three months later, Souleymane Porgo still cannot remember the moment when six men knocked him to the sidewalk on a busy Bronx street.He was selling books, socks and handbags from his regular spot on East 149th Street on May 2. Hours earlier, one of the men had tried to steal a handbag. It was not the first time Mr. Porgo had to fend off a would-be thief, nor was it the first time he had been threatened.\u201cSometimes they would try to do stuff and say they\u2019re coming back for you, but they don\u2019t come,\u201d said Mr. Porgo, 48. \u201cI didn\u2019t take him seriously.\u201dBut the man did return \u2014 with the other five men. That\u2019s when the assault began, according to the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office.One of them dropped Mr. Porgo to the ground with a blow to the head, as two of his children, 2 and 4, and their mother looked on. Then, as Mr. Porgo lay motionless on the ground, two others punched him in the head. When witnesses went to help Mr. Porgo, the assailants fled.The last moments of the attack were captured on video. Watching the footage and seeing Mr. Porgo\u2019s body on the sidewalk, it is hard not to think that he was dead.His jaw was dislocated, his face battered \u2014 and, most critical, his skull had been fractured and his brain was swelling. At Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx, doctors and nurses raced to save Mr. Porgo. A piece of his skull was removed so the brain could have more room to swell and for doctors to treat the blood clots.Dr. Erico Ramos Cardoso, one of the emergency room doctors who oversaw Mr. Porgo\u2019s treatment, said the prognosis was bleak.\u201cBecause of the amount of swelling in the brain that already existed we anticipated things would get worse \u2014 and anticipated death,\u201d Dr. Cardoso said.Street vending isn\u2019t an easy way to make a living. The hours can be long and the hassles many. But after emigrating from Burkina Faso 19 years ago, he needed work, and his first job, at a carwash, didn\u2019t pay enough.So he became a street vendor and carved out a spot for himself in the Hub, around 149th and Third Avenue. With a subway station, bus stops and rows of stores, the Hub bustles with customers. Mr. Porgo would take home $500 in a typical week.So when the police were called to a report of an assault on 149th Street around 5 p.m. on May 2, they had little assurance anyone would cooperate.Officers arrived to find Mr. Porgo splayed on the ground and his partner and the couple\u2019s two children stricken by what had just unfolded.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s like I was frozen,\u201d Mr. Porgo\u2019s partner said in an interview. \u201cMy 4-year-old was crying, \u2018They killed my daddy.\u2019\u201dFearful that as a witness, she could face unwelcome attention, she agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her name not be used.Mr. Porgo\u2019s family, though, were not the only ones jarred by the brutal, gratuitous nature of the attack. It stirred outrage in the neighborhood and then online as the video was shared widely on social media. Tips poured in about the identity of the assailants, some of whose faces were captured clearly on the video.Even in a neighborhood where aiding the police is seen as risky, people were unwilling to stay quiet.\u201cA simple punch here and a punch there, they may have said, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s not worth anything on my part,\u201d said Rick Simplicio, the lead detective on the case. \u201cBut a lot of people from that neighborhood may have even purchased an item or two from him. And then to see savagery of the assault, they were fed up with it.\u2019\u201dThe man prosecutors say initiated the attack, William Burgess, 21, surrendered to the police six days later, and five other men were arrested in the days that followed. The six have been charged with gang assault, and they have all pleaded not guilty. The men are being held in jail and are expected to appear in court in September. If convicted, the men could face up to 25 years in prison, according to the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office.While a breakthrough in the investigation came remarkably quickly, the pace of Mr. Porgo\u2019s recovery has been slower and shakier.From the scene of the attack, he was taken just a few blocks away to Lincoln, a city-run hospital that has one of the busiest trauma centers in the region. He would spend three weeks there before being transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where he would spend nearly a month, undergoing intensive rehabilitative care.Hours before his release from Mount Sinai in late June, Mr. Porgo lay curled up on a bed in Room C. 39, resting his broken jaw and injured head in the palm of his left hand. The right side of his head was visibly shrunken; the piece of his skull that had been removed after the attack would be reattached later on a return visit to Lincoln. But in the meantime, the piece of his skull had been placed inside his abdominal wall for safe keeping, a not-uncommon procedure with such an injury.He gazed at his brother, a cousin, two family friends and a daughter, Aminata, 21, who came from Burkina Faso over Father\u2019s Day weekend.Mr. Porgo\u2019s partner, though, stood outside the room. She would often stare off into the distance and sometimes gazed at Mr. Porgo, lying in his bed, a black helmet hanging on a pole next to him.Though he had survived, the gravity of his injuries and the uncertainty of his future appeared to weigh on her.For workers like Mr. Porgo, who don\u2019t have sick days or disability insurance, being a victim of violence takes not only a significant physical and emotional toll but a financial one, too.It was unclear when \u2014 or whether \u2014 he would be able to return to work. Summer is a slow time, so he wasn\u2019t losing as much income, but the busy fall season was around the corner.His medical care was being covered by Medicaid, his family said. His younger brother, who lives with him and also witnessed the beating, volunteered to cover the entire rent.\u201cHe has done a lot for me,\u201d Mr. Porgo said of his brother, Missa Bosco, who is a taxi driver.Street vending has been a common entry point into the city\u2019s economy, and the attack resonated with vendors. Sean Basinski, the director of the Street Vendor Project at the Urban Justice Center, raised more than $30,000 though crowdfunding to assist Mr. Porgo\u2019s family.In the first weeks after the attack, Mr. Porgo said he expected to return to being a street vendor. More recently, he said he does not think he will go back to his old line of work. But he hasn\u2019t figured out what he will do.For now, he is focused on healing.The head injuries Mr. Porgo sustained could lead to neurological impairment and affect his ability to perform physically demanding skills, Dr. Cardoso said. But so far, the doctor said, the recovery has been \u201cmiraculous.\u201dLast month, Mr. Porgo was back at Lincoln to have the piece of his skull put back in place, and last week he was at the hospital again, this time to have the doctor see how the incision in his head was healing.As Dr. Cardoso swabbed iodine over about 50 shiny staples on the right side of the head, Mr. Porgo looked more at ease.\u201cYou look like a new man,\u201d Dr. Cardoso said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one drop of blood. That\u2019s a good sign.\u201dMr. Porgo smiled.Then he had about 40 staples removed from his abdomen, where doctors had stored the piece of his skull. Mr. Porgo craned his head to see the wound on his belly, which prompted a touch of humor from his partner.\u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d she joked to Mr. Porgo, who has only daughters. He burst into laughter.Advertisement"}

The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tourist organizations project 2.2 million Chinese visitors a year by 2020.A photo of the offending scrawl drew outrage on social media, and the 15-year-old vandal was tracked down. He and his parents later issued a public apology.For the two men who thought nothing of saluting in the style of Hitler outside the Reichstag, a judge ordered each to post 500 euros, or about $589, in bail.A police spokeswoman declined on Sunday to reveal further details, and said she did not know whether the tourists were still in Berlin, or even in Germany.Advertisement"}

Mayor Joe McComb of Corpus Christi encouraged residents to leave voluntarily.Houston, with a population of about 2.3 million people, has a history of floodwaters that led to fatalities. In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison pummeled southeast Texas and was blamed for 22 deaths in the Houston area.Mr. Abbott described the storm as a \u201cvery complex and dangerous hurricane\u201d that will hammer Texans not only with high winds but \u201crecord-setting flooding in multiple regions of the state.\u201d The storm is also expected to spawn multiple tornadoes.After a reporter pointed out that he seemed to be disagreeing with local calls on whether to evacuate, Mr. Abbott said, \u201cI think it is important for the local officials who have the authority and responsibility for this to be the ones to make the call.\u201dBut he added, \u201cI can be suggestive of what I would do and that is, if I were living in the Houston region, as I once did, I would decide to head to areas north of there.\u201dAdvertisementWe explain how hurricanes form \u2014 and grow \u2014 when cold and warm air merge.In a video, we explain how hurricanes form \u2014 and grow \u2014 when cold and warm air merge.Seven coastal counties from Corpus Christi to the western end of Galveston ordered mandatory evacuations of at least some areas.

While oil prices have not soared even as many offshore production platforms have been shut, gasoline futures in New York have risen to their highest levels of the summer driving season. So far, though, prices at the pump around the Gulf region remain at historically low levels for this time of year, and more than a dime below the national average of $2.35.Drivers in the Houston area waited in lines at the pump Thursday night, preparing for several days of shortages.Officials in San Antonio have been working for days to prepare for evacuees from the coastal region, as well as local residents who may be forced to leave their homes if flooding occurs.Two shelters have been set up and more will be added as needed, said Marty McKellips, chief executive of the Central and South Texas Region of the American Red Cross. Governor Abbott said at his news conference that more than 50 shelters had been set up around the state.Advertisement\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve received almost 700 total evacuees, with 10 additional full buses waiting to check in as we speak,\u201d Mayor Ron Nirenberg said. \u201cWe expect that number to climb as coastal cities continue to experience significant rainfall and high winds.\u201dHundreds of relief workers have come from around the state to help man the shelters, and medical facilities in San Antonio have already received many patients from coastal areas, the Bexar county judge, Nelson Wolff, said.The lesson is that it is not just wind that makes a storm dangerous. Storm surge, the water that a hurricane pushes ahead of it, can be tremendously destructive. Much more harm was done to New Orleans during Katrina because of the surge \u2014 which overwhelmed the area\u2019s faulty levees \u2014 than the wind. Go to Home Page \u00bb"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Mr. Mercedes,\u2019 a Stephen King Story With a Difference", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThrough four episodes, \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is probably the most enjoyable, even though \u2014 or perhaps because \u2014 it\u2019s the least King-like of the productions.A bigger factor, though, is the TV show\u2019s creator, David E. Kelley, who developed the series and wrote the first two episodes. He\u2019s in good form, and \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d has the Kelley hallmarks \u2014 snappy dialogue, credible characters, a story that adds up, an overall feeling of polished craftsmanship. It may lack King\u2019s intensity, but it holds on to a measure of the author\u2019s dark humor.(Mr. Kelley has some high-class help: the novelists A.M. Homes and Dennis Lehane wrote the third and fourth episodes, respectively.)Being a King story, \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is a mystery predicated on an act of extreme carnage. In a fading Ohio industrial city in the post-crash year of 2009, a driver in a clown mask plows a Mercedes through a crowd of people waiting outside a job fair. The story then jumps ahead two years and burrows into the life of Bill Hodges (Brendan Gleeson), a recently retired detective unable to let go of the still unsolved massacre.In its early episodes, at least, \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is a show soaked in decline. The sagging economy makes an easy target of the desperate job seekers, camped out on a walkway. The killer, whose identity is revealed early on, works for a big-box electronics store that\u2019s being driven out of business. Saddest of all is Hodges, shuffling around his empty house, and Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Kelley combine to give an unusually honest portrayal of middle-age depression and decrepitude.The story slowly kicks into gear when the killer, calling himself Mr. Mercedes \u2014 he\u2019s actually a 20-something victim of a terrible childhood named Brady, played by Harry Treadaway (Dr. Frankenstein on \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d) \u2014 begins sending the detective taunting emails about his failure to solve the case. These have the dual effect of stoking Bill\u2019s post-traumatic stress over the case while reinvigorating him, and soon he\u2019s independently investigating, like a Philip Marlowe brought back from the dead.\u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is full of people who are off, on a spectrum from mildly antisocial to psychopathic, and Mr. Kelley works hard to humanize them, making even the sadistic Brady sympathetic. He mostly reins in his propensity for quirkiness for its own sake, though a character added for the series, a sexually aggressive neighbor of Bill\u2019s played by Holland Taylor, is a little too good to be true.(Ms. Taylor is fun to watch, though, and the cast includes a number of distinctive actresses, including Kelly Lynch as Brady\u2019s mother, Breeda Wool as his co-worker and Mary-Louise Parker as the woman who hires Bill to pursue the case.)The problem with \u201cMr. Mercedes,\u201d at least early on, is a version of Netflix bloat: it dawdles, and through the first four episodes it feels like the story is still getting started. One of the most important characters from the novel, a woman who joins in Bill\u2019s investigation, has yet to appear. So far Mr. Kelley has put together a decent character study, but whether he\u2019ll pull off a hard-boiled thriller remains a mystery.Advertisement"}

(At the end of every video session, the Oakleys pin up the green fabric that serves as the backdrop so Fluffy doesn\u2019t ruin it.)Prestigious universities have spent millions and employ hundreds of professionally trained videographers, editors and producers to create their massive open online courses, known as MOOCs. The Oakleys put together their studio with equipment that cost $5,000. They figured out what to buy by Googling \u201chow to set up a green screen studio\u201d and \u201chow to set up studio lighting.\u201d Mr. Oakley runs the camera and teleprompter. She does most of the editing. The course is free ($49 for a certificate of completion \u2014 Coursera won\u2019t divulge how many finish).\u201cIt\u2019s actually not rocket science,\u201d said Dr. Oakley \u2014 but she\u2019s careful where she says that these days. When she spoke at Harvard in 2015, she said, \u201cthe hackles went up\u201d; she crossed her arms sternly by way of grim illustration.This is home-brew, not Harvard. And it has worked. Spectacularly. The Oakleys never could have predicted their success. Many of the early sessions had to be trashed. \u201cI looked like a deer in the headlights,\u201d Dr. Oakley said. She would flub her lines and moan, \u201cI just can\u2019t do this.\u201d Her husband would say, \u201cCome on. We\u2019re going to have lunch, and we\u2019re going to come right back to this.\u201d But he confessed to having had doubts, too. \u201cWe were in the basement, worrying, \u2018Is anybody even going to look at this?\u2019\u201dShe illustrates her concepts with goofy animations: There are surfing zombies, metabolic vampires and an \u201coctopus of attention.\u201d Hammy editing tricks may have Dr. Oakley moving out of the frame to the right and popping up on the left, or cringing away from an animated, disembodied head that she has put on the screen to discuss a property of the brain.Sitting in the Oakleys\u2019 comfortable living room, with its solid Mission furniture and mementos of their world travels, Dr. Oakley said she believes that just about anyone can train himself to learn. \u201cStudents may look at math, for example, and say, \u2018I can\u2019t figure this out \u2014 it must mean I\u2019m really stupid!\u2019 They don\u2019t know how their brain works.\u201dHer own feelings of inadequacy give her empathy for students who feel hopeless. \u201cI know the hiccups and the troubles people have when they\u2019re trying to learn something.\u201d After all, she was her own lab rat. \u201cI rewired my brain,\u201d she said, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201dAs a youngster, she was not a diligent student. \u201cI flunked my way through elementary, middle school and high school math and science,\u201d she said. She joined the Army out of high school to help pay for college and received extensive training in Russian at the Defense Language Institute. Once out, she realized she would have a better career path with a technical degree (specifically, electrical engineering), and set out to tackle math and science, training herself to grind through technical subjects with many of the techniques of practice and repetition that she had used to let Russian vocabulary and declension soak in.Along the way, she met Philip Oakley \u2014 in, of all places, Antarctica. It was 1983, and she was working as a radio operator at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. (She has also worked as a translator on a Russian trawler. She\u2019s been around.) Mr. Oakley managed the garage at the station, keeping machinery working under some of the planet\u2019s most punishing conditions.She had noticed him largely because, unlike so many men at the lonely pole, he hadn\u2019t made any moves on her. \u201cYou can be ugly as a toad out there and you are the most popular girl,\u201d she said. She found him \u201ccomfortably confident.\u201d After he left a party without even saying hello, she told a friend she\u2019d like to get to know him better. The next day, he was waiting for her at breakfast with a big smile on his face. Three weeks later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, he walked her over to the true South Pole and proposed at the stroke of midnight. A few weeks after that, they were \u201coff the ice\u201d in New Zealand and got married.Dr. Oakley is already planning her next book, another guide to learning how to learn but aimed at 10- to 13-year-olds. She wants to tell them, \u201cEven if you are not a superstar learner, here\u2019s how to see the great aspects of what you do have.\u201d She would like to see learning clubs in school to help young people develop the skills they need. \u201cWe have chess clubs, we have art clubs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have learning clubs. I just think that teaching kids how to learn is one of the greatest things we can possibly do.\u201dAs a bonus, the ritual of setting the timer can also help overcome procrastination. Dr. Oakley teaches that even thinking about doing things we dislike activates the pain centers of the brain. The Pomodoro Technique, she said, \u201chelps the mind slip into focus and begin work without thinking about the work.\u201d\u201cVirtually anyone can focus for 25 minutes, and the more you practice, the easier it gets.\u201dPractice brings procedural fluency, says Dr. Oakley, who compares the process to backing up a car. \u201cWhen you first are learning to back up, your working memory is overwhelmed with input.\u201d In time, \u201cyou don\u2019t even need to think more than \u2018Hey, back up,\u2019\u2009\u201d and the mind is free to think about other things.Chunks build on chunks, and, she says, the neural network built upon that knowledge grows bigger. \u201cYou remember longer bits of music, for example, or more complex phrases in French.\u201d Mastering low-level math concepts allows tackling more complex mental acrobatics. \u201cYou can easily bring them to mind even while your active focus is grappling with newer, more difficult information.\u201dJohn Schwartz is a staff writer at The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson Hails U.N. Sanctions, as Chinese Minister Rebukes North Korea at Asean Meeting", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a midday conclave on Sunday with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha of South Korea, Mr. Tillerson hailed in his typically understated fashion the United Nations vote, which could cost North Korea nearly $1 billion a year, or about one-third of its foreign earnings.\u201cIt was a good outcome,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said with a smile.Ms. Kang, sitting across the table from him, could not resist chiming in: \u201cIt was a very, very good outcome.\u201dMr. Wang said the two had \u201can intensive conversation,\u201d and in unusually strong terms, he later urged North Korea to show restraint.\u201cDo not violate the U.N.\u2019s decision or provoke the international society\u2019s good will by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests,\u201d Mr. Wang said.He also said, \u201cOf course, we would like to urge other parties like the United States and South Korea to stop increasing tensions.\u201dThe case, brought against China by the Philippines, seemed like a turning point in China\u2019s disputes with a host of regional players, including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.A few months before that ruling, 12 nations in the Pacific region concluded more than seven years of negotiations by signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a trade agreement that bound much of Southeast Asia together with the United States and Japan in an economic partnership intended to fight China\u2019s growing economic hegemony in the region.While China had its own regional trade accord, the United States-led pact had become the preferred agreement, with several nations that had missed out on the initial round of negotiations expressing interest in joining in a second round.How things have changed.President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, elected last year, has backed down from his country\u2019s insistence that China abandon the shoals at the heart of the tribunal\u2019s decision, preferring instead to accept significant Chinese economic assistance.In a news conference on Friday, the Philippine foreign affairs secretary, Alan Peter Cayetano, said the fight with China was not worth the cost.\u201cIf we go harsh with everyone, our people will suffer \u2014 trade, direct foreign investments, tourism,\u201d Mr. Cayetano said.With the Philippines serving as host to Asean, the country\u2019s about-face lifted a significant cloud over China, with only Vietnam reportedly continuing to insist that the group condemn Beijing\u2019s actions.Instead, Asean and China adopted a fairly weak negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea \u2014 several steps removed from anything that could force China to abandon its territorial claims or give up the seven islands it has built in the disputed waters, three of which are equipped with runways and military hardware.Few believe the framework will lead China to conclude a binding agreement anytime soon.Geographically astride the world\u2019s busiest and most strategic shipping lanes, the region was the fulcrum of the administration\u2019s rebalancing toward Asia.Mr. Trump has yet to demonstrate a similar interest or commitment to the region.In his opening remarks to the conference, Mr. Tillerson sought to put to rest fears that the United States would abandon the region, saying that his multiple meetings with ambassadors were \u201cindicative of the importance that the United States pays and places on this relationship with Asean.\u201dAnd while Mr. Tillerson chose not to meet with journalists on Sunday, his top diplomat for the region, Susan A. Thornton, the acting assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that multiple visits by top administration officials had demonstrated its continued importance to the United States.\u201cThe engagement is not a question,\u201d she said.Still, Ms. Thornton gave credit to the Chinese for supporting Saturday\u2019s vote in the United Nations against North Korea.\u201cThe fact that the Chinese were helpful and instrumental really in setting up this set of sanctions, this really sweeping set of international sanctions, shows that they realize it\u2019s a huge problem that they need to take on and is a threat to them,\u201d she said.But Ms. Thornton cautioned that Beijing has often failed to follow through on its promised tough measures against Pyongyang. China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s external trade, and it has long avoided tough economic sanctions against the North for fear that a collapse of the government would lead to a flood of refugees, as well as the North\u2019s reunification with the South, putting a close American ally directly on China\u2019s border.\u201cI think we still are going to be watchful as to their implementation of the sanctions,\u201d Ms. Thornton said. \u201cBut this is definitely an important step.\u201dAlso on Sunday, Mr. Tillerson met with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia. Mr. Lavrov has often spoken expansively and sometimes humorously in the moments before or after meeting top American diplomats. But though he and Mr. Tillerson both smiled and appeared relaxed as they made small talk in the moments before their official meeting, neither said anything to a contingent of journalists briefly ushered into their presence.In comments that were broadcast on Sunday on Russian television, Mr. Lavrov said that Mr. Tillerson had asked about the details of the reductions in American diplomatic staff members in Russia and that Mr. Lavrov had explained how it would work, according to a translation provided by The Associated Press.Mr. Lavrov also said Mr. Tillerson had promised to send the United States special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, to Moscow for discussions.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the foreign minister of South Korea. The minister, Kang Kyung-wha, is a woman.An earlier version of this article misidentified the foreign minister of North Korea. He is Ri Yong-ho, not Ri Su-yong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Waiters Drink. And Why It Matters.", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMy former co-worker once drank so much during a waitressing shift, she stumbled through the restaurant with her intoxication on full display to guests. Even the chaos of the service rush couldn\u2019t hide the state she was in. By closing she was fired.After work that night, a group of us consoled her at the casino sports book, where we often congregated for an after-hours ritual. Over drinks, cigarettes and video poker, we traded our best war stories. Together, our minds and bodies recovered from the physical exhaustion and emotional stress of service.We told our friend that everything would be fine. After all, she wasn\u2019t the first employee to be under the influence on the job. One manager regularly arrived to work with alcohol on his breath. Some bartenders taste-tested enough cocktails to maintain a steady buzz throughout their shifts. We knew which servers, cooks and managers relied on cocaine to get through the long hours that restaurant life demanded.Naturally, food and beverage work is accompanied with an easy access to alcohol. But with the addition of late-night hours, long shifts without meal breaks and dark rooms full of people drinking, it is no surprise the environment often nurtures addiction.But without union representation, these jobs are usually accompanied by poor pay, inconsistent schedules and no medical insurance. High turnover means that when substance abuse behaviors do interfere with job performance, workers can be easily, and immediately, replaced.Plus, the problem goes all the way to the top. The same report on substance abuse found that across all industries, one in 10 managers is abusing controlled substances. Middle management is arguably the most overworked in food service; in high-end bars and restaurants, managers often make less than their service staff, while working longer hours with no overtime pay.Because food service jobs are increasingly a foundational part of our economy, it is even more crucial to think about what happens to the people who work them.There remains a false assumption that restaurants are staffed by college students and 20-somethings, making it easy to pass off substance abuse as a result of unmotivated employees or the immaturity of a younger work force.I\u2019ve personally managed to avoid drinking and drug use. On more than one occasion, however, I found myself walking back to my car after a shift, disappointed in the amount of cash tips I fed, like Monopoly money, into a video poker machine.In Las Vegas, many bar and casino workers become addicted not only to substances, but also to the gambling services their employers provide. Many employers do not restrict their workers from gambling in their establishments.Addiction is a disease, and in some ways, it is contagious. As much as we might want to imagine we are, none of us are completely immune.My dearest friends are those I toiled alongside in horrible restaurant jobs. We share with manual labor industries like construction and mining the physical toll of our work, but also the continued sense that our work is less-than. In my first restaurant job at 18, I observed my older co-workers drinking together after shifts as I folded napkins and polished silverware. The social nature of food service can mean it becomes easy to define substance abuse behaviors as \u201ctypical\u201d rather than problematic.Incorporating substance abuse prevention information into training materials, and providing insurance with access to mental health care, could help.Industry executives must realize that although far removed from them directly, the staff\u2019s substance abuse has compounding effects on the bottom line through workplace injuries, absenteeism and low employee morale.My co-worker who was let go after that drunken night eventually found another job. Today she works in sales.But not everyone in food service can or will pick another career. If leaving the industry entirely is the primary path toward recovery, then we are not actually solving our problems. We are running away from them.Brittany Bronson is an English instructor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer Immigrants Mean More Jobs? Not So, Economists Say", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the federal government banned the use of farmworkers from Mexico in 1964, California\u2019s tomato growers did not enlist Americans to harvest the fragile crop. They replaced the lost workers with tomato-picking machines.But economists say the tomato story and a host of related evidence show that there is no clear connection between less immigration and more jobs for Americans. Rather, the prevailing view among economists is that immigration increases economic growth, improving the lives of the immigrants and the lives of the people who are already here.\u201cThe average American worker is more likely to lose than to gain from immigration restrictions,\u201d said Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California, Davis.The Trump administration is proposing sharp reductions in the number of skilled and unskilled workers who are allowed to become permanent residents, halving annual immigration from the current level of roughly one million people a year.\u201cThis legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first,\u201d President Trump said.The proposal revives elements of President George W. Bush\u2019s effort to rewrite federal immigration law in 2007, and it appears no more likely to succeed. It already has drawn sharp opposition from Democrats and from some Senate Republicans.Economists say that skilled immigrant workers are clearly good for the American economy. The United States could import computers; if it instead imports computer engineers, the money they earn is taxed and spent in the United States. Moreover, some of those engineers invent new products \u2014 or even entirely new technologies.The administration says it still wants high-skilled workers, and it has described the cuts as targeted at low-skilled immigrants. It would still issue roughly 140,000 merit-based green cards each year, while sharply reducing the number of people admitted as family members of current residents.But about one-third of those family members who received green cards since 2000 had college degrees, Mr. Peri said. \u201cPeople have an outdated image\u201d of legal immigration, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly Asian, Indian, Chinese people who are coming to do mid- and high-level professional jobs.\u201dGeorge J. Borjas, the Harvard immigration economist whose work is the only evidence that the administration has cited as justifying its proposals, said in an interview on Wednesday that there was no economic justification for reducing skilled immigration.\u201cThat is a political decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not an economic decision.\u201dEconomists agree that other factors, notably technological improvements, are primarily responsible for the broader deterioration in the fortunes of the American working class.Mr. Borjas also argues that low-skilled immigration does not produce clear benefits for the economy as a whole. He said that the benefit of low-cost labor was offset, or even slightly outweighed, by the cost of providing government services to immigrants.The primary beneficiary of immigration is the immigrant, Mr. Borjas said.\u201cIf all you care about is economics, then it\u2019s really clear,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do you want to live in a country that only cares about money, or do you want to live in a country that has a legacy of being generous to immigrants? Maybe you want a compromise.\u201dOther economists, however, have sharply disputed Mr. Borjas\u2019s research. Most studies put the negative impact on low-skilled wages closer to zero, Mr. Peri said.One key reason is that immigrants often work in jobs that exist only because of the availability of cheap labor. Picking tomatoes is a good example. California farmers in the 1950s and early \u201960s relied on Mexican workers even though machines were already available. In 1964, 97 percent of California tomatoes were picked by hand.\u201cThe story that \u2018when labor supplies go down, wages go up\u2019 is a cartoon,\u201d said Michael A. Clemens, an economist at the Center for Global Development who has studied the end of the Mexican guest-worker program, which was known as the Bracero program.Low-skilled immigration can also provide a boost to the rest of the economy.The National Academy of Sciences made an ambitious effort to assess the bottom line in 2016. It concluded that the average immigrant cost state and local governments about $1,600 a year from 2011 to 2013 \u2014 but the children and grandchildren of immigrants paid far more in taxes than they consumed in public services.A recent analysis by economists at JPMorgan Chase concluded that halting immigration completely would reduce annual economic growth by 0.3 percent.The Trump administration\u2019s immigration proposal would also change the rules for merit-based immigration. It wants to create a point system that would give higher priority to applicants based on factors including age, job skills and the ability to speak English.Canada and Australia use similar points-based systems to pick immigrants.Some economists argue that it would be better to just let the market make decisions, for example, by using a system like the H-1B visa program that allows companies to request permission for workers to come to the United States on a temporary basis.\u201cIt\u2019s a political myth that the principal need is for high-skilled workers,\u201d he said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Cautious on China Inquiry Over Intellectual Property Theft", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 President Trump is planning to jab, not punch, China for allegedly stealing intellectual property from American businesses, part of an effort to fulfill his hard-edge campaign promises on trade without alienating Beijing during the crisis over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.Mr. Trump will return to Washington from his working vacation at his Bedminster, N.J., golf resort on Monday to sign an executive memo asking the United States Trade Representative to determine whether to investigate state-backed theft by China of intellectual property from American technology and defense companies.The request for an investigation will focus on Beijing\u2019s practices of coercing American companies doing business in China to partner with local firms, which require them to turn over proprietary technological secrets as part of what American officials described as a coordinated effort to steal intellectual property.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers, speaking to reporters on a conference call early Saturday, did not say why the administration decided to add the intermediate step of requesting an investigation, rather than starting one immediately. This month, people familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s deliberations suggested that the administration was prepared to immediately begin an inquiry into Chinese theft under the 1974 Trade Act.Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that they have engaged in such theft. The pause might give both sides a chance to negotiate some kind of a deal before the investigation begins, one American official involved in the policy said. If Mr. Trump moves ahead with an investigation, China could litigate it with the World Trade Organization.It is not clear how much time the additional step will add to the process. If approved, the investigation is expected to take as long as a year, officials said.The delay was welcomed by those who have been worried about the president\u2019s protectionist tendencies. The Trump administration was expected to move directly into the investigation, so the memorandum reflects the more measured approach the administration also appears to be taking with steel and aluminum.\u201cIf this is the expression of Trumpian economic nationalism, most trade advocates are going to breath a sigh of relief,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an international trade attorney at the law firm White & Case.\u201cThis is a critical action, and long overdue,\u201d said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan group created by Congress in 2000 to monitor trade and security issues between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\u201cChina\u2019s been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of U.S. technologies and intellectual property for years,\u201d added Mr. Wessel, a former Democratic congressional staff member. \u201cAn important question going forward will be whether U.S. companies and trade associations who have highlighted the problem will actually come forward and assist our government in the investigation or whether they will hide the facts, fearful that our government won\u2019t follow through, that the Chinese will retaliate against their interests or that they\u2019ll have to admit what\u2019s happened to their critical assets.\u201dIf the investigation finds evidence of wrongdoing, Mr. Trump could retaliate against China with tariffs or other punitive measures that have yet to be determined. Officials, speaking to reporters on the Saturday conference call, said their intention was not to punish Beijing but to negotiate an agreement that clawed back some of the estimated $600 billion in intellectual property theft officials estimate is perpetuated by China.The policy shift, led by Mr. Trump\u2019s economic adviser, Peter Navarro \u2014 a longtime critic of Beijing\u2019s trade practices and the author of a recent book, \u201cDeath by China\u201d \u2014 is unrelated to the continuing effort to persuade China to act more forcefully in the North Korea crisis, a senior administration official said.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to be tougher than previous presidents on trade, his administration has proceeded with a great degree of caution.The United States is scheduled to embark next week on its first round of renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. So far, however, its expressed goals are not drastically different than what was agreed to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact that Mr. Trump has attacked.Glenn Thrush reported from Bridgewater, N.J., and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "27 National Monuments Are Under Review. Here Are Five to Watch.", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nNo president has ever abolished a national monument designated by a predecessor. President Trump may try to change that.Democrats and environmental activists see the review as part of a broad effort within the Trump administration to unravel the conservation legacy of President Barack Obama, who under the 1906 Antiquities Act put more land and water under federal protection than any other president. Yet Mr. Zinke\u2019s study, due by Aug. 24, stretches back 21 years to include other national monuments that remain a source of acrimony, particularly in the West.Not all of the monuments are truly in the administration\u2019s cross hairs, and Mr. Zinke has already declared some of them safe from changes. While any of the others could be altered, critics and supporters of the review say only a handful face significant scrutiny. Here are some of the big ones to watch.UTAH 1.88 million acres | Designated by Bill Clinton, 1996 It\u2019s no accident that the Antiquities Act review goes back to 1996. That\u2019s when President Bill Clinton, standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon with the actor Robert Redford by his side, declared the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. The announcement took state leaders by surprise. Angered that Washington had ignored local views and quashed a proposed coal mine that had promised hundreds of jobs, residents in the neighboring town of Kanab flew flags at half-staff. Two decades later, opponents are still seeking ways to shrink the monument.UTAH 1.35 million acres | Designated by Barack Obama, 2016  Native American groups, for whom the rock formations and canyons are considered sacred ground, have fought to maintain the monument, arguing that archaeological sites have been defaced and that burial sites have been looted. But Utah\u2019s political leaders denounced the decision. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican, called it an \u201cegregious abuse of executive powers.\u201dN.M.496,330 acres | Designated by Barack Obama, 2014When Mr. Zinke flew by helicopter in July over the jagged Organ Mountains in southern New Mexico, he proclaimed the beauty of the monument, though he described it as \u201ca little disconnected.\u201d\u201cThe boundaries are difficult to discern \u2014 between private, public, state lands,\u201d he said at a news conference.Mr. Zinke has pledged to remain open-minded about the review. But environmentalists at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Biological Diversity are concerned that the large Western monument designated by the Obama administration could be altered.In designating Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Mr. Obama claimed the monument would spur $7.4 million in new economic activity. Ranchers, however, have worried that the monument will hurt their business. They also argue Mr. Obama did not follow the spirit of the Antiquities Act, which calls for protected lands to be \u201cconfined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management.\u201dMe.87,563 acres | Designated by Barack Obama, 2016The governor of Maine has denounced this sweeping monument in forestland that once was the heart of large-scale logging operations in the state.Mr. Zinke toured the area in June. He said he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the land remaining public, according to The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m confident there\u2019s a path forward here that will work,\u201d Mr. Zinke said.Expansion OriginalHAWAIIPresident George W. Bush created the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (pronounced \u201cPapa-ha-now-moh-koo-ah-kay-ah\u201d) off Hawaii in 2006. Last year, Mr. Obama quadrupled it.Now the ocean reserve more than twice the size of Texas is the largest protected area anywhere on Earth. Commercial fishing of tuna and other species is prohibited, though recreational fishing is allowed with a permit. New mining and oil and gas drilling are also forbidden.Scientists and environmentalists hailed the decision as critical to helping the diverse ecosystem withstand the threat of climate change. \u201cThe oceans are the untold story when it comes to climate change, and we have to feel a sense of urgency when it comes to protecting the ocean that sustains us,\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, who proposed the monument.But the decision wasn\u2019t without detractors. The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, a quasi-government agency that helps manage fisheries in the Pacific Islands, opposed the monument, arguing that Hawaii\u2019s fishermen are already being hurt by the protections because they now must fish in the high seas in competition with other countries.Republicans in Washington argue that the Antiquities Act was designed to protect \u201clands,\u201d not waters. Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, called the monument \u201cunjustified.\u201dAll National Monuments Under ReviewLand MonumentMarine MonumentNo Longer Under Review, No Changes RecommendedNo matter what Mr. Zinke\u2019s review finds, changes to federal monuments are not imminent. Environmental groups have vowed to sue if President Trump tries to eradicate or reduce protected lands.The Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment.Todd F. Gaziano, a senior fellow in constitutional law at the Pacific Legal Foundation, a group that advocates for limited government, has said environmental groups are engaged in \u201cmagical thinking\u201d when they argue that a president cannot revoke a designation. \u201cThere is no court case that holds the president doesn\u2019t have significant reduction authority,\u201d he said.The Interior Department has received more than 1.4 million public comments, which several outside organizations have said swung overwhelmingly toward preserving the national monuments.Mr. Zinke has reassured critics that he doesn\u2019t plan to sell off federal lands. \u201cEven if a monument is modified, the land will remain under federal ownership,\u201d he said.Hawaii shown at 50 percent scale relative to other states.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Can Always Get a Tee Time, but Turning a Profit Can Be Tricky", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersChip Smith didn\u2019t set out to get into the golf course business. He ran an advertising company in South Carolina in the 1990s, then got into the more lucrative business of running an institutional pharmacy in 2000, selling medications to nursing homes.He built a home on a golf course, the Tournament Players Club in Myrtle Beach, S.C. It was only after he sold the pharmacy business that he decided he liked the view from his windows and bought the course.\u201cThe PGA Tour was attempting to sell a number of properties,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, what a perfect opportunity. So I took some of the proceeds from the pharmacy and purchased the TPC Myrtle Beach,\u201d paying $7.5 million in 2006.\u201cMy backyard grew from half an acre to 369 acres.\u201dOwning a golf course is a luxury akin, for some people, to owning a vineyard or sports team. It may also come with a warning from friends and relatives.This was down 5.9 percent from a peak of nearly 16,000 courses in 2006, the culmination of a 20-year construction boom.But wealthy individuals still are attracted to course ownership \u2014 and some have great success with it. President Trump is one. He owns or manages 18 golf clubs in the United States and abroad, several of which have been host to major tournaments.It\u2019s probably not surprising that clubs, which require millions of dollars a year in upkeep, are not the highest-returning investment. But like vineyards to wine lovers, they are the fulfillment of a dream.Warren Stephens, chairman, chief executive and president of Stephens Inc., a privately held investment bank in Arkansas, came to course ownership with financial capital and knowledge of the country\u2019s best courses. His father, Jackson, was the fourth chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters tournament.\u201cI\u2019d been fortunate to be around a lot of great golf clubs over the years,\u201d said Mr. Stephens, who is a member of six clubs, including Cypress Point Club in Pebble Beach, Calif. \u201cIt was something I thought I could do.\u201dBut he needed time to do it. He bought 1,300 acres of wooded, rolling land in Roland, Ark., outside of Little Rock, in 2001. He began clearing land the next year and hired Tom Fazio, a well-known course architect, to design the club. In 2004, the Alotian Club opened, and the clubhouse opened the next year.Today, the Alotian is ranked the 27th best course in the United States by Golf Digest. It has only 200 members and remains dedicated to golf alone. It has attracted professional golfers like Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.In Mr. Stephens\u2019s case, he was building a course where he could buy all the land he needed. Eric Bergstol had a different challenge in his quest to put a high-caliber golf course close to Manhattan.Mr. Bergstol, who started as a residential developer, had already built several clubs in the New Jersey and New York suburbs and had learned from his mistakes. The biggest lesson, he said, was to make sure he had financing before he started construction.With Bayonne Golf Club, four miles by boat from Manhattan, Mr. Bergstol struck a deal to take and clean the fill being dredged from New York Harbor. That took some bite out of what he said was $130 million to build a golf club on top of a former waste dump \u2014 albeit one with views of the New York skyline and strong winds to challenge golfers.The club opened in 2006, and he said he was fortunate to have a number of members committed before the financial crash. Initiation fees then, he said, were $100,000.While not as many helicopters shuttle executives across the Hudson these days, he said the club still runs a boat to bring members and guests across. \u201cThis was a moment in time,\u201d said Mr. Bergstol, who also designed the course. \u201cThis type of project can never happen again.\u201dBuying an existing course can be a better deal. Mr. Smith said he made improvements to the TPC Myrtle Beach when he bought it, even though the club was only seven years old. He wanted it to stand out in the crowded Myrtle Beach golf market, which has over 100 courses. When he sold the course to a group of Chinese investors in 2014, he said, he made a good profit, which he wouldn\u2019t disclose.But last year, when he and a partner, Doug Marty, bought a course in Florida, Wellington National, he said he realized just how much money it could cost to turn around a course and make it profitable.\u201cWe went into that one and evaluated the facilities and the golf course,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt was by far the worst one I\u2019d ever seen in terms of being open and playable but being in awful condition. Doug likes to say we went in with an unlimited budget and exceeded that.\u201dThey shut the club for a year of renovations. It has now reopened and started to attract members. The two partners are betting that it can attract members from the surrounding equestrian community and nearby Palm Beach.But recouping their investment will take time. The initiation fee is $7,500 and annual dues are $6,750, comparatively modest in an area where $50,000 and $100,000 initiation fees are common.Pure resort courses are a different challenge. They need to rely on a steady stream of people visiting them.Jay Cashman, who runs a marine construction and dredging business in Boston, bought Kilkea Castle outside of Dublin in 2013. He said he had spent about 20 million euros (about $23.7 million) renovating the 12th-century castle and reviving the golf course that surrounds it. The annual payroll is \u20ac4 million ($4.7 million).But Mr. Cashman, who rarely plays golf and doesn\u2019t keep score when he does, said he did not expect to profit from the course. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make money but it sells the rooms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a casino in the old days when they gave away the rooms and the entertainment. The golf course is a loss leader. But we make money in some other parts.\u201dPaul Schock, a top amateur golfer and successful private equity investor, doesn\u2019t have that luxury.In 2004, after one of the companies he had invested in went public and \u201cgave me a big pile of money,\u201d Mr. Schock went to Nebraska to play Sand Hills Golf Club, a well-known destination for serious golfers. Through that trip, he discovered land 70 miles away on the Snake River in Valentine, Neb., population 2,803.He bought 1,700 acres at first and another 800 acres over time with the idea of creating a golf destination. With an initial investment of $25 million from himself, friends and investors in his private equity ventures, he built two 18-hole courses and a quirky short course.In 2010, with the effects of the recession lingering, the Prairie Club opened to widespread acclaim from golf writers, but in the first two and a half years, Mr. Schock said, the club lost $5 million.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you that the third time I went to my own well and the well of my investor group, I kept asking myself, and they kept asking me, \u2018Is this really going to work?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut we felt like we were getting there.\u201dNow, he has a thriving golf destination, with members and guests from across the country, and it has helped the local economy.And fortunately, ownership hasn\u2019t ruined his golf game. While he said he had probably played each course only 10 times in the eight years since the club opened, he recently shot a six-under-par on the tougher of the two courses. \u201cBut I will tell you this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wind wasn\u2019t blowing 35 miles per hour that day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a series of tweets, he blamed Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan for their handling of legislation to raise the debt ceiling, something Republicans argued for years had to be paired with spending cuts. \u201cCould have been so easy \u2014 now a mess!\u201d the president said.He\u2019s right. It is a mess. But it\u2019s not a mess Mr. McConnell and Mr. Ryan created this summer. It\u2019s a mess Republicans laid the groundwork for over eight years of impeding a presidency and an economy because of their professed desire for fiscal restraint.It must be satisfying to turn Republicans\u2019 own debt arguments back on them. But the honest objection Democrats should raise is not how things will be paid for, but whether they\u2019re worth the cost.Instead of digging in on the debt ceiling, the Democrats should call the Republicans\u2019 bluff and demand the limit be abolished altogether. Republicans have shown their hand: They don\u2019t care about the deficit or the debt. Democrats should point that out and push for an end to brinkmanship over the country\u2019s finances.If the Republicans\u2019 experience shows anything, it\u2019s that voters haven\u2019t punished them for reneging on promises.

And there does seem to be interest: State Democrats have already raised more than $1 million for the effort.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get under my skin at all, but I know I get under his,\u201d said Mr. Collins, 67, breaking into a laugh. \u201cAnd that just makes me happier than I could ever tell you.\u201dMs. Cole, making her first run for public office, says she has never met the governor, and faults Mr. Collins for his pursuit of fame in Washington \u2014 he\u2019s a regular on national talk shows \u2014 rather than concerns in his district. \u201cClearly he\u2019s not getting out to talk to people,\u201d she said.Mr. Collins rejected that, and said he relished the thought of Mr. Cuomo \u2014 or Ms. Cole \u2014 trying to unseat him. \u201cI would dare him, double-dare him, to come campaign for his handpicked candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even better yet, bring Nancy Pelosi with him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Service Union Plans Big Push to Turn Midwest Political Tide", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChallenging the Republican ascendance in states where labor once carried enormous sway, a prominent union plans to spend tens of millions of dollars during the 2018 campaign cycle to reverse the trend.The Service Employees International Union, one of the largest and wealthiest unions in the United States with roughly 2 million members, will fund an extensive campaign over the next 14 months to elect politicians with labor-friendly stands on the minimum wage, unions and health care.The effort will primarily aim at the traditionally industrial states of the Midwest and Rust Belt, where labor\u2019s political influence has come under a furious assault from conservative forces in recent decades, culminating in President Trump\u2019s electoral sweep of the traditionally Democratic states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u201cIf you think about what the No. 1 job of an elected official ought to be, it\u2019s raising the standard of living of citizens they\u2019re elected to represent,\u201d said Scott Courtney, an executive vice president of the union, which will formally unveil the initiative on Labor Day. \u201cBut if you look at what has been happening in battle ground states in the Midwest, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201dThe high-profile involvement of S.E.I.U., whose membership in the Midwest has steadily increased over much of the past generation, is in some sense a reflection of the changing economic landscape of the region, where health care has replaced manufacturing as the top employer in many states.Some public opinion experts believe that Republicans have overreached on the narrower issue of unions in particular.\u201cIn Midwestern states, the battlegrounds, people really like unions,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has done work for unions, including the service employees. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re uncritical, but they like them, they cannot imagine a world without unions.\u201d\u201cIf the issue Big Labor plans on raising is right to work, then that should be a winning debate for candidates who have voted to oppose forced union dues,\u201d Mr. Semmens said in an email.One of the S.E.I.U.\u2019s biggest initiatives in recent years has been the Fight for 15 campaign, an effort to raise wages and win union rights for low-paid workers that began in the fast-food industry and has helped win minimum wage increases across the country. Mr. Courtney, an architect of that effort, said the Fight for 15 would join the new initiative and that the idea was to combine two projects in which the union has considerable expertise: organizing workers and mobilizing voters.He said that door-to-door canvassing for issues like a $15 minimum wage, union access and universal health care in the coming months would give way to electoral canvassing as next year\u2019s voting approaches. Even then, issues will remain at the forefront, he said: the union and the Fight for 15 will continue to emphasize their agenda and only tout candidates who strongly support it.\u201cYou learn every time you do stuff about how to do it differently, better,\u201d Mr. Courtney said.The key to the union\u2019s program for 2018, Mr. Courtney added, will be to expand the universe of voters who turn out on Election Day.The S.E.I.U. conducted a pilot project during the 2016 campaign in which it canvassed groups of voters largely in two heavily African-American wards of Detroit using a small-scale version of the campaign it plans for the year ahead.Over all, about 62 percent of voters the union talked to during the pilot project cast ballots in the presidential election, versus turnout of about 38 percent of voters who it did not talk to, according to data provided by the union.Applying the same percentage to all of Detroit\u2019s voters would have produced about 40,000 more total votes in 2016, an amount that would have almost certainly secured the state for Mrs. Clinton.Two people briefed on the initiative said the overall budget would approach $100 million, though that figure includes a substantial portion of money that the union was already likely to spend in these states. Even so, the initiative ensures that the political spending will primarily support outreach to voters on key issues, which would not necessarily have been the case.By comparison, the union spent about $70 million on all federal political activity in 2012 and again in 2016, though the sums rose considerably once spending on local candidates and other nonfederal costs was included. Beyond the Midwest, the initiative will be aimed at a small number of competitive states elsewhere in the country, like Colorado, Florida and Nevada.It was \u201challucinatory,\u201d Mr. Rolf wrote, to believe that \u201cthe hundreds of millions of dollars the labor movement spent just on Wisconsin gubernatorial elections between 2010 and 2014 couldn\u2019t have been better used to build new forms of worker power.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified one traditionally Democratic state carried by President Trump in November. He won Michigan \u2014 not Illinois \u2014 along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Advertisement"}

We are going to get lit up.\u201dThe class, a mix of strength work and high-interval training, was carefully created by the trainers, who are close friends. Participants, dressed in bright-colored leggings, cut-up T-shirts and the latest name-brand footwear, grunted through intervals of burpees with names like hot sauce, Bloody Mary, and jalape\u00f1o.By the end of the 50-minute workout participants were drenched in sweat and keeled over. But rather than run straight to the locker rooms, they stayed behind to chat with the instructors. Some requested selfies. Others needed clarifications on moves. A large group headed to the adjacent lounge where they helped themselves to free cold brew, laced with nitrogen for an extra kick, and analyzed the workout.\u201cEveryone is very passionate about working out here,\u201d said Sara Angle, a 27-year-old fitness editor for Shape magazine who was at the class. \u201cNo other studios have this space to build this kind of community.\u201dEquinox, the luxury health club chain, opened the new space, Project by Equinox, in March to experiment with new kinds of exercise, equipment and teaching methods. Instructors get to invent new classes and practice them with willing participants before rolling some of them out to the wider world.\u201cIt\u2019s a think tank, or incubator, or lab, or start-up, or whatever you want to call it,\u201d said Vanessa Martin, the studio director.This space is a welcome addition for instructors and customers who like to experiment, said Ms. Martin. Many New York fitness studios, in order to scale their offerings, ask teachers to follow set scripts and workouts, stifling their creativity, she said. Other clubs turn to gimmicks that have no real physical benefit. \u201cNew Yorkers have 45 minutes a day to exercise, and they want results.\u201dTo that end, traditional Equinox clubs aren\u2019t the ideal places to experiment, since members expect a constant, high-level experience.\u201cThis is our Google Garage, our 20-percent time,\u201d Chloe Heckman, the vice president of business development at Equinox, said.There are eight to 10 instructors at any given time working in the studio. They must first audition, and prove that they have an entrepreneurial spirit and the potential to build a brand. Once accepted, they get whatever equipment they want \u2014 one requested a pull-up bar big enough for a group; another, resistance bands with a specific type of clutch. Instructors can play around with a lighting system that has 110,000 different settings, or a video camera that provides short clips of their workouts for social media.Every afternoon, the space is reserved for instructors to collaborate and experiment. \u201cOnce I was asked to hang from a pull-up bar with a resistance band on my ankle\u201d for a \u201chuge core engagement\u201d exercise, said Ms. Martin.Some fitness experts are dubious, however. Jason Kelly, the author of \u201cSweat Equity: Inside the New Economy of Mind and Body,\u201d agreed that there is a desire for innovation. \u201cThe appetite for the next fitness thing is robust, especially with the 20- or 30-something set,\u201d he said.Still, he worries about the ramifications of following trends. \u201cDoing the next cool thing sometimes feels like making sure you\u2019ve eaten at the greatest restaurant or gone for a drink at the cool new rooftop bar. If fitness turns into this strange one-upmanship of, \u2018If you aren\u2019t doing this cool new thing, you aren\u2019t doing it right,\u2019 that can be a bit of a turnoff,\u201d he said. \u201cAt heart, I still love the idea of just going out for a run.\u201dA perk for some trainers at Project by Equinox is that they are finally given the resources and time to develop their dream class \u2014 something they don\u2019t see as trendy at all. Patrick McGrath, a Pilates expert, teaches a sculpt and strength class that focuses on core work. \u201cWhen we sat down for a meeting, I knew what I wanted to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what I do in my own life.\u201dMs. Godso and Ms. Williams used to have brunch and talk about the class they wanted to teach together. \u201cThis was the first time we had a space to do it,\u201d said Ms. Godso.At $35 a class, the experience is not cheap, but it is open to the public, not just Equinox members. Dennis O\u2019Reilly, a 28-year-old sales executive at a tech company, seems fine with the price tag, and likes the vibe of the studio, which welcomes men, he said. \u201cThis studio offers core workouts and a Nordic vibe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t go out of fashion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I loved going to an office, where satisfaction was wrapped in camaraderie garnished by a salary, health care, paid vacation and sick days I never used. In my mid-50s I was shown the door. Opportunities came along, far from my home. I held out for a situation that did not involve relocation while I watched my industry \u2014 magazine publishing \u2014 start to disappear as if it were written in vanishing ink. Remaining jobs went to editors with three years of experience, not 33.Which is why I joined the gig economy. For the past decade I\u2019ve worked hard, hoping to write books as long as editors and readers will buy them. My second act has gone well, perhaps because I report to a taskmaster: me. I\u2019ve also been lucky, and for that I\u2019m grateful, but self-employment is hardly an option for everyone, nor does it offer any benefits beyond the chance to work in dollar-store leggings while Facebook \u201clikes\u201d replace human contact.Recently I celebrated my aunt\u2019s 100th birthday. Whoa, is Ruth sharp. Manages her finances. Follows politics. Remembers everything, including that in 1984 I failed to thank her when she cared for my Alzheimer\u2019s-afflicted mother so that her brother \u2014 my dad \u2014 could visit me. Mea culpa, Aunt Ruth.Ruth explained how she and her husband grew a tiny North Dakota shop into a mini-Tiffany\u2019s, taking afternoons off for bridge, to which she credits her mental muscle. How the couple got wind of a 55-plus community sprouting in Arizona. How after prairie winters, Sun City was Nirvana.It\u2019s 45 years since Ruth retired. That\u2019s a heap of bridge. As I toasted her, my mind wandered: If I knew I had 45 lucid years left, what would I do?Nor would social sports make my cut. My eye-hand coordination ends with typing. If forced to live among a tribe of friends, based on their ability to team up to play tennis, I\u2019d organize a book club.The one-two punch of my agenda: I\u2019ll decide when I \u201cretire,\u201d along with when I become \u201cold.\u201d If I want to rock long hair into my 90s, I will. Likewise for hanging with friends half my age. I\u2019ll study history, take up painting and in the company of my husband \u2014 who in my eyes will always be a shaggy sophomore \u2014 go dancing and see every art-house film and as many plays as we can afford. (Damn you, Broadway, for tickets that cost what we paid for our first car.) We\u2019ll travel because I don\u2019t want to be the last American to visit Reykjavik. I\u2019ll take my grandchildren to museums, throw parties and get out the vote, lest my life be one big orgy of me time.But all of this needs to fit around my nonretirement retirement: work. Some sidelined women can afford to be ladies of leisure and happily fulfill conventional expectations, finding joy at gardening clubs and golf courses. The rest of us? Hello, darkness, my old friend. Got Lexapro? The old saw goes that on a deathbed nobody wishes they\u2019d spent more time at the office, but I suspect many women, whose careers stop prematurely, do. Work is where we get our superpowers and not incidentally, our income. How else will we afford a ticket to Iceland?But women can\u2019t just imagine change. They need to speak up about this issue, just as female managers should think about hiring women the age of their mother. Today\u2019s 30- and 40-somethings can\u2019t \u201clean in\u201d forever. If they don\u2019t address embedded ageism, they\u2019ll blink, pass 50, and possibly see their success evaporate faster than a boss can say, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re going in another direction.\u201d A younger direction.An opinion essay last week about older women in the work force misstated a statistic about 55-to 64-year-old women who are looking for work. Nearly half of the long-term unemployed in that age bracket are women; it is not the case that half of women in that age bracket are among the long-term unemployed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says More Jobs Will Help Race Relations. If Only It Were So Simple.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySharing the PiePresident Trump has a simple answer for racial tension in the United States: jobs.In his contentious news conference Tuesday, he argued that his administration would create millions of jobs and stronger growth in wages, and that this would have a \u201ctremendous positive impact on race relations.\u201d\u201cWhat people want now, they want jobs,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey want great jobs with good pay. And when they have that, you watch how race relations will be.\u201dBut there\u2019s not much evidence in recent history that racial attitudes are shaped by the ups and downs of the overall economy. Certainly jobs and wages influence Americans\u2019 sense of well-being and their worldview. But attitudes about race relations seem to be overwhelmingly shaped by developments unrelated to things like the unemployment rate or growth in household incomes.The survey results around racial attitudes changed not in the immediate aftermath of the recession, when the unemployment rate soared to 10 percent and jobs were scarce, but in 2015, when the economy was back on its feet.In the middle of 2013, when the jobless rate was 7.5 percent, 70 percent of adults thought race relations were somewhat good or very good. By 2015, unemployment was down to a healthy 5.3 percent, but only 47 percent gave that positive reading of race relations.One likely reason for the shift is the rise of protest movements over police killings of African-Americans. Those protests took off in August 2014, when a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Mo. Negative polling on the state of race relations has persisted in the years since, even as the economy has continued improving. As a candidate, Donald Trump stressed the idea that immigrants were stealing American jobs.\u201cThe idea that the availability of jobs is the way to solve race relations is misguided,\u201d Ms. Jones said, in that a job alone doesn\u2019t assure a stable, prosperous standard of living.\u201cEven if you have jobs available, there\u2019s still discrimination in pay and promotion,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing able to have a job that pays well and comes with benefits, to buy a house in a place that isn\u2019t racially segregated, to send your kids to a school that is not racially segregated, these are parts of what makes for a quality economic outcome.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the question of what the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda would do for those types of opportunities. Job growth has remained steady in the first seven months of the Trump administration, with the United States adding an average of 179,000 jobs a month since February compared with 187,000 a month last year. But wage growth has been only slightly faster than inflation, with average hourly earnings up 2.5 percent over the last year. That number was 2.9 percent in December.Even if job growth and wages were to accelerate further, Mr. Trump also promised big things specifically for inner-city America in his comments on Tuesday. \u201cWe are spending a lot of money on the inner cities,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe are doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It is a priority for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Sets Date for Major Communist Party Reshuffle", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese Communist Party will hold a once-every-five-years leadership reshuffle in October, the state-run news media reported on Thursday, confirming the date of a closely watched meeting that will serve as a test of President Xi Jinping\u2019s power.About 2,300 delegates, including senior officials, will meet in Beijing for a party congress on Oct. 18, according to news reports. They are expected to confirm Mr. Xi for a second five-year term and to appoint a new cohort of officials under him.Mr. Johnson said Mr. Xi\u2019s performance at the congress would have more than just domestic implications. It is also likely to determine Chinese policy toward the United States at a time of increasing friction over issues such as trade and North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, he said.\u201cIf Xi has a big win in the congress, I think that gives him full freedom of action to manage the relationship how he chooses,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, with options including being more obstinate in the face of demands from President Trump.At the congress, at least 11 of the 25 members of the Politburo are expected to retire, unless an informal rule requiring members to step down if they are 68 or older at the time of the congress is relaxed. That includes five of the seven members of the even more powerful Politburo Standing Committee.Party congresses usually last 10 days. But details must first be approved by a meeting of the party\u2019s Central Committee, which brings together hundreds of senior officials. The congress will elect a new Central Committee, which in turn will anoint the new leadership.Mr. Xi is likely to present his new lineup publicly at the end of the congress.The congress will select only party positions. The new government lineup will be appointed by a meeting of the legislature, called the National People\u2019s Congress, which is likely to convene in March. Mr. Xi is then almost certain to be reappointed state president, and Li Keqiang appears likely to win another term as premier.\u201cThat would be a fairly strong sign to the party that this is collective governance of one, and that all eyes should be looking to Xi Jinping,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a researcher at the Conference Board in Beijing who studies Chinese politics.Still, Mr. Blanchette added, having more allies in crucial positions could leave Mr. Xi vulnerable to criticism if the Chinese economy underperforms or if a foreign policy crisis breaks out.\u201cThe buck stops with him whether he wants it or not,\u201d Mr. Blanchette said.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

(In my own faraway youth, after 18 hours or more at work on the equivalent, then, of a start-up \u2014 a poorly funded local print product \u2014 I could do no more than fill a plastic tray with sesame chicken at the Vietnamese salad bar on Bleecker Street and shuffle home, alone, with a beer.)Up on the roof (squashy canvas beanbags), we could see a gaggle of yoga practitioners who swayed and dipped a few buildings away. \u201cIs this \u2018The Matrix\u2019?\u201d Ms. Evans wondered, before clapping her hands and gathering up the group. \u201cShould we say hello to our future selves?\u201d\u201cThat just meant that we weren\u2019t making out, though we were seeing each other every day,\u201d he said. Regular apartment life is boring, he continued, but there are challenges to co-living. \u201cPeople getting drunk and hooking up, there\u2019s more potential for drama to happen. And in a normal apartment you don\u2019t have 30 people who know what\u2019s going on in your relationship. If we have a fight,\u201d he said of Ms. Zhao, \u201ceverybody wants to know what it\u2019s about.\u201d\u201cScooby, scooby, guys,\u201d said Ms. Evans, \u201ccome along!\u201d It was time for the next port, the bistro Dirty French across the street, followed by one more: Max Fish, the beloved, art-inflected 1990s-era hangout on Ludlow Street that closed there in 2013 and reopened a year later on Orchard. I decided to skip that stop. I\u2019d been there before, after all.I liked my cubby bed, but apartments tucked into office buildings can be grim, despite the ferry terminal outside this one, the literary embellishments and the free coffee.Floors are organized into \u201cneighborhoods,\u201d with open staircases and unifying decorative schemes. There\u2019s a B.Y.O. whiskey bar, a library, and common kitchens are stocked with coffee and fruit water. The laundry room has a pool table. You can buy snacks there with the WeLive app, which also alerts you to group events, like family dinners, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d nights or kickboxing classes. It\u2019s all a bit bro-themed: On a blackboard panel were chalked the words \u201cDo You Have Ur Keys.\u201dBut there were women at family dinner that night, like Kimberly Cockrell, 37, newly arrived from Miami for a job in the shipping industry, and delighted, she said, to be rid of her three-bedroom house. The free wine and food was nice, too. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a broom here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels pretty great not to have to cut the grass.\u201dBlaine Ford, WeLive\u2019s community manager, said he encourages tenants to not join the WeWork offices in the building, but pick a location that\u2019s at least a few blocks away. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to have a bit of a commute,\u201d he said, \u201cand just go outside.\u201dOn a scruffy block on Eldert Street in Bushwick, a renovated brick townhouse built around 1900 gleamed like a showplace in Brooklyn Heights. Inside, a parlor room was swathed in Brooklyn toile; there were vintage photographs of the neighborhood, and on the shelves, the requisite board games and other accouterments of the internet-weary.The apartments, fully furnished in a gender-neutral, post-West Elm manner, have plump blue Smeg refrigerators in their open-shelved galley kitchens. The backyard is propped with Brimfield finds \u2014 seats made from rusty milk cans, vintage signs \u2014 and above, a web of industrial light bulbs.I observed the impressive efforts of Peter and Gena Cuba, both 33 and graphic designers originally from the Midwest. They had moved to Node from Brooklyn Heights, as it happened, because they felt that the comforts of that neighborhood had become a trap. Ms. Cuba also had a hankering for a bathtub. Rents start at $2,800 for a one-bedroom. You can bring your own roommates, or Jeanette Dobrowski, Node\u2019s 28-year-old community curator, will fix you up.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the room of a fashion stylist at Quarters on Grand Street. It is 212 square feet, not 65.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Full Transcript and Video: Trump\u2019s News Conference in New York", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump gave an update on the administration\u2019s efforts on infrastructure on Tuesday at Trump Tower, and then held a combative question-and-answer session that touched on the violence in Charlottesville, Va., his view on removing Confederate statues, Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s role in the White House and more.Following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times. It has been lightly edited for clarity. Read more coverage \u00bb___________TRUMP: Great to be back in New York with all of our friends and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you.I want to thank all of our distinguished guests who are with us today, including members of our cabinet: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, O.M.B. Director Mick Mulvaney, and of course our transportation secretary, who\u2019s doing a fabulous job, Elaine Chao. Thank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what we are going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure. We\u2019ve just had a great set of briefings upstairs on our infrastructure agenda.My administration is working every day to deliver the world-class infrastructure that our people deserve, and that frankly our country deserves. That\u2019s why I just signed a new executive order to dramatically reform the nation\u2019s badly broken infrastructure permitting process.Just blocks away is the Empire State Building. It took 11 months to build the Empire State Building. But today it can take as long as a decade, and much more than that. Many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway. Highway builders must get up to 16 different approvals involving nine different federal agencies governed by 29 different statutes. One agency alone can stall a project for many, many years and even decades. Not only does this cost our economy billions of dollars, but it also denies our citizens the safe and modern infrastructure they deserve.This overregulated permitting process is a massive, self-inflicted wound on our country. It\u2019s disgraceful. Denying our people much needed investments in their community. And I just want to show you this, because it was just shown to me. I think I\u2019m going to show it to the media, both real and fake media, by the way. This is what it takes to get something approved today.Elaine, you see that. So this is what it takes, permitting process flow chart. That\u2019s a flowchart. So that can go out to 20 years. This shows about 10. But that can go out to about 20 years to get something approved. This is for a highway. I have seen a highway recently in a certain state. I won\u2019t mention its name. It is 17 years. I could have built it for $4 or $5 million without the permitting process. It costs hundreds of millions of dollars, but it took 17 years to get it approved and many, many, many, many pages of environmental impact studies. This what we will bring it down to. This is less than two years. This is going to happen quickly. That\u2019s what I\u2019m signing today. This will be less than two years for a highway. So it\u2019s going to be quick. It\u2019s going to be a very streamlined process. And by the way, if it doesn\u2019t meet environmental safeguards, we are not going to approve it. Very simple. We are not going to approve it. Maybe this one will say, let\u2019s throw the other one away. Would anybody like it from the media? Would anybody like that long, beautiful chart? You can have it. So my executive order also requires agencies to work together efficiently by requiring one lead agency for each major infrastructure project. It also holds agencies accountable if they fail to streamline their review process.So each agency is accountable. We\u2019re going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively, relatively speaking. And the permitting process will go very, very quickly. No longer will we tolerate one job killing delay after another. No longer will we accept a broken system that benefits consultants and lobbyists at the expense of hard-working Americans.Now I knew the process very well, probably better than anybody. I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built, all of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places. And I will tell you that the consultants are rich people. They go around making it very difficult. They lobby Congress. They lobby state government, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune. So we are streamlining the process, and we won\u2019t be having so much of that anymore. No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay. While protecting the environment, we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels and highways. We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel. We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true. Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world. We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world. And today, we are like a third-world country. We are literally like a third-world country. Our infrastructure will again be the best. And we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation. And all over the United States will be proud again.So I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you. God bless the United States. And if you have any questions, we have Mick. You could come up here, please. Come on up. Mick Mulvaney.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.REPORTER: Why do you think these C.E.O.\u2019s are leaving your manufacturing council?TRUMP: Because they\u2019re not taking their jobs seriously as it pertains to this country. But we want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you are talking about, they are outside of the country. They are having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look \u2014 excuse me, excuse me \u2014 take a look at where their product is made. It\u2019s made outside of our country. We want products made in the country. Now I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they\u2019re leaving out of embarrassment, because they make their products outside. And I have been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you are referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can\u2019t do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That\u2019s what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit.REPORTER: Why did you wait so long \u2014 [cross talk]TRUMP: I didn\u2019t wait long. I didn\u2019t wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement but you don\u2019t make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don\u2019t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don\u2019t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to my statement, I brought it. I brought it.[cross talk]As I said, remember, Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America. And then I went on from there. Here is the thing. Excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here is the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn\u2019t happen yet as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don\u2019t want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through I guess Twitter, social media, the nicest things. And I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually, an incredible young woman. Her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you \u2026 [cross talk]... and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.[cross talk]How about a couple of infrastructure questions.REPORTER: The C.E.O. of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you?TRUMP: Not at all. I think the country \u2014 look, you take a look. I\u2019ve created over a million jobs since I\u2019m president. The country is booming. The stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we have ever had in the history of our country. We are doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm, so the head of Walmart, who I know, who\u2019s a very nice guy, was making a political statement.[cross talk]I would do it the same way, because I want to make sure when I make a statement that the statement is correct. And there was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters. [cross talk] I didn\u2019t know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well-stated. In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good. I couldn\u2019t have made it sooner, because I didn\u2019t know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don\u2019t know all of the facts. It was very important \u2014 [cross talk] excuse me, excuse me. It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement \u2014 and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made with knowledge, with great knowledge. There are still things \u2014 [cross talk] excuse me. There are still things that people don\u2019t know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts.REPORTER: Two questions: Was this terrorism? And can you tell us how you are feeling about your chief strategist Steve Bannon?TRUMP: Well I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country. You can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. There is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? Then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. What he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.REPORTER: Can you tell us how you are feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon?TRUMP: Go ahead.ANOTHER REPORTER: Steve Bannon \u2014 I would echo Maggie\u2019s question.TRUMP: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it.REPORTER: But can you tell us broadly, do you still have confidence in Steve?TRUMP: Well, we\u2019ll see\u2026 Look, look, I like Mr. Bannon. He is a friend of mine. Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist. I can tell you that. He is a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. We\u2019ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. He is a good person and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly.[cross talk]REPORTER: Senator McCain has called on you to defend your national security adviser, H.R. McMaster against these attacks.[cross talk]TRUMP: I\u2019ve already done \u2026 I did it the last time.[cross talk]REPORTER: \u2026 and he called on you again, linking it to the alt-Right\u2026[cross talk]TRUMP: Senator McCain? You mean the one that voted against Obamacare? You mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care?REPORTER: Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these and he linked that same group to those that perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville.TRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sure Senator McCain must know what he is talking about. When you say the alt-right. Define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead. No, define it for me. Come on. Let\u2019s go.REPORTER: Senator McCain defined them as the same group \u2014[cross talk]TRUMP: What about the alt-left that came charging at \u2014 Excuse me \u2014 What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? [cross talk] Let me ask you this: What about the fact that they came charging, that they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. So, you know, as far as I\u2019m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.[cross talk]Wait a minute. I\u2019m not finished. I\u2019m not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day.[cross talk]TRUMP: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it. And you had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that. But I\u2019ll say it right now.[cross talk]You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent.REPORTER: Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?TRUMP: All of those people \u2014 Excuse me \u2014 I\u2019ve condemned neo-Nazis. I\u2019ve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee.So \u2014 excuse me \u2014 and you take a look at some of the groups and you see and you would know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases, you are not. But, many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?But they were there to protest \u2014 excuse me \u2014 you take a look, the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead.REPORTER: Does the statue of Robert E. Lee stay up?TRUMP: I would say that is up to a local town, community or the federal government, depending on where it is located.REPORTER: Are you against the Confederacy?REPORTER: How concerned are you about race relations in America and do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office?TRUMP: I think they\u2019ve gotten better or the same. Look they have been frayed for a long time. And you can ask President Obama about that because he would make speeches about it.But I believe that the fact that I brought in, it will be soon, millions of jobs, you see where companies are moving back into our country. I think that\u2019s going to have a tremendous positive impact on race relations.We have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin, just announced. We have many companies, I say, pouring back into the country. I think that\u2019s going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations.You know why? It is jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay. And when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I\u2019ll tell you we are spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We are gonna fix, we are fixing the inner cities. We are doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It is a priority for me. And it\u2019s very important.REPORTER: Mr. President, are you putting what you are calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane?TRUMP: I am not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I\u2019m saying is this: You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and horrible. And it was a horrible thing to watch. But there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left. You have just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that\u2019s the way it is.REPORTER: You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides?TRUMP: Well I do think there\u2019s blame. Yes, I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it. And you don\u2019t have doubt about it either. And if you reported it accurately, you would say.REPORTER: The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest \u2014TRUMP: Excuse me. They didn\u2019t put themselves down as neo-Nazis. And you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.You had people in that group \u2014 excuse me, excuse me \u2014 I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.[cross talk]TRUMP: George Washington as a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down \u2014 excuse me \u2014 are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him. Good.Are we going to take down the statue? Cause he was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? So you know what? It\u2019s fine. You are changing history, you\u2019re changing culture. You had people and I\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. O.K.? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group too.REPORTER: Who has the press treated unfairly? Sir, I\u2019m sorry, I just didn\u2019t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? I just didn\u2019t understand what you were saying.TRUMP: No, no. There were people in that rally. I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest.Because I don\u2019t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn\u2019t have a permit. So I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final question? Do you have an infrastructure question?REPORTER: What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn\u2019t get health care, you didn\u2019t get tax reform...TRUMP: Well, you know, I\u2019ll tell you. We came very close with health care. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You\u2019ll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we\u2019ll get the infrastructure. And actually infrastructure is something I think we\u2019ll have bipartisan support on. I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure.REPORTER: Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack?TRUMP: No. I will be reaching out.REPORTER: When will you be reaching out?TRUMP: I thought that the statement put out, the mother\u2019s statement, I thought was a beautiful statement. I tell you, it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. Under the kind of stress that she is under and the heartache that she is under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won\u2019t forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you.REPORTER: Do you plan to go to Charlottesville, Mr. President?[cross talk]TRUMP: Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville? It is in Charlottesville. You\u2019ll see.REPORTER: Is that the winery?REPORTER: What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?TRUMP: I really think jobs can have a big impact. I think if we continue to create jobs, over a million, substantially more than a million. And you see just the other day, the car companies coming in, with Foxconn. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I\u2019m creating jobs, I think that\u2019s going to have a tremendous impact, positive impact, on race relations.REPORTER: What you said today, how do you think that will impact the racial \u2014?TRUMP: Because the people are going to be working. They\u2019re going to be making a lot of money, much more than they ever thought possible. That\u2019s going to happen. The other thing, very important: I believe wages will start going up. They haven\u2019t gone up for a long time. I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well, with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up. I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. Thank you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Health Care, Who Needs Congress?", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRegardless of whether Congress enacts health care reform, the private sector isn\u2019t waiting. Health care for our employees is too expensive, and the employer-based system must be reformed.This can\u2019t go on. Our health care system may offer cutting-edge cures and treatments, but it\u2019s also cumbersome, expensive and inefficient, especially for the daily, more routine matters that our employees and their families deal with.Two years ago, a small number of corporate chief human resources officers, led by American Express, Verizon and Macy\u2019s, met to figure out if they could come up with a better way to provide coverage for their workers at more affordable rates. Individual companies had done all they could to improve the system, but each hit a wall. There was only so much one company could accomplish on its own. One year later, 21 companies with a total of four million employees began an effort to change the way they paid for health care.Now 41 major corporations that represent over six million workers and retirees have joined together to reform the private-sector health care system. Our companies are diverse, representing pretty much every sector of the economy. Known as the Health Transformation Alliance, we\u2019re troubled by the number of middlemen who drive up the price of care, and by the soaring costs of prescription drugs.The members of the alliance spend $25 billion on health care and, as a result, have a lot of data that helps us identify trends. By studying where the money goes and its impact on patient health, we can see what treatments, which doctors and hospitals, and which medical networks get the best results. Data analysis from IBM is turning what used to be a blizzard of paperwork into a road map for the future.There are things data can tell us that individuals have a hard time learning on their own. For example, if data tell us that 50 percent of patients who visit a particular hospital suffer a relapse for a particular medical condition while only 25 percent of patients who visit a crosstown hospital have a relapse for the same illness, we want our employees to know that \u2014 and if possible, to use the hospital with the better results. The data can save lives.Prescription drugs also save lives, but they\u2019re expensive, often in ways hidden from employers and employees alike. This year, the alliance companies changed how we do business with pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that provide prescription drugs for our employees.Rather than having individual companies contract with benefit managers, we worked with CVS and OptumRx on an approach under which we gain more access to drug companies\u2019 pricing structures, strengthening our position in cost negotiations. That results in lower prices for the same medicines and allows the alliance members to achieve considerable savings. We also are working to ensure that formularies, the lists of prescription medicines covered by insurers, are the right ones for patients, not just the most profitable ones. This can increase the use of lower-cost generic drugs.Beginning Jan. 1, these drug reforms alone are projected to save participating companies, their workers and, in some cases, retirees at least $600 million over three years \u2014 while achieving the same or better results. Even for large companies, that\u2019s a lot of money. It\u2019s also an inducement for more companies to join our effort. The more that join, the more reforms we can achieve.We and our employees spend more than $5 billion each year on four procedures and ailments: knee replacements, hip replacements, back pain and diabetes. These common problems account for 20 percent of the money our companies spend on treatment. Starting next year, we will create new medical networks in three major cities that will focus on delivering better results for these ailments and procedures at better prices. Our new networks are likely to compete with some doctors and hospitals that don\u2019t have as good a treatment record. The health care arena needs more competition, and we will encourage it.The rising number of companies joining our alliance means corporations recognize that the status quo is not acceptable. Private sector health care must change. We are doing our part to make that happen.Robert Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from New Jersey, is chief executive of the Health Transformation Alliance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Democrats See Tax Overhaul as a Path to Taxing Carbon", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey also hope to have an ally in President Trump\u2019s economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who met in February with a prominent group of Republicans advocating a similar plan.Yet even the fiercest critics of a carbon tax say they can\u2019t afford to dismiss the effort.Amid concern that tax reform might be delayed because of the political turmoil caused by Mr. Trump\u2019s statement at a news conference Tuesday that \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for violence over the weekend at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., top White House officials asserted the president\u2019s words would not hamper the tax reform plan.\u201cWe are going to hit the ground running, literally this month on tax reform,\u201d Cohn told reporters in Trump Tower on Tuesday after the president left the podium. Asked if the president\u2019s agenda is still on track, he said, \u201cWe are here to execute his agenda.\u201dThe carbon tax bill they have proposed uses part of the revenue to reduce the marginal corporate income tax rate to 29 percent.\u201cThere are only a handful of options in terms of generating revenue for broad-based tax reform, and they\u2019re all very close to dead on arrival. This is the one proposal that could attract a significant number of Democrats,\u201d Mr. Schatz said. He acknowledged, though, that using revenue to cut the corporate income tax rate could turn off some Democrats, too.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.The legislation calls for the tax, which would increase annually by 2 percent, to be collected at its source \u2014 at coal mines, oil refineries or ports of entry. The rest of the revenue would come back to taxpayers in an annual inflation-adjusted $550 refundable tax credit, or $1,100 for married couples filing jointly. Money would also be devoted to veterans and to coal country for job training programs.The idea of a carbon tax dates to the 1920s, when the British economist Arthur Pigou observed that some goods had social costs that society ended up paying for \u2014 like alcohol, or pollution. In the early 2000s economists and other supporters of taxing companies for the carbon they send into the atmosphere formed the Pigou Club in his honor.Asked where a carbon tax stands in the administration\u2019s deliberations, a White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, said in a statement, \u201cWe don\u2019t officially comment on legislation unless it\u2019s something we are actively supporting or is about to be considered in Congress.\u201dMr. Norquist and other opponents like Mr. Pyle say they welcome a debate on a carbon tax. They and others recalled that Democrats lost the House in the 1994 midterm elections in large part because President Bill Clinton proposed but failed to get passed a \u201cB.T.U. tax\u201d on fuels that would have raised energy costs.There\u2019s no single solution for climate change, but there is one that would be more effective than others. What do you think it is?But supporters note that if the White House hopes to cut tax rates without raising the deficit, it will need to find new, taxable economic activity. So optimistic are Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Schatz about winning bipartisan support that they unveiled their bill at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. (A representative was quick to note, though, that hosting the carbon tax debate was not an endorsement of the policy.)Mr. Whitehouse insisted the Republican votes are there. They are just, for now, hiding, he said.\u201cThere are Republicans willing to work with us, and not just a few,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just need the prospect of safe passage through the political kill zone.\u201dAfter the Senate\u2019s failure to pass health care legislation, pundits note that both Congress and Mr. Trump need a win.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

Just look at all those smartphones, constantly buzzing with news alerts and calendar notifications as we tell the virtual assistant to find us Google Maps directions to the new rice-bowl place. What would Ullman think of all this? We can now find out, as she\u2019s written a new book, \u201cLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology,\u201d which manages to feel like both a prequel and a sequel to her first book.Don\u2019t panic, non-nerds. In addition to writing code in multiple computer languages, Ullman has an Ivy League degree in English and knows how to decode her tech-world adventures into accessible narratives for word people: \u201cTime went on; I graduated from Cornell and moved to San Francisco, where, one day in 1979, I walked past a Radio Shack store on Market Street and saw in the window a microcomputer called the TRS-80. Reader, I bought it.\u201dHer work as an active programmer spanned about 20 years, ending in the 1990s, but some experiences stay with you forever. \u201cThe role they assigned to me, translator, is perhaps the most accurate description of everything I have ever done concerning technology,\u201d she writes of one gig. As I\u2019ve found in my own scribbling about tech, language skills and accurate translation are essential to understanding in both human and computer systems. The most useful bit of prep I had for that came from the two years of Attic Greek I once took to fulfill a curriculum requirement for a theater degree. Converting text into plain language for the inquiring masses is vital, whether it be wrestling Xenophon\u2019s \u201cAnabasis\u201d or Linux engineer notes into English.The first three-fifths of \u201cLife in Code\u201d is primarily composed of essays published elsewhere between 1994 and 2004, while newer material from 2012 to early 2017 fills out the rest. The technology mentioned within those early chapters often recalls quaint discovery, like finding a chunky, clunky Nokia cellphone in the back of the junk drawer. The piece on preparing computers for the Year 2000 has a musty time-capsule feel, but the philosophical questions posed in other chapters \u2014 like those on robotics and artificial intelligence \u2014 still resonate.While the electrified economy had yet to complete its first dramatic cycle of boom and bust when her first book came out, a 1998 essay in \u201cLife in Code\u201d shows Ullman, Cassandra-like and ever the pragmatic pessimist, already bracing for the coming storm. \u201cI fear for the world the internet is creating,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBefore the advent of the Web, if you wanted to sustain a belief in far-fetched ideas, you had to go out into the desert, or live on a compound in the mountains, or move from one badly furnished room to another in a series of safe houses.\u201d These days, she\u2019s still concerned about the damage the internet is doing to culture, privacy and civility. What hasn\u2019t changed in the past 20 years is the dominant demographic of the technology industry and its overall lack of diversity. Ullman addresses these topics in the latter part of the book, as she observes online classes for newer programming languages like Python and feels put off by the \u201cunderlying assumption of male, white, geeky American culture\u201d with science fiction TV shows woven into the course material. She worries that this approach may alienate people who aren\u2019t familiar with it, and imagines a time when the general public is writing their own code for the world they need. \u201cWhat I hope is that those with the knowledge of the humanities break into the closed society where code gets written: invade it,\u201d Ullman writes. But, she warns, be prepared for an environment of \u201cboyish men who bristle at the idea of anyone unlike them invading their territory.\u201dShe has many stories of her own to share on the topic of gender relations in the office and points out that not all of them were bad. In one case, she tolerates frequent comments about her hair from one addled man in order to learn more about various aspects of computing from him. \u201cI did have pretty hair; I went on to become a software engineer.\u201dJ.

{"Headline": "Seeing Hope for Flagging Economy, West Virginia Revamps Vocational Track", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 In a sleek laboratory at Marshall University last month, four high school teachers hunched over a miniature steam-electric boiler, a tabletop replica of the gigantic machinery found in power plants.They hooked the boiler to a small, whirring generator and tinkered with valves and knobs, looking for the most efficient way to turn coal, natural gas, nuclear or solar energy into electricity.The teachers, who were attending a summer training program, are helping West Virginia in another kind of transformation. Long one of the poorest states, it is now leading the way in turning vocational education from a Plan B for underachieving students into what policy makers hope will be a fuel source for the state\u2019s economic revival.Simulated workplaces, overseen by teachers newly trained in important state industries like health, coal and even fracking, are now operating in schools across the state. Students punch a time clock, are assigned professional roles like foreman or safety supervisor, and are even offered several vacation days of their choice in addition to regular school breaks. (Many take time off during deer hunting season.)Traditional math and English teachers have been reassigned to technical high schools, to make sure students on the vocational track still gain reading, writing and math skills.And this fall, students enrolled in simulated workplaces will need to participate in one of the program\u2019s boldest elements: random drug testing.Given the extent of the state\u2019s opioid crisis, employers \u201cwouldn\u2019t take anything we were doing seriously until we passed that hurdle,\u201d said Barry Crist, principal of the Fayette Institute of Technology in Oak Hill.Democrats, too, are talking about vocational training. The agenda they introduced in July, \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d speaks of increasing support for \u201ctechnical education that leads to a good job.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s budget calls for $166 million in cuts, a 15 percent reduction, in Perkins Act grants to the states, the government\u2019s main funding stream for technical education in high school and college. The House passed a bipartisan reauthorization of the Perkins program in June, but the bill has not moved forward in the Senate. Even if it passes, the legislation will represent a tweak to the program, not a substantial new commitment of the type Mr. Trump and Democrats have touted.\u201cWe are so focused on academic routes as opposed to other routes that can be high quality,\u201d said Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills at New America and a former official at the Education and Labor Departments. \u201cThere\u2019s a desperate need.\u201dBut in few other states have the changes in vocational education \u2014 now rebranded as \u201ccareer and technical education\u201d \u2014 been as dramatic. Thirty-seven percent of West Virginia high school seniors completed a technical course of study in 2016, up from 18 percent in 2010.Many are now in simulated workplaces where they learn to work with stethoscopes, welding torches and drafting tables as well as more sophisticated technology.In his classroom, Dillon said, music plays and students are permitted breaks throughout the day, like employees at a real work site. He and his classmates have designed and produced objects like saltshakers and fidget spinners, the faddish hand-held toys.\u201cIt\u2019s a great experience,\u201d Dillon said, because \u201cyou\u2019re treated like an adult.\u201dRachel Peal, who graduated this spring from the pre-engineering simulated workplace program at the Fayette Institute, said the protocol kicked up little protest among her peers. They are well aware that opioid users can\u2019t get or hold down jobs, she said.\u201cA lot of kids and their families saw the struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic here.\u201dRon Foster, president of Foster Supply Inc., an 80-employee construction and fabrication firm, has hired eight graduates of the state\u2019s high school simulated workplace program over the past two years. They can earn as much as $15 per hour doing jobs such as welding and machinery repair.Compared with previous hires, this group is more punctual and focused on building a career, Mr. Foster said. \u201cIf you\u2019re dedicated enough to go through that program, you\u2019re more apt to do a good, quality job,\u201d he said.But far from being strictly a job training program for teenagers, classes like Advanced Career Energy and Power, the four-course sequence for which teachers were training at Marshall University, require math and physics instruction as rigorous as in the College Board\u2019s Advanced Placement track. Of the four teachers tinkering with the miniature boiler, three came from traditional math and science departments.The hope is to prepare students for higher-skilled work. In the fracking industry, for example, they might qualify for jobs in equipment maintenance or environmental compliance instead of laying pipeline, an entry-level and sometimes dangerous job.About half of the state\u2019s technical-track graduates go on to two- or four-year colleges. Dillon Brasse, for example, is now planning to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering or architecture.\u201cThere\u2019s so much technical information that\u2019s needed today,\u201d said Jeri Matheney, communications director for Appalachian Power, which runs coal, natural gas and hydropower plants in West Virginia. \u201cWhere we counted on just on-the-job training 50 years ago, that has changed.\u201dThe classes mimic the workplace in another way, one perhaps not intended. According to federal data from the 2015-16 school year, 90 percent of West Virginia high school technical students concentrating in science fields were male, while 89 percent of those concentrating in health fields were female.Still, West Virginia educators and policy makers are believers in the \u201cskills gap\u201d hypothesis.Adjusted for inflation, West Virginia\u2019s funding through the Perkins Act has been flat since the program\u2019s inception in 1984, according to the state. Asked about the president\u2019s proposed cuts to Perkins, Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Education, said innovation in career and technical education would continue locally through \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d between schools and industry.Ms. D\u2019Antoni said she appreciated the attention Mr. Trump had given to vocational education. But, she said, \u201cI want to see the action.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article described Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory margin in West Virginia incorrectly. While Mr. Trump won his highest percentage of the vote in West Virginia, the state did not give him his greatest victory margin. (That was Wyoming.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Eyes China Sanctions While Seeking Its Help on North Korea", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In a diplomatic gamble, President Trump is seeking to enlist China as a peacemaker in the bristling nuclear-edged dispute with North Korea at the very moment he plans to ratchet up conflict with Beijing over trade issues that have animated his political rise.Mr. Trump spoke late Friday with his counterpart, President Xi Jinping of China, to press the Chinese to do more to rein in North Korea as it races toward development of long-range nuclear weapons that could reach the United States. Mr. Xi sought to lower the temperature after Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea, urging restraint and a political solution.But the conversation came as Mr. Trump\u2019s administration was preparing new trade action against China that could inflame the relationship. Mr. Trump plans to return to Washington on Monday to sign a memo determining whether China should be investigated for intellectual property violations, accusing Beijing of failing to curb the theft of trade secrets and rampant online and physical piracy and counterfeiting. An investigation would be intended to lead to retaliatory measures.The White House had planned to take action on intellectual property earlier but held off as it successfully lobbied China to vote at the United Nations Security Council for additional sanctions on North Korea a week ago. Even now, the extra step of determining whether to start the investigation is less than trade hawks might have wanted, but softens the blow to China and gives Mr. Trump a cudgel to hold over it if he does not get the cooperation he wants.While past presidents have tried at least ostensibly to keep security and economic issues on separate tracks in their dealings with China, Mr. Trump has explicitly linked the two, suggesting he would back off from a trade war against Beijing if it does more to pressure North Korea. \u201cIf China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday.Mr. Trump has sought to leverage trade and North Korea with China for months, initially expressing optimism after hosting Mr. Xi at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, only to later grow discouraged that Beijing was not following through. The effort has now reached a decisive point with the overt threats of American military action against North Korea \u2014 warnings clearly meant for Beijing\u2019s ears.China is widely seen as critical to any resolution to the nuclear crisis because of its outsize role as North Korea\u2019s main economic benefactor. China accounts for as much as 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s total trade and supplies most of its food and energy while serving as the primary purchaser of its minerals, seafood and garments.But even though the effectiveness of the new United Nations sanctions depends largely on China\u2019s willingness to enforce them, the Trump administration so far has failed to come up with enough incentives to compel China to do so, analysts said.In their phone conversation on Friday night, Mr. Xi stressed that it was \u201cvery important\u201d for the two leaders to maintain contact to find \u201can appropriate solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d according to a statement carried in the Chinese state-run media. The language indicated China wants to push forward with a diplomatic proposal for North Korea that the Trump administration has brushed aside.The Chinese statement urged the \u201crelevant sides\u201d \u2014 a reference to North Korea and the United States \u2014 to \u201cavoid words and actions that exacerbate tensions.\u201d It did not explicitly criticize North Korea, which issued its own searing rhetoric all week, including a threat against Guam, and did not draw a clear distinction between Washington and Pyongyang.In its own account of the call, the White House emphasized points of concurrence. \u201cPresident Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior,\u201d read a statement from the White House issued early Saturday morning. \u201cThe presidents also reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201dIf Mr. Trump was trying to move Mr. Xi toward bolder action against the North, he did so while the Chinese leader is preoccupied with his own domestic political machinations, attending to a once-every-five-year political shake-up in the top ranks of the Communist Party.Mr. Xi is believed to be at the beach resort at Beidaihe on the coast east of Beijing, where the leadership conducts a secretive retreat every summer, sometimes emerging casually dressed in open neck shirts and Windbreakers for photographs on the strip of sand along the beachfront.The final stages of the political process to win Mr. Xi\u2019s favor for a place on the standing committee of the party, now a seven-member body that makes the final decisions on the nation\u2019s affairs, is underway among the resort\u2019s villas and hotels, China\u2019s political analysts said.The selection will be unveiled at a national congress in Beijing sometime between September and November. Until then, almost all other matters, including foreign policy, are put on hold, the analysts said.Still, the leadership has been vexed that the Trump administration has paid scant attention to China\u2019s proposal for a \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d solution to North Korea. Described many times by China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, the notion calls for North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program at current levels in exchange for the United States drawing down military exercises off the Korean Peninsula.So far, the United States has dismissed the proposal as a nonstarter. Instead, to China\u2019s irritation, the United States is looking to increase missile defenses in South Korea. In some respects, though, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has tried to please Beijing by pledging that Washington does not seek to overthrow the North Korean leader, and does not plan to send American troops north of the 38th parallel that divides North and South Korea.Mr. Xi is said to be exasperated with Kim Jong-un, a leader much his junior, whom he openly disparaged during his meetings in Florida in April with Mr. Trump, American officials say. But despite the frustration with Mr. Kim, China still prefers to have what it considers a relatively stable North Korea under Mr. Kim rather than a collapsed state that could result in a united Korean Peninsula on its border, with American troops in control.In rebuffing the \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d proposal, Washington has raised suspicions in Beijing about its true intentions, said Yun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center in Washington. Chinese leaders believe the United States sees its true rival as China, a mammoth economy, and not North Korea, one of the poorest countries on earth, Ms. Sun said. In this estimation, Washington is merely using North Korea to mount a military containment strategy around China, she said.\u201cThe Chinese operate from the conviction that China remains and will always be the No. 1 strategic threat to the U.S., so the issue of North Korea will be used against China \u2014 through sanctions, provocations and everything else,\u201d she said. China was also annoyed, Ms. Sun said, that the United States refuses to discuss a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d or \u201cend game\u201d on the future of the Korean Peninsula. Of most interest to China, she said, is the future disposition of American forces in South Korea, now standing at 28,500 troops.The phone conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi will be followed by a visit from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who is expected in Beijing on Monday. General Dunford will also visit South Korea and Japan.The general\u2019s visit, planned earlier this summer, is the first by a senior American official to Beijing since Mr. Tillerson met with Mr. Xi in March.Much of the diplomacy between China and the United States has been conducted between Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the Chinese ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai. Those talks have concentrated on Mr. Cui\u2019s efforts to stave off punishing trade tariffs against China that are gathering momentum in White House discussions.During his two-day visit, General Dunford is likely to use the opportunity to drive home arguments for the Chinese to put more pressure on the Kim government, said Brian McKeon, who was a senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration.A major point of dispute will likely be American plans to deploy more missile defenses in South Korea, he said. China vehemently opposes the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, that has already been deployed in South Korea, calling it a threat to its own security.\u201cI would expect that Dunford will make the usual request that they put more pressure on the regime to behave, and to recognize that Kim\u2019s actions threatens our core interests, which means we will have to continue to take measures that Beijing doesn\u2019t like, for example the deployment of Thaad,\u201d Mr. McKeon said.Jane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Peter Baker from Bridgewater, N.J.

Valenciano revoked all permits that had been granted to Hawaii Dairy Farms and ordered it to complete an environmental assessment before going further.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from an economy here that grew sugar cane and pineapples and had a large agricultural industry to one based largely on tourism and real estate development,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said. \u201cAll these interests are competing for the same resources and opportunities, and if we\u2019re not careful, agriculture is going to lose out and Hawaii will be without a safety net \u2014 not being able to grow our own food is a significant issue.\u201dResidents point out that one drinking-water well supplying the neighborhoods of Poipu and Koloa is within 700 feet of the pastures where the cows will graze, and other wells are within 1,200 feet.The dairy\u2019s representatives contend that the soil at the site can absorb and filter the manure runoff from 699 milk cows.The chosen number of cows is significant: If Hawaii Dairy\u2019s plans included one more cow \u2014 bumping the total to 700 \u2014 it would meet the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s definition of a \u201clarge concentrated animal feeding operation,\u201d or CAFO.That designation initiates the need for a permit under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Because the dairy drew the line at 699 cows, avoiding the need for the discharge permit, it originally was able to describe itself as \u201czero discharge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be zero discharge from the E.P.A.\u2019s perspective,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said. \u201cThere will be very little discharge, but I think it was a little confusing for some people in the community, so we\u2019ve stopped saying that,\u201d she said.The dairy plans to eventually have 2,000 cows on the property.Given Hawaii\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley, it is little surprise that the islands have attracted many of America\u2019s new billionaires. Like everyone else, they appreciate the state\u2019s natural beauty. And they appreciate its generally laid-back approach to fame and fortune.Plus, it is easier to move around by boat and helicopter \u2014 avoiding paparazzi stakeouts. Marc Benioff, Paul Allen and Michael Dell, whose 18,500-square-foot hideaway there is known as the Raptor Residence, have homes here.While his improvements have driven up rents, displacing some residents \u2014 only about 3,200 people live there full time \u2014 Mr. Ellison has also paid for a new water filtration system for the island, a public pool and a movie theater.The suits touched on a particularly sensitive issue for native Hawaiians having to do with land that traditionally belonged to Hawaii\u2019s kings. Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan said in a letter printed in the local newspaper that they had been unaware of some of the issues involving such parcels and pledged to learn more.The Omidyars have lived in Honolulu more or less full time since the mid-2000s, and it is not the eBay billionaire\u2019s first run-in with the Kauai community. He previously planned to open a resort on the island\u2019s north shore on a property that was home to a Club Med. But he had to give up after about a tenth of the island\u2019s population signed a petition against the project, claiming its impact on the environment would be detrimental.He lived in Hawaii for two years when he was a teenager, and his wife, Pam, attended \u2019Iolani School in Honolulu. Today, he tends to keep a low profile. The couple has a private security staff that includes former Secret Service and State Department officers, and they keep a private plane at the ready at Honolulu Airport, which Mr. Omidyar has said is so that the family can escape a disaster quickly.He has also devoted $250 million to building a media business that includes online publications like The Intercept and Civil Beat, based in Honolulu, which tend to keep a weather eye on government and its secrets.Hawaii has at least three commercial dairies already \u2014 and making money is \u201can uphill battle,\u201d said Steve Whitesides, the owner of one of them, Big Island Dairy. Permits are hard to get, expenses are high and he has had to import more feed than he expected, he said. Mr. Whitesides, an Idaho-based dairy farmer, bought Big Island Dairy in 2012, when it was flirting with bankruptcy.Last September, heavy rains led to flooding in O\u2019okala, and some residents found themselves up to their ankles in wastewater carried down the mountain. They posted videos to YouTube documenting the experience and wrote letters to state officials. \u201cOlder people have told me they have a hard time eating dinner because of the smell, and homeowners have gotten E. coli and staph infections,\u201d said Valerie Poindexter, who represents the neighborhood on the Hawai\u2019i County Council.Mr. Whitesides said Big Island Dairy was built to \u201cproper specs\u201d and that he had continued to invest in its infrastructure to improve it. He said he did not believe manure was escaping from the two effluent ponds on the property, or the milking building. But the dairy does have some animals in pastures, he said, \u201cAnd that manure has to go somewhere.\u201dTo avoid any problems like that at Mr. Omidyar\u2019s dairy, Ms. Hennessey said, Hawaii Dairy will establish 35-foot setbacks, planted with dense vegetation, along a stream that runs through the property to prevent contamination of the waterway running through the property to the sea. The company also plans to introduce dung beetles to the property, Hawaii Dairy said, to help process manure.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Lanai. At least two of the Hawaiian archipelago\u2019s eight main islands \u2014 Niihau and Kahoolawe \u2014 are smaller, along with many other islands and atolls in the chain; it is not the smallest Hawaiian island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Republican Tax Bill Be Aimed at the Economic Past, or the Future?", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewCongress and the Trump administration are said to be hard at work creating a tax bill, aiming for a signature economic policy achievement in the months ahead. As they do so, there is a fundamental tension they will have to resolve: Is this tax legislation about the past, or about the future?The bill\u2019s writers face a series of choices over whether to shovel more money into the pockets of individuals and businesses based on choices they have already made, or to change tax laws that shape economic incentives in the years ahead. In at least a few areas, politics favors the past while theory favors the future.One example of this is a debate over whether a tax cut will be retroactive. Suppose that a bill passes in November or December cutting individual income tax rates. Should the lower taxes apply to income earned in 2017, or only to that earned in 2018 and beyond?It\u2019s easy to see why the smart thing politically would be to apply the lower rates to 2017; more money would show up in taxpayers\u2019 refund checks in the spring of 2018, ahead of the midterm elections. When the George W. Bush administration passed tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, it took that approach.But it also defies the economic theory about why tax cuts might be advantageous for the economy. The entire conservative philosophy behind lowering taxes is that when the government takes less, it encourages people to invest more and work harder, increasing the nation\u2019s economic potential.There is a continuing debate over how powerful those effects really are, yet it at least is a coherent theory of how tax cuts can generate economic growth. If a retroactive tax cut passes in November, however, no one can go back in time to January and suddenly put in more hours or invest more.It might make sense to have a retroactive tax cut if we were in the middle of a recession, because putting some money immediately in taxpayers\u2019 pockets could help spur growth. But right now the economy is humming along with a 4.3 percent unemployment rate, a record high stock market and no recession in sight.On the corporate side of the tax ledger, similar questions arise. Among them: whether, and how, to incentivize American companies to bring home the trillions of dollars in accumulated profits that they have kept parked overseas to avoid the 35 percent federal tax they would have to pay by repatriating the money.Depending on how it is structured, that could amount to a one-time boon for companies with large overseas profits, essentially rewarding past success rather than providing the incentives to invest in future growth.\u201cWith repatriation at a lower rate, you\u2019re not only providing a tax cut for choices that have already happened, but you\u2019re rewarding choices that involved heavy tax avoidance and gaming of the tax system,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a law professor at New York University. \u201cA lot of the reason so much money is socked away overseas is because of the ability of large multinationals to shift income on paper, so you\u2019re kind of rewarding bad behavior.\u201dBut the most interesting area of tension between changes that reward old behavior versus future behavior comes in how the corporate tax code handles capital investments by businesses.Consider a company that spends $1 million on a piece of equipment expected to last 20 years. Currently, it can deduct the cost of investment spending gradually: in $50,000 annual chunks over two decades, unless covered by exceptions for certain equipment or for smaller businesses.One idea, embraced by Republicans in the House but not those in the Senate, would be to allow companies to fully deduct capital expenses in the year they are incurred. Suddenly that company that spends $1 million on a piece of equipment could deduct the full million in the first year.But this would be costly in terms of lost revenue to the Treasury, to the tune of a couple of trillion dollars over the next decade. And some people would rather that kind of money go toward reducing the corporate tax rate.That pits two types of companies against each other. For those expecting to make large capital investments in the future, full expensing could be a boon. The ones that made big capital investments in the past and are now harvesting the profits have nothing to gain from full expensing but would win big if the corporate tax rate is cut.Enthusiasts for full expensing, by contrast, argue that giving more favorable treatment to capital spending can help companies that are in growth mode and encourage the kind of investments that create more jobs. That is doubly significant in an era of relatively low capital spending and weak advances in labor productivity.Think of a trucking company, says Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation. With the ability to fully expense capital investments upfront, a firm that buys more trucks \u2014 creating more jobs for both truck drivers and the manufacturing workers who build the truck \u2014 benefits. By contrast, if you just cut the tax rate, \u201ceven if a trucking company does not expand its fleet, it could still benefit from a lower corporate rate, because the profits from its existing fleet would be taxed less.\u201dThere is still a great deal unknown about what type of tax legislation Congress will take up, with negotiations between House and Senate tax-writers and the Trump administration taking place behind closed doors.But once it is revealed, the questions to ask aren\u2019t just whether it would benefit the rich or the middle class, or what it would mean for the deficit. Another big one is whether it is more about the economic future, or the economic past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump\u2019s Turmoil Slowing Economic Growth?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterAt the end of last month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for economic growth in the United States. Where the I.M.F. previously predicted the economy would grow at a rate of 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2.5 percent in 2018, it now expects 2.1 percent growth in both years.The reason? An uncertain and insufficiently expansionary economic environment linked to the chaos in Washington. Yes, the stock market has been strong and unemployment is down. But Donald Trump, friend of business, may be costing us growth, a key indicator of economic health.The I.M.F. forecast is a reminder that ill-advised policy isn\u2019t the only way politics can interfere with growth. Instability can also slow things down.Macroeconomists have long pondered how growth might be affected by features of the political system. Mostly an issue \u2014 until now \u2014 in the developing world, instability is thought to hinder growth by generating uncertainty that scares off investors and makes firms risk-averse. Instability also gives politicians a short-term view of things: If they can\u2019t be sure they or their parties will be involved in governance in the future, they won\u2019t commit to economic policies with long-term yield.In a 1992 paper, the economist Alberto Alesina and colleagues tested these suppositions by looking at data on 113 countries from 1950 to 1982. A challenge in estimating the effect of instability on economic growth is that causality may run in the opposite direction: Low growth, and the accompanying sense of economic malaise, can lead to political disruption, rather than vice versa. After addressing this problem statistically, the researchers discovered that growth does tend to be slower when nations are politically unstable \u2014 when governments verge on collapse or pinball from one ideological extreme to another.More recently, the economists Ari Aisen and Francisco Jos\u00e9 Veiga examined 169 countries from 1960 to 2004. They gauged political instability by how often a new head of government was installed or more than half of the cabinet was changed out (or both). The greater the frequency of these changes, they found, the less overall investment there tended to be in physical capital like factories, and the lower the rate of growth.The United States isn\u2019t an unstable Third World republic. But with a White House plagued by remarkably high staff turnover, and with constitutional crises lurking around every corner, the country and economy aren\u2019t exuding predictability either. If you were a judicious chief executive, you might be more restrained in pushing to expand amid the political turmoil, whatever the administration\u2019s interest in cutting regulatory red tape and slashing corporate taxes.If the United States achieves the growth rate now projected by the I.M.F., it won\u2019t be terrible. But it won\u2019t be anything like the productivity spurts that policy makers and the public grew accustomed to in the second half of the 20th century. A vigorous, expanding economy meant jobs, reliably filled tax coffers, real recovery from downturns and continual improvement in the quality of life. Today, more modest growth rates have become the new normal.There are several schools of economic thought on why growth has been in the doldrums \u2014 but unfortunately, few offer solutions that are viable in an atmosphere of political instability.Mr. Summers points out that it costs a lot less to start a company in the internet age than when the only way to make money was through manufacturing. So there\u2019s less investment demand.With a nod to the New Deal economist Alvin Hansen, who wrote about the relationship between population size and interest rates, Mr. Summers notes as well that population growth in Europe and the United States has steeply declined. Without new workers and consumers coming onto the rolls, there\u2019s an upper limit to domestic profit-making opportunities.Mr. Summers believes there\u2019s a way out of the low-growth trap. He argues for a major debt-financed infrastructure spending program, coupled with tax reform, policies to address rising inequality (since when income gains go almost entirely to those at the top, it\u2019s hard to get a broad-based rise in consumer demand) and efforts to counter protectionist trade practices.The thing is, nothing like what he proposes will be possible so long as we have a president whose inflammatory language, egregious actions and administrative incompetence continue to alienate voters and members of Congress. President Trump campaigned for infrastructure spending, but at this point neither Democrats or Republicans are likely to get completely on board. As for the other pro-growth suggestions, the president and his cabinet of billionaires couldn\u2019t care less about inequality and seem to be gunning for a trade war with China. And it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether Mr. Trump has the discipline to negotiate corporate tax reform.The bottom line is that while Wall Street is happy for the moment, the United States economy isn\u2019t reaching its full potential. A tumultuous Trump administration will have a hard time getting us there.Neil Gross is a professor of sociology at Colby College.Advertisement"}

But Working Hard Is a Skill.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe man who said that never met Manuel Chaidez.Manuel was just 16 when he made it from Sonora, Mexico, to the F-Bar, my family\u2019s ranch outside the town of Snowflake, in Northern Arizona. I was just a kid, no more than 6 or so, and to me Manuel looked like a full-grown man. He wasn\u2019t much more than a kid himself, of course, but he worked as if his family depended on him. They probably did. He couldn\u2019t have worked harder if the ranch were his own.In terms of material possessions, Manuel was an invisible man. His capacity for hard, backbreaking work was his sole credential in life. By no Washington bureaucrat\u2019s estimation would he have been judged a \u201chigh-value immigrant.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak much English. He didn\u2019t come from money. He hadn\u2019t finished high school. He had no technological innovation to his credit, nor had he started a business.In other words, count Manuel among the 99 percent of immigrants who have ever come to this country, including many of our ancestors, the \u201cwretched refuse\u201d who got here as fast as they could and who made this country what it is once they arrived.All Manuel had to recommend him was his strength and his belief that America was a place where, by the labor of your hands, you could create a life for yourself. That is all, and that is everything. My dad would occasionally hire some of my high school buddies. The work was so hard that they often washed out after a day or two. Not Manuel.History doesn\u2019t much record the unglamorous and often excruciating work of moving sprinkler pipe, digging ditch, chopping hay or keeping a broken-down feed truck running for just one more year. Manuel did all of that, and so much more (including, one lonely summer, giving me relationship advice as we fixed a tractor on the edge of an alfalfa field). Without such work there is no ranch. Without ranches, my town and towns like it falter. And so in my estimation, Manuel is just about the highest-value immigrant possible, and if we forget that, then we forget something elemental about America.It is Manuel\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that puts him in the company of so many of the men, women and children from all over the world who, since the beginning of the American experiment, left behind everyone and everything they knew to come to a place they had seen only in their dreams, in the desperate hope of building a life for themselves \u2014 and if not for themselves, then for their children. By working by their side, I came to know that these Americans by choice are some of the most inspiring Americans of all.Just as my family members bear the aches and pains of a lifetime of work on the F-Bar, so, too, does Manuel. All told, he devoted 24 years of his life to the ranch. Those first years were interrupted more than a dozen times, when Manuel was picked up and returned to Mexico by the Border Patrol. Each time, he made his way back.Manuel would marry in the late 1970s and obtain a green card, which awarded him permanent resident status. He and his wife, Frances, would ultimately raise seven kids \u2014 three boys and four girls, one of whom was adopted. All the Chaidez kids are contributing members of American society.A few weeks ago, as I stood with my mother and 10 siblings at my father\u2019s funeral to say our final goodbyes, there stood Manuel, cowboy hat in hand. \u201cMi hijo,\u201d he said as he approached me \u2014 \u201cmy son.\u201dAmerica would be a lesser country without Manuel Chaidez, and so many like him.Jeff Flake, a Republican senator from Arizona, is the author of \u201cConscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Looks to Australia in Overhauling Immigration System", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe BreakdownThe plan Mr. Trump supports seeks to reduce immigration by curbing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. As Mr. Trump told Congress earlier this year, \u201cIt is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.\u201dThat approach \u2014 making sure new immigrants are not a burden on the country\u2019s safety net and are able to prosper financially \u2014 is at the core of Australia\u2019s immigration laws.Australia takes in more immigrants relative to its population than the United States. The country has two distinct systems: a points-based system, which favors people based on their English proficiency and the skills they have to fill needed jobs, and an employer-nomination system, which allows businesses to sponsor people for jobs.A White House official said on Wednesday that it had looked at both the Australian and Canadian immigration systems and \u201cadded things that made sense for America.\u201d\u201cOne of the things I think is the most compelling about the Australian system is the efforts to make sure that immigrants are financially self-sufficient,\u201d Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, said in discussing the plan with reporters Wednesday.Under the plan proposed by Republican senators, applicants for legal residency in the United States would be judged on the basis of education, language and job abilities, favoring those who can speak English. They would be able to financially support themselves and have skills that contribute to the economy. Currently, most legal immigrants are admitted to the United States based on family ties to those already in the country.\u201cWe are establishing a new entry system that\u2019s points-based,\u201d Mr. Miller said in explaining the Trump administration\u2019s approach. \u201cCan they support themselves and their families financially? Do they have a skill that will add to the U.S. economy? Are they being paid a high wage?\u201dUnder the Australian system, applicants get the most points \u2014 up to 60 \u2014 for having skills in needed areas, and fewer points \u2014 up to 20 \u2014 for fluency in English. They are also awarded points for their age group, with the 25-to-32 age range being most desirable, and older people being less so. Applicants get up to 20 points for having a doctorate from an Australian educational institution or its equivalent.While the program seeks to attract immigrants to fill occupations in areas where needed skills are in short supply, some experts believe the approach has been largely ineffective.\u201cAustralia has this image internationally that our points-tested skill program is delivering a high quality, skilled work force,\u201d said Bob Birrell, president of the Australian Population Research Institute. \u201cI think that\u2019s a myth. Our points-selected skilled migration program is full of holes.\u201dRather than favor people from overseas who have significant work experience and skills considered important in Australia, the points system has been watered down to favor foreigners who have recently graduated from Australian universities, Mr. Birrell said.\u201cThere\u2019s no assessment as to whether the skills that the applicant possesses are actually in demand here,\u201d Mr. Birrell continued.The program has also been criticized as overly complex in its skills criteria and as inherently favoring white applicants because of its language and educational requirements.Like the United States, Australia has been very welcoming of immigrants, with roughly 27 percent of its population foreign-born, coming from more than 200 countries. It formalized the points-based system in 1989 and has updated it several times, most recently in 2011.\u201cSome suggest a points test is a crude measure that does not account for \u2018soft\u2019 attributes desired by employers such as communications skills, the ability to learn on the job, or resilience,\u201d he wrote, adding that the system may not be nimble enough to adjust to the country\u2019s employment needs.\u201cThis raises questions as to the government\u2019s ability to accurately project shortages in the labor market, leading to underemployment or over-employment in some areas,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It\u2019s Very Easy to Die There\u2019: How Prisoners Fare in Vietnam", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Do Thi Mai said she was shocked to learn that her 17-year-old son, Do Dang Du, had fallen into a coma in prison a few weeks after he was arrested, accused by the police of stealing about $90.The police initially said that Mr. Du\u2019s severe head and leg wounds had been caused by falls in the bathroom, according to a family lawyer. \u201cHe was unconscious, so I couldn\u2019t ask him,\u201d Ms. Mai said.Nearly two years later, Ms. Mai is still searching for closure. \u201cTwo months before he died, he was healthy,\u201d she said during an emotional interview at home on the rural fringe of Vietnam\u2019s capital, Hanoi. \u201cHow did he turn out like this?\u201dA recent government report on Vietnam\u2019s prison system \u2014 which was posted on an official website a few months ago, possibly by accident, according to rights activists \u2014 appears to confirm many of the activists\u2019 worst fears.Another section, referring to the period from 2011 to 2016, said 261,840 inmates had received vocational training, a term that rights activists say essentially means forced labor. In addition, the report said, the remains or ashes of 2,812 prisoners were approved for collection by family members, suggesting a high rate of deaths in custody for a prison population that the government says numbers less than 150,000.The statistics \u201cgive us reason to doubt that governance is becoming less authoritarian and violent as Vietnam transitions to a market economy,\u201d said Benjamin Swanton, a longtime social justice advocate and development consultant in Vietnam.Vietnam\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to emailed questions about conditions in Vietnamese prisons.The result, policy experts and rights advocates say, is a court system where arrests almost always lead to convictions and a prison system where human rights are an afterthought. Corruption, impunity and violence in prisons are mostly tolerated, these advocates say, because the system serves the party\u2019s interests by silencing dissidents and enriching prison guards.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to die there,\u201d said Doan Trang, an independent journalist in Hanoi who has written extensively about state-led repression in the country.The recent government report presented prison statistics as part of a long-term process of changes in line with global trends. It noted, for example, that the number of crimes punishable by death in Vietnam had fallen to 22 in 2009 from 45 in 1993.The report also said, however, that the number of people on death row in Vietnam had climbed to 681 last year from 336 in 2011, and that the government planned to build five new execution centers to accommodate demand.The global trend is a reduction in the use of the death penalty, said Janice Beanland, a campaigner at Amnesty International. \u201cThis is why it\u2019s a bit shocking to us to learn that, in actual fact, Vietnam has been executing people more regularly than we believed,\u201d she said.The government report said that Vietnam had improved vocational education in prisons and that inmates received training in tasks like sewing, construction, carpentry, mechanics, farming and the processing of agricultural products.But former prisoners and human rights groups say that such labor is usually not voluntary, and that the cashews, garments and other products are exported from prison workshops for a profit.Doan Huy Chuong, a labor rights activist who was released in February after a seven-year prison term, said it was common for prisoners to rise at 6 a.m. and do manual labor, without pay, until anywhere from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.Prisoners with money can bribe their way into hospitals if they fall ill, he said. \u201cWithout money, if they have a fever, they still have to work,\u201d he added.Rights advocates said they were especially worried about the government report\u2019s claim that the remains and ashes of 2,812 prisoners were approved for collection by family members.\u201cDo I think they start out with the idea of beating someone to death? No,\u201d said Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cBut do I think that there\u2019s no accountability or controls in the system? Yes. And that\u2019s the fundamental problem.\u201dIn the case of Mr. Du, the teenager who died in custody in 2015, police investigators said for months afterward that his head injury \u2014 an inchwide gash \u2014 had been caused when his cellmate kicked him on the top of his head, not by a fall in the shower as they initially said, according to Le Luan, one of the family\u2019s lawyers.For example, he said, citing an X-ray he provided to The New York Times, the wound was on Mr. Du\u2019s forehead, not the top of his head. It was also hard to imagine, he said, how Mr. Du\u2019s severe leg injuries could have been caused by falling onto a toilet in the bathroom, as the authorities claimed.The causes that the police described \u201ccould not have created such serious wounds,\u201d Mr. Luan said. \u201cThere must have been another incident.\u201dMembers of Mr. Du\u2019s extended family said in a separate interview that they were still not sure how he had died.The only certainty, they said, is that something about the official explanation does not add up.\u201cHe did something wrong,\u201d Mr. Du\u2019s grandfather Do Dinh Van said as he stood beside a makeshift altar that the family had created for the boy in their bare living room. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t deserve to die.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

While the civilized world was appalled at his remarks after the hate parade in Charlottesville, Va., a majority of Republicans approved of Trump\u2019s response. Approved.It\u2019s too easy to write all these people off as racists, for that\u2019s exactly what Bannon is counting on. Yes, there\u2019s a genuine hate-cohort in the Republican Party \u2014 neo-Nazis, or \u201cclowns and losers,\u201d in Bannon\u2019s terms \u2014 of about 10 percent, which is horrifyingly high.But there are many more voters in Trump\u2019s camp who still consider themselves Democrats. Some live in the much-discussed zone of despair, places where opportunities for people without a college degree are few, and the opioid epidemic rages. These folks are persuadable, if the message is economic hope \u2014 something that Obama understood, and Hillary Clinton never did.This doesn\u2019t mean that Democrats should not speak out when a cop kills someone for driving while black. Nor does it mean that Democrats should not join with progressive institutions \u2014 the military and forward-looking corporations among them \u2014 when Trump turns back the clock on transgender rights, or equal opportunity.But you can\u2019t bang just one drum. Trump has said demonstrably racist things many a time, from his birther obsession to his taco bowl tweet. He still won, \u201con a straightforward platform of economic nationalism,\u201d as Bannon noted.\u201cAs long as Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose,\u201d he said.So, even though Trump now threatens to shut down the government that he runs over his insane and unpopular border wall, even though he\u2019s told 1,000 verifiable lies since he\u2019s been in office, his horrid character will not be enough to help the forces of good.Democrats need to flip 24 House seats to get a majority. History is certainly on their side. When Harry Truman was at his nadir in 1946, Democrats lost 45 seats in the House. George W. Bush, with an approval rating about the same as Trump\u2019s current standing, saw his party shed 30 seats and the majority in 2006.I wouldn\u2019t trust that history. We\u2019re in a different universe \u2014 not end times, but truly awful times. Too many Americans have turned inward and dark. But they don\u2019t have to reside in that cave, if the Democrats can give them a reason to come out.The history I would trust is with Franklin Roosevelt, who rallied broken Americans during the Great Depression to an agenda in which government could lift people up.So far, Democrats have come up with a tepid slogan \u2014 a \u201cbetter deal\u201d \u2014 and a bushel of banalities. They need to go big, bold and simple, pounding home a single economic message: Trump is trying to make life worse for most Americans. Call him out for going after people\u2019s health care, for gutting protections for clean air and water, for killing studies on the health of miners in Appalachia.Democrats could grab the economic nationalism argument from Bannon, refine it along Bernie Sanders lines, and run with it. Health care for all is pro-American. Raising wages across the country is pro-worker. A moonshot infrastructure program would lift every community. And then, Trump will do his part, ranting in the gutter where he feels most at home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Obama-Trump Voters Are Real. Here\u2019s What They Think.", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySurvey SaysThe story of the 2016 presidential election is simple. Donald J. Trump made huge gains among white voters without a college degree. His gains were large enough to cancel out considerable losses among well-educated white voters and a decade of demographic shifts.But the study also supports the conclusion about the pivotal nature of the Obama-Trump vote.Mr. Milbank\u2019s choice to use nationwide figures obscures the degree of the defection of white working-class voters from the Democrats to Mr. Trump. That shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. After all, the national results would seem to make the 2016 election one of the least interesting in history. Hillary Clinton would be the president if the national tallies counted, and the shift from Mr. Obama\u2019s 51.9 percent of the two-party popular vote to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 51.1 percent was the smallest change in major party vote share since 1888.But the national vote doesn\u2019t count, and Mrs. Clinton is not the president. She lost primarily because of the narrow but deep swing among white working-class voters who were overrepresented in decisive battleground states.Just 74 percent of white Obama voters with a high school diploma or less backed Mrs. Clinton in the voter study group cited by Mr. Milbank.Similarly, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that Mrs. Clinton won just 78 percent of white Obama voters without a bachelor\u2019s degree. The figure was even lower in the key Rust Belt battlegrounds.A separate analysis from the voter study group found that many of these voters are Republicans whom the Democrats can\u2019t win back. That question \u2014 whether the Democrats can lure these Obama voters back \u2014 is the important one.The data from these surveys sends a mixed message. Strong evidence suggests a lot of these voters will lean Republican for the foreseeable future, and certainly will lean toward Mr. Trump. But Democrats can still win a meaningful and potentially decisive share of these voters, many of whom probably voted Democratic down-ballot in 2016.Here\u2019s what one survey, the C.C.E.S., says about these voters:Taken together, the data indicates that Mr. Trump had considerable and possibly unique appeal to an important slice of Democratic-leaning voters. Mr. Trump adopted a platform tailored to white working-class Democrats. In doing so, he neutralized many traditional Democratic lines of attack against typical Republicans like Mitt Romney. Many of these voters backed him in the primary and seemed to prefer his brand of populism, suggesting they probably would have backed Mr. Trump no matter which Democrat he faced.Similarly, the C.C.E.S. found that 45 percent of Obama-Trump voters identified as Republican-leaners in their postelection study.The voters who both voted for Mr. Trump and say they lean Republican have probably taken a big step toward becoming consistent Republican voters. They seem relatively difficult for Democrats to lure back.Yes, racial resentment is the strongest predictor of the Obama-Trump vote in this survey data. White, working-class Obama voters with racially conservative views were very likely to flip to the Republicans. For example, Mrs. Clinton won just 47 percent of white Obama voters without a college degree who disagreed with the idea that \u201cwhite people in the U.S. have certain advantages because of the color of their skin.\u201d In contrast, she retained 88 percent of white Obama voters without a college degree who agreed that white people have certain advantages.Nonetheless, voters with high racial resentment did not necessarily represent the preponderance of the Obama-Trump vote, because Mr. Obama had already lost nearly all such voters by 2012. To take the prior example: 49 percent of white, no-college Obama-Trump supporters at least somewhat disagreed with the notion that white people had certain advantages.Mrs. Duckworth\u2019s performance is probably the most telling. She won Illinois\u2019s 12th Congressional District \u2014 a downstate, working-class district now held by Republican Mike Bost \u2014 by nine points. Mr. Trump won it by 12 points.Mr. Bost might seem like a fairly safe Republican for re-election, if you judge the partisanship of his district strictly by his party\u2019s performance in the last presidential election. He certainly would be safe if Democrats wrote off Obama-Trump voters. But the willingness of these voters to support a Democrat for federal office against an incumbent Republican in a fairly decent year for Republicans suggests that at least these Obama-Trump voters remain in play, and Mr. Bost is more vulnerable than it might initially seem.More generally, there is reason to think these voters are likelier to vote for a Democrat against a more traditional Republican who hasn\u2019t developed a message to match Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to white working-class Democrats. These voters, for instance, tend to support abortion rights and same-sex marriage. They support a higher minimum wage.All considered, it does seem likely that at least a portion of the Obama-Trump vote can be lured back to the Democrats \u2014 especially against traditional Republican candidates who emphasize small government, free markets and social conservatism.Whether that means it should be the crux of the Democrats\u2019 path to power is another question. But it will most likely be a part of it, and will probably need to be for Democrats to secure parts of the Rust Belt that continue to play an outsize role in American elections.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rouhani 2.0 vs. the Hawks in Washington and Tehran", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The inauguration of Hassan Rouhani on Saturday as president of Iran for a second term may be a bittersweet moment for him.History suggests that Mr. Rouhani has reason for concern. All his predecessors over the past three decades suffered gradual obsolescence in their second terms. Without the option of a consecutive third term, they all followed the same script: an initial forceful push of their agenda, followed by a clash with the Iranian system\u2019s custodians and the frustration of becoming premature lame ducks.There is no reason to believe that the Trump administration will succeed where its six predecessors faltered. And in that sense Iran\u2019s rulers have little to worry about.Of greater concern are the American policies\u2019 unintended consequences. Escalation against Iran is bound to deepen the insecure country\u2019s siege mentality; rising tensions will feed Iran\u2019s militarism and militancy; and squeezing Iran will diminish Mr. Rouhani\u2019s maneuvering space.All of this will bolster the principlists \u2014 defeated time after time in local and national elections \u2014 and enable them to regain politically what they lost electorally. They could exploit the external threat as pretext to obstruct the government\u2019s agenda, hinder economic reintegration to preserve their own interests, label critics as foreign agents, and fuel apathy and dissatisfaction to ensure their rivals\u2019 defeat in the next elections. While the United States is incapable of empowering Iranian pragmatists, midwifing a principlist consolidation now would be a grave mistake.The biggest losers in all of this, of course, will be the Iranian people. They pursued utopia in 1979 and know full well the cost of revolutionary change. Since then, they have grasped at the highly imperfect electoral straws of Iran\u2019s constitutional theocracy, hoping for a gradual evolution toward a more open economy and pluralistic polity. Given a limited choice, they endorsed Mr. Rouhani\u2019s platform of diplomatic engagement with the West and banked that it would produce at least some modest improvements.There is a lesson in that for the Trump administration.Mr. Rouhani is not an ideal partner for Washington, and Iran under his helm would not pursue policies to America\u2019s liking. The United States can intelligently push back against aggressive Iranian behavior in the region, and it can legitimately insist on rigorous enforcement of the nuclear accord.But to escalate regional tensions, deepen sectarian rifts, undermine the nuclear agreement, pursue regime change and eschew all diplomatic engagement would be a hazardous affair. The Trump administration risks tilting Iran\u2019s internal dynamics in the wrong direction at a pivotal moment, once again bringing the country\u2019s democratic struggle to grief and breeding another generation of enemies.Ali Vaez is the senior Iran analyst for the International Crisis Group.Advertisement"}

He was 83.His death, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was caused by acute leukemia, his son Andrew said.A longtime public servant who worked at the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in addition to the Fed, Mr. Bradfield had a hand in important economic policy decisions over four decades.In the 1970s, he helped draft the legal justification for imposing import surcharges during the Nixon administration. In the 1980s, he helped resolve the debt crisis in Latin America and push through banking regulations. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he was one of the investigators who examined how Swiss banks had handled the assets of people persecuted by the Nazis. While at the F.D.I.C., in 2009, after the financial crisis, he negotiated who would take responsibility for deposits at failing banks.\u201cI worked with Michael over a period of 50 years or so,\u201d said Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cHe was a very loyal soldier in the form of a lawyer who put the interests of the United States first.\u201dKnown as both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Volcker\u2019s and as his enforcer, Mr. Bradfield specialized in coming up with the legal arguments that could undergird policy decisions.In 1971, when \u201cthe big shots at Camp David\u201d needed a legal expert to weigh in on a price freeze and an import surcharge, Mr. Volcker recalled, they said, \u201cGet Mike Bradfield up here.\u201d Mr. Volcker called him \u201cdogged and tenacious.\u201dAnd, he said, Mr. Bradfield \u201cwas the driving force\u201d on a commission that uncovered more than 45,000 dormant Swiss bank accounts that had most likely been opened by victims of Nazi persecution during World War II. It found multiple instances in which banks had misled Jewish account holders about their funds after the war.A federal judge overseeing the case appointed Mr. Bradfield special master to establish and supervise the claims process.\u201cMike discovered there were a lot more records than anybody was admitting,\u201d Mr. Volcker said.The commission persuaded Swiss banks to publish more than 25,000 names of account holders. In 1998, Swiss banks reached a $1.25 billion settlement with Holocaust victims.Mr. Bradfield stayed on at the Fed under Alan Greenspan after Mr. Volcker stepped down in 1987 but resigned in 1989 to return to private law practice. With Mr. Volcker he helped found the Volcker Alliance, a nonpartisan organization focused on improving government.Michael Bradfield was born in New York City on July 24, 1934. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1956 and received a law degree and a master\u2019s degree in international affairs from Columbia University in 1960. That same year, he was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve.For three years he was an adjunct professor at what is now the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, part of Johns Hopkins University.At his death he lived in Mercersburg, Pa. Besides his son Andrew, Mr. Bradfield is survived by his wife, Inai Y.

{"Headline": "Brazilian Lawmakers Reject Bribery Prosecution of President Michel Temer", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCURITIBA, Brazil \u2014 Brazilian lawmakers voted on Wednesday to spare President Michel Temer from standing trial on corruption charges, choosing to keep the deeply unpopular leader in place and avoid yet another round of political turmoil.Mr. Temer needed at least 172 lawmakers to back him or abstain from voting to avoid prosecution. In a marathon congressional session that underscored Brazil\u2019s polarization, 263 deputies supported him and 227 voted against him. The remaining 23 lawmakers abstained or were absent.Several lawmakers who sided with him said Brazil could not afford more political upheaval. But opponents said that allowing Mr. Temer to stay amounted to an endorsement of the culture of impunity that has made corruption in Brazilian politics pervasive.Before the vote, shoving matches broke out in the lower house of Congress. Lawmakers critical of Mr. Temer tossed fake bills in the air to denounce what they called the brazenness of corruption in Brazilian politics.After the vote, Mr. Temer urged Brazilians to \u201cwork together for Brazil\u201d and tear down \u201cthe walls separating us.\u201d He pledged to continue his efforts to restore economic growth.Prosecuting a sitting president in Brazil requires that two-thirds of the lower house of Congress formally send the case to the Supreme Court. If enough lawmakers had voted against Mr. Temer, he would have been suspended for 180 days and potentially put on trial, much like Ms. Rousseff was.But many lawmakers have argued that Brazil and its aching economy need stability, not more political turmoil.Mr. Temer\u2019s approval rating sank to 5 percent last month, according to the poll, which was conducted by the research company IBOPE and had a sampling error of three percentage points and included 1,000 respondents. That makes him even less popular than Ms. Rousseff at her low point in late 2015, when 9 percent of Brazilians supported her.Many other lawmakers are under scrutiny in a series of sprawling investigations into kickback schemes at Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, and a construction giant, Odebrecht. Like the president, they are shielded from prosecution in regular courts and can be tried only by the Supreme Court.\u201cThere\u2019s a metaphor in Brazil that says that when two men are drowning, they embrace,\u201d said Ilona Szab\u00f3 de Carvalho, a co-founder of Agora!, a civic movement that seeks to make Brazil\u2019s political system more accessible and responsive to the public. \u201cThis is the picture of our legislative branch today.\u201dA series of corruption inquiries that stemmed from an investigation into money laundering at a gas station in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, initially upended the nation\u2019s culture of impunity. Dozens of businessmen and several prominent politicians have been put on trial.But as the scandal enters its fourth year, many politicians still appear to feel beyond the reach of the law, said Deltan Dallagnol, one of the prosecutors in the cases.\u201cAs a rule, these people still don\u2019t believe they will be punished in Brazil,\u201d Mr. Dallagnol said.Mr. Temer\u2019s lawyer delivered an impassioned defense on Wednesday as the hearing got underway, crediting the president with signs of a healing economy, including falling inflation. \u201cAt this time those gains are being put at risk,\u201d said the lawyer, Antonio Cl\u00e1udio Mariz de Oliveira. He called the charges against Mr. Temer \u201cfruits of fiction.\u201dLawmakers from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, which became one of the main opposition groups after her ouster, said that Mr. Temer should stand trial.Wednesday\u2019s vote does not necessarily protect Mr. Temer from being ousted early or standing trial. Rodrigo Janot, Brazil\u2019s top prosecutor, is likely to file new charges against him in the coming days, which would force lawmakers to hold a new vote on whether the case should move forward.While Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster inspired street demonstrations on both sides of the issue, the prevailing mood among Brazilians as Mr. Temer\u2019s fate hung in the balance in recent weeks was one of resignation rather than outrage.Marcelo Issa, the director of political consulting firm Pulso P\u00fablico, said that when Brazilians took to the streets in huge numbers to call for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, they expected her dismissal to bring about lasting political change.\u201cThere is a great deal of wear and tear on an individual level for people who live in Brazil, in relation to this political crisis without end,\u201d Mr. Issa said.Antonio Alcantaro Lima, a retiree in Rio de Janeiro, said that Brazilians had grown cynical in the face of a corrupt political class that seemed intractable.\u201cI don\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the candidates that are in the media are the same. I call it a soap opera, where the script changes but the actors remain the same.\u201dCiara Long contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beneath Markets\u2019 Calm Are Signs of Growing Investor Caution", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump threatened nuclear war with North Korea, and the markets yawned.While stocks in Asia sold off initially, the main market measures in the United States fell less than half a percent on Wednesday and ended the day nearly unchanged, as investors stuck to focusing on buoyant economic fundamentals and ignoring the chaos of American politics.But beneath the calm there were signs that investors \u2014 who have been conditioned since the presidential election in November to embrace risk instead of running from it \u2014 are becoming more cautious.The price of gold, a traditional safe investment, has been rising, and on Wednesday it continued its march, increasing more than 1 percent on the day.Gold\u2019s strong move pushed it just barely ahead of the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for the year \u2014 up 10.75 percent, compared with 10.69 percent for the S.&P., according to Y Charts, a data-gathering company.On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 and the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended the day virtually flat.Earlier, the Nikkei index in Japan closed down 1.29 percent, while the Kospi index in South Korea ended down 1.10 percent. European stocks were also lower, with London down 0.56 percent and Frankfurt down 1.12 percent.Prices of United States Treasury securities \u2014 often in demand in times of turmoil \u2014 rose early in the day, driving their yields, which move in the opposite direction, lower. But Treasury prices gave up ground in the afternoon, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.25 percent, from 2.26 percent on Tuesday.Gold futures rose 1.59 percent, to $1,282.40 an ounce.Gold tends to outperform stocks when the markets are sliding, so it is unusual for such a conservative investment to beat equities when they have been on a tear as has been the case this year.What is driving this anomaly, some say, is a recognition that eventually investors will not be able to ignore recent headline risks \u2014 whether nuclear tensions with North Korea, a trade war with China or a debt ceiling crisis in Washington.\u201cThere has been a Pavlovian response by investors to disregard any piece of bad news or any spike in volatility, and that has been a very profitable strategy,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, a portfolio manager for BlackRock\u2019s $39 billion Global Allocation Fund. \u201cBut we do think that there are risks in the world that are not being priced in.\u201dThe VIX rose nearly 9 percent on Wednesday after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about North Korea, before settling up just 1.37 percent, at 11.11 for the day. The index has been trading at historically low levels, and many investors continue to wager that lots of money pouring into markets and an improving global economy will keep the index quiescent.Mr. Koesterich, however, has been taking the opposite side of that trade. Since the beginning of the year, he has been adding to his gold position, and it is now the Global Allocation Fund\u2019s second-largest position, according to Y Charts.Mr. Koesterich is not alone in adopting a wary stance, especially now in August, when trading desks on Wall Street empty out and lower levels of buying and selling can result in sharper downward moves in the market.While few people are predicting an actual crash, a growing number of stock market specialists are warning that in the coming months, markets are likely to start reacting more to so-called macro events such as political volatility and the realization that central bankers in Europe and the United States are moving toward a more restrictive stance on interest rates and intervening in markets.That is because the benign market conditions of recent months have been spurred by better economic news, and, in particular, by a very good spate of second-quarter earnings.Once investors return from vacation, the theory goes, and with no good earnings news to inspire them, they will be more sensitive to headline events.That could result in sharper moves downward in stock market indexes.\u201cThere are risks,\u201d said Marko Kolanovic a market strategist and derivatives specialist at JPMorgan Chase, who warned in a recent report about an increase in trading volatility this fall. \u201cChina, North Korea and the normalization of policies by central banks, which has been underappreciated by the market.\u201dBut while many investors have shaken off scares such as Britain exiting the European Union or political unrest in Washington, the view is taking hold that gold can be a very good hedge against more serious threats like nuclear confrontation in Asia.\u201cThere has been a wall of money supporting markets so far,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, a market strategist at Exotix Capital in London. \u201cBut this time we are not just talking about a macro surprise \u2014 we are talking about full-on military action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Governor", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 Bragging about keeping his promises on immigration, the economy, the environment and crime, President Trump celebrated on Thursday with a raucous West Virginia crowd as the state\u2019s Democratic governor announced that he will switch to the Republican Party.With Gov. Jim Justice by his side, Mr. Trump hailed stock market records and the growth of coal income in West Virginia. And he delivered a lengthy critique of the federal investigations of his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, calling the matter \u201ca fake story that is demeaning to all of us.\u201d His comments came just hours after reports that a grand jury had been impaneled in the Russia investigation and that subpoenas had been issued.\u201cMost people know there were no Russians in our campaign; there never were,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd in a midsize rural town that drew thousands of supporters from across Appalachia, a region that gave Mr. Trump some of the largest margins of his election. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win because of Russia; we won because of you,\u201d he said. \u201cAre there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians?\u201dThe president also demanded that Congress pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, urging the crowd to call their lawmakers so they will have \u201cthe guts\u201d to take a vote. He vowed to reduce taxes, continue to crack down on immigrants, and rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure.The crowd welcomed the announcements, cheering heartily when Mr. Justice officially abandoned the Democratic Party, and repeatedly applauding for Mr. Trump, waving \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d signs.Mr. Justice said he would officially change his voter registration on Friday. \u201cI will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking, today I will tell you as West Virginians that I can\u2019t help you anymore being a Democrat governor,\u201d he said. He imagined his mother, who has passed away, saying, \u201cJimmy, it\u2019s about damn time you came to your senses.\u201dThe governor initially received some boos from members of the crowd who seemed uncertain why he was there. But they applauded his announcement, and he quickly wrapped his arms around the president. \u201cThis man is a good man. He\u2019s got a backbone, he\u2019s got real ideas. He cares about us in West Virginia,\u201d Mr. Justice said of Mr. Trump. He defended the president over the Russia investigation, saying, \u201cHave we not heard enough about the Russians?\u201dAfter the announcement, Mr. Trump praised the governor: \u201cHaving Big Jim as a Republican is such an honor,\u201d he said. \u201cFantastic man, fantastic guy.\u201dMr. Justice, a billionaire coal and real estate magnate, ran as a conservative Democrat and declined to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016. But even as West Virginia has become a reliable Republican state in presidential elections and further down the ballot, a handful of Democrats have still been able to win office.Mr. Justice, though, is said to have friendly relationships with some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family. Before entering politics he gave money to officeholders in both parties while variously registering as a Republican, a Democrat and an independent.Mr. Justice\u2019s decision to change parties will further isolate Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat and himself a former governor.Mr. Manchin has resisted the entreaties of Republicans to change parties and add to the two-seat Senate majority. Some Trump administration officials, eyeing Mr. Manchin\u2019s seat, also had hoped to put him in the cabinet, but he has declined all overtures.

Mr. Kott said Mr. Manchin was still not interested in joining the Trump cabinet.In his first months as governor, Mr. Justice, a colorful and hulking figure who stands over six feet, seven inches, drew headlines beyond West Virginia\u2019s border for bringing a plate of cow excrement into the state Capitol to express his anger at a Republican-passed budget proposal.\u201cWhat we have is nothing more than bunch of political bull you-know-what,\u201d Mr. Justice said, pulling the lid off a silver platter to reveal the scented prop atop a printed copy of the budget. But the governor, who found his fortune with coal and now owns The Greenbrier resort, continues to be dogged by the financial issues that Republicans sought to use against him in last year\u2019s campaign.The state tax department has filed four liens this year against of one of Mr. Justice\u2019s companies, Tams Management Inc., citing nearly $1 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties related to his coal mines.Mr. Justice scaled back his television advertising campaign late in last year\u2019s governor\u2019s campaign, telling Democratic officials that, while wealthy on paper, he had limited liquidity, according to a Democrat involved in the conversations.Representative Evan Jenkins, one of the Republicans seeking Mr. Manchin\u2019s Senate seat, said he would welcome the governor to his party.\u201cI simply couldn\u2019t be a part of a liberal agenda that was so contrary to who we are and what we believe in West Virginia,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who switched parties several years ago.Shaking hands with constituents earlier in the day at a meet-and-greet near the stadium where Mr. Trump was scheduled to speak, Mr. Jenkins said he would understand if Mr. Justice felt the same way.\u201cIf Jim Justice is the next to change his party registration to Republican, I welcome him to the Republican party,\u201d he said.Chris Goertler, a retired consultant from Williamstown, W.V., who was at the stadium to see Mr. Trump, said he used to be a Republican but is now \u201cnonaffiliated.\u201d Told of Mr. Justice\u2019s expected announcement, Mr. Goertler shrugged and said, \u201cI could never be a Democrat myself.\u201dRussell Lucas, an electrician from Kenova, W.V., who was also in line waiting to see Mr. Trump, said he would welcome Mr. Justice to the Republican Party, but added that he supported him even though he was a Democrat.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for this state already. He\u2019s a mine owner, and I know guys that work in the mines, and all of them like him.

{"Headline": "Strangling Puerto Rico in Order to Save It", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States invaded Puerto Rico in 1898 and took it from Spain. Although the residents became United States citizens in 1917, the island\u2019s colonial status has been a locus of political debate and struggle for most of its subsequent history.Just a few months after gaining citizenship, Puerto Ricans were made subject to a United States military draft. But they have never gotten to elect a voting member of Congress, despite being governed by United States law. The island is officially an \u201cunincorporated territory\u201d of the United States, but since the 1950s, it has preferred to call itself an \u201cestado libre asociado\u201d \u2014 free associated state \u2014 or a \u201ccommonwealth.\u201d If the word \u201ccolony\u201d was once judged too harsh, at this moment in Puerto Rico\u2019s history, it looks like an understatement.Worst of all, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. As revenues fell with the economy over the past decade, the island\u2019s government increased borrowing in an attempt to maintain levels of economic activity and social spending. Puerto Rico ended up with $73 billion in debt that it couldn\u2019t pay, and it officially defaulted in 2015.In June 2016 Congress passed the terribly misnamed Promesa act (it means \u201cpromise\u201d in Spanish), which created a financial oversight and management board to direct Puerto Rico\u2019s finances. This board, to which President Barack Obama appointed four Democrats and four Republicans, has now approved an austerity regimen that, if things go according to plan, envisions a second lost decade \u2014 in other words, no economic growth from 2005 through 2024. But the plan doesn\u2019t take into account the impact of such austerity, which would add more years of decline. And there\u2019s more: All the budget tightening over the second decade, including cuts to health care and education, would pay only about $7.9 billion of Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion debt.That means that creditors\u2019 lawsuits, which have already been filed, could inflict additional damage and worsen the quarter-century of economic stagnation that is now in the cards. Hedge funds hold much of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, and since May their claims have been under consideration in a bankruptcy-like proceeding \u2014 also under the Promesa act \u2014 that does not look any more promising than the oversight board\u2019s plan.And even if Puerto Rico were a state, its two senators and four or five voting members of Congress, combined with the more than five million Puerto Ricans in the current 50 states, would give them more of a fighting chance than they have today.There is a strong case to be made for serious debt relief and a plan that will allow for an economic recovery. Most of the economic decline that led to the debt crisis resulted from decisions made by the federal government or international treaties that it signed. Among these were the rules of the World Trade Organization and China\u2019s accession to it in 2000, which set off an out-migration of pharmaceutical production \u2014 a mainstay of the island\u2019s economy \u2014 and other manufacturing. Employment in manufacturing, which was a much bigger percentage of jobs in Puerto Rico than in most of the rest of the Americas, fell by more than half from 1995 to 2016. The repeal of a special tax break for American corporations that operated in Puerto Rico helped drive down investment and employment. Between 1999 and last year, investment fell from a peak of 20.7 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s gross domestic product to 7.9 percent.Puerto Rico\u2019s international commerce also suffers from a federal law that significantly raises the cost of traded goods and the cost of living there by preventing foreign ships from stopping first at the island before proceeding to a mainland port. Reduced funding for Medicaid and Medicare in Puerto Rico, when compared with that for states of comparable per capita income levels, also accounts for billions of dollars of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt.For all of these reasons and more, the United States government has a responsibility to contribute to Puerto Rico\u2019s economic recovery. In doing so, it should ensure that the creditors who made foolish loans or bought Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds at a steep discount do not profit from those decisions.The structural problems \u2014 the unfair economic relationships and legal inequities carved out for Puerto Ricans because of their colonial status \u2014 will take longer to resolve. But there is no excuse for the prolonged collective punishment of so many American citizens that is now being prescribed.Advertisement"}

But the company\u2019s troubles run deeper than Mr. Kalanick\u2019s flubs and scandals, and new leadership alone won\u2019t be able to right this distressed ship.If Mr. Khosrowshahi is to succeed, he\u2019ll have to do what his predecessor refused to do: confront the reality that Uber\u2019s business model simply doesn\u2019t work.These are troubling signs. Every start-up must one day fulfill the market\u2019s demand that it turn a profit, but Uber has never figured out how to do that. While ride sharing in some form will probably survive, it\u2019s more likely that without some drastic changes, Uber won\u2019t be around in three to five years.Mr. Khosrowshahi must avoid the mistakes of his predecessor by accepting that \u201cpivots\u201d (Silicon Valley-speak for the desperate changes troubled companies make to reassure their venture capitalist funders) are not the answer. None of the pivots Mr. Kalanick tried \u2014 like on-demand delivery of food and packages through UberEats and UberRush, packing in more passengers via UberPool, and expansions into China, India and Russia \u2014 improved the bottom line.Why? Because none introduced efficiencies or changed the basic underlying economics of the taxi industry, the way Amazon did with retail by getting rid of brick-and-mortar stores through online sales.Uber\u2019s only chance to survive at this point is to actually make its taxi business work. If he\u2019s to have any chance of doing that, Mr. Khosrowshahi will need to make major changes.First, he should parlay Uber\u2019s popularity among its users into a significant increase in fares.Third, he should find a way to repair Uber\u2019s poor relationship with its drivers, since the company will need them for a good while longer. One study found that only 4 percent of people who sign up to drive for Uber are still driving a year later. Uber burns through drivers as fast as it burns through its investors\u2019 cash.Fifth, he should shut down Uber\u2019s foreign operations everywhere except London, where it has had a degree of success.If Mr. Khosrowshahi follows this blueprint, the company has a chance of surviving. If not, Uber will burn through its remaining estimated $6.6 billion in cash and go out of business in three to five years, and he\u2019ll be its final chief executive.Steven Hill, a technology and economic journalist, is the author of \u201cRaw Deal: How the \u2018Uber Economy\u2019 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe of Japan Reshuffles Cabinet, Hoping to Shore Up Falling Support", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan appointed a new cabinet on Thursday, hoping to breathe new life into his conservative government, whose support among voters has plunged after a series of scandals and missteps.\u201cI want to unite and move forward by returning to the early spirit we had when we took back the government in 2012,\u201d Mr. Abe said.After winning office in December 2012, Mr. Abe initially went to work on the economy, seeking to lift Japan\u2019s sluggish growth rate with a stimulus program known as Abenomics. The approach won him high approval ratings.But more than four and a half years later, only about a third of voters say they support his administration, according to opinion surveys by the Japanese news media.For the post of defense minister, Mr. Abe chose Itsunori Onodera, a longtime lawmaker who held the same job in the first cabinet Mr. Abe formed after his 2012 victory.Mr. Onodera succeeds Tomomi Inada, who resigned under pressure last Friday over allegations that she had withheld information from Parliament about dangers faced by Japanese soldiers on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. The episode added to the problems faced by Mr. Abe, who was already dealing with accusations of showing favoritism toward friends and conservative sympathizers, which he has denied.The post of foreign minister went to Taro Kono, one of the most liberal voices in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Kono is known for his vocal opposition to nuclear power after the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011, a position that has put him at odds with his pronuclear party.Mr. Kono\u2019s father is Yohei Kono, a former foreign minister who, as chief cabinet secretary in 1993, issued a landmark apology to women from Korea and elsewhere who were coerced into working in Japanese military brothels during World War II. The so-called Kono Statement has long been resented by the nationalist right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party.Mr. Kono succeeds Fumio Kishida, a moderate rival to Mr. Abe who is considered a potential successor as prime minister, and who did not receive a spot in the new cabinet. Mr. Kishida was instead given a top executive role in the Liberal Democratic Party, as chairman of its policy research council. Mr. Harris noted that members of Mr. Kishida\u2019s faction of the party were given more posts than in the previous cabinet \u2014 five, up from three \u2014 strengthening his position.Mr. Abe\u2019s second term as the party\u2019s president expires next year. The party changed its term-limit rules this year to allow for a third term, but without a sharp turnaround in his public support Mr. Abe is unlikely to convince party members to let him stay on.Mr. Abe selected another rival, Seiko Noda, to be his new minister of internal affairs and communications. Ms. Noda challenged Mr. Abe for the party leadership when his first term ended in 2015. She is one of only two women appointed to the 20-member cabinet, along with the justice minister, Yoko Kamikawa, a ratio that could open Mr. Abe to criticism that he is retreating from a pledge to promote more female leaders.Two of Mr. Abe\u2019s most important allies, the finance minister, Taro Aso, and the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, retained their positions.Toshihiro Nikai, the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s secretary general, will also stay on. In remarks on Thursday morning, he suggested that the government would slow its drive to amend the Constitution to remove restrictions on the military. Mr. Abe has proposed enacting such changes, which the party has long sought, by 2020, but surveys show that a majority of the public remains opposed to them.\u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to a wide array of opinions and pile caution on top of caution,\u201d Mr. Nikai said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly term-limit rules of the governing Liberal Democratic Party. The party allows its president to serve a maximum of three three-year terms, not a maximum of two three-year terms.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Keep the FARC Guerrillas Out of the Fight", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe task is daunting: How do you keep people who have been fighting for decades from rearming? Giving aid to former fighters remains controversial, but new evidence-based strategies provide reason for hope that reintegration can succeed despite the challenges.The FARC members\u2019 background presents a first hurdle. As Communist ideologues with links to the narco-economy, many of its members were recruited from poor, rural families as children, and have been guerrilla fighters for so long they know no other life. Most have had little formal schooling and are not accustomed to civilian life.The approximately 7,000 fighters in the group are in a holding pattern in 26 rural camps.. Those suspected of war crimes are waiting for their cases to be handled by transitional courts. Most rank-and-file fighters have been granted amnesty and could leave the camps this month.Meanwhile, another rebel group, the National Liberation Army, is still active, though engaged in its own peace talks. Social leaders and activists calling for land restitution and human rights have been the targets of violence by neo-paramilitary criminal bands. This worrying trend revives memories of FARC\u2019s previous attempt to transition to politics, in the 1980s and 1990s, when thousands of members of the associated leftist Patriotic Union party were assassinated.FARC\u2019s disarmament shows that the government and rebels are committed to the peace deal. The United Nations recently approved a mission to monitor reintegration, and Colombia\u2019s Reincorporation and Normalization Agency helps the newly demobilized fighters ease back into civilian life. Although the prospective caseload may seem substantial, it is small relative to the more than 50,000 fighters the agency reintegrated over the past 14 years. Under the accord, FARC will also have the option of becoming a political party.First, assistance must address individual needs, particularly in underdeveloped rural areas that have been neglected by the state. We found that education programs can help counter recidivism. An ex-combatant we interviewed from a previous demobilization affirmed the enduring value of education in light of the limited period of the reintegration program: \u201cIf I finish my studies, I\u2019ll always have that. I\u2019ll be able to get by, find a job, and improve my quality of life.\u201dMeanwhile, fighters who joined the rebels for motives like revenge or adventure-seeking present tougher cases than those who joined for ideological reasons.Men are more inclined to recidivism than women, as their notions of masculinity may be tied to their identities as fighters. Since demobilizing women may face different struggles, psychosocial care must address gender-specific needs.Second, reintegration is a family affair. We found that having children and good relations with family members are anchors that keep ex-combatants on the right side of the law. As another ex-combatant we interviewed said, \u201cI have a daughter and she gives me many reasons not to go back to crime.\u201d A positive sign is a baby boom happening in the camps; previously having children was taboo for fighters.Colombia\u2019s embrace of peace is a bright spot in a region plagued by violence. Successful reintegration can increase public trust in the peace process, offering lessons for the world on how to manage post-conflict problems. The coming months will tell whether victims and those who made war can turn a new page in the country\u2019s history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phallus Art Brings Luck in Bhutan \u2014 and Tourists, Too", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLobesa JournalLOBESA, Bhutan \u2014 For centuries, Bhutan has celebrated the phallus.They are painted on homes, or carved in wood, installed above doorways and under eaves to ward off evil, including one of its most insidious human forms, gossip. They are worn on necklaces, installed in granaries and in fields as a kind of scarecrow. They are used by masked jesters in religious festivals and at one temple near here in Lobesa as a blessing of fertility.Now, as Bhutan increasingly opens up to the world, the ancient tradition has been evolving or, some say, sullied \u2014 by commercialization.\u201cPeople still use it as a symbol,\u201d said Needrup Zangpo, the executive director of the Journalist Association of Bhutan, who has written about the historical inspiration for the symbol, \u201cbut the necessity of having it painted on your house is going away.\u201d He attributed this erosion of tradition to \u201cthe exposure to Western culture.\u201dThe symbol, like Bhutan itself, seems suspended between two impulses: the country\u2019s headlong embrace of modernity and its preservation of traditions that made it unique to start with.The tradition has been widely traced to one lama, Drukpa Kunley, who spread the tenets of Buddhism through Bhutan in the 15th and 16th centuries.Called the \u201cDivine Madman,\u201d he was a holy fool, a mendicant, drunkard and Lothario who subdued women and demons alike with his heightened spirituality and what legend called his \u201cFlaming Thunderbolt of Wisdom.\u201dDrukpa Kunley is celebrated throughout the country \u2014 and in Tibet, across the border \u2014 but his cult is centered on Chimi Lhakhang, the \u201cno dog\u201d monastery, near Lobesa, which encompasses a cluster of still smaller hamlets nestled in a valley of terraced paddies of red and white rice.The monastery was built in 1499 on a knoll above the Puna Tsang River, though given the hazy mythology surrounding Drukpa Kunley\u2019s evangelism, there are contradictory accounts of the monastery\u2019s founding.In the prevailing one, the lama subdued a demon haunting a nearby mountain pass called Dochula by turning her into a red dog, which he buried \u201cwith a pile of earth to resemble a woman\u2019s breast.\u201d Hence the name \u201cno dog.\u201dIn neither scenario of the monastery\u2019s founding, Mr. Zangpo emphasized, did he use his penis, though that is how the legend is often garbled.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear line between history and mythology,\u201d said Mr. Zangpo, who is compiling his own translations of the oral histories that he hopes will set the record straight. Like other scholars, he argues that the phallus symbol can more likely be traced to pre-Buddhist pagan rituals than to the Divine Madman\u2019s legend.Nevertheless, the tales of the lama\u2019s sexual appetite have prevailed \u2014 in no small part because of the oral histories, in which Drukpa Kunley flouts both secular and religious sensibilities by reveling in sex and alcohol on his path to enlightenment.To this day, hopeful couples traverse Bhutan to partake of the monastery\u2019s fertility blessing. They reach it by climbing the knoll on foot after passing through the hamlets of Sopsokha and Teoprongchu. The valley is indisputably beautiful. Dragonflies swarm in circles overhead. Small aqueducts feeding the green rice paddies spin colorful prayer wheels like water mills.What has made the area famous, though, are the phalluses, a must-see for foreigners who pay the $250 per day minimum that Bhutan requires for tourist visas. And more tourists, perhaps inevitably, mean more phalluses.House after house is painted with phalluses. While highly stylized, they are in some cases graphically detailed: always erect, often ejaculating. One appears with the country\u2019s name, a marketing ploy by the owner of one of the proliferating souvenir shops. The displays in some \u2014 rows of colorful wooden carvings \u2014 would not seem out of place in a sex shop.Bhutan\u2019s phalluses are not considered explicitly sexual, noted Ms. Choden, the writer.\u201cIn essence, the phallus represents the center of the male ego, and not a celebration of sex,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt reminds onlookers that if this force is harnessed properly, it will fuel productivity and creativity rather than wanton lust.\u201dLotay Tshering, a 51-year-old rice farmer, owns a house in Sopsokha that is adorned with two giant penis murals. His wife\u2019s uncle painted them in homage to the Divine Madman, \u201cwho has blessed this place,\u201d as he put it. He and his wife have six children.Over a cup of salt butter tea, Mr. Tshering lamented the proliferation of shops and cafes that accompanied the rise of tourism (though his main complaint for the authorities was the sorry state of the local roads).\u201cFrom then on there was no stopping the number of shops sprouting up,\u201d Mr. Tshering said, adding that he found the trend unseemly.The phalluses certainly have been a boon for the villages here, a two-hour drive from the capital, Thimphu. The area has around 2,700 people, according to the most recent census, in 2005. Most are farmers, though there is a growing number of shopkeepers and artists.Tenpa Renchen, the deputy headman of the village, an elected post, said the gains to the local economy had come mostly from the rents that villagers can charge to the souvenir shops. A few more opened in the last year, as did a restaurant with a stunning view of the monastery.\u201cPersonally,\u201d he emphasized, with a diplomatic touch, \u201cI don\u2019t like people selling these in shops, but they have to make a living.\u201dThe village elders, however, are watching the commercialization with caution. The proliferation of shops has not yet reached a crisis, Mr. Renchen said, but could soon test the limits of tolerance.Mr. Renchen sounded wistful in an interview, lamenting the modern exploitation of something with a deeper religious significance.\u201cThe Divine Madman,\u201d he said, \u201chas much more to offer than just a phallus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron Vowed to Be Business Friendly. Now He Faces a Protectionist Uproar.", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Two weeks after taking office, President Emmanuel Macron, donning a white hard hat, stood before hundreds of employees at the nation\u2019s largest shipyard, promising to protect a French jewel from falling into foreign hands.Mr. Macron campaigned to make France more business friendly by luring foreign investment and easing regulatory complexities. But blocking the deal for STX, along with a series of other maneuvers in recent weeks, is prompting concerns that Mr. Macron may follow the tried and true French tradition of dirigisme \u2014 an interventionist approach that his predecessors have employed time and again to promote French interests.France is finding itself in the middle of debate over protectionism, as a backlash against globalization deepens around the world. President Trump is championing a more nationalistic stance in the United States, while Europe is generally calling for freer trade to stoke growth.Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s economy minister, on Tuesday traveled to Rome to meet with Italy\u2019s economy and industry ministers, who criticized what they called an \u201cincomprehensible\u201d decision over STX, and accused France of lapsing into economic nationalism. Mr. Le Maire said the seizure of STX was temporary and designed only to buy time to renegotiate an accord more favorable to the French government, which owns a third of the company.\u201cEven if it is temporary, it\u2019s part of the French way of doing things,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, the head of research at OpenCitiz, a political risk consultant firm in Paris. \u201cMacron says he\u2019s going to do things differently, but he also has to work with existing institutions and the culture, and that won\u2019t just go away in a few months.\u201dSuccessive presidents have declared France \u201copen for business,\u201d only to get intimately involved in corporate takeovers, especially when a foreign company is making a play.Despite declaring he would make France\u2019s economy more liberal, Mr. Macron has shown a willingness to involve the state in industrial policy.More recently as president, Mr. Macron has exerted that power in the name of saving jobs. When GM & S, a struggling French auto parts supplier, veered toward bankruptcy this summer, his government demanded that the partly state-backed carmakers, Renault and Peugeot, order tens of thousands of euros worth of new parts from the plant.The 277 workers had booby-trapped the factory and threatened to blow it up unless a buyer was found. Mr. Macron sought to entice a savior by pressuring Renault and Peugeot to also invest millions more in modernizing the plant, on a remote and polluted parcel of land in central France.A French buyer finally sealed a deal this week. Fewer than half the jobs will be kept.While Mr. Macron\u2019s early actions set a distinct pattern, it is not clear how much further he will go. He is still hoping to lay the groundwork for growth, in part by lightening the French state\u2019s hand in companies, which could make such economic intervention less possible.\u201cIt looks bad for France\u2019s image right now,\u201d said Patrick Artus, the chief economist at the French bank Natixis. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think his mission is to increase the activism of the state.\u201dMr. Macron has pledged to revamp France\u2019s costly pension system, to invest in education and to build up France\u2019s technology and renewable energy sectors. To pay for it, he has hinted at privatizing billions of euros worth of the French government\u2019s holdings in a swath of French firms.\u201cIn five years, the French state\u2019s presence will be much lower than today,\u201d Mr. Artus said. Meanwhile, he added, Mr. Macron\u2019s interventions are \u201call political marketing.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s poll ratings have slumped recently from near record highs as he prepares to push through steep budget cuts and painful changes to French worker protections and labor laws. French unions have called for street protests in September.But the decision to temporarily nationalize the STX shipyard, in Saint-Nazaire, has proved popular with the French public, which generally wants the French state to preserve national interests.\u201cMacron is picking his fights right now in French public opinion, and dropping the tool of nationalization is not one of them, given what he has to do in terms of cutting budgets and implementing labor market reforms,\u201d Ms. Krumbm\u00fcller said. \u201cNot nationalizing STX would have been too expensive for him in terms of popularity.\u201dIn the case of STX, Mr. Macron\u2019s government said its concerns went beyond jobs. Under the contract signed by former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the Italian state-backed shipbuilder Fincantieri was to take a two-thirds stake in the French shipyard held by a now-bankrupt South Korean owner.Fincantieri had pledged to keep thousands of jobs and orders for the next five years at Saint Nazaire. The hulking operation makes many of the world\u2019s mega-cruiseships and has the capacity to build aircraft carriers and other naval vessels.The French government said the deal could jeopardize the Saint-Nazaire operations in part because Fincantieri holds stakes in Chinese shipyards, raising concerns about a transfer of technology to China. The deal would also effectively give the Italian state, which owns Fincantieri through a finance company, sway at a strategic French site.Last week, as the contract was about to take effect, the Macron administration tried to renegotiate a 50-50 split. When Fincantieri balked, the French government seized control by exercising its right to buy out existing shareholders.On Tuesday, Mr. Le Maire sought to smooth tensions with Rome, where officials questioned why it was acceptable for a South Korean shipbuilder to hold a majority stake, but not an Italian one. Italians are also incensed that French companies have spent billions on takeovers of its own major businesses in sectors like dairy and luxury, without the Italian state putting up a fuss.Mr. Le Maire, in his talks with Italian officials, offered to work with Italy to create a \u201cEuropean naval shipbuilder champion,\u201d in which the two countries would collaborate on building civilian and naval vessels.Should the Italians reject a deal, he told a French newspaper, \u201cwe will stick with the current situation and look for other potential buyers.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title held by Bruno Le Maire. Mr. Le Maire is the economy minister in France, not the prime minister.An article on Wednesday about France\u2019s economy erroneously attributed a distinction to the Meraviglia cruise liner, built by the shipyard STX France, which an Italian competitor is trying to take over. At 171,598 tons, the Meraviglia is the world\u2019s biggest luxury cruise ship built in 2017; it is not the biggest over all. (The 226,963-ton Harmony of the Seas, also built by STX France, holds that distinction.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From President Macron, a Lesson in Style", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookAmerican politics needs a makeover, and Emmanuel Macron might be the man to do it. Sure, the technocrat-turned-president has a lot on his plate right now \u2014 compelling stuff like recasting France as an innovative tech hub, rejiggering his country\u2019s archaic work rules and reviving its flagging economy. But if he ever has a moment to spare away from the demands of international diplomacy and arm-wrestling President Trump, the mediagenic politician who came out of nowhere to win a hotly contested race could give his counterparts in the United States a master class in playing the image-manipulation game.For a start, he could offer pointers on how to use clothes to political advantage, as he did throughout his canny presidential run. Before this novice of the campaign trail became, at 39, the youngest man ever elected president of France, Mr. Macron had been a banker and a minister of economy and finance, one who dressed in the chic, uptight uniform of the power elite: pinstripe suits, white shirts with modest spread collars, anonymous silk ties.Back when he was dressing in outfits that cost 1,200 euros (about $1,400), Mr. Macron found himself vulnerable to criticism from those in his former (Socialist) party. Just by losing the hand-stitched buttonholes and the smart silk linings, he saved himself roughly $800 a suit and simultaneously gained himself a measure of voter approval \u2014 appreciation for a cost-value proposition being as deeply Gallic a quality as a love of Serge Gainsbourg.It doesn\u2019t hurt that Mr. Macron is a youthful piece of brainy eye candy. Still, one gets the sense a politician shrewd enough to outmaneuver the American president \u2014 as he did Mr. Trump during a Bastille Day state visit \u2014 could manipulate his imagery just as deftly if he had two heads.And here is where he has something to teach his American friends. Dip a toe into the unceasing torrent of news from inside the Beltway and it becomes obvious that, in United States politics, image management plays little part in anyone\u2019s job description. Sure, there are more pressing matters at hand in Washington right now than lapel widths. Yet a steady HDTV diet of senators with comb-overs and insurance-agent sack suits can sometimes exaggerate the ways in which the political establishment appears out of touch with a country growing younger and more urban every day.Smarten up, Senators Tom Carper (Democrat of Delaware), Mike Crapo (Republican, Idaho), Angus King (Independent, Maine), Sherrod Brown (Democrat, Ohio) and Ron Johnson (Republican, Wisconsin). Those folksy button-down shirts in your official portraits are neither authoritative nor casual enough. No one says you have to aim for the Jupiterian heights Mr. Macron aspires to. But either dress up or dress down.And hire a stylist, Senators Jerry Moran (Kansas), Steve Daines (Montana) and John Hoeven (North Dakota), all Republicans, someone who can help you out of those big-shouldered power suits that look as if they were run up by an upholsterer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rwanda\u2019s Forever President", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorANTWERP, Belgium \u2014 There is an election in Rwanda on Friday, but its outcome already is nearly certain: President Paul Kagame will win a third seven-year term. Elections there are not a contest for power. They are the ritual confirmation of the power in place.Mr. Kagame generally wins by margins that would make a dictator proud: In 2010, he scored some 93 percent of the vote. He is the only ruler most Rwandans born since the 1994 genocide know. The Rwandans who remember leaders before him have reason to wonder if they will ever see another: The state\u2019s mighty security apparatus is quietly eloquent, with all those soldiers and police officers routinely patrolling both city streets and the countryside.Burundi was condemned internationally in 2015 after President Pierre Nkurunziza flouted term limits to run for a third mandate. Last year, President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo skirted term restrictions by simply delaying the next election, triggering protests and then a crackdown that led to sanctions against his government. Yet nothing of the sort has happened to Mr. Kagame or his administration despite its ploys to keep him in power basically unchallenged.Mr. Kagame\u2019s supporters, in Rwanda and beyond, sing to his tune. In a way, they have to. Western donors and international organizations may well prefer democratic values to big-man politics. But having poured great sums of money into Rwanda since the 1994 genocide, they want to be impressed by the headway Mr. Kagame claims to have made \u2014 on economic growth and poverty reduction, but also maternal health care and the prosecution of suspected mass killers. Asia has tigers; now Africa has found its lion. Many want to believe that while Mr. Kagame may have been cutting corners on democracy, he has delivered on development.Has he, though?In fact, his government\u2019s record is shakier than it looks, including on some of the major achievements it is credited with.Consider poverty reduction. Back in 2005, I was stationed in Rwanda with a World Bank team, working on a large-scale study of poverty. Six months into it, after we had collected hundreds of survey questionnaires about the well-being of ordinary Rwandans and conducted hundreds of discussions with villagers, the Rwandan security forces seized half of our files on the pretext that our research\u2019s design was tainted by \u201cgenocide ideology\u201d \u2014 a vague notion supposedly something like sectarianism that the government often invokes to criminalize what it sees as challenges to its authority. After lengthy negotiations between World Bank and Rwandan officials, the project was abandoned. We never determined what the poverty trends were: The information we had collected was destroyed before it could be analyzed.Matters have hardly improved. Major studies can only be carried out by the Rwandan authorities or under their close supervision. Independent researchers have come to question the government\u2019s methodology for analyzing data.Whatever one thinks of these issues, however, everyone should be concerned that the Kagame government has been fudging, hiding or selectively presenting the raw facts of its economic record. Rwanda may be forgoing democracy for development only to wind up with no democracy and far less development than many think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One U.S. Factory Goes Global, While Trump Shrinks the World", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Never mind the refrain that the American factory is supposedly a dinosaur in the age of globalization.Here in the heart of horse country, some 700 American workers are designing and building premium ceiling fans. They tap local engineering prowess and export their wares around the world using a whimsical brand: Big Ass Fans. (Yes, that is really its name.)But if the company stands as refutation to the premature obituaries for American manufacturing, the people running the operation worry about a looming risk. Talk of trade hostilities from Washington could shrink the globe, potentially yielding policy that could limit American exports while impeding access to crucial components of manufacturing.The latest concern unfolds this week, as the Trump administration begins to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, redrawing the terms of commerce with Mexico and Canada.The president has long criticized Nafta as a lethal threat to American livelihoods, asserting that it has spurred an exodus of jobs to Mexico while opening the borders to unfairly cheap, tariff-free imports. He has vowed to bring factory jobs back to the United States.In outlining its goals for the Nafta renegotiation, the Trump administration listed as a priority shrinking American trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. Trade experts construed that as an intention to limit imports from those countries.But many of the imports encouraged by Nafta are parts and raw materials used by American workers in fashioning finished wares. If Mr. Trump limits such imports, that could increase the cost of making goods at many American factories. It could provoke Canada and Mexico to similarly restrict trade, diminishing their purchases of American products.In short, Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to bring work back to the United States could eliminate some jobs that are already here.\u201cAltering Nafta could fundamentally change the production of the economy \u2014 for the U.S., as well as for Mexico \u2014 and that will be very disruptive,\u201d said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cMany of the policies being proposed could end up hurting the people who are being left behind.\u201dBig Ass Fans could wind up paying more for motors it imports from Mexico. It could lose sales to Canada and Mexico, now its two largest export destinations, and the destinations for more than a third of American exports over all.\u201cIf we get into a trade war, that could significantly impact our U.S. production,\u201d said Paul Lauritzen, the company\u2019s vice president for manufacturing. \u201cIt just seems like the Trump guys are so focused on meeting campaign promises that they have failed to understand the reality of manufacturing and the global supply chain.\u201dIn the world economy as depicted by President Trump, a product made in Mexico and sold on American shelves represents a theft. Such wares should have been forged in the United States, using American hands.In this spirit, Mr. Trump first threatened to kill Nafta, and later agreed to the renegotiation getting underway. He has vowed to slap tariffs on a range of Chinese goods including steel. He has accused his predecessors of destroying American factory jobs by assenting to a series of abominable trade deals.Still, Mr. Tantillo argued against reinstating tariffs, while cautioning that the renegotiation must not disrupt \u201cthe high level of supply chain integration that exists today.\u201dTrade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.As Mr. Lauritzen walks through his plant on a recent afternoon, he lifts an electrical device that regulates the power supply for a new line of highly energy-efficient industrial lights. It was imported from China.\u201cIf you wanted to source this domestically, your options would be minimal to zero,\u201d he says.Big Ass Fans began life in 1999 with a more staid name, the HVLS Fan Company. It specialized in enormous industrial-grade fans hung in vast spaces like factories and airplane hangars as a way to reduce use of heating and air-conditioning. The largest fans reach 24 feet in diameter and sell for upward of $8,000.As customers began using blunt language to describe the products, the company took their declarations as its name. Its complex on the outskirts of Lexington features no end of brand-related mischief. Signs reserve a favored parking spot for the \u201cSmart Ass of the Month.\u201d The company mascot is a donkey named Fanny.Beneath the joviality is a serious engineering operation. In 2008, when the global financial system was ensnared in disaster and the company\u2019s revenue was about $30 million a year, it invested nearly one-third of that sum in a new research and development facility.Company innovators used the facility to develop a popular feature that simulates the variable wind speeds of an ocean breeze, which provides relief from the constant blowing of a typical fan. The company started a new residential line under the Haiku brand, using a molded hunk of stainless steel, bamboo and other luxurious materials.By 2012, revenue had tripled to $90 million, according to the company. Last year, it reached $240 million.Big Ass Fans pays well above the state average, investing in the notion that happier workers are more productive. One-third of its assembly line workers earn more than $40,000 a year, plus health insurance, according to the company.Ray Hawkins, 38, landed at the factory four years ago, after being laid off from his previous job as a welder at a nearby Toyota plant. He had endured four years of joblessness with a young son at home. Since starting at the company, he has worked his way up to a supervisory position and now earns nearly one-and-a-half times his previous pay.\u201cWhen I was at Toyota, I felt like I was just a number,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, everybody knows my name.\u201dBut company overseers are feeling pressure.Jamie Hillegonds, director of global operations, is looking for savings in the supply chain. The Trump administration presents itself as a champion of business, eager to strip away job-killing regulations. Yet she finds herself having to anticipate how the president might complicate her plans.Her company buys motors from a Midwestern supplier known for quality and good prices. But the supplier recently shifted its production to Mexico. If the Nafta renegotiation makes that product more expensive, she will have to adjust.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to develop a global sourcing strategy based on Trump\u2019s day-to-day whims about what he wants to do,\u201d Ms. Hillegonds said.Jonathan Bostock, the chief operating officer, wonders what happens if the Trump administration follows through on plans to impose tariffs on steel as a way to limit China\u2019s exports. Big Ass Fans buys little steel directly, but the companies that supply its parts purchase the material.\u201cIt goes downstream, and someone ends up paying,\u201d he said.With the United States out of the pact, Big Ass Fans is more likely to serve Asian customers from its factory in Malaysia rather than expanding in Kentucky, he said, adding, \u201cEvery time we miss out on one of those, when other countries are negotiating free trade agreements, that disadvantages us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the wording on a sign in the Big Ass Fans parking lot. As shown in the photograph accompanying the article, the sign says a nearby parking spot is reserved for the company \u201csmart ass,\u201d not \u201cwise ass.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was the sharpest daily decline in the benchmark S.&P. 500 since May 17.Gold held at $1,283.70 an ounce after its strong run of late, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan steadied from its fall on Wednesday, closing at 19,730. The relative safety of United States Treasury securities continued to appeal, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 2.20 percent from 2.25 percent on Wednesday. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions from each other.)At the root of investors\u2019 nervousness was a jump in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the index measures investor expectations that stocks will experience sharp moves in the future.On Thursday, the VIX surged 44 percent from its historically low levels to close the day at 16.04, its highest close since Election Day in November.For many weeks this year, the VIX hovered persistently in single-digit territory, unusual for a barometer that historically trades around 20.The index\u2019s long period of placidity amid constant upheaval in Washington has posed a persistent riddle for Wall Street prognosticators.Some analysts warned that expectations of low volatility had lured a rush of recent investment, particularly from retail investors piling into exchange traded funds tied to the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and other indexes and strategies.A sharp upward trend in the VIX could well prompt many of those newcomers to flee at the same time, which could turn a market downturn into something more severe.The potential risks extend beyond those who are new to the party. In recent years, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into risk parity and other machine-driven funds that are programmed to start selling stocks and bonds once volatility rises sharply.In a period of investment calm and artificially low interest rates, automated funds, which churn out consistent if unspectacular returns, have become very popular among yield-hungry investors.\u201cBy definition, investors tend to be long the most risk when volatility is at its lowest levels,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investments. \u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201dAfter many years in which investors made a mint by betting against the VIX, a number of investors have begun to argue that the time has come to wager on the VIX \u2014 not against it.Of course, it may be too early to predict the end of one of the longest bull markets in financial history. The global economy continues to grow, and companies in the United States remain highly profitable, with earnings and sales in the quarter that ended in June handily beating expectations.The VIX\u2019s sharp move could also simply be a reversion to its mean and not a sign of panic in the markets.Analysts noted that a long period of stock market calm is highly unusual and that a correction should not come as a shock.Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm, said that before today\u2019s sell-off, the S.&P. 500 had experienced only two down days of more than 1 percent this year; the last similarly long period of financial calm was in 1964.That reserve of buying power, be it retail or institutional, has cushioned stock market drops in the past, and optimists are hoping that it will do so again.Advertisement"}

We are renegotiating trade deals and making them good for the American worker. And it\u2019s about time.Our economy is now strong. The stock market continues to hit record highs. Unemployment is at a 16-year low and businesses are more optimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over one million jobs since I took office. We will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon.But based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the nation with an update on the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone. I just met with F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others.To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend\u2019s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered. As I said on Saturday, we condemn, in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America.And as I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws. We all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God.We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty, that bring us together as Americans.Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution.Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America. Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers and our love.We also mourn the two Virginia state troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Berke Bates exemplify the very best of America and our hearts go out to their families, their friends and every member of American law enforcement.These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character. Responding to hate with love, division with unity and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.As a candidate I promised to restore law and order to our country and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear.We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans, and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams, in their hearts, and to express the love and joy in their souls.Thank you.

Today, they are outdated and unwanted, and the region is one of the Chinese economy\u2019s most troubled.A short drive away, however, a newly minted industrial park offers reasons for optimism. Liu Qi, the chairman of PQI Industrial Technology Group, opened an $18 million factory there last year, equipped with whirring robots that pound out car parts for the German automaker BMW.The factory, and the more than 200 jobs it has created, is just one small part of a grand plan led by China\u2019s government to rejuvenate Shenyang, a city of eight million, by replacing stumbling state industries with modern manufacturing and start-up companies.\u201cWhen things hit bottom, there is an opportunity for things to go up,\u201d Mr. Liu, 46, said.Whether the rejuvenation happens will shape not just the future of Shenyang, but also, potentially, the entire Chinese economy. The city\u2019s woes represent a broader problem: There are too many unproductive, debt-laden factories that are losing business as China\u2019s growth slows. If Beijing fails to overhaul those crumbling industries and revive the communities that rely on them, Shenyang and the surrounding area \u2014 and other similar regions \u2014 could weigh heavily on the country\u2019s economic progress.The story of Shenyang will probably sound familiar in places like Midwestern towns in the United States that have seen important industries decline or depart. During China\u2019s go-go years, when factories, roads and housing were constructed with wild abandon, the city\u2019s heavy industrial companies, many of them owned by the state, boomed.A rush of wealth was plowed into new apartment towers and shopping malls in Shenyang. The city still has an industrial air, with central office blocks designed in a near-uniform drab brown, matching its factory complexes.But as China\u2019s investment binge fizzled, Shenyang and its factories sputtered. Last year, the economy of the northeastern province of Liaoning, of which Shenyang is the capital, shrank 2.5 percent \u2014 a shocking figure in a country accustomed to seemingly endless expansion. Other major cities have sped ahead of Shenyang in the development of the high-tech and service companies expected to propel China\u2019s future growth.The entire northeast of the country, where much heavy industry has been concentrated, runs the risk of being left badly behind. The decay of this factory zone has left Beijing with a similar knotty problem to the one that has plagued Washington for decades: how to resurrect down-on-their-luck areas.In the United States, President Trump plans to streamline regulation, cut corporate taxes and renegotiate trade pacts to bring factory jobs back to troubled towns.Around the world, state intervention to attempt to stimulate a domestic economy is not unusual. But officials in China, as is often the case, have adopted a much more hands-on approach. With lavish incentives and initiatives, they are trying to attract investment to the region and to upgrade its industries.Shenyang is a crucial test case. The city has set up a $7 million fund to support high-tech industries, promised a $30,000 bonus for some technology firms, and offered to pare the corporate tax rate for companies in favored sectors.Mr. Liu\u2019s factory opened inside the China-Germany Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park, introduced in late 2015 to try to attract advanced production in robotics, automotive components and other industrial sectors. The government offers a 30 percent discount on land, streamlined regulations and other perks for companies that set up in the facility. PQI is now negotiating for rent breaks and cheap land for his current factory, as well as for future investments.Zhang Yanzan, the park\u2019s deputy director, says that, since its opening, more than 140 factories have been completed or are underway, hauling in a total investment of nearly $6 billion. \u201cWe hope this park can be an example for other areas,\u201d he said.The city authorities are also striving to persuade local college graduates to start companies in Shenyang by offering subsidies. The effort is focused on a shopping arcade of fast-food restaurants and computer outlets that had Start-Up and Innovation Street added to its name in 2015.On the top floor of one office tower in the area is an incubator called Phoenix Valley, founded by two Shenyang-born businessmen. One room is a cafe, where budding entrepreneurs swap tips over cappuccinos and browse shelves of books on business building. Next door, desks can be rented in a communal office for 300 renminbi, or about $45, a month. The incubator has more than 100 members and will soon open a second office in the city.\u201cThe development in Shenyang is not as fast as in Beijing and Shenzhen, but if start-ups are really good at what they do, they will have more potential to grow,\u201d said Hong Qifan, who founded Phoenix Valley with his business partner, Ma Ke, citing China\u2019s capital and one of its southern boom towns.Shenyang\u2019s taxpayers are contributing to the effort. Some entrepreneurs are eligible for subsidized housing, with rent costing the equivalent of $30 a month. This year, Phoenix Valley received a cash handout from the central and municipal governments worth more than $70,000. Local officials also helped the incubator\u2019s founders negotiate a below-market rent for its headquarters.Occupying one of the Phoenix Valley desks recently was Tao Qiuchen, 25, a Shenyang native who has founded a company called Hong Mo Fang Enterprise Management, which plans parties. In less than a year, Mr. Tao has hired 20 employees, thanks in part to the local government, which pays the interest on the $24,000 bank loan he took out to start the business.The government programs \u201care definitely helping the economy,\u201d he said.Still, Innovation Street pales in comparison to the efforts in hot spots like Beijing and Hangzhou, a city in the east, which have not only higher salaries, but also entire neighborhoods of start-up centers. And the residents of Phoenix Valley complain that venture capital and talent are scarce in Shenyang.Other initiatives in the city seem to be generating more buzz than business. In April, Shenyang opened a branch of the provincial free-trade zone, in which companies can benefit from reduced red tape, discounted land and other advantages. At its offices, in the corner of a gargantuan, columned hall worthy of a Star Trek set, dozens of businesspeople and their agents lined up to register companies.But the zone\u2019s rules do not require these businesspeople to start any actual operations there. Tian Jiawei, a manager at an agricultural company based near Shenyang, registered an export-import firm, but has no plans to open an office or hire workers.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of tax break I might enjoy, but I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity,\u201d he said.More problematic: Shenyang\u2019s incentive programs are not unique. \u201cEvery province and city in China has policies to encourage investment and start-ups,\u201d said Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIf northeast cities just do the same, they won\u2019t be able to compete with those who are already ahead of them.\u201dThe result is that, even with its active officials, China may find reviving its troubled industrial towns every bit as challenging as Western countries like the United States do.\u201cShenyang still has a long way to go,\u201d Mr. Liu, the factory owner, said. \u201cIt is like grass that you burn to the ground. It is going to grow back. You just don\u2019t see it at the moment.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump in Missouri Lays Groundwork for Tax Overhaul but Offers No Details", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPRINGFIELD, Mo. \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday pitched a sweeping tax overhaul that he said would unleash the American economy and help ordinary people, promising that a large corporate tax cut and trims to individual income tax rates would boost the middle class.The politically difficult legislation has yet to be drafted despite months of private negotiations among members of the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Time is running out for enactment of the bill before year\u2019s end, and the White House is keenly aware that if Mr. Trump fails to deliver his promised tax cuts, he will emerge from his first year in office devoid of any major legislative accomplishments.\u201cThis is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hard-working Americans,\u201d the president said as he stood in front of a giant American flag at the Loren Cook Company, a fan manufacturer. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be disappointed by Congress.\u201d\u201cLower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers,\u201d he added.And with the economy growing at 3 percent \u2014 Mr. Trump exulted over the figure during his speech on Wednesday, saying, \u201cI happen to be one who thinks it can go much higher\u201d \u2014 the Federal Reserve has warned that it would move to curb faster growth for fear of inflation.\u201cCorporate profits are at record highs,\u201d said Michael Linden, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. \u201cCorporations are sitting on a vast amount of capital. Reducing their tax burden would have absolutely no effect on workers.\u201dBusiness groups eager to see substantial tax cuts argued the opposite.\u201cA reform package that lowers tax rates and encourages investment will enable and encourage more people to start businesses,\u201d Karen Kerrigan, the president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, said in a statement. \u201cOf course, if small-business owners can keep more of their hard-earned capital, they will reinvest those resources back into their employees and enterprises.\u201dThat is a minority view among economists, but one that has been gaining ground.For many years, experts agreed that corporate taxes did not affect wages. American companies were stuck in the United States, so they had no leverage to lower workers\u2019 wages. Instead, taxes reduced profits.The rise of globalization changed that calculus \u2014 particularly in industries like manufacturing, where it is relatively easy to move jobs overseas. The conventional estimate now is that workers bear about a quarter of the burden of taxation, but some estimates are much higher.\u201cIf a firm faces a higher tax rate, you\u2019re not going to pass that off to shareholders or consumers because you\u2019re competing in a global marketplace,\u201d said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. \u201cSo it\u2019s labor that bears the brunt.\u201dIt follows that when taxes are reduced, labor gets some of the benefit.Mr. Trump called on Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday to come together to support the effort. He then singled out Senator Claire McCaskill, Missouri\u2019s Democratic senator, who faces re-election next year, for a pointed threat.\u201cShe must do this for you,\u201d the president said of delivering on his tax-cut promises. \u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t do it for you, you have to vote her out office.\u201dBeyond the politics, Mr. Trump made plain the broad outlines of his vision for overhauling the tax code: a combination of deep cuts for businesses large and small as well as for investors and the wealthiest, along with reductions for middle-class people, only partly paid for by eliminating some deductions and boosting economic growth. He spoke of a \u201cbusiness\u201d tax cut rather than strictly a corporate one, a nod to his proposal to allow small businesses and large partnerships to take advantage of the same rate as corporations, a costly change.In 2012, the neighboring state of Kansas slashed its taxation of business income, prompting a stampede by wealthy Kansans \u2014 including the head football coach at the University of Kansas \u2014 to turn themselves into businesses for tax purposes.Democrats seized on the disconnect between Mr. Trump\u2019s tax-cutting message and the large reductions for businesses and high earners that he has championed.\u201cIf the president wants to use populism to sell his tax plan, he ought to consider actually putting his money where his mouth is and putting forward a plan that puts the middle class, not the top 1 percent, first,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a conference call organized by progressive groups that are planning an intensive advertising and advocacy campaign to oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s tax-cutting initiative.Mr. Trump portrayed his plan as an evenhanded approach that would help both businesses and working people, suggesting that his call for scrapping deductions would harm wealthy people such as himself.\u201cI\u2019m speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you,\u201d remarked Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns, making it impossible to assess the personal effect of his proposals. But independent analyses of the broad outlines have concluded that wealthy taxpayers would get most of the benefits. One proposal, the elimination of estate taxation, would benefit only the wealthy.In his speech, Mr. Trump hinted at the challenge of securing a cut of the scale he wants, saying, \u201cIdeally \u2014 and I say this for our secretary of the Treasury \u2014 we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent.\u201dAdministration officials are also weighing leaving the top individual tax rate, which they wanted to lower to 35 percent, at its current 39.6 percent level.The timetable has slipped considerably, as well. Mr. Mnuchin noted last week that his goal to produce a tax proposal by August never materialized.In laying out what he called his principles for a tax overhaul, Mr. Trump made no mention of insisting that cuts be offset by corresponding increases to avoid adding to the deficit, essentially acknowledging publicly what his aides have privately for weeks: that he is willing to accept a plan that adds to the deficit, which had long been considered anathema to many conservative Republicans.If Mr. Trump lacked specifics for his plan, the White House made sure he would not lack for cheerleaders. In the hours after he spoke, several members of his cabinet, including some who have little to do with his economic agenda, issued statements praising the president\u2019s effort. Among them were Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the interior, who said it would allow families to better afford vacations to national parks.But many Republicans, even those broadly supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, have scaled back their ambitions, conceding that the calendar makes a full-scale tax rewrite unlikely and resolving instead to push through the largest tax cut possible by New Year\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s important to get this done this year,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, \u201cand at some point, we\u2019ll have to make the decision, \u2018O.K., how much of the tax-code fight can we get into and still have the kinds of reduction in rates and achievable results that mean more American jobs and better American jobs?\u2019\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Springfield, and Binyamin Appelbaum from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Houston Airports Closed, Airlines Cancel Thousands of Flights", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than half a dozen airports in and around Houston, including one of the nation\u2019s busiest aviation hubs, remained closed Monday amid catastrophic flooding and unprecedented rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Harvey.More than 54 million passengers made their way through the Houston Airport System last year. Most of them came through George Bush Intercontinental, which has flights to more than 70 international destinations and to more destinations in Mexico than any other airport in the United States.Together the airports support more than 220,000 local jobs, injecting more than $26 billion to the local economy, according to the Houston Airport System. George Bush Intercontinental is one of the largest hubs for United Airlines, which employs more than 11,000 people in the areas affected by Tropical Storm Harvey.It\u2019s typical, after a storm, for it to take a few days for flight schedules to return to normal, but the situation in Houston is unusual. The powerful storm stalled over the Texas Gulf Coast during the weekend and the National Hurricane Center said that it is expecting additional rainfall accumulations of up to 25 inches across upper Texas. A tornado watch is also up for parts of southeast Texas. \u201cDo not attempt to travel if you are in a safe place,\u201d the center said in an advisory on Monday, \u201cand do not drive into flooded roadways.\u201dStranded and delayed air travelers took to the social media accounts of airlines to ask for help and, in some cases, express frustration.Amid the devastation, some airlines are offering miles to customers who donate to relief efforts.

{"Headline": "U.S. Begins Nafta Negotiations With Harsh Words", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement is off to a rocky start.The Trump administration lectured Canada and Mexico on the failures of the current agreement at an opening news conference Wednesday morning, while behind closed doors negotiators began to seek significant concessions from America\u2019s neighbors.\u201cWe feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,\u201d said Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who is leading the United States team aiming to overhaul the 25-year-old agreement.The Canadian and Mexican representatives were publicly pleasant, emphasizing their commitment to regional trade and the benefits resulting from a regional alliance. But both nations also say the current agreement is not tilted against the United States.The talks that began Wednesday are the first of several scheduled rounds between now and the end of the year, when the three nations hope to conclude a deal. It is a very fast timetable in the world of international negotiations, reflecting political imperatives in all three nations more than the practical realities of an immensely complex negotiation.Both Mexico and the United States have national elections scheduled next year.The overarching issue is the importance of trade deficits. Americans buy more goods and services from Mexico than Mexicans buy from the United States. Last year, the difference was $55.6 billion. The Trump administration regards this number as an indictment of the current trade deal \u2014 evidence that Mexico is taking advantage of the United States.While trade with Canada has been more balanced in recent years, Mr. Lighthizer said Wednesday that over time the United States has run a significant trade deficit with Canada, too.Such trade deficits, Mr. Lighthizer said, \u201ccan\u2019t continue.\u201d President Trump has made it clear that he regards trade deficits as a primary measure of the nation\u2019s economic health.Mexico and Canada, however, are united in discounting the importance of trade deficits. Many economists agree that the focus on bilateral trade is misplaced. A nation may run a deficit with one trading partner and a surplus with another. What matters is the totality.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.\u201cCanada doesn\u2019t view trade surpluses or deficits as a primary measure of whether trade works,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, said on Wednesday.Mexico has been even more pointed in resisting the assertion that there is a problem. The economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, told a Mexican Senate commission last week that he was \u201cdelighted to analyze the situation that we call \u2018trade rebalancing\u2019 if and when we manage to improve that through expanding trade, not restricting it.\u201dA key question looming over the negotiations is how the Trump administration\u2019s public bombast will translate into the details of the negotiations. The administration in its early months has repeatedly talked tough and then sought to conciliate trading partners.The administration, for example, insists that it wants to do away with a system of independent arbitration that allows companies to seek the elimination of tariffs. The system has been used primarily by Mexican and Canadian companies to force the United States to abandon protectionist measures found to be in violation of the agreement.Another area of potential conflict concerns the automobile industry. The United States wants to discourage importation of auto parts from countries outside the Nafta region. Under the current agreement, a car assembled in Mexico can be imported into the United States without paying an import tax if at least 62.5 percent of the car, measured by value, was made in North America. The Trump administration wants to raise that bar, and to require that a significant portion of those parts come from the United States.The United Automobile Workers union has long sought such a change.But carmakers are wary. The importation of some cheap parts helps to hold down the cost of the final product. In general, a higher share of Nafta components, and a higher share of American components, means a more expensive car.\u201cMany in the business community feel that the Nafta is working quite well and they don\u2019t want disruption in existing supply chains,\u201d said Jeffrey J. Schott, a Nafta expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Both Canada and Mexico said Wednesday that they opposed specific standards for the share of car parts coming from any of the three nations.There is general agreement among the three nations that Nafta needs to be modernized. It was written before the advent of Internet-based commerce, for example, and there is broad support for stronger enforcement of workplace and environmental protections. Indeed, the three nations already renegotiated Nafta once as part of the discarded Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.Some issues appear relatively straightforward. The Trump administration is eager to insert provisions addressing currency manipulation. Canada and Mexico float their currencies, and are unlikely to resist the symbolic gesture.But on more substantive issues, both Canada and Mexico have shown a growing willingness to resist American demands.Luis de la Calle, a former Nafta trade negotiator for Mexico, said the shock value of Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster and threats had diminished since the presidential election. \u201cMost people thought back then that he had powers to impose duties, close the border, prevent investment,\u201d Mr. de la Calle said. \u201cNow people have learned what trade experts knew all along, that he doesn\u2019t have those powers.\u201dMr. Trump also will need to win congressional support for a revised agreement. Democrats, who have long sought changes to Nafta, share many of his stated goals, but Mr. Trump\u2019s political problems could complicate any alliance.There is also little if any congressional support for the administration\u2019s threat to withdraw from the trade agreement if Canada and Mexico resist improvements.Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, said Tuesday that \u201cbeing bombastic\u201d was not \u201cthe mature way\u201d to seek changes. \u201cUltimately you can have huge disruptions in the economy if you don\u2019t handle this like an adult,\u201d he said.Ms. Freeland spoke first on Wednesday, and began by holding up pictures of American and Canadian firefighters working together, images that she said \u201cillustrate the deep friendship that our countries share.\u201dMr. Guajardo Villarreal struck a similar tone. \u201cNafta has been more than a trade agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made us think of ourselves as a region.\u201dMr. Lighthizer began by acknowledging that Nafta had benefited groups including American farmers and communities along the Mexican border.Then he insisted that the agreement was broadly damaging to the United States, causing the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201cThe views of the president about Nafta, which I completely share, are well known,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cI want to be clear that he is not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters.\u201dHe concluded, \u201cAnd now, we will get down to work.\u201dElisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iran, Rouhani Begins 2nd Term With Signs He\u2019s Yielding to Hard-Liners", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 President Hassan Rouhani, endorsed by Iran\u2019s supreme leader on Thursday with a nationally televised cheek-kiss, is starting his second term under newly intense pressure from both hard-line opponents and many of his own reform-minded supporters.Now, as Iran prepares for his second inauguration on Saturday, some of the forces that helped give Mr. Rouhani a 24 million-vote mandate in May are concerned he will not fulfill his promise of appointing women and young politicians to his 18-member cabinet, and instead is running nominations by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\u201cWe supported him during the campaign, but now there is no place for us,\u201d said Jila Baniyaghoob, a women\u2019s rights advocate, who said she was informed 10 days ago that there would be no female ministers in the cabinet. \u201cClearly, Mr. Rouhani does not believe in the capabilities of women,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is so disappointing.\u201dThe reform-minded Mr. Rouhani has always occupied a precarious position leading a country that is governed both by a religious ruler and a democratically elected president and parliament. But experts say this is a particularly challenging moment.Closed in by rivals in Iran\u2019s other centers of power \u2014 the supreme leader, influential clergy members and the judiciary \u2014 Mr. Rouhani can steer debate but not call the shots. Mr. Khamenei, who often publicly opposes the president but has supported him behind the scenes on key issues like the nuclear agreement and foreign outreach, is far more interested in economic growth than social change.In Thursday\u2019s endorsement ceremony, the ayatollah advised the president to \u201cpay attention to the people\u2019s problems, which today are primarily the economy and living conditions.\u201d He also urged Mr. Rouhani to have extensive interaction with the world and to \u201cstand strongly against any domination,\u201d state media reported.The public pressure on Mr. Rouhani turned personal three weeks ago when his brother, Hossein Fereydoun, was detained by the hard-line judiciary on corruption charges. After a brief court appearance, Mr. Fereydoun was hospitalized, for what has variously been described as high blood pressure or a nervous breakdown. (The president changed his surname to Rouhani, which means \u201ccleric,\u201d when he became an Islamic cleric.)When Mr. Fereydoun, a former ambassador to the United Nations, paid the record-high $13 million bail, some observers said it only proved the accusations because they could not explain such wealth given his career as a diplomat and think-tank chief.\u201cRouhani faces serious pressures,\u201d said Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite cleric from Qom who supports change in Iran. \u201cPerhaps too many. And let\u2019s face it, he does not have the final say on many issues.\u201dOne thing that does fall within Mr. Rouhani\u2019s power as president is the formation of his cabinet, scheduled to be presented after the inauguration Saturday. But several reformists said that instead of selecting the ministers personally over the past two months, Mr. Rouhani has been consulting with Mr. Khamenei more than is typical.Customs prescribe that the supreme leader would weigh in on picking ministers for some sensitive positions, such as the foreign minister and those overseeing intelligence and oil, but not, say, culture, sports, transportation, health and labor. Analysts say Mr. Rouhani decided to involve Mr. Khamenei more deeply as insurance against potential hard-line attacks against the incoming cabinet.But many of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s leading supporters in the May election had hoped the new cabinet would represent a new generation of women, youths and daring politicians, ready to implement Mr. Rouhani\u2019s agenda and curb the influence of hard-liners.Instead, although all the positions are not yet filled, it looks like the ministers will be a delicate mix of older technocrats, don\u2019t-rock-the-boat moderates and even some hard-liners. Reformists are now saying the 18 slots will all be filled by men, dashing hopes built up during Mr. Rouhani\u2019s campaign.\u201cThe president referred to \u2018restrictions\u2019 and said that he was unable to use women,\u201d Mahmoud Sadeghi, a parliamentarian, told the reformist newspaper Etemaad.\u201cBut he pointed out that women candidates will be used as directors and vice presidents,\u201d Mr. Sadeghi added. \u201cHe also mentioned that the cabinet may change midway, at which stage, women may be used.\u201dThis does not satisfy advocates like Mrs. Baniyaghoob. \u201cWe gave a list of capable women,\u201d she noted. \u201cInstead again they choose incapable officials, and again women do not get the chance to gain governing experience.\u201dThe deeper involvement of Mr. Khamenei in the cabinet picks comes amid resistance from hard-liners to nearly every move Mr. Rouhani has made since his re-election in May.The supreme leader himself criticized the president over his cultural policies, saying that his government is too lenient toward what Mr. Khamenei calls \u201cWesternization.\u201d Clerics denounced Mr. Rouhani\u2019s signing of a multibillion-dollar deal with the French oil company Total, saying he should be investing in the nuclear program instead.Mr. Rouhani has also had public fights with the Revolutionary Guards, whom he has called an alternative \u201cgovernment with guns.\u201dMany of those who campaigned for Mr. Rouhani this spring in sweaty stadiums and posted pictures online of themselves in purple, his signature color, are now worried the president will choose pragmatism over promises.\u201cThey were so many people, so full of energy, we all felt that we will be able to achieve change,\u201d Ms. Rashidi recalled in an interview this week. \u201cI am worried that if people are disappointed there might be a backlash.\u201dMr. Meybodi, the reform-minded cleric, said Mr. Rouhani is like politicians everywhere, who promise change during elections.\u201cThere is one positive point: at least the hard-liners didn\u2019t win the elections,\u201d he added. \u201cIn that case, we\u2019d be much worse off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Portugal Dominated Angola for Centuries. Now the Roles Are Reversed.", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 How the roles have reversed: The colonizer, some Portuguese contend, has been colonized.The money flowing into Portugal comes from the colony it dominated, often brutally, for hundreds of years, Angola. Now, the African nation is a major oil producer that has been led for the last 38 years by Ms. dos Santos\u2019s father, President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos.\u201cAnd suddenly they were able to help us and to buy things that we cannot buy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a housekeeper buying your house. That is awkward.\u201dWith billions invested in Portugal, including in some of its biggest public companies, the Angolans have bought Portuguese wineries, newspapers, sports teams and other trophies of the super rich. With Portugal giving them access to the rest of Europe and beyond, they have been catapulted, in a few short years, to the world\u2019s jet set.In the past two years, her family has made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival: Ms. dos Santos sat in the front row of fashion shows, and Kim Kardashian cooed over a 404-carat diamond paraded at a party thrown last year by de Grisogono, the Swiss jeweler now owned by the dos Santos family.But in the moment, basking in the applause, Mr. dos Santos and a companion walked up to the stage and were hugged by the M.C., the star Will Smith, who shouted, \u201c500,000 euros! Yes, yes, yes!\u201dMr. Smith added, \u201cThey look way too young to have 500,000 euros.\u201dIt was an extraordinary turnaround for a country that had been dominated for centuries by Portugal, which exploited Angola for the slave trade and its natural resources, before falling into a long and costly civil war fueled by the Cold War.\u201cIt was an investor that was very welcome and, in certain moments, the only investor in Portugal,\u201d he said.The problem was how the money was obtained.Politicians and businesspeople in both countries say that Angola is dominated by allies of the president with tentacles in every corner of the economy, allowing them to amass great fortunes in politically connected deals under mysterious circumstances.As Angola\u2019s ruling elite sought to safeguard its wealth outside their country \u2014 knowing that Mr. dos Santos\u2019s rule would eventually end \u2014 Portugal\u2019s political and business elite more than obliged.Still, Mr. Silva said that Angola\u2019s growing power was a positive development. Unequal postcolonial relations, he said, would carry \u201cthe flavor of neocolonialism.\u201dPortuguese business leaders say that Angolan investments unfairly attract the kind of scrutiny that money from elsewhere, including China, does not.\u201cIt\u2019s not realistic that a small country like Portugal would be able to change that,\u201d said Mr. Amaral, a former Portuguese minister of industry and energy.Mr. Amaral said that all Angolans had to \u201cjustify the money\u201d they put into Portuguese banks by showing assets in Angola, to help prevent money laundering.\u201cWhen I see Isabel dos Santos putting money into Portugal because she has a number of big companies in Angola,\u201d he said, pointing to her big stake in Unitel, Angola\u2019s biggest cellphone operator, \u201cit is easy to justify.\u201d\u201cAfter, you can put another question: how she was able to create this company,\u201d Mr. Amaral added with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s another question. It\u2019s not my problem as a banking manager.\u201dIn a written reply to emailed questions, Ms. dos Santos told The New York Times that the egg anecdote was meant \u201cto show that since a young age I had an entrepreneurial spirit.\u201dBut in Angola, the story about the eggs fueled widespread ridicule and anger.Asked whether it was possible that Ms. dos Santos\u2019s fortune was self-made, Marcolino Moco, a former prime minister of Angola, said, \u201cIt\u2019s possible to make us laugh. All her wealth comes from the fact that her father is the law.\u201dThe oldest child of Angola\u2019s president, Ms. dos Santos, 44, has gained large or controlling shares in Angola\u2019s diamond, cellphone, banking and other industries over the years.In her email, Ms. dos Santos said that, beginning in the early 1990s, she had started \u201ca small beverage distribution and logistics business,\u201d as well as a restaurant, an event production company and a walkie-talkie business.Ms. dos Santos did not say where she had obtained the capital to invest in those businesses or in Unitel, which she now controls. She has also acquired big stakes in Portugal\u2019s banks, the Portuguese energy giant Galp, the Portuguese telecommunications company NOS, and other businesses.Ms. dos Santos\u2019s critics say she has tried to gain respectability in the West by using her ill-gotten gains in Angola and laundering them in Portugal \u2014 an accusation she rejects.\u201cIn my book respectability is not achieved by mingling with the \u2018right people,\u2019\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn my book respectability is something you gain and achieve through a lifetime of work, and actions worthy of esteem, coherent positive behavior, attitudes of good social standing and building a reputation with your friends and peers.\u201dRespectability, some Angolans have found, can be acquired in Portugal \u2014 and lost.But he was eventually investigated by the Portuguese authorities for his role in the bank, the Angolan subsidiary of Portugal\u2019s Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, which he headed for a decade until 2012. The bank was accused of misappropriating $5.7 billion by giving out loans \u2014 to the political elite and to Mr. Sobrinho himself \u2014 that were never repaid. Mr. Sobrinho has denied all accusations and has not been charged despite the long investigation.But he is now regarded as a \u201cthief\u201d in Portugal, he said. He has sold off his newspapers. He said he had at least recovered his assets, which the Portuguese authorities had frozen for a few years. A court reaffirmed in May that the state cannot seize his assets, but prosecutors say that Mr. Sobrinho is still being investigated.His assets include six apartments he owns with his family in Estoril Sol Residence in Cascais, the \u201cAngolans\u2019 building.\u201d Brazilians, Russians and Portuguese, including some who made money doing business in Angola, also owned apartments but were never investigated for money laundering, he said.\u201cOnly Angolans,\u201d Mr. Sobrinho said, with bitterness.\u201cThe king used to live there,\u201d he added.An earlier version of this article misstated when Kim Kardashian tweeted about a 404-carat diamond. It was in 2016, not \u201cthis year.\u201dPaulo Guilherme Figueiredo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Walmart Academy, Training Better Managers. But With a Better Future?", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "A new program for store supervisors and department managers may make them better employees but may not help them reach the middle class.Supported byFULTON, N.Y. \u2014 The procession started in toys, marched through electronics, down into grocery and past the registers at the front end.Fifty-one men and women, dressed in shimmering blue and yellow caps and gowns, walked through the Walmart to receive certificates on a stage set up in the store\u2019s lawn and garden department. A bagpiper, wearing a kilt, led the graduates through the aisles.For Roy Walts, it was the first time he had ever graduated from anything.He dropped out of school in the ninth grade after his father died of cancer and his stepmother told him to leave the house. At 15, he lived in a Salvation Army clothing collection box. One Christmas night he ate cookies from a Dumpster.So as Mr. Walts, 53, crossed the stage that April morning in front of the local mayor; Walmart\u2019s regional manager for upstate New York; and his son, who had worked overnight stocking freezers, he had butterflies in his stomach.\u201cI thought for sure I would trip walking up on that stage,\u201d recalled Mr. Walts, the automotive department manager.Mr. Walts is a graduate of Walmart Academy, one of the largest employer training programs in the country. Since March 2016, Walmart has put more than 150,000 of its store supervisors and department managers through the training, which, over several weeks, teaches skills like merchandising and how to motivate employees.An additional 380,000 entry-level workers have taken part in a separate training program called Pathways. Most of these workers receive a $1-an-hour raise for completing the course.American companies spend about $170 billion a year on formal employee training, but most of that instruction focuses on workers with college degrees.Walmart has spent $2.7 billion on training and raising wages for 1.2 million of its store workers over the past two years \u2014 an investment that reflects the pressures the company faces in the retail industry.Fighting Amazon for sales, Walmart is trying to make its stores more pleasant places to shop. That requires a well-trained work force with a sense of purpose and self-worth, qualities that can be difficult to nurture in lower-wage workers.But it\u2019s not clear whether all this training is teaching workers valuable skills that could enable them to move into the middle class, or whether it is mostly making them better Walmart employees.And even with more skills, many retail workers may never be able to earn what factory workers made in places like Fulton, a faded manufacturing hub near Syracuse.\u201cIt is going to be very hard to replace what we\u2019ve lost,\u201d said Fulton\u2019s mayor, Ronald Woodward. \u201cRetail jobs don\u2019t compare to manufacturing.\u201dIn a study funded by Walmart, researchers at the National Skills Coalition, a nonprofit group that promotes investment in training, found that 60 percent of retail workers are not proficient in reading and 70 percent have difficulty working with numbers.The Pathways program addresses some of these issues by teaching \u201cretail\u201d math, or basic numerical skills a worker might need at the register or stocking shelves.The academy is geared to more-experienced supervisors and department managers. Working in classrooms set up in 150 Walmarts around the country, employees learn how to calculate profit and loss statements and how to run their department like a small business.Managers are also taught to get to know their employees and understand their home life.Walmart was once considered to be a pariah of rural America, vilified by some \u2014 especially people who shopped elsewhere \u2014 for wiping out local businesses by selling cheap goods made in China. Now, Walmart is rebranding itself as a company focused on the needs of its workers and the fate of small towns and hardscrabble cities.In the past year, Walmart has spent about $650,000 running television ads about Walmart Academy, according to Alphonso, a TV data company. It has spent $17.6 million on an ad highlighting the company\u2019s commitment to buy $250 billion in goods made or grown in America. That ad features scenes of factory workers and their families set to the squeals of Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cDream On.\u201d\u201cThe caps and gowns, the symbolism, these are not trivial things,\u201d said Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\u201cThey are trying to create this feeling among employees that \u2018we are the store.\u2019 They are taking small-town America and putting it into Walmart. Is that a bad thing? No.\u201dOther researchers say what many Walmart workers need most is not training, but higher wages. The training programs, they say, may be helpful in enhancing employee loyalty and performance, but increasing pay would benefit the workers most.Two years ago, the company raised its starting wage to $9 an hour, a $1.75 increase from the federal minimum wage.\u201cIf Walmart really wanted to invest in its workers, it would start people at $15 companywide and adequately staff its stores so they can service customers,\u201d said Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the National Employment Law Project, which lobbies for low-wage workers.Fulton, a city of about 11,400 people, was once known for producing one very important thing: chocolate.Specifically, Fulton was home to a factory that made Nestl\u00e9 Crunch bars. On humid days, before a summer rain, the smell of chocolate wafted through the city.The company shut the factory and moved operations to Wisconsin in 2003 to consolidate its production facilities and \u201cincrease the utilization of assets,\u201d a Nestl\u00e9 spokeswoman said in an email.\u201cI think what everyone misses most,\u201d said Geoff Raponi, manager of the Fulton Walmart Supercenter, \u201cis the smell.\u201dThey also miss the jobs \u2014 more than 1,500 of them when the factory was booming in the mid-1980s, according to Mayor Woodward. The local Walmart has about 300 employees.Mac Guile, 24, was not quite 6 years old when the chocolate works closed. He was living with his grandmother, who poured molten chocolate into bars, and his grandfather, who delivered supplies to the factory. They lived in a spacious house across from a McDonald\u2019s, where Mr. Guile was known as the store\u2019s mascot because of his name \u2014 Mac \u2014 and the fact that he ate breakfast there almost every day.After Nestl\u00e9 left town, Mr. Guile moved with his grandparents into a trailer. There were no more daily McDonald\u2019s breakfasts, and often there was little food at all. Mr. Guile and his younger brother took baths with water warmed on the stove.At 19, Mr. Guile got a job at the Fulton Walmart Supercenter as a part-time janitor, earning $7.50 an hour. He didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for utilities in his apartment for the first few months, so he showered at a relative\u2019s house.He now runs the meat department, a wall of refrigerated shelves, spanning from chicken thighs to Hofmann\u2019s hot dogs, a Syracuse-area favorite.He likes meat because of the fast pace and customer demands. He has memorized the internal temperature that pork, chicken and beef need to reach for safety, and recommends a variety of sauces and rubs.The Walmart Academy classes appealed to Mr. Guile because they were more like discussions than lectures. Instead of being scolded for using their phones, students were encouraged to look things up. He was impressed that the program was held in a real classroom equipped with tablets.The most useful lesson Mr. Guile learned at the academy was how to motivate his workers. \u201cHave more one-on-one conversations, that is key,\u201d said Mr. Guile, who has a brown beard and a tattoo that proclaims, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201dHe now earns about $15 an hour, has a 401(k) retirement account with matching contributions from Walmart, and receives bonuses.His former supervisor recommended him for the assistant store manager program, which could put him on track to manage a store one day \u2014 a job that pays an average of $170,000 a year.Many of Mr. Guile\u2019s family members also work in the store. His sister works in the deli, his cousin\u2019s mother works at the front end and his girlfriend is a cake decorator in the bakery.Some of his relatives who don\u2019t work at the store ask him for help. He buys some family members new shoes and clothing for school.\u201cThe whole town can\u2019t work at Walmart,\u201d Mr. Guile said.When Fulton\u2019s Walmart Academy graduated its first class, the store presented the mayor with a gift. It was a brick pulled from the rubble of the Nestl\u00e9 factory, which is being demolished 14 years after Nestl\u00e9 left.\u201cA piece of Nestle History,\u201d read the inscription on the brick. \u201cPresented this day 25th of April 2017.\u201dMr. Woodward, who is serving his third four-year term as mayor, appreciates Walmart\u2019s training program but says it will take more to save his city\u2019s economy.\u201cAnytime a company offers training, that is good,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t all going to run the store.\u201dMr. Woodward, a former maintenance supervisor at Nestl\u00e9 who made $89,000 a year, says he was one of the last two workers to leave the plant when it closed. His second-floor office in City Hall is like a time capsule, frozen in Fulton\u2019s glorious industrial past.There are black-and-white photos of a campaign banner for Theodore Roosevelt hanging over a downtown street, and of a long-gone horse racing track teeming with spectators in suits and bowler hats.A few years ago, Fulton tried to restart chocolate production. A confectionery company, owned partly by a consortium of cocoa suppliers from Ivory Coast, revived the Nestl\u00e9 property with help from the state. But the venture failed.The site\u2019s most recent owner stripped the factory of wiring to sell for scrap and walked away, the mayor said, leaving empty brick buildings behind.From his office, Mr. Woodward, 68, talks on a flip phone and peers out over his glasses with eyes like an owl\u2019s.He is busy working to dredge a public lake that is choked by algae and closed to swimming at the height of another summer.\u201cI love this town,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. \u201cI will do anything to help it.\u201dThat includes showing up one morning at the Walmart to attend the academy graduation.Mr. Woodward didn\u2019t have the heart to tell the store employees that the Walmart was not technically in his city.The store lists a Fulton mailing address but is actually in the neighboring town of Granby. That means Fulton misses out on the property tax revenue the store generates.The retailer does pay Fulton for water and sewage, an average of $11,703 a year, according to the city. But that pales next to the $364,218 the Nestl\u00e9 plant spent on those services in 2002. The chocolate company was also paying Fulton $166,253 in annual property taxes.Mr. Woodward appreciates that the supercenter provides steady jobs during a tough economic time. But in his mind, these are not the kind of jobs that earned Fulton the nickname \u201cthe largest small city in the state.\u201d In the past few decades, Birds Eye foods and Miller Brewing also closed plants in the Fulton area that once employed hundreds of people.\u201cYou could graduate from high school, work at a place like Nestl\u00e9, buy a car and send your kids to college,\u201d Mr. Woodward said.When the Nestl\u00e9 plant was roaring in 1985, the average wage in Oswego County, which includes Fulton, was about $51,000. Today, the average pay is 18 percent less, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency.Walmart declined to disclose the wages at the Fulton store. But the company said that at its stores in New York State, full-time workers earned an average of $14.10 an hour. Part-time workers make an average of $11.10 an hour.The company says its training programs are intended to help employees advance into higher-paying jobs at Walmart or in other industries.\u201cWhether they are coming to us for two years or 20 years, we want them to have the skills that allow them to create opportunities,\u201d said Kathleen McLaughlin, who runs the Walmart Foundation and also holds the title chief sustainability officer.Walmart has been working with the National Retail Federation, a trade association, to help devise standards for a certificate that retail workers could earn for gaining certain interpersonal skills like how to deal with angry customers. The hope is that certificate holders will have an easier time finding a job or getting promoted.Walmart points out that more than a quarter of its 1.2 million store workers are in supervisory and manager positions and that there are frequently openings for managerial jobs.And Walmart workers who stay in entry-level jobs over many years can earn up to $17 an hour nationwide.Activists and unions say the starting wage should be higher. But Ms. McLaughlin, who worked for two decades at McKinsey, the global consulting company, said increasing entry-level wages could do more harm than good. If the starting wage is too high, she said, employers will be less likely to hire unskilled, inexperienced workers.\u201cIn contrast to only increasing wages,\u201d Ms. McLaughlin said in an email, \u201cwe believe investing in people and developing their skills gives them access to more choice of jobs that reflect their particular talents and passions.\u201dAbout a month ago, Ashley VanHorn was stocking shelves in the Fulton store when she overheard two little girls tell their father they wanted to work at Walmart one day.\u201cYou can do better than this,\u201d Ms. VanHorn recalled the man telling them.Working at Walmart was never part of Ms. VanHorn\u2019s plan, either. She remembers going with her father to register at Cayuga Community College in Fulton. They rode their bikes to the campus because they didn\u2019t have a car.Ms. VanHorn, 27, described her father as someone \u201cwho could build a house with his bare hands\u201d but had faced some financial challenges. He was so insistent on enrolling his daughter in college that he filled out most of the paperwork himself.Ms. VanHorn wanted to be a social worker, but a few credits shy of getting her degree, she became pregnant and dropped out of college. Soon after, she got a job at Walmart.\u201cI know I let my dad down,\u201d she said.She started out in the health and beauty department and eventually moved to grocery, where she now manages dry goods. Her manager says Ms. VanHorn, who earns about $15 an hour, has what it takes to be a salaried assistant manager overseeing several departments and making nearly $20,000 more a year.But Ms. VanHorn worries that the longer hours as an assistant manager would mean less time with her two children. She also hopes to go back to college someday.On graduation day, Ms. VanHorn didn\u2019t know what to expect. Like many of the graduates in her Walmart Academy class, she had never taken part in a graduation ceremony because she didn\u2019t finish high school.As the procession made its way through the aisles and the bagpiper played, Ms. VanHorn spotted her father, sitting on a folding chair in the lawn and garden section.After the ceremony, he told Ms. VanHorn he was proud of her.\u201cThis was not the dream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the dream does change.\u201dRobert Gebeloff and Sapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cold War and America\u2019s Delusion of Victory", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyThe Cold War as a system of states ended on a cold and gray December day in Moscow in 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Soviet Union out of existence. Communism itself, in its Marxist-Leninist form, had ceased to exist as a practical ideal for how to organize society.But the Cold War as an ideological struggle disappeared only in part, despite Communism\u2019s implosion. On the American side, not so much changed on that day. The Cold War was over, and the United States had won it. But most Americans still believed that they could only be safe if the world looked more like their own country and if the world\u2019s governments abided by the will of the United States.Ideas and assumptions that had built up over generations persisted, despite the disappearance of the Soviet threat. Instead of a more limited and achievable American foreign policy, most policy makers from both parties believed that the United States could then, at minimal cost or risk, act on its own imperatives.America\u2019s post-Cold War triumphalism came in two versions. First was the Clinton version, which promoted a prosperity agenda of market values on a global scale. Its lack of purpose in international affairs was striking, but its domestic political instincts were probably right: Americans were tired of foreign entanglements and wanted to enjoy \u201cthe peace dividend.\u201dAs a result, the 1990s was a lost opportunity for international cooperation, particularly to combat disease, poverty and inequality. The most glaring examples of these omissions were former Cold War battlefields like Afghanistan, Congo and Nicaragua, where the United States could not have cared less about what happened \u2014 once the Cold War was over.The second was the Bush version. Where President Bill Clinton emphasized prosperity, President George W. Bush emphasized predominance. In between, of course, stood Sept. 11. It is possible that the Bush version would never have come into being had it not been for the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington carried out by Islamist fanatics (a renegade faction, in fact, of an American Cold War alliance).The Cold War experience clearly conditioned the United States response to these atrocities. Instead of targeted military strikes and global police cooperation, which would have been the most sensible reaction, the Bush administration chose this moment of unchallenged global hegemony to lash out and occupy Afghanistan and Iraq. These actions had no meaning in a strategic sense, creating 21st-century colonies under the rule of a Great Power with no appetite for colonial rule.But the United States did not act out of strategic purpose. It acted because its people were understandably angry and fearful. And it acted because it could. The Bush version was directed by foreign policy advisers who thought of the world predominantly in Cold War terms; they stressed power projection, territorial control and regime change.The post-Cold War era was therefore not an aberration but a continuity and confirmation of an absolute historical purpose for the United States. Gradually, however, over the course of the generation that has passed since the Cold War, the United States has become less and less able to afford global predominance.As America entered a new century, its main aim should have been to bring other nations into the fold of international norms and the rule of law, especially as its own power diminishes. Instead, the United States did what declining superpowers often do: engage in futile, needless wars far from its borders, in which short-term security is mistaken for long-term strategic goals. The consequence is an America less prepared than it could have been to deal with the big challenges of the future: the rise of China and India, the transfer of economic power from West to East, and systemic challenges like climate change and disease epidemics.In retrospect, the economic transition to capitalism was a catastrophe for most Russians. It is also clear that the West should have dealt with post-Cold War Russia better than it did. Both the West and Russia would have been considerably more secure today if the chance for Russia to join the European Union, and possibly even NATO, had at least been kept open in the 1990s.Instead, their exclusion has given Russians the sense of being outcasts and victims \u2014 which, in turn, has given credence to embittered jingoists like President Vladimir Putin, who see all the disasters that have befallen the country over the past generation as an American plot to reduce and isolate it. Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritarianism and bellicosity have been sustained by genuine popular support.The shocks of the 1990s have given way to an uninhibited cynicism among Russians, which not only encompasses a deep distrust of their fellow citizens but also sees conspiracies against themselves everywhere, often contrary to fact and reason. Over half of all Russians now believe Leonid Brezhnev was their best leader in the 20th century, followed by Lenin and Stalin. Gorbachev is at the bottom of the list.For others around the world, the end of the Cold War undoubtedly came as a relief. China is often seen as a major beneficiary of the Cold War. This is not entirely true, of course. For decades, the country was under a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship that was out of tune with its needs. A result, during the Maoist era, was some of the most terrible crimes of the Cold War, in which millions died. But during the 1970s and \u201980s, Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China benefited hugely from its de facto alliance with the United States, both in security and development.In the multipolar world now establishing itself, the United States and China have emerged as the strongest powers. Their competition for influence in Asia will define the outlook for the world. China, like Russia, is well integrated into the capitalist world system, and many of the interests of these two countries\u2019 leaders are linked to further integration.Russia and China, unlike the Soviet Union, are not likely to seek isolation or global confrontation. They will attempt to nibble away at American interests and dominate their regions. But neither China nor Russia is willing or able to mount a global ideological challenge backed by military power. Rivalries may lead to conflicts, or even local wars, but not of the systemic Cold War kind.The ease with which many former Marxists have adapted themselves to post-Cold War market economics raises the question of whether this had been an avoidable conflict in the first place. With hindsight, the outcome was not worth the sacrifice \u2014 not in Angola, not in Vietnam, Nicaragua or Russia, for that matter. But was it avoidable back in the 1940s, when the Cold War went from an ideological conflict to a permanent military confrontation?While post-World War II clashes and rivalries were certainly unavoidable \u2014 Stalin\u2019s policies alone were enough to produce those \u2014 it is hard to argue that a global Cold War that was to last for almost 50 years and threaten the obliteration of the world could not have been avoided. There were points along the way when leaders could have held back, especially on military rivalry and the arms race. But the ideological conflict at the root of the tension made such sensible thinking very difficult to achieve.People of good will on both sides believed that they were representing an idea whose very existence was threatened. It led them to take otherwise avoidable risks with their own lives and the lives of others.The Cold War affected everyone in the world because of the threat of nuclear destruction it implied. In this sense, nobody was safe from the Cold War. The greatest victory of Gorbachev\u2019s generation was that nuclear war was avoided. Historically, most Great Power rivalries end in a cataclysm. The Cold War did not, but on a couple of occasions, we were much closer to nuclear devastation than any but a few realized.Why were leaders willing to take such unconscionable risks with the fate of the earth? Why did so many people believe in ideologies that they, at other times, would have realized could not possibly hold all the solutions they were looking for? My answer is that the Cold War world, like the world today, had a lot of obvious ills. As injustice and oppression became more visible in the 20th century through mass communications, people \u2014 especially young people \u2014 felt the need to remedy these ills. Cold War ideologies offered immediate solutions to complex problems.What did not change with the end of the Cold War were the conflicts between the haves and the have-nots in international affairs. In some parts of the world today, such conflicts have become more intense because of the upsurge of religious and ethnic movements, which threaten to destroy whole communities. Unrestrained by Cold War universalisms, which at least pretended that all people could enter their promised paradise, these groups are manifestly exclusionist or racist, their supporters convinced that great injustices have been done to them in the past, which somehow justify their present outrages.Often people, especially young people, need to be part of something bigger than themselves or even their families, some immense idea to devote one\u2019s life to. The Cold War shows what can happen when such notions get perverted for the sake of power, influence and control.That does not mean that these very human urges are in themselves worthless. But it is a warning that we should consider carefully the risks we are willing to take to achieve our ideals, in order not to replicate the terrible toll that the 20th century took in its quest for perfection.Odd Arne Westad, a professor of United States-Asia relations at Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Cold War: A World History,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}

Better jobs, higher wages and, increasingly, more training are a result of growing businesses. Yet the Better Deal is silent on a host of policies that would encourage that new investment, like tax reform and regulatory reform.Instead of a pro-growth approach, the agenda targets American employers with more regulation, more government and more penalties.Business leaders agree that it\u2019s time to act on serious policies that will benefit all Americans.

{"Headline": "Freeport to Give Indonesia a Majority Stake in Its Grasberg Mine", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, in one of the most dramatic examples yet of rising resource nationalism around the world, Grasberg\u2019s American owner tentatively agreed to give a majority stake back.Still, major issues remain, including what the Indonesian government might have to pay for that stake. The deal could also scare off foreign investors who could otherwise help support and broaden a fast-growing, but still developing, Asian economy.Freeport and the Indonesian government said in a news conference on Tuesday that the American company would transfer to Indonesia a 51 percent stake in Grasberg, the world\u2019s largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine. The deal essentially rewrites an arrangement that began in 1972, when a Freeport predecessor began mining operations there under an agreement with a military dictatorship that was comfortable with the United States. Freeport also agreed to build smelters to process copper concentrate in Indonesia, helping to create more jobs and more valuable processing work there.In exchange, the Indonesian government agreed to extend Freeport\u2019s permit to export copper from the mine. That gives the mining giant a measure of certainty as it makes plans to expand the mine and shift much of the work underground.The agreement gives Freeport \u201cassurances on fiscal and legal matters that gives us the confidence to make these $20 billion dollars of investments,\u201d Richard Adkerson, Freeport\u2019s chief executive, said during the news conference.Alluding to the rising price of copper, which has reached two-year highs on rebounding Chinese demand, he added, \u201cthose investments will have major returns.\u201dThough Indonesia has developed quickly in recent years, its economy still heavily depends on exporting natural resources, including metals from Grasberg. In 2015, Grasberg\u2019s output of gold and copper was worth $3.1 billion Local politicians and activists have complained that Freeport pays little in taxes; the company has said it pays back more than half its profit from the mine in taxes, fees, royalties and other payments.Grasberg has also been rocked by strikes since May, after Freeport began cutting its work force. Protests have occasionally become violent, with demonstrators blocking roads and bringing weapons like bows and arrows, according to the Indonesian police.With a presidential election approaching in 2019, analysts said a Freeport deal would be considered a victory for Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo. Mr. Joko has insisted that mining companies must divest majority stakes in order to continue operating in Indonesia, and the government has turned up pressure on foreign companies to do just that.Late last year, Indonesia unveiled legislation that required foreign mining companies to switch to a new licensing agreement that required them to divest 51 percent of their stakes in Indonesian mines. Freeport delayed the switch, prompting the Indonesian government to withdraw Freeport\u2019s export permit for copper in January, and resulting in a partial shutdown of the Grasberg mine for a few months. In April, the two sides signed a temporary agreement allowing Freeport to export unrefined copper.Freeport and Indonesia have much ground to cover before a deal is sealed, however.Freeport valued Grasberg at around $16 billion, suggesting Indonesia would have to plow a significant amount of money into the operation to increase its stake from its current 9 percent. The Indonesian government has previously argued that it should have to pay significantly less than Freeport\u2019s proposed sum. The timing of a deal has also been left unclear.\u201cThese are absolutely critical issues which, unless and until they are resolved, makes it impossible to say that the long-running Freeport-government of Indonesia dispute is truly over,\u201d Bill Sullivan, a lawyer and mining analyst in Jakarta, wrote in an email. \u201cIn essence, Freeport and the government of Indonesia have left the most difficult issues to be resolved later.\u201dMr. Adkerson, Freeport\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that specific details of the new agreement had yet to be decided.\u201cWe have a lot of work to do to get this documented,\u201d he said. He referred to the agreement with Indonesian government as a \u201cframework for an agreement.\u201dMukhtar Tompo, an Indonesian legislator who has previously called for Freeport to be expelled from Indonesia, said he was pleased with the deal. Still, he worried that the government would overpay for the shares, endangering other government priorities.\u201cDon\u2019t let it get to the point that Freeport\u2019s divestment will sacrifice the right of Indonesians to better health services and education,\u201d he said in an interview.\u201cFreeport can\u2019t be allowed to keep playing games,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the government hesitates, that means it\u2019s afraid.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanks to a Shopping Spree, Japan Is Looking Up. It May Not Last.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s long-sluggish economy has found its spark. To keep it flickering, Japan needs to find more big spenders like Sayaka Sakata.Ms. Sakata, a 49-year-old mother of four, recently moved to a rented house from an apartment in the city of Yokohama after her husband got a new job. That meant buying new stuff: a washing machine, a refrigerator, some appliances and even a used car. Saving, she said, was no longer her top priority.\u201cI\u2019m an optimistic person,\u201d she said. \u201cI think spending money on my family is more important.\u201dThe unexpected surge in economic growth reported in Japan this week was thanks in large part to an unexpected source: Japanese consumers.Long known as aging penny pinchers, Japanese shoppers in recent months have decided to spend. Data showed they bought more cars, air-conditioners, television sets and other appliances during the three months that ended in June, fueling an unusually high annualized growth rate of 4 percent.But the June quarter results have left many economists scratching their heads. Despite low unemployment figures and a year and a half of slow-but-steady economic growth, worker pay in Japan has been mostly stagnant. Overall wages fell in June compared with a year ago, according to official data.This week\u2019s figures could suggest paychecks will start to rise and Japan\u2019s consumers are feeling better. Or, economists say, the figures could be a fluke, leaving Japan to keep looking for ways to escape its slow-growth rut.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is permanent consumption,\u201d said Kozo Ueda, a professor of political science and economics at Waseda University in Tokyo. \u201cI think it\u2019ll decrease in the next quarter because the figures in this quarter are too strong.\u201dWhen workers retire, Japanese companies often replace them with temporary workers, who make less than regular hires, depressing wages even more. Temporary workers, like freelance or contract workers, make up about one-third of the country\u2019s work force.\u201cThere\u2019s still question marks all over wages,\u201d said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research for the Asia-Pacific region at ING, the Dutch bank.That has left some workers feeling confident. Jimmy Yoon, for example, just bought his dream car: a Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicle.The Jeep will not be cheap. Mr. Yoon, a 26-year-old South Korean living in Japan, has committed to paying $1,000 a month for the next three years. But he just got a job in logistics in Tokyo at an e-commerce company and his stock investments are beginning to pay off.\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my stocks since university, and I\u2019ve actually been aiming to get a car since when I was 21 years old,\u201d Mr. Yoon said. \u201cThat was the final goal, to get the money.\u201dA new job also gave Mika Funaba, 26, new confidence. Last year, while working in hospitality, she was reluctant to spend. But then she got a position in a Yokohama salon as a beauty therapist specializing in eyelash extensions. Feeling more secure, she recently spent about $3,000 on improving her teeth and took a trip to the Philippines.Of her new, $4,500-a-month income, Ms. Funaba said, \u201cI know that it will never go down, but it won\u2019t necessarily go up.\u201dStill, economists say the consumer sales rise could be explained by more temporary factors.For one, several different kinds of durable goods have reached the end of their life cycles, said Professor Ueda of Waseda University. Six years ago, Japan ended analog TV service, prompting demand for flat-screen TVs. And the government has encouraged the purchase of environmentally friendly appliances.The key to wage growth may be productivity. Franz Waldenberger, director and chief economist of the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, says low unemployment will not result in significant wage increases by itself.Wages could rise if productivity does, he said, and \u201cthat would be an excellent performance given the demographic condition of an aging population.\u201dStill, Ms. Sakata of Yokohama said that she has reason to believe the good times will stick.\u201cI remember four years ago reading a lot about young graduates finding it hard to get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t really see that anymore. I\u2019ve encouraged my 21-year-old son, who\u2019s studying in Australia, to come back to Japan because the job market looks good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada Letter: Back at the Nafta Table and Tundra Meltdowns", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House is convinced that Mr. Trump has the authority to pull out of Nafta. Legal scholars generally agree, though there are enough skeptics to ensure the decision would end up in court.But Mr. Trump already has backed away from one threat to abandon Nafta after strong opposition from business interests and members of his own party. Corporations and farmers that have benefited from Nafta want to preserve a quarter-century of investment in the development of a continental economy.Changing Nafta would be even more difficult, because it would require congressional approval. Many Democrats share at least some of the president\u2019s concerns about the current deal, but Mr. Trump\u2019s political problems are likely to complicate any White House effort to build a bipartisan coalition.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the government of Canada has said it welcomes Nafta negotiations and will use them to improve the agreement. Can Canada realistically get improvements or are the talks more about preserving the agreement?The three nations successfully negotiated improvements to Nafta as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some of those improvements, like bringing electronic commerce under the deal\u2019s framework, are relatively noncontroversial. Also, Canada and the United States have a shared interest in pushing Mexico to adopt stronger labor and environmental standards. And there are areas, like indigenous rights, where the United States may simply be willing to defer to Canada.Bottom line: It\u2019s easy to imagine upsides. The question is really about the downsides.Nafta basically added Mexico to the 1989 free-trade deal between Canada and the United States. If the United States pulled out of Nafta, it would be subject to the earlier, substantially similar deal.If Mr. Trump also ends the earlier deal, the two countries would still be subject to the rules of the World Trade Organization. The eventual result could be average import tariffs of about 3.5 percent.Canada and Mexico could choose to maintain Nafta as a bilateral deal or negotiate a new one.But the absence of an agreement between the United States and Mexico would cause problems for Canada. The work of making a given car, for example, is often spread across multiple factories in all three countries \u2014 so the Canadian jobs depend on trade between the United States and Mexico.The rise of a continental economy has been painful for many workers in all three countries. There is no particular reason to think that going backward, in whole or in part, would be a less painful process.For Canada, autos and car parts are a huge chunk of its exports to the United States. And one of the largest automotive employers in the country is Fiat Chrysler, the carmaker that, in recent years, has gone through different owners, a bankruptcy and a bailout that included money from Canada and Ontario.The turmoil, and the fate of those jobs, continues. Bill Vlasic and Neal Boudette reported this week from Detroit that the company has been actively courting investors and potential partners in China for months. The bad news for Canada: Would-be partners are interested only in Fiat Chrysler\u2019s line of Jeeps and its Ram pickup trucks, neither of which are Canadian-made.Henry Fountain, a science writer at The Times, was recently in Alaska, at a place that is warming faster than many other places on the planet. That is creating a vicious cycle. As the permafrost that underlies large parts of the state melts, it releases carbon dioxide, further increasing global warming.Alaska is not alone. \u201cSome experts I\u2019ve talked to say the thawing is even worse in some parts of Canada, especially the northwest,\u201d Mr. Fountain told me.In their analysis, Mr. Fisher and Ms. Taub conclude that Rebel Media\u2019s distress is related to Canada\u2019s electoral and legislative systems, which \u201cmake it very difficult for a party to win power without heavy support from racial minorities.\u201d It is a provocative and interesting read.The Times\u2019s superb obituary of Mr. Lewis, by Dave Kehr, notes that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Martin were the first big mass media stars to come along after World War II, something that had largely been forgotten.Tell us what you think at nytcanada@nytimes.com.

{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his.

{"Headline": "Canada Wants a New Nafta to Include Gender and Indigenous Rights", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Canada\u2019s idea of a fair trade deal seems very different from President Trump\u2019s.Just two days before heading into the first round of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finally laid out its core objectives, and second on the list was to make the 23-year-old pact \u201cmore progressive.\u201dBy that, the government meant not only strengthening the existing labor safeguards and environmental provisions, but also adding whole new chapters on both gender and indigenous rights, and addressing climate change.Those \u201cprogressive elements,\u201d the foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, told a university audience in Ottawa on Monday morning, \u201care how we guarantee that the modernized Nafta will not only be an exemplary free-trade deal, it will also be a fair trade deal.\u201dShe later repeated the remarks to a parliamentary committee on international trade, but did not provide much detail as to how her government\u2019s proposals would be carried out.The speeches were the first time the government had revealed its goals heading into the much-anticipated talks, despite sending lobbyists to Washington and across the United States over the past nine months to ensure the trade deal survives President Trump\u2019s rancor and threats to rip it up.Tracey Ramsey, a member of the New Democratic Party in Parliament, posed a question during the committee meeting that many Canadians wondered about. \u201cHow confident can you be that the Americans will even include the words \u2018climate change\u2019 when they pulled out of what happened in Paris?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey have a president who claims that climate change is a Chinese hoax.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve explained to our southern friends, at every opportunity, that Canada is the largest export market for two thirds of U.S. states, and America\u2019s biggest overall customer \u2014 by far,\u201d Ms. Freeland said on Monday. \u201cIndeed, Canada buys more from the U.S. than China, the U.K. and Japan combined.\u201d\u201cThere are too many communities in our prosperous nation where people do not feel prosperous, where they instead feel left behind by an economy that is increasingly divided between the wealthy 1 percent at the very top, and everyone else,\u201d Ms. Freeland said.\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now,\u201d she added, \u201cCanadians may lose faith in the open society, in immigration and in free trade \u2014 just as many have across the Western industrialized world.\u201dAnd in what was perhaps a reference to Mr. Trump, who has accused Mexicans of stealing American jobs and being rapists, she said the first essential thing for the country to do is \u201cavoid scapegoating the \u201cother.\u201dTrade agreements usually include prohibitions more than encouragements, and without binding repercussions, those can seem weak. But even weak acknowledgments can establish expectations for future deals, said Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute in Washington.\u201cIt may be an opportunity for creative rule making,\u201d said Ms. Dawson, a former senior adviser on economic affairs at the American Embassy in Ottawa. \u201cIf a trade agreement is going to have longevity, it needs to reflect the broader public values and not just be a way to ease the trade of things.\u201dAnd in blatant conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d campaign, Canada also wants to ban local-content provisions for government contracts, which Ms. Freeland called \u201cpolitical junk food, superficially appetizing, but unhealthy in the long run.\u201dThree other core demands are less likely to rankle American negotiators: a modernization of Nafta to reflect technology that has developed since 1994; the slashing of red tape; and the easing of travel for professionals between the countries.Noting that the country had walked out of trade negotiations before and was willing to do so again, Ms. Freeland remarked that \u201cwe are committed to a good deal, not just any deal.\u201dBut, it was clear to most Canadians that her bluster was addressed to them just as much as American negotiators who will sit across from her team on Wednesday, in the first of many talks that are expected to last months. Canadians may agree that Nafta is good for the country\u2019s economy, but the notion of being pushed around by their larger, more powerful neighbor sets their teeth on edge.\u201cOur approach in these talks will be in keeping with our national character; hard-working, fact-based, cordial, animated by the spirit of good will and the pursuit of compromise,\u201d Ms. Freeland said. \u201cWe also know that there is no contradiction between being polite, and being strong. It is no accident that hockey is our national sport.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Rails Against New Sanctions. Whether They Will Work Is Unclear.", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration has hailed the latest United Nations sanctions against nuclear-armed North Korea as the most severe yet, and the North\u2019s fury over the penalties suggested they carried some sting.In a staccato of outraged reactions on Monday to the sanctions imposed over the weekend, North Korea threatened retaliation against the United States \u201cthousands of times\u201d over, vowed to never give up its nuclear arsenal and called the penalties a panicky response by an American bully.But it is unclear at best, experts on sanctions say, whether the measures will hinder North Korea\u2019s nuclear militarization or even crimp its economy.The sanctions are aimed at pressuring North Korea into negotiating, with the goal of renouncing its nuclear weapons. But Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader, has repeatedly said that the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities are crucial to its self-defense.North Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, reinforced that point, denouncing the new sanctions on Monday in Manila at a regional ministerial meeting that was also attended by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.\u201cNeither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. against the D.P.R.K. are fundamentally eliminated,\u201d Mr. Ri said, using the initials for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u2019s official name.In a more ominous response, North Korea\u2019s official news agency said, \u201cThere is no bigger mistake than the United States believing that its land is safe across the ocean.\u201dLike all United Nations sanctions imposed on North Korea for more than a decade, the effectiveness of the new round, which American officials say could cost North Korea\u2019s government about $1 billion annually, depends on faithful enforcement by China and to a lesser extent Russia.Both countries joined in the Security Council\u2019s unanimous vote on Saturday to penalize North Korea. But neither China nor Russia has a strong record of policing sanctions against the North. China, the North\u2019s major benefactor by far, is reluctant to squeeze its economy for fear of causing instability on its borders.The sanctions adopted by the 15-member Council left important elements of the North Korean economy untouched. For example, the resolution did not sanction oil imports, which are critical to the functioning of the North Korean state.Further, North Korean laborers who work overseas and send remittances home \u2014 money that the United Nations says is used in the weapons program \u2014 will be allowed to stay abroad. The new sanctions cap the current number of workers overseas, but stop short of calling for those who already work abroad to return to North Korea.The new sanctions were a direct reaction to two North Korean tests last month of intercontinental ballistic missiles that appeared capable of reaching the continental United States.After passage of the resolution, President Trump tweeted: \u201cChina and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact.\u201d The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said the measures showed \u201cwe\u2019re not playing anymore\u201d with North Korea.The new measures prohibit all exports of North Korean coal, iron, iron ore, lead ore and seafood. They put new restrictions on North Korea\u2019s Foreign Trade Bank, forbid the country to increase the number of workers sent abroad and strengthen oversight of North Korean shipping.The measures also place a cap on new investment and new joint ventures in North Korea.China had already agreed this year to stop importing North Korean coal, and despite scattered reports of smuggling of coal shipments, that prohibition appears to have held, Chinese and Western experts say.The North\u2019s iron ore exports, which also go mainly to China, have dwindled in the past several years, they say. North Korean seafood \u2014 crab, lobster, shrimp and other shellfish \u2014 is sold to wholesalers in China, where it ends up at large buffet displays in major hotels.The seafood hauls from North Korean boats, whose crews are mostly army personnel, have increased over the last few years, but the revenue to the state from seafood is not as high as from the metals trade, economists say.China officially welcomed the new sanctions. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said they were necessary, and, at the United Nations, the Chinese ambassador, Liu Jieyi, urged North Korea to \u201ccease taking actions that might further escalate tensions.\u201dIn supporting the United Nations measures, and winning good will from the Trump administration by doing so, China appears to have delayed an unpalatable set of sanctions that Washington was getting ready to impose on China itself.The Treasury Department has been working on a series of so-called secondary sanctions against Chinese banks and corporations that do business with North Korea and help facilitate its access to foreign exchange.Even though China has long considered North Korea a close ally, though a wayward and often irritating one, it could stomach United Nations sanctions against the North, she said. But Beijing vehemently opposed sanctions by Washington against Chinese institutions, particularly banks, that help the North, she said.\u201cAgreeing to tightening U.N. sanctions was a price that Beijing was willing to pay to avoid being hit with U.S. secondary sanctions on Chinese banks,\u201d she said.Another consideration for the administration: Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are scheduled to visit China next month. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said this weekend that China was preparing to welcome Mr. Trump before the end of the year. It was unlikely that Washington would want to sour relations before the visits by imposing the secondary sanctions.This means the Chinese companies that give the North access to American dollars and other currencies would be essentially free to continue their business unabated, Mr. Ruggiero said.\u201cThe U.S. will give China and Russia time to implement the resolution while Chinese companies, individuals and banks facilitate Pyongyang\u2019s sanctions evasion,\u201d he said.By allowing North Korea to continue sending workers abroad, the Security Council missed an easy target for crimping revenue, said Joseph DeThomas, a former State Department official who specialized in sanctions against Iran and North Korea.\u201cBy just capping labor, you leave the field open to easy evasion by having additional workers work off the books,\u201d Mr. DeThomas said.Sixty thousand to 80,000 North Korean workers are employed overseas, many in heavy construction jobs in appalling conditions, according to human rights groups.The United Nations \u201cjust locked in North Korea receiving at least $500 million a year for the practice\u201d of sending laborers abroad, Mr. Ruggiero said.During a low point in relations between China and North Korea this year, the Global Times, a state-run newspaper that sometimes reflects Beijing\u2019s views, suggested that China might be willing to reduce the amount of oil it sends to North Korea. Without Chinese crude oil, North Korea\u2019s economy would be imperiled.The United Nations sanctions did not touch oil imports, which appeared to be a step too far for China, Mr. Ruggiero said.Mr. DeThomas offered a mixed view of the latest sanctions.\u201cI am not saying it was not a good thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI am saying it is probably too little, too late. Other cards will have to be played by China, the U.S. and South Korea if something very damaging, bloody and politically catastrophic is to be avoided.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Verdict Sends a Tough New Message to South Korea Inc.", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 More than two decades ago, South Korean prosecutors indicted the chairman of the powerful Samsung conglomerate on charges of bribing the president. He was let off with a suspended sentence and then a presidential pardon.About a decade later, he was indicted again, on tax evasion and embezzlement charges. And again he escaped prison time.The message was clear: Samsung was essentially untouchable, and the family that ran the company wielded the true power in South Korea.On Friday, the country\u2019s courts sent a different message.Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation heir to the Samsung empire, was sentenced to five years in prison over a bribery scandal that has already contributed to the downfall of the country\u2019s former president and shaken the country\u2019s political and economic foundations.It was the most remarkable sentence yet for a South Korean business titan, and a sign that the country is no longer willing to offer its business leaders political impunity in exchange for untrammeled economic growth.Now South Korea and Samsung \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest business empire and a global force in the technology industry \u2014 are at a turning point. Friday\u2019s verdict could embolden efforts to weaken the hold that major family-run business groups have maintained over one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies.\u201cUntil now, Samsung had always been considered above the law in South Korea,\u201d said You Jong-il, an economist at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management. \u201cThis marks a big stride in establishing judicial justice in the country because it has kept failing before Samsung.\u201dFor Samsung, a vast conglomerate, the verdict offers a test of whether the company can wean itself from the family that founded it and has long used it to amass wealth and power. Mr. Lee and other family members could still wield power behind the scenes, say people who study South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, the way some of the country\u2019s other business empires have been run from jail cells.\u201cHe still has controlling power, even though he\u2019s in jail,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore, speaking of Mr. Lee. \u201cHe can fire any chief executive, and the professional managers should have to keep reporting to him.\u201dMr. Lee and four other Samsung executives were convicted on Friday of paying $7.8 million in bribes and other inducements to ensure that the country\u2019s disgraced former president, Park Geun-hye, supported a complicated corporate deal. That deal strengthened Mr. Lee\u2019s grip on Samsung Electronics, the famous maker of smartphones and televisions and the conglomerate\u2019s crown jewel.The verdict could still be reversed on appeal, which Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers have said they will pursue. Their hope is not senseless: Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, twice received presidential pardons for wrongdoing. But the current president, Moon Jae-in, and his political party have pledged to crack down on shady practices at South Korea\u2019s family-run business empires, which are known as chaebols.In 2005, conversations recorded between a senior Samsung executive and a newspaper magnate, both close to the Lee family, were leaked to local news media. In those conversations, which took place eight years earlier, they discussed bribes paid to top politicians and senior prosecutors. Samsung apologized, but the recordings were not used as evidence because they had been illegally recorded.Mr. Lee\u2019s father \u2014 Lee Kun-hee, the son of Samsung\u2019s founder \u2014 was twice pardoned by presidents after being convicted of bribery and other charges. But he won a measure of respect from South Koreans because he helped make Samsung Electronics into a high-quality brand.Being in prison does not necessarily mean that Mr. Lee will give up control, however. He has two sisters, but neither has been heavily involved in the electronics business and they generally have not been considered rivals to Mr. Lee.Perhaps the most daunting challenge to Samsung is one that the company has not been able to solve even with Mr. Lee free and in charge. While the company dominates hardware, from memory and chips to the finished smartphone and television, it has long struggled in the realm of software and services.Another challenge could arise with the death of the elder Mr. Lee, which could set off the type of infighting that split up other chaebol families and empires in recent years, said Park Sang-in, a professor of public administration at Seoul National University and a chaebol critic.\u201cCronies inside Samsung will start taking sides, and this is a risky situation you can\u2019t control from a jail cell,\u201d he said.For many in South Korea, the question is whether the authorities will keep up the pressure on the country\u2019s big business groups. Some groups critical of the chaebol say Friday\u2019s Samsung verdict was not as severe as it could have been, and that the five-year sentence was the weakest legal penalty allowed for the crimes Mr. Lee committed.\u201cThis is another court ruling proving that in South Korea, if you don\u2019t have money, you are guilty,\u201d said a statement from Spec Watch, a Seoul-based civic group that monitors corporate crimes, \u201cbut if you have money, you are innocent.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article, using information from Reuters, provided an incorrect photographer credit.

{"Headline": "How the Radical Right Played the Long Game and Won", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the United States, promising and then delivering services and protections for the majority of voters provides a path for politicians to be popularly elected. Buchanan was concerned that this would lead to overinvestment in public services, as the majority would be all too willing to tax the wealthy minority to support these programs. So Buchanan came to a radical conclusion: Majority rule was an economic problem. \u201cDespotism,\u201d he declared in his 1975 book \u201cThe Limits of Liberty,\u201d \u201cmay be the only organizational alternative to the political structure that we observe.\u201dBuchanan, however, also had what MacLean calls a \u201cstealth\u201d agenda. He knew that the majority would never agree to being constrained. He therefore helped lead a push to undermine their trust in public institutions. The idea was to get voters to direct their ire at these institutions and divert their attention away from increasing income and wealth inequality.This is the sordid tale that MacLean lays out in \u201cDemocracy in Chains.\u201d She starts with Buchanan\u2019s early engagement in policy work in the late 1950s, when he offered to help the state of Virginia respond to the federal mandate to desegregate public schools. After the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public school segregation was unconstitutional, Buchanan and a fellow economist called for the state to issue tax-subsidized vouchers to any parents who wanted to send their children to private schools. What these economists were calling for was essentially the privatization of public education.But even in 1950s Virginia, public schools were popular with many white parents, and \u201ca fire sale of tax-funded public schools to private school operators would be political suicide,\u201d MacLean writes. Buchanan\u2019s plan failed, and he learned a tough lesson from this foray into policy making: If the majority demands services such as free public schools, politicians will acquiesce.Buchanan decided he needed to influence policy at a deeper level. In the ensuing years, he sought to lead an economic and political movement in which he stressed that \u201cconspiratorial secrecy is at all times essential\u201d to mask efforts to protect the wealthy elite from the will of the majority. In September 1973, Buchanan held the inaugural meeting of the International Atlantic Economic Society, arguing for the need to \u201ccreate, support and activate an effective counterintelligentsia\u201d to reshape the way people thought about government. He believed the center-left controlled academia and \u201ceffectively indoctrinated political actors in both parties,\u201d MacLean writes. To fight back, conservatives needed to develop new surrogates who could be \u201cindoctrinated\u201d in turn with right-wing ideas, and then \u201cmobilized, organized and directed\u201d to disseminate them.We know all of this because MacLean found documentation of Buchanan\u2019s plans \u2014 including correspondence, meeting minutes and personal papers \u2014 in his previously unexplored archives. She came upon her biographical subject \u201cby sheer serendipity,\u201d she writes, while researching how the state of Virginia responded to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Seeing the name of an unfamiliar economist eventually led her to rooms full of documents that made clear how \u201coperatives\u201d had been trained \u201cto staff the far-flung and purportedly separate, yet intricately connected, institutions funded by the Koch brothers and their now large network of fellow wealthy donors.\u201d Buchanan\u2019s papers revealed how, from a series of faculty perches at several universities, he spent his life laying out a game plan for a right-wing social movement.One part of his plan involved Social Security. The election of Ronald Reagan as president in 1980 was a watershed for conservatives, yet it quickly became clear that he, too, would succumb to political pressure. By 1982, Reagan\u2019s fight to end Social Security \u2014 long a bugbear of Buchanan\u2019s \u2014 was faltering. Amid that debate, the libertarian Cato Institute, funded by the brothers Charles and David Koch, made privatization of Social Security its top priority and turned to Buchanan for a master plan. Buchanan told them that \u201cthose who seek to undermine the existing structure\u201d must do two things: Make people doubt the viability of Social Security, and divide the public by suggesting high earners be taxed at higher rates \u2014 which might sound progressive but would ultimately undo the universal foundation of the program itself.MacLean doesn\u2019t hide her antipathy to Buchanan\u2019s goals. As a historian of American social movements, she brings this expertise to her study of Buchanan, showing how his work helped to sow doubt that anyone \u2014 whether individuals, groups or institutions \u2014 can act in the public good. Nevertheless, her overt moral revulsion at her subject can sometimes make it seem as if we\u2019re getting only part of the picture.American democracy was unprepared to defend itself against the agenda of Buchanan and conservative benefactors. Buchanan may not have been the only actor in this movement, and the role of conservative donors and economists has been documented elsewhere, but we are now living in a world he helped shepherd into reality. Public choice economists argue that those with the most to lose from change will pay the most attention, which has certainly been the case with Charles and David Koch. They and their friends have invested enormous sums in organizations that have changed the national debate about the proper role of government in the economy. Our politically polarized and increasingly paralyzed government institutions are the result.Power consolidation sometimes seems like a perpetual motion machine, continually widening the gap between those who have power and money and those who don\u2019t. Still, \u201cDemocracy in Chains\u201d leaves me with hope: Perhaps as books like MacLean\u2019s continue to shine a light on important truths, Americans will begin to realize they need to pay more attention and not succumb to the cynical view that known liars make the best leaders.Heather Boushey is the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.Advertisement"}

Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor in New Jersey, it would have prevented her husband\u2019s firm from getting any state contracts under a potential Murphy administration, the result of New Jersey\u2019s strict pay-to-play laws. She also would have been able to give only $4,300 to Mr. Murphy directly.In a brief phone interview, Ms. McPherson confirmed she made the donations and that she is an \u201canti-Christie\u201d voter, but declined to comment further.Sending the money to the governors association is legal. And with just two statewide elections this year, the national group can use that money to support Mr. Murphy in New Jersey.The donations have come largely from a mix of pharmaceutical companies, unions, construction companies, law firms and corporations that would have been barred from obtaining government contracts if they had donated directly to Mr. Murphy or local candidates.In the primary, Mr. Murphy spent more than $20 million of his own money to fend off challenges from Jim Johnson, John Wisniewski and Raymond Lesniak. Now, he will not be able to tap his personal wealth to support his candidacy and instead will be limited to spending $13.8 million in the general election.The Democratic Governors Association is not limited to simply supporting Mr. Murphy; it can use the money however it wants, within federal guidelines, and that includes sending money to county political parties. This year, the group has sent more than $415,000 to county parties in New Jersey, sending the maximum amount of $37,000 each to 10 counties.One New Jersey union, the Operating Engineers Local 825 PAC, which represents heavy equipment operators, mechanics and surveyors, made a $300,000 donation this year to the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association, its first to the group and the largest single contribution from New Jersey.\u201cWe wanted to make a statement on how important control of the statehouses is to us,\u201d said Greg Lalevee, a business manager at the union. As an example of why donating to the association was crucial, he noted that in Kentucky, after legislative control switched from Democrats to Republicans, lawmakers tried to limit the power of unions.Some global companies based in New Jersey, including Johnson and Johnson, AT&T, Novartis and Merck, often give similar amounts every year to both the Democratic Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association, a political investment intended to ensure access to events held by both groups.But the prospect of victory by Mr. Murphy, who leads Ms. Guadagno by nearly 20 points in many polls, has attracted new donors to the Democratic organization.A hotel group known as Jersey City Hospitality donated $37,500 this year, the first time it has appeared on the donor rolls of the Democratic Governors Association. G.R. Robert Construction Company, another first-time donor, contributed $27,500. Mount Construction Company gave multiple donations this year totaling $52,943.Jeff Brindle, the executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission, said the one restriction on national donations from New Jersey is that businesses are not allowed to form political nonprofits to circumvent the state\u2019s pay-to-play laws.\u201cOtherwise, business entities with state contracts must limit their contributions to $300 or less only to gubernatorial candidates, county parties, state parties, municipal parties and legislative leadership PACs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cContributions larger than $300 to federal committees are not explicitly prohibited in the law except for the one exception listed above.\u201dBut the practice has led many critics to argue that it is an easy way for contractors seeking favorable treatment to funnel money to candidates.\u201cThis is a Laundromat for contractor money,\u201d said Mr. Holman, who works for Public Citizen, a liberal research group. \u201cAnd contractors know it.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs, Factories and Stocks Provide Economic Lift for Trump", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA stock market hitting record highs. Foreign corporations announcing big new plants in the United States. And robust hiring that has brought the unemployment rate to a 16-year low.That convergence added up to a solid economic report card on Friday that President Trump was happy to present to the nation as a sign of good work.On the hiring front, the Labor Department reported that 209,000 jobs were added in July, somewhat above Wall Street economists\u2019 expectations, with the unemployment rate matching May\u2019s 4.3 percent, the lowest since early 2001.And while the stock market had a relatively quiet day, the Dow Jones industrial average reached another high, two days after it closed above 22,000 for the first time.As all that positive economic news ricocheted through Wall Street, on social media and around office cubicles, conversation inevitably turned to one question: How much credit does Mr. Trump deserve?President Trump has taken to Twitter to celebrate his handling of the economy. But how much credit can he really claim?In a series of early-morning tweets, the president claimed quite a bit.On the hiring news, he declared, \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released \u2014 and I have only just begun.\u201d Earlier, in addition to saluting the \u201cgreat investment\u201d by Toyota and Mazda, he noted, \u201cConsumer confidence is at a 16 year high .... and for good reason.\u201d Both tweets pointed to a looser regulatory environment as a factor.Of course, as economists are fond of saying, correlation is not causation. Many of the trends Mr. Trump is benefiting from \u2014 falling unemployment, steady hiring, a rising stock market \u2014 were firmly in place under his predecessor, Barack Obama.And in the case of Friday\u2019s jobs data, Mr. Trump is citing figures he called phony not long ago on the campaign trail.In the end, there is no way to quantify exactly how much credit the president is due for attracting foreign investment or encouraging the creation of jobs here instead of overseas.But even some skeptics of his overall approach concede that Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of tax reform and higher infrastructure spending, as well as pressure to increase domestic manufacturing, are resonating in boardrooms in the United States and abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s still 80 percent lip service in the corporate world, but there are some executives who want to support Trump\u2019s initiatives,\u201d said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies who covers aerospace and defense giants like Boeing and United Technologies.Ravin Gandhi, founder and chief executive of GMM Nonstick Coatings in Chicago, is a case in point.The son of immigrants from India, Mr. Gandhi fiercely opposed Mr. Trump before the election, even appearing on CNBC to denounce the candidate\u2019s proposals on trade, immigration and health care.After Mr. Trump was elected, however, \u201cI bought into the economic growth rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said. \u201cI was hearing stories about 4 percent growth, about tax reform and my health care costs going down.\u201dNone of that has come to pass, of course.But this year Mr. Gandhi has invested $3 million to expand domestically and hired more than 20 employees, even though sales are flat compared with 2016, when they were up by double digits.\u201cIt\u2019s nuanced,\u201d he said, noting that his company was recently purchased by a Japanese conglomerate and that the American houseware firms he supplies make their pots and pans mostly overseas.\u201cA lot of us who were against Trump are still rooting for him to succeed because as citizens we want the economy to do well,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said. \u201cBut so far, it\u2019s been all hat and no cattle.\u201dDespite generally strong earnings, many manufacturers continue to shed jobs.In December, Mr. Trump persuaded United Technologies, parent of Carrier, not to proceed with a shutdown of an Indianapolis plant, but the company did go ahead with several hundred previously announced layoffs last month.\u201cWhen it matches the market, companies are still establishing production outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Rubel said.\u201cIf it\u2019s a tossup, though, companies seem more willing to keep the work here,\u201d he added. \u201cThe optics are better, especially if it will help them in their pitch for tax reform, infrastructure or to get defense contracts.\u201dPerhaps even more than outsourcing, the real threat to job growth for Mr. Trump\u2019s blue-collar base comes from automation and other efforts to improve productivity on the factory floor. In Mr. Obama\u2019s final year in office, Boeing\u2019s work force fell to 148,138 from 159,469, according to Mr. Rubel.Boeing reported stellar earnings recently, lifting its stock to record levels, but it has cut another 4,500 positions since Mr. Trump moved into the White House.The factory sector has been showing signs of life this year, although experts said that has more to do with improving economies overseas and a weaker dollar that benefits exporters than with any specific White House policies. Still, manufacturers added 16,000 jobs in July, lifting employment in the sector to its highest level since January 2009.On the other hand, wage growth, the missing ingredient throughout the recovery, has remained tepid. The Labor Department said wages grew by 0.3 percent last month, bringing the 12-month gain to 2.5 percent, down from 2.8 percent a year ago.It is not such good news for American workers, but moderate salary gains are just fine with Wall Street. The lack of upward pressure on wages gives the Federal Reserve ample room to maneuver before its next rate increase.\u201cThis is a Goldilocks report for the markets,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, meaning it was not too hot or too cold, but just right for investors and Fed policy makers. The Dow closed up 66.71 to finish the week at 22,092.81.Mr. Gapen said the latest jobs figures suggested the central bank would stick with the plan Wall Street has been anticipating: a reduction in its bond holdings in September as the central bank gradually reduces its stimulus efforts, followed by a rate increase in December.For Mr. Trump and leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill, business owners say the key is to requite their increased optimism and hiring with actual accomplishments.\u201cWe may not agree in corporate America with the president on social issues like global warming or transgender people serving in the military,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company.But Mr. Gimbel, who opened a new office in Nashville on Monday and plans to add 100 workers this year, said he remained confident that the president and Congress would deliver on their promise of business-friendly legislation in the next year or two.\u201cTrump hasn\u2019t done anything tangible yet, but he has injected hope for corporate growth, tax reform and deregulation among business leaders, and that\u2019s driving hiring,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said.An earlier version of this article misstated the increase in average hourly earnings in July. It was 0.3 percent, not 0.4 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s the Economy, Democrats, but Inequality Is Not the Issue", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneBut maybe the issue should not be the party\u2019s lodestar. This month, a clutch of Democratic governors, members of Congress and city mayors gathered with Democratic fund-raisers, strategists and other champions of liberal causes in this secluded patrician resort in the Rockies to hear that all this attention to income inequality could actually hurt them.\u201cIncome inequality is severe,\u201d Jon Cowan, president of the centrist Democratic research group Third Way, told the assembled politicos. \u201cAnd parts of the economic system are unfair. But these are not the central problems vexing most Americans. Many of the solutions proposed to meet them are not responsive to the aspirations, needs and values of those Americans.\u201dMr. Cowan\u2019s exhortation might be understood as the typical call for repositioning that follows a lost presidential election. Third Way, which organized the gathering, is, after all, an intellectual heir to President Bill Clinton\u2019s centrist politics \u2014 more skeptical of deregulation than in the Clinton era, and less interested in fiscal balance, but equally at loggerheads with the Democratic Party\u2019s left.The financial crisis and ensuing recession scrambled Americans\u2019 fears and desires, leaving an electorate defined by some variety of anger: at stagnant paychecks, at bank bailouts and government spending, at police shootings of blacks and at women\u2019s lower wages; anger against a \u201crigged system.\u201d Unfortunately for the Democratic Party \u2014 the party of government \u2014 most voters tend to think government is doing the rigging.The most inspiring campaigners, Senator Sanders on the left and Donald J. Trump on the right, did not convince voters of the wisdom of carefully honed policy prescriptions. They ran on an apocalyptic vision of America under siege, with clear enemies in sight. Mr. Trump, an interloper of scant ideological baggage who took over a Republican Party at least as clueless as Democrats about voters\u2019 preoccupations, offered the more powerful apocalypse.The problem is hardly unique to American politics. Across the Atlantic, populist parties have arisen to rattle the established political class, though nowhere have they achieved the sort of upset pulled off by Mr. Trump.Voting for governments in power declined, and the share going to the opposition grew. Politics became more fractionalized as voters who lost faith in standard political pitches sought alternatives. Governing, of course, got much tougher. And some of these effects persisted 10 years or more.Banks got a bailout after the financial crisis of 2008. Homeowners whose mortgages were underwater got next to nothing.\u201cFrom this selective intervention, additional economic inequality and political polarization may ensue, compounding and amplifying the initial political effects of the crisis,\u201d the researchers wrote.How much attention to devote to income inequality is only one of the decisions Democrats have to make.Does this mean Democrats should de-emphasize racial discrimination? Should they stop talking about guns and the right to choose to get candidates elected in, say, Louisiana? What will voters elsewhere think?\u201cWe must realize that we forgot an important sector of social disadvantage, which is social class,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it is not convincing to say we should go beyond identity politics. That is like telling women and blacks, O.K., you had your 40 years of attention, and now we have to move on.\u201dStill, Professor Williams argues against a move to a Democratic center that is friendly toward Wall Street and favors trade agreements, \u201ctwo of the reasons that the working class is so done with the Democratic Party.\u201dThere is much that makes sense in Third Way\u2019s approach. Mr. Cowan argues that the battle for redistribution of wealth that shaped Democratic politics over the 20th century culminated with the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the last missing piece of the social safety net, offering health insurance to all. Now, he adds, the critical task is to remedy the lack of opportunity faced by so many Americans seeking to make a decent living in the tech-heavy, globalized 21st.Offering free college is not the way to do it. That can sound meaningless in the large swaths of the country where fewer than 30 percent of residents have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Half of the people who start a four-year program do not finish it. A national apprenticeship program that could help connect people to good jobs is a more fruitful option.The government could also encourage small-business formation \u2014 often stifled for lack of credit and seed capital. It could take a more proactive role to lean against market power that shuts rivals out of markets.The challenge is not to prepare for a jobless future but to ensure available jobs offering decent incomes to working families, Mr. Cowan adds. A $15-an-hour minimum wage is a bad idea. But wage subsidies and a regional minimum wage adjusted for the cost of living might do the trick. To bolster retirement finances, employers could be required to contribute a minimum to workers\u2019 private retirement plans.This platform, by the way, would probably mitigate income inequality. It would just do so in a more business-friendly manner than the one suggested by the slash-and-burn talk further to the left. It has a shortcoming, however: It will be harder to sell a program that lacks villains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet Kim Jong-un, a Moody Young Man With a Nuclear Arsenal", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the target of all that scorn, Kim Jong-un, the 33-year-old leader of North Korea, has long been underestimated.Mr. Kim was the youngest of three sons yet leapfrogged his brothers to succeed his father, Kim Jong-il. Many analysts dismissed him as an inexperienced figurehead when he took power at 27; some predicted he would never last. But almost six years later, there is little doubt he is firmly in control.Some have urged President Trump to open negotiations with him. But it is unclear whether Mr. Kim is interested in talking, or what if anything he might demand in exchange for freezing or abandoning his nuclear program. He has made building a nuclear arsenal a top priority, arguing that it is the only way the North can guarantee its security and develop its economy.What little is known of Mr. Kim\u2019s record suggests ruthlessness \u2014 and some ideological flexibility.\u201cSmart, pragmatic, decisive,\u201d Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, said of Mr. Kim. \u201cBut also capricious, moody and ready to kill easily.\u201dOne subject on which Mr. Kim has not wavered is the nuclear program. His father held out the possibility of scrapping the program in return for economic aid and security guarantees and even struck a deal with the Clinton administration, though the North later violated it. But Mr. Kim has taken a more aggressive approach.The nation crossed a major threshold with the last two missile tests, on July 4 and July 28, which analysts said demonstrated intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting Alaska and, in the most recent test, the mainland United States.North Korean state media showed Mr. Kim present at both tests, wearing a suit with a Mao-style collar, surrounded by soldiers and smiling broadly.Mr. Kim first appeared in North Korean state media in September 2010, little more than a year before he succeeded his father as supreme leader. The reports said that he had been appointed a four-star general and that the ruling Workers\u2019 Party had elected him vice chairman of the Central Military Commission.Until then, it was not clear whether he would succeed his father. The outside world had never even seen a photograph of him as an adult.The elder Mr. Kim, who ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death at the end of 2011, had three wives and at least six children. His first wife delivered a son in 1971 but fell out of favor and died in exile in Moscow. His second wife gave birth to two daughters but no son. His third wife, Ko Yong-hui, a Japanese-born Korean singer and dancer, had two sons and a daughter.Despite his mother\u2019s departure, the eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, was widely considered the heir apparent until 2001, when he was caught attempting to visit Tokyo Disneyland on a false passport. He later appeared to go into exile, living in Macau and surfacing occasionally with mild criticism of the regime, before his assassination in Malaysia in February.But Kim Jong-il adored his third son, Kim Jong-un, and saw his own domineering attitude and other leadership qualities in the boy at an early age, according to Mr. Fujimoto, who was one of the few to predict Kim Jong-un\u2019s rise to power.After a basketball game, for example, Kim Jong-chol would leave the court immediately but Kim Jong-un would linger and gather his teammates for postgame analysis, the chef wrote. Mr. Fujimoto also recalled how Kim Jong-un sometimes hurled board-game pieces at his brother when he was losing.\u201cHe learned how power works from early age,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.North Korean state media have swaddled Mr. Kim\u2019s childhood with mythmaking, portraying him as an excellent marksman and a \u201cgenius among geniuses\u201d who loved to drive fast cars. At age 16, he is said to have written a research paper analyzing his grandfather\u2019s leadership during the Korean War.Mr. Micaelo and others have said Mr. Kim was a quiet teenager who loved James Bond films and playing basketball. But he stood out because he had expensive sneakers and gadgets, including a Sony PlayStation, and enjoyed the services of a cook, a driver and a private tutor.There is evidence that Mr. Kim\u2019s time as a youth in Europe, and perhaps other countries, left an impression. In his memoir, Mr. Fujimoto recalled conversations with Mr. Kim as a teenager in which the future leader expressed frustration with power shortages at home and marveled at overseas department stores.\u201cJapan was defeated by America, but they\u2019ve greatly reconstructed the country. The shops were full of goods. What about our country?\u201d Mr. Fujimoto quoted the young Mr. Kim as saying. Later in the conversation, Mr. Kim suggested that North Korea should learn from China\u2019s market-oriented economic policies, Mr. Fujimoto wrote.Such accounts have left some analysts hopeful.\u201cWhen the time comes, Kim Jong-un is expected to adopt policies that will ease his country\u2019s isolation and embrace good things from the West,\u201d Paik Hak-soon, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute, a think tank outside Seoul, said in a paper on Mr. Kim\u2019s leadership published in February.But first came what South Korean officials have called a \u201creign of terror.\u201dAfter returning to Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital, Mr. Kim graduated from the Kim Il-sung Military University in 2006 and was put on a fast track into the nation\u2019s military leadership. Recent state propaganda footage has shown him inspecting military units in the years after graduation. In one scene, he is seen welcoming his father home from an overseas trip and shaking hands with him as an equal.After his father\u2019s death, though, Mr. Kim\u2019s hold on power is believed to have been precarious. He had completed his university education only five years earlier and was surrounded by experienced military leaders and party officials. Outside North Korea, many assumed he was the supreme leader in name only, with real power in the hands of Jang Song-thaek, his uncle and regent.Mr. Jang appeared to help his nephew carry out a systematic purge, replacing many of the nation\u2019s most powerful generals and bureaucrats, according to South Korean intelligence officials.Cheong Seong-chang, an expert on the Kim family at the Sejong Institute, said high-level North Korean defectors told him that Mr. Jang had as many as 20 children and that Mr. Kim had them all killed.\u201cHe moved quickly and ruthlessly,\u201d said Daniel A. Pinkston, a Seoul-based professor of international relations at Troy University. \u201cI think most people did not expect a man so young to be so proficient at managing his dictatorship.\u201dAnalysts say Mr. Kim has restored the authority of the Workers\u2019 Party apparatus and uses it as his main vehicle for governing, in contrast with his father, who put the military first, rarely convened formal party meetings and made decisions in secretive, late-night sessions of his cronies. That, some say, has added a degree of institutional predictability to his rule.Mr. Rodman, the former professional basketball player, has described going to a stadium packed with 150,000 people during the 2013 visit to Pyongyang where he was allowed to meet Mr. Kim. \u201cPeople were standing for a half-hour, just clapping,\u201d he told an audience at West Point in March. \u201cThey were crying for this man.\u201dMr. Rodman was even allowed to hold Mr. Kim\u2019s baby daughter, the first confirmation for much of the world that he had a child. (South Korean officials believe that Ms. Ri had a second child last year, a son.)\u201cWhen North Koreans first saw him, we thought Kim Il-sung was reincarnated,\u201d said Baek Yu-min, a North Korean defector.During much of Kim Il-sung\u2019s rule, North Korea\u2019s economy was bigger than South Korea\u2019s. But today, per capita income in the North is less than 5 percent what it is in the South. That chasm poses perhaps the greatest threat to Kim Jong-un\u2019s political legitimacy.Mr. Kim\u2019s answer has been to pursue a policy of \u201cbyungjin,\u201d or parallel advance, which calls for the simultaneous pursuit of nuclear weapons and economic development. Only with a nuclear deterrent, Mr. Kim contends, will the North be secure enough to focus on growth.But conditions remain dismal outside the showcase capital, and further growth may require an end to the sanctions that limit the North\u2019s ability to trade with the world. And that would mean giving up the nuclear program.Mr. Kim, however, appears to see the problem differently. More than 30,000 North Koreans have fled since the famine of the 1990s, and defectors say he must keep the country isolated because he is afraid of it being swallowed by the South.That is where the nuclear arsenal comes in. His government has argued that it needs nuclear arms to protect itself from being toppled like others who gave up weapons of mass destruction; the state news media has pointed to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.\u201cKim Jong-un is here to rule for decades, playing the long game,\u201d said Mr. Koh, the Dongguk University professor. \u201cOver time, he believes that the world will have no option but to accept his country as a nuclear power.\u201dAnalysts say it may be difficult for Mr. Kim to back down in the face of foreign pressure, especially on the nuclear issue, given how closely he is associated with the program.The state news media has highlighted what it claims is his military daring, especially in dealing with the United States. One recent propaganda film reported that Mr. Kim persuaded his father to approve the test firing of a long-range rocket in 2009, when he would have been about 25.If the Americans intervened, he was said to have argued, the North should go to war.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Can Contain North Korea Without \u2018Fire and Fury\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFor decades North Korea threatened American \u201cimperialists\u201d and our South Korean allies with a \u201csea of fire\u201d and retribution for trying to contain their conventional and nuclear weapons programs. North Korean leaders have made as much noise as a small yappy dog confronting a placidly tolerant Rottweiler trying to take away its nuclear bone.The president\u2019s cabinet therefore needs to emphasize the human cost of trying to eliminate North Korea\u2019s plutonium- and uranium-based nuclear facilities and weapons. The costs would be staggering \u2014 possibly millions of South Korean and thousands of American lives. And because we presumably don\u2019t know where all the nuclear facilities, material, scientists and weapons are hidden, and because North Korea has mobile ground launchers, a major military strike might not even succeed.The only solution is a multipronged strategy aimed at containing the threat posed by North Korea. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, came to power at the end of 2011 with three main objectives: consolidate his power, prevent international actors from overthrowing his regime and carrying out gradual economic reform so the Kim dynasty could retain power over the long run.This last point is often overlooked. Young Kim was educated in Switzerland, and long-time Korea analysts say he understands he cannot keep North Koreans economically oppressed and ignorant of their impoverished status relative to the rest of the world forever. But he will need time to strengthen the nation\u2019s economy.Diplomacy will be required to explain to the North Koreans \u2014 as well as to the Chinese and Russian governments, which are nearly as opposed to regime change as Pyongyang is \u2014 that our aim is not to kick out Mr. Kim or eliminate the North Korean state, but to address the threat posed by its nuclear weapons. Working with China, Washington can offer incentives to encourage North Korea to continue its first steps toward market reform and privatization.Finally, the United States can build trust and make progress on what North Korea calls \u201chumanitarian\u201d issues: winning release of American and Japanese hostages held by Pyongyang; allowing reunions between North and South Korean families and repatriating the remains of American troops from the Korean War.President Trump has a chance now to simultaneously apply all four prongs of a strategy \u2014 deterrence, pressure, diplomacy and incentives \u2014 to not only contain the threat from North Korea, but also pave the way for economic reform and real change for the North Korean people. That is something only a superpower, working with it allies and even adversaries and competitors like Russia and China, can do. Let\u2019s swap brimstone for bargaining.Evelyn N. Farkas, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, is a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia/Ukraine Eurasia in the Obama administration and a former staff member for the Senate Armed Services Committee, overseeing Asia Pacific defense policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump Cannot Redeem Himself", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe saw Donald Trump\u2019s true colors on Saturday, when he was given the chance \u2014 a ready-made moment for presidential grace \u2014 to denounce the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., and instead found wrongdoing \u201con many sides.\u201d That was Trump minus the pressure and the planning. That was his initial instinct, his first impulse.We saw a different palette at a lectern in the White House on early Monday afternoon, but it was pure artifice, and muted and unpersuasive because of that.Sure, he got some of the brush strokes right: the succinct assertion that \u201cracism is evil\u201d; the specific callout of the \u201cK.K.K.\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d; the remembrance \u2014 finally \u2014 of Heather Heyer, who died as a consequence of the precise hatred that it took him more than two days to name.But we should note that just hours before he stepped up to that lectern, supposedly to make things right, he used that infernal Twitter account of his to taunt a black chief executive, Kenneth Frazier, for resigning from an administration advisory board. That was unscripted Trump. And he was peeved and hostile, not penitential and healing.We should also note that he began his brief statement on Monday by congratulating himself on the American economy and implicitly taking credit for what he said were a million new jobs. This is what our self-consumed, ungenerous president prefers to do \u2014 brag. He thumps his chest when he should be on his knees.Atone? Adjust? Inspire? These are outside of his character and beyond his ken. We can\u2019t hope for any better, not at this point. And neither can his fellow Republicans, who find themselves at another juncture \u2014 maybe the most important one yet \u2014 where they must decide whether to continue showing him allegiance or carve out greater space between him and them. They\u2019re no doubt judging the politics of it all and looking to the numbers. How I wish they\u2019d judge the morality of it all and look to their souls.Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019d rather that Trump said what he did on Monday than maintain his silence, which was breathtaking, galling \u2014 and spectacularly revealing. He needed to speak, and to say some of the very words he did.But the length of his delay upped the ante on his delivery, which was passionless. He barely cleared the bar of grudging. He fell miles short of stirring:\u201cJustice will be delivered.\u201d \u201cNo matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws.\u201d \u201cWe are all made by the same Almighty God.\u201d \u201cRacism is evil.\u201dAmen, amen, amen and amen, but this preacher\u2019s sermons have been wildly inconsistent and as often designed to divide as to unite. That was his path to power, one much uglier than most politicians travel, and his election didn\u2019t do what so many of the Republicans who reluctantly supported him hoped that it would and make him a bigger person.No, Trump is the yardstick by which all other Republicans measure large. He makes you yearn for leaders you never in your wildest dreams considered yearn-worthy.When, before Trump, did you find yourself wishing that someone could just summon the courage, clarity and compassion of \u2026 Ted Cruz? If only the Texas senator were our president! Back on Saturday, when Trump was still hemming, hawing and hiding, Cruz released a statement superior to what Trump, with more time and the help of many aides, delivered on Monday.\u201cThe Nazis, the K.K.K. and white supremacists are repulsive and evil, and all of us have a moral obligation to speak out against the lies, bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred they propagate,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThese bigots want to tear our country apart, but they will fail.\u201dHe was emphatic and eloquent. So were Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican. As I heard their voices and read their words, I saw a glimmer of something positive: Trump\u2019s failings are prompting G.O.P. leaders to enunciate certain principles in a clearer and more unequivocal way than they did before. Because of him, they\u2019re drawing lines in the sand \u2014 at least semantically.Of course the winds of opportunism and convenience could wipe out those lines in an instant. Of course Republicans have upbraided Trump before, only to hug him anew.But there can be no doubt: He\u2019s past the point of hugging. His pretend amends at the White House on Monday didn\u2019t color him warm, cuddly and redeemed. They were just Trump trying to get through another miserable day. And you, Republican members of Congress, have to figure out how your party and the rest of us get through the next miserable years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Identity Politics", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the wake of the presidential election, we\u2019ve all been asking simplistic questions about how Donald Trump won. Was it economics? Was it racism? Was it misogyny? Did it come down to identity? We know that it can\u2019t have been just one thing, and that President Trump\u2019s triumph was a concoction of many things. Nonetheless, several factors came together in a peculiar way, with serious electoral consequences. Millions of white voters began to see themselves more openly not as white supremacists but as white identified.It is no secret that the president has capitalized on the increasing salience of race and ethnicity in recent years. The furious reaction to many different historical and cultural developments \u2014 mass immigration; the success of the civil rights and women\u2019s rights movements; the election and re-election of a black president; and the approaching end of white majority status in the United States \u2014 has created a political environment ripe for the growth of white identity politics.When the dominant status of whites relative to racial and ethnic minorities is secure and unchallenged, white identity likely remains dormant. When whites perceive their group\u2019s dominant status is threatened or their group is unfairly disadvantaged, however, their racial identity may become salient and politically relevant.The whites marching on Charlottesville were only a small segment of a much larger population for whom the politics of white identity resonates. The vast majority of white Americans who feel threatened by the country\u2019s growing racial and ethnic diversity are not members of the KKK or neo-Nazis. They are much greater in number, and far more mainstream, than the white supremacists who protested in Virginia over the weekend.The survey, they write,asked four questions that captured dimensions of white identity: the importance of white identity, how much whites are being discriminated against, the likelihood that whites are losing jobs to nonwhites, and the importance of whites working together to change laws unfair to whites. We combined those questions into a scale capturing the strength of white identity and found that it was strongly related to Republicans\u2019 support for Donald Trump.On the basis of that scale, the authors assembled the data illustrated by the accompanying chart, which shows that fewer than five percent of white Republicans who indicated that their racial identity was of little importance supported Trump. Among those who said their identity as whites was extremely important to them, Trump\u2019s support reached 81 percent.Both white racial identity and beliefs that whites are treated unfairly are powerful predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primaries.Once Trump secured this \u201cwhite identifier\u201d base \u2014 making him competitive in a multicandidate field \u2014 he was positioned to expand his traction among traditional Republicans, including a decisive majority of those who backed Mitt Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush.What are the views of \u201cwhite identifiers\u201d?According to Jardina, these votersare more likely to think that the growth of racial or ethnic groups in the United States that are not white is having a negative effect on American culture.And they aremuch more likely to rank illegal immigration the most important issue facing the U.S. today, relative to the budget deficit, health care, the economy, unemployment, outsourcing of jobs to other countries, abortion, same-sex marriage, education, gun control, the environment or terrorism.Perhaps most important, Jardina found that white identifiers arean aggrieved group. They are more likely to agree that American society owes white people a better chance in life than they currently have. And white identifiers would like many of the same benefits of identity politics that they believe other groups enjoy.In other words, most \u2014 though by no means all \u2014 white identifiers appear to be driven as much by anger at their sense of lost status as by their animosity toward other groups, although these two feelings are clearly linked.Trump effect combined with eight years of racialized politics under President Obama, means that racial attitudes are now more closely aligned with white Americans\u2019 partisan preferences than they have been at any time in the history of polling.Just over a decade ago, political scientists were discounting the significance of white identity in elections.whites\u2019 whiteness is usually likely to be no more noteworthy to them than is breathing the air around them. White group consciousness is therefore not likely to be a major force in whites\u2019 political attitudes today.Wong and Cho went on, however, to make what turned out to be a crucially important point: that sincewhite identity is indeed unstable but easily triggered, the danger is that a demagogue could influence the salience of these identities to promote negative outgroup attitudes, link racial identification more strongly to policy preferences, and exacerbate group conflict.Podhoretz recognizes Trump\u2019s adamant refusal to alienate his most dogged backers:If there\u2019s one thing politicians can feel in their marrow, even a non-pol pol like Trump, it\u2019s who is in their base and what it is that binds the base to themand, even more important,the nucleus \u2014 the very heart of a base, the root of the root of support.For years, Podhoretz writes, Trump operated below the radar, cultivating a constituency of \u201cdisaffected Americans entirely on the margins of American life, politically and culturally and organizationally.\u201d\u201cThis has been happening for a while, which is why Trump was able to leverage white identity in 2016,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTrump went where no other GOP primary candidate would go even though they all knew those voters were there.\u201dIn \u201cIdentity Crisis,\u201d Sides, Tesler and Vavreck write that Trump\u2019s primary campaignbecame a vehicle for a different kind of identity politics \u2014 oriented around white Americans\u2019 feelings of marginalization in an increasingly diverse America.The three authors describe a rapidly \u201cgrowing sense of white victimhood.\u201d They cite surveys showing that among Republicans, the perception of discrimination against whites grew from 38 percent in 2011-12 to 47 percent in January 2016.Trump, according to Sides, Tesler and Vavreck, wasunusual in how he talked about race. Candidates have traditionally used implicit racial appeals to win over voters without appearing overtly prejudiced. And, as much political science research has shown, these appeals have often succeeded in activating support among voters with less favorable views of racial minorities. But Trump talked about issues related to race and ethnicity in explicit terms.probably because his supporters think that whites and Christians are the most oppressed groups of people in the country.Trump has mobilized the white identity electorate, and in doing so has put the tenuous American commitment to racial and ethnic egalitarianism on the line. And Trump has been captured by the success of his own demagoguery. He surged ahead of his Republican competitors for the nomination when he threw matches on the kindling and now, under siege, his only strategy for survival is to pour gasoline on the flames.An earlier version of this column misstated the university affiliation of Grace E. Cho at the time she co-wrote a paper with Cara Wong; in 2005, she was a graduate student in political science at the University of Michigan, not a psychology professor at St. Olaf College.Advertisement"}

And as more people have left rural areas, schools in small towns and villages have closed, creating a vicious circle. Attracting young families to a town without an elementary school can be a very tall order.That was the problem in Markdale, Ontario, where the province, looking to cut costs, planned to close the local Beavercrest Community School.Unlike in many other communities, a savior arrived.The town\u2019s big employer, Chapman\u2019s Ice Cream, stepped and offered two million Canadian dollars to save the school. Private money and public education don\u2019t traditionally mix in Canada so the initial plan didn\u2019t quite work out. But when I went there to report and write an article about the school, I found that the offer of cash had prompted the province and school board to rethink the role of rural schools. Beavercrest, in a new form, looks likely to survive.The stream of asylum seekers crossing the border from the United States south of Montreal continues to rise. This week a crew from the army appeared at the most popular informal crossing point and built a tent camp to allow police and border officials to process the newcomers. The would-be immigrants are also being housed in Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium.Many of the newcomers are Haitians and apparently fear deportation from the United States under the policies of President Trump.Dan Levin traveled to Montreal and to the border to report on this situation. He found that the current wave of asylum seekers was very likely prompted by false information shared by Haitians on social media indicating that if you could get into Canada, you could stay. But for most of the claimants, it may turn out that their efforts to slip into Canada will only leave them being deported from Canada.The novelist Claire Messud, the daughter of a Canadian mother and a French father, had an unusually peripatetic childhood. The many places in the world that her family called home included Toronto. \u201cYou\u2019re only ever understood in parts,\u201d she told Ruth Franklin in an interview for The New York Times Magazine. \u201cI\u2019m a different person in French. I\u2019m a different person in New York. I\u2019m a different person in Canada.\u201dBrand\u2019s Deli is a quick stroll from the beaches of Long Island. But its approach to sandwich nomenclature is more like something you\u2019d expect to find in Canada. The sandwiches bear the nicknames of National Hockey League stars. Fancy roast pork, mozzarella, gravy, duck sauce on garlic bread? Then order a Messiah, named for the former New York Rangers great Mark Messier. Around Long Island, the deli\u2019s owner, Joe Brand, shares Gordie Howe\u2019s nickname: Mr. Hockey.In Chattanooga, Tenn., Patricia Cohen found that foreign companies, including Volkswagen, have revived the economy and made local politicians and business leaders aware that foreign trade has become a key part of their local prosperity \u2014 and something that may now be in jeopardy.Alan Rappeport, who covers economic policy for The Times from Washington, reported this week that one short-term effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to trade has been to hurt some American businesses. That includes home builders who rely on Canadian lumber which, once again, is a trade target.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stay, Hide or Leave? Hard Choices for Immigrants in the Heartland", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "Edith Rivera loved her life in Hampton, Iowa, but for many undocumented immigrants like her, this summer has been a season of fear or flight.Supported byHAMPTON, Iowa \u2014 It was quitting time. Edith Rivera took one last lunch order, dropped off a basket of tortilla chips and set off from work, heading out to the farm roads where other immigrants feared to drive.Like them, Ms. Rivera, 33, had no legal status in the country where she had lived for 18 years. She had no driver\u2019s license, apart from the long-expired North Carolina identification she held safe, like a talisman, in her wallet.But as she skimmed past the northern Iowa cornfields on her way to her son Steven\u2019s seventh-grade track meet, she did not share other immigrants\u2019 fears. Not of being pulled over. Not of raids or deportation. Not of the man in the White House. Not of the new Franklin County sheriff\u2019s quest to make sure this rapidly diversifying community of hog barns and egg farms would never again be known as an immigrant sanctuary.Her American journey was waning, and she had little left to lose.Her husband, Jes\u00fas Canseco-Rodriguez, was already gone \u2014 deported to Mexico in 2015. Ms. Rivera had jettisoned their apartment and sold off what the family had built here in Hampton: their small business power-washing hog barns, Mr. Canseco\u2019s work truck, their furniture.Now, at this tense juncture for immigrants and their adoptive hometowns across the conservative swaths of rural America, Ms. Rivera planned to sever one last tie. She was returning to Mexico \u2014 and to her husband \u2014 with Steven, 13 years old and American-born.Some politicians call it \u201cself-deportation.\u201d She called it her family\u2019s only hope of being together.The heartland is freckled with Hamptons and Ediths. In small agricultural towns that supported President Trump by 20-point margins, residents are now seeing an immigration crackdown ripple through the families that have helped revive their downtown squares and transform their economies.In Hampton, Latinos make up 51 percent of the elementary-school rosters and sit in the next pews over at the bilingual Easter Mass.Like Ms. Rivera, many are weighing whether to stay, hide or leave altogether.As she angled her gray Camry north, farms and silos whipping by under a sunny spring sky, Ms. Rivera scrolled through memories and fears as if they were pictures on her phone. The apartment by the golf course where she used to chase Steven through the grass. The curling prairie trails where they walked after school. The quiet blacktops where she went jogging.\u201cI love the days like today,\u201d she said.And when their departure date finally arrived, could she bring herself to get on that Delta flight and leave?The most indelible American stories are often road trips of one kind or another, whether they end at Plymouth Rock or in Hampton, Iowa. Ms. Rivera\u2019s first journey whisked her away from her poor home in southern Mexico when she was 14, across the Arizona border illegally, to join relatives looking for jobs in North Carolina. Another road trip brought her to Iowa with her husband and child, then a toddler.In the decade the family spent in Hampton, they drove to Minneapolis, where her husband played first base in the Liga Latina de B\u00e9isbol, and where young Steven began, as one friend said, to \u201cbreathe baseball.\u201d They drove to horse races and to a water park in Des Moines.After Mr. Canseco\u2019s arrest in 2015 on charges of illegally re-entering the country, there were trips to jail and to a federal courthouse.Now, one final road trip waited: The drive from Hampton to a 5:45 a.m. flight out of Des Moines. The itinerary: Atlanta to Mexico City to Veracruz, and the start of an uncertain new life.\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to provide everything,\u201d Ms. Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s no work, no opportunities there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid at how she\u2019s going to face all this,\u201d Mr. Canseco said in a telephone interview from Mexico. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how different it is.\u201dSome nights, as Steven fell asleep in the bedroom he and his mother shared, Ms. Rivera called her husband to talk about the home he was building for them on her family\u2019s ranch in the village of Joach\u00edn, and the world of cows, sheep, lime trees and poverty that waited.Hampton, population 4,400, rises from the rolling fields of northern Iowa, a courthouse clock tower and grain elevator forming its simple skyline.It is a place where neighbors catch up at the Fareway market\u2019s butcher counter; where the economy revolves around corn, hog confinements and egg farms, and where Latino immigrants do more and more of the work as the white population dies off or moves away.The town tumbled into the nation\u2019s immigration debate early this year when the newly elected county sheriff, Linn Larson, told the community he was ending policies that had added this tiny county to national lists of immigrant safe havens. Sheriff Larson said he would share arrest information with immigration officials and cooperate with them when asked.\u201cThe only sanctuary I plan on offering is to the law-abiding people that want a safe place to raise their families and work,\u201d he promised.The county commissioners backed up the sheriff, and many residents said they liked his stance.At the Hardee\u2019s along Highway 3, where tables of machinists, farmers and retirees sip 99-cent coffees each morning and hash out the day\u2019s news, many said they supported a harder line on immigration.There was talk of signs in Mexico directing immigrants to Hampton. Some complained about Hampton\u2019s being lumped in with liberal sanctuary cities like Seattle and New York.If the sheriff reported undocumented immigrants who landed in his custody to the federal authorities, \u201cIt could make our county safer,\u201d said Fran Foland, 69.Others said they got along fine with their immigrant neighbors. They ate at the Mexican restaurant, La Amiguita, where Ms. Rivera worked, and admired immigrants who cleaned out reeking livestock pens for $10 to $15 an hour.But why, they asked, couldn\u2019t the immigrants learn English and come here legally, like their own German and Norwegian ancestors?For many immigrants in town, it was a season of fear. Some papered over windows and front-door peepholes. Parents who dreaded being detained drew up contingency plans for what should be done with their children and cars.Hundreds filled the high school gym to press the sheriff about his new approach. What would happen if they were pulled over? Would his deputies conduct immigration raids? Sheriff Larson tried to reassure people that his officers would not target immigrants.Conversation by conversation, longtime Hampton residents struggled to reconcile their support for the president with the values they cherished: compassion, kindness and charity for their neighbors and friends.Or in Steve Pearson\u2019s case, for his namesake.Mr. Pearson, 63, moved to Hampton 30 years ago because it was the biggest town in Iowa without a certified public accountant.When he and a partner bought a building for their accounting firm, they rented rooms upstairs to Mexican families. Mr. Pearson called them \u201cthe amigos\u201d and started carrying a Spanish-English dictionary. He helped them get loans and wire money home.\u201cThe fact that we were renting to illegals, that bothered some people,\u201d Mr. Pearson said. \u201cMy thought was, why not tell the politicians to change it? It\u2019s in Exodus: Be kind to foreigners because you were foreigners once in the land of Egypt.\u201dOne of the amigos stood out. He was a teenager from Veracruz who had arrived with his father and younger brother. His name was Jes\u00fas.Jes\u00fas grew up, spent several years working in North Carolina, and returned to Hampton with a woman named Edith who had been attracted to his athleticism, work ethic and quiet humility. They had a son: Steven.Steven, named for the mustachioed landlord who had treated the Canseco family so kindly.Now living 2,000 miles away, Mr. Canseco still says that \u201cthe greatest man I know in the U.S.A.\u201d is Mr. Pearson.But times have changed.And last year, Mr. Pearson, a conservative Republican, yearned for a change in the White House, despite his misgivings about the candidate promising it.\u201cSo why not vote for Trump?\u201dSix months into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Mr. Pearson said he still thought the country\u2019s immigration system was broken. He was angered by the fate of the Canseco-Rivera family, though he noted that Mr. Canseco had been deported on President Barack Obama\u2019s watch, not Mr. Trump\u2019s.Give people like them work permits, Mr. Pearson said. Give them residency. \u201cI\u2019m angered by the stupidity of it all,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s 10 million people \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s grab this one.\u2019 It\u2019s very sad.\u201dLives are braided together in Hampton. After Mr. Canseco was arrested, the city\u2019s police captain, a retired school principal and Mr. Pearson all wrote to the court on his behalf.Another letter came from Megan Pearson Rosenberg, 37, Mr. Pearson\u2019s daughter \u2014 who is also one of Ms. Rivera\u2019s closest friends.The two women met through their children when Steven Canseco was not yet school age.Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s son, Mickey, now 14, is a few months older than Steven, and her daughter, Lily, 9, shares Steven\u2019s athletic, adventurous side. When they played, Lily and Steven would scramble and climb around the yard while Mickey sat in a tree reading.For the grown-ups, the friendship was an easy fit. Ms. Rosenberg, a lawyer, did legal work for Mr. Canseco\u2019s business. She accompanied Ms. Rivera to court to deal with a traffic ticket.Ms. Rivera went with her husband and son to Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s home for Thanksgiving, where Steven announced that he had never eaten turkey.The Rosenbergs, in turn, experienced Mexican Christmases with their friends, eating until they could barely move. Ms. Rivera introduced them to her homemade green chile and cast a skeptical eye on the Rosenbergs\u2019 version of Mexican cooking \u2014 Old El Paso tacos.Steven showed up unannounced in the Rosenbergs\u2019 backyard to play on the swing set. He and Mickey made pizza and watched baseball movies together. And Steven revealed a sly sense of humor.He once told the Rosenbergs they were his white family. Another time, Ms. Rosenberg asked him if he followed politics. No, Megan, he deadpanned: I follow my dreams.On July 22, 2015, Ms. Rosenberg got an urgent Facebook message from Ms. Rivera: Call me.That morning, Mr. Canseco had been arrested by immigration agents at a gas station on Hampton\u2019s west side as he, his father and an employee were heading to wash out a hog barn.It was not Mr. Canseco\u2019s first encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He had been deported in 2005 after being caught using a false Social Security number to obtain work, but returned to his family a week later after another illegal border crossing.That morning in 2015, Mr. Canseco said, the immigration agents told him, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take you.\u201dMs. Rivera feared visiting her husband in jail because of her own immigration status.Steven did visit his father, and felt proud for not crying in front of him.That September, Mr. Canseco pleaded guilty to one count of illegally re-entering the United States. He was back in Mexico when Ms. Rivera and Steven went to the Rosenbergs\u2019 house for Thanksgiving dinner.As he reconciled himself to staying in Mexico, Mr. Canseco had to recast his sense of national identity. He said he used to feel a surge of belonging when he heard \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d before baseball games. \u201cI felt myself as an American,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in a dream. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not.\u201dUnited States law also viewed Mr. Canseco differently now: He wasn\u2019t just an immigrant in the country illegally. He was a repeat offender.He tried to return to Iowa even after his second deportation. He said he swam across the Rio Grande with a small group but turned back when immigration agents surrounded them. He then tried to cross the Arizona desert, where according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he was caught this April and immediately sent back to Mexico on an \u201cexpedited removal.\u201dTo the family, it was becoming clear Mr. Canseco would never be able to rejoin them. So Ms. Rivera made up her mind to join him in Mexico. She decided to leave on July 21, a day before the second anniversary of his arrest.Iowa\u2019s spring ripened to summer. Corn shot up. Volunteers repainted the 19th-century storefronts of Hampton\u2019s recreated prairie downtown to ready them for the county fair. Ms. Rivera\u2019s last American days were slipping by.As she waited for Steven\u2019s relay race at a track meet, Ms. Rivera agonized over money and time. She wanted to save up while she could, so she worked lunch shifts at La Amiguita, where she averaged $40 in tips, then drove 90 miles to Des Moines to work weekends at another restaurant.But she felt torn. She wanted to spend more time with her friends in Hampton. And she found herself indulging her son with expensive sunglasses, sneakers and a baseball bat.She just wanted things to feel normal.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing right,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be strong all the time and be positive. It\u2019s so hard.\u201dAnother warm evening, and the families were together at the Rosenbergs\u2019 house, talking about the future of their friendship. Ms. Rivera, an artist with an eyeliner pencil, spends hours practicing her makeup skills. She wondered if she could find the same makeup in Mexico.\u201cCan you still send me my Chanel?\u201d Ms. Rivera asked.\u201cYou\u2019re overestimating my abilities,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said.The Rosenbergs have talked about visiting Veracruz one day, but are wary of the security conditions. The families have talked about whether Steven might come back to Iowa for high school, and maybe live with the Rosenbergs. Ms. Rivera hoped she could get a tourist visa and return from time to time.It was getting late. Time to put the kids to bed. The women hugged.\u201cBye, amiga,\u201d Ms. Rivera said as she headed out the door.\u201cBye, amiga,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said. \u201cLove you.\u201dAnother day closer to their departure, Steven cracked open the back of a white trailer. It held the last artifacts of their American lives. A microwave oven, boxes of clothes, golf clubs, Mr. Canseco\u2019s tools, an artificial Christmas tree. \u201cMy dad wanted to have Christmas in Mexico,\u201d Steven said.After his father\u2019s arrest, Steven cried nearly every night for months. But as his reunion with Mr. Canseco got closer, friends said Steven seemed excited. He savored his time with friends, confident that he would be able to return to the United States. It was like the lesson his father taught him about being lost.\u201cWhenever I\u2019m in the woods, I try to break a stick and leave it hanging and make it really obvious,\u201d he said one morning. \u201cSo if I were to get lost, I know I\u2019ve been there already. I know where I\u2019m at.\u201dHis last days with his friends, his red Hampton-Dumont Bulldogs baseball cap: snapped twigs. When the county fair came to town in July, Steven roamed the midway with his friends, laughing and slurping vanilla ice cream.As the Riveras and Rosenbergs took their last boat ride together on Clear Lake, Steven jumped and flipped onto a floating orange foam mat. \u201cLook at how many birds there are!\u201d he yelled out. His mother sat quietly on the back of the boat, trailing her feet in the water.Her closest friends saw Ms. Rivera grow sadder and quieter as the July 21 flight approached.\u201cI don\u2019t think about it, because I don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Ms. Rivera said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is right or not.\u201dShe asked one of her best friends, Hortencia Saldivar: How many days do I have left? Don\u2019t think about it, Ms. Saldivar replied.One night, the women sank into Ms. Saldivar\u2019s couch with a bottle of wine, and painted their toenails with purple glitter. It hit Ms. Saldivar that this was the last time they would do this.\u201cWe\u2019re so used to being each other\u2019s support,\u201d said Ms. Saldivar, 36. \u201cNow I have to let go.\u201dIt is quitting time.The Des Moines International Airport is almost empty at 3:30 in the morning on July 21, save for two women and a 13-year-old boy, lugging overpacked suitcases through the departures terminal. Ms. Saldivar drove them here from Hampton, and is helping them check in.Steven is keyed up. He plays with a fidget spinner, makes origami shapes out of a gum wrapper and worries about whether his baseball cap will give him hat hair before he sees his dad.Ms. Rivera barely slept. She woke at 2:30 to do her makeup and now hurriedly transfers shoes and shampoo between suitcases to stay within the luggage-weight limits. \u201cWhat am I going to take out?\u201d she asks Ms. Saldivar in Spanish.She straightens Steven\u2019s watch and picks an invisible speck of lint from his red Hampton T-shirt as they wait. Only one aspect of her life feels good now, she says: that she\u2019ll be with her family.She and Ms. Saldivar embrace. They say \u201cI love you,\u201d and promise to see each other again.\u201cAlg\u00fan d\u00eda,\u201d Ms. Rivera says. Someday.A Delta agent asks for their passports.\u201cDo you have a return date?\u201d she asks.\u201cOne way,\u201d Ms. Rivera says. \u201cNo return.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save Your Sanity. Downgrade Your Life.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionRecently, I gave up my electric toothbrush. There was nothing wrong with it. It was, in fact, an upscale model, and when I used it, I felt certain my teeth were not only getting cleaner and whiter but also perhaps even better aligned. And yet, my old manual toothbrush, poking out of a mug on the vanity, beckoned. One night, as I wearily approached the sink, I realized the last thing I wanted to experience was the frantic whir of yet another spinning gizmo. I plucked out the old-timey toothbrush instead, and never looked back.I deliberately downgraded.Over the past few years, as my work life has accelerated at boggling speed, my personal life has begun creeping backward toward the 20th century. Like carbon offsets, each decision to remove a technology at home makes the corresponding upgrade at work feel more acceptable. Work: Slack, our latest instant-messaging program, replaces conversation as a way of conveying simple queries. Home: Devices are banned from bedrooms. Work: Upgrade to new \u201ccontent management system.\u201d Home: Netflix account to remain stubbornly DVD-based.Disruption can be a positive force in the office, but at home it feels the way disruption has always felt: intrusive and annoying. At home, at least, we have the power to pace the change, to choose the old over the new. These incremental lifestyle downgrades help calibrate a rate of technological change that might otherwise produce a resting state of whiplash. They let me catch my breath.Even the highest-tech among us seem to feel this need: Digital tweens lust after manual typewriters while techies embrace Maker culture on weekends. People want to use more of their hands than just their thumbs, to get them dirty and scrub them clean afterward.This requires occasionally putting down the smartphone. According to a 2017 study by the American Psychological Association, more Americans are employing \u201ctechnology usage management strategies\u201d such as banning cellphones from the dinner table (depressingly, only 28 percent of people do this), taking occasional \u201cdigital detoxes\u201d and forbidding devices during family time.My personal mode of self-restraint is to always carry my phone when I\u2019m not with my kids and always leave it in another room when I am. The kids themselves don\u2019t get phones at all. When my 12-year-old daughter walks home from school without one, I intentionally have no idea where she is, just like nobody knew where kids were when I was growing up. How rare it is these days not to be able to know something.Though we are a forward-looking people, Americans are also quite good at nostalgia. We understand that the economy, the technology, the culture, the media are relentlessly pushing forward (\u201cThe March of Time!\u201d), yet a streak of Luddite backwardness persists. This tendency is aided and abetted by an ancient technology, the book. Each season seems to have its stop-the-world best seller. In the mid-1990s it was Elaine St. James\u2019s \u201cSimplify Your Life.\u201d In the mid-aughts, \u201cThe Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.\u201d At the end of the last decade, it was the sweaty toolbox of \u201cShop Class as Soulcraft.\u201d Most recently, it was the minimalist Marie Kondo\u2019s book about tidying and the sensibly titled \u201cOverwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time,\u201d a book I may one day have time to read.Why this yearning? In recent years, a number of studies have documented the effects of techno-stress \u2014 the psychological and physical impact of spending countless hours staring at a screen. According to the 2017 A.P.A. study, on a typical workday, 85 percent of people are constantly or often digitally connected (by email, text and social media). On their days \u201coff\u201d? It\u2019s nearly the same: 81 percent.This turns out not to be soothing. According to the A.P.A. study, nearly half of millennials worry about the negative effects of social media on their physical and mental health. Often for good reason. A 2017 survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 66 percent of Americans have witnessed online harassment and 41 percent have experienced it themselves.When I watch kids giggling at their phones rather than at one another or families in the local diner silently sitting together in front of their respective devices, I can\u2019t help thinking of Pixar\u2019s post-apocalyptic \u201cWALL-E,\u201d a nightmare vision in which earthlings, stripped of their musculature and humanity, recline blobbily in automated loungers, affixed to portable screens whose animated features are all they know of human interaction.And so, I resist.

{"Headline": "Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s Response Reshape Virginia Gubernatorial Race", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFALLS CHURCH, Va. \u2014 The bloody white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., has thrust race and history to the forefront of this year\u2019s campaign for governor in Virginia, a tradition-bound state whose identity has always been rooted in a past that is as proud for some residents as it is painful for others.The gubernatorial race in this swing state was already set to be the next big test of the nation\u2019s politics, its results inevitably to be read as a harbinger for the 2018 midterm elections and President Trump\u2019s fate. But the events last weekend in one of its historical centers \u2014 in the city that Thomas Jefferson called home and on the university campus that he designed and founded \u2014 ensure that the nation\u2019s highest-profile campaign this fall will also be fought in part along the highly combustible lines of racial politics.With Mr. Trump defending Confederate statues and his former top strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, openly inviting Democrats to continue focusing on the issue of removing monuments, the president will loom large over the commonwealth in November.It is a course that leaves both parties somewhat discomfited, both because of Virginia\u2019s bifurcated demography and the cautious nature of the two candidates.In the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s violence, Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, the Democratic nominee for governor, has firmed up his call to take down Confederate monuments in the state where much of the Civil War was fought and where so many Confederate leaders, now memorialized in marble, emerged.Mr. Northam said in an interview that \u201can awakening\u201d had taken place in Virginia after the Charlottesville violence that left one woman dead, many more wounded and a liberal college town convulsing.\u201cWe have to be sensitive to all people\u2019s feelings and represent all Virginians,\u201d he said, criticizing his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, for not \u201cdenouncing the president\u201d by name after Mr. Trump asserted that there were good people marching alongside Nazi sympathizers and Klansmen last weekend.Yet Mr. Northam has little appetite to make Virginia\u2019s counties and cities uproot their memorials to the Confederacy and says the decision should remain up to the localities.Mr. Gillespie also believes local communities should make that decision. He argues that the statues should remain in place, but include added context clarifying that the lost cause they represent would have perpetuated slavery, not just the euphemistic \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d preferred by some traditionalists.\u201cRather than glorifying their objects, the statues should be instructional,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said in a lengthy written statement earlier in the week.In an illustration of this state\u2019s complicated politics, and the expectations of each party\u2019s base, it is Mr. Northam, the descendant of slaveholders and a product of Virginia\u2019s rural eastern shore, who is calling for the statues to come down, while Mr. Gillespie, a New Jersey native who moved to Northern Virginia after establishing a political career in Washington, is more closely aligned with the old guard.Recent statements from participants at the protests.Each, though, hails from the establishment wing of their party. And the specter of an election shifting from a hard-fought but aboveboard clash over taxes, health care and the economy to an explosive debate about race and identity makes officials in both campaigns uneasy.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spoke for the more reticent in his party this week when he suggested they were better off keeping the focus on the more politically safe topic of neo-Nazis and the Klan. Democrats worry about Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to shift the debate to Confederate monuments and a slippery slope argument toward tearing down memorials to slaveholding founding fathers.Mr. Schumer accused Mr. Trump of a ploy \u201cto divert attention away from\u201d his \u201crefusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\u201dYet many Republicans are equally wary about running a gubernatorial campaign with race as a centerpiece. Virginia is an increasingly progressive state, and in an election that is bound to become nationalized, evading Mr. Trump, a deeply unpopular figure in the most vote-rich regions here, would be all but impossible for Mr. Gillespie under those circumstances.\u201cIt puts Ed in a tough spot,\u201d said State Delegate David Albo, a veteran Republican legislator, alluding to the pressure Mr. Gillespie is under to distance himself from the president.Or as Representative A. Donald McEachin, Democrat of Virginia, put it: \u201cWe have the gift that keeps on giving in Donald Trump. We don\u2019t know what tomorrow\u2019s news will bring.\u201dCompounding Mr. Gillespie\u2019s challenge, Mr. Trump is not the only incendiary Republican looming over this campaign.Corey Stewart, who in June narrowly lost the nomination for governor after making the statues a central part of his platform, has already started his 2018 bid for the seat held by Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat. Mr. Stewart, a Minnesotan by birth, is using that bullhorn to complain that Mr. Gillespie is being overly timid on the matter of Virginia\u2019s Confederate history.\u201cHe\u2019s like some dainty old lady who doesn\u2019t want to get her hands dirty,\u201d said Mr. Stewart of his former rival, adding: \u201cIf he continues to try to stay above the monuments\u2019 debate he will lose the election.\u201dThe searing images of torches and mayhem on the University of Virginia\u2019s iconic lawn and murder in the community that Mr. Jefferson made his home have left many in this state reeling, furious that a group of bigots from beyond the state\u2019s borders have stained a place they revere.Yet those outside agitators only reignited a debate that was inevitably going to return.Virginia still venerates its past. That is why even a transplant like Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, took care to wear a tie bearing the state seal (Sic Semper Tyrannis) in his public appearances and appeared in a national television interview this week from the governor\u2019s mansion standing in front of a portrait of Barbara Johns, the black teenage civil rights activist who in the 1950s protested Virginia\u2019s segregated schools.Yet many African-Americans have long since grown tired of such prominent Confederate iconography as the horse-bound generals on pedestals who loom over Monument Avenue in Richmond, the state capital and former capital of the Confederacy.\u201cYou are amazed there could be a whole street dedicated to losers, except for Arthur Ashe,\u201d said Mr. McEachin, who descends from slaves, referring to the local tennis great who was added to the boulevard over the protests of some white Virginians.This state is also increasingly filled with new residents who see its ubiquitous rebel statues, schools and street names as, at best, a charming relic \u2014 but in many cases an ill-conceived homage to a past that should hardly be celebrated.\u201cThe whole argument over the Confederacy and how we honor our history was bound to occur,\u201d said state Senator Creigh Deeds, a Democrat, pointing to the increasing numbers of Virginians born elsewhere. \u201cWe\u2019re a diverse state and strong because of it, but we have to figure out how to live side by side.\u201dIn truth, those with different views increasingly don\u2019t live together. Virginia effectively contains the political and social equivalent of Alabama and New Jersey within its borders, and its politics reflect this dichotomy. The affluent and educated urban crescent that stretches from the Washington suburbs down to Richmond and on to Virginia Beach votes differently from the poorer and more rural areas in much of the state\u2019s south and west.Because the state \u2014 or \u201cthe commonwealth,\u201d as Virginia\u2019s political leaders dutifully call it \u2014 is now so sharply divided, few were much surprised when Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Northam staked out their positions on the state\u2019s civic canonization of the Confederacy. Their voters demanded it.\u201cIf you\u2019re Northam, how do you go to black churches this fall and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to do something about those monuments: Every locality can decide for themselves?\u2019 \u201d asked Larry Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist who witnessed the white supremacist rally from his home on the school\u2019s lawn. \u201cNobody would applaud.\u201dMr. Northam said the moment called for leadership and he was acting out of conviction. But asked about the many Confederate images at his alma mater, Virginia Military Institute, he signaled that he would not force the issue.He said he would prefer to see the rebel monuments at V.M.I. taken down. But Mr. Northam also twice said the decision would be left to the school\u2019s governing board.Many in the political middle here fault Mr. Trump for effectively weaponizing the conversation.\u201cWe need a rational debate, but I\u2019m afraid the emotion of the moment after what Trump did just destroyed the opportunity for that discussion,\u201d said Mr. Deeds, who did not criticize Mr. Northam but made clear he thinks localities should be free to decide the monument issue.\u201cThis state is no longer a history lesson suspended in animation,\u201d Mr. Sabato said. \u201cThis was a disaster for Virginia, and people want to put a period on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Real Tax Reform Could Be", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter their protracted failure to repeal Obamacare, congressional Republicans have indicated that taxes will be next on their agenda. It\u2019s a misnomer to call their plans \u201ctax reform,\u201d though, because they have proposed little more than the same deep cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals that they\u2019ve always wanted.Real reform would honestly confront the fact that in the next decade we will need roughly $4.5 trillion more revenue than currently projected to meet our existing commitments without increasing the federal debt as a share of the economy. Even more would be needed if the government were to make greater investments to lift productivity and living standards through education, infrastructure and scientific research. Real reform would do this by diversifying methods of taxation while targeting individuals and sectors best able to pay.While the wages of most Americans have stagnated for years, incomes of the wealthiest have soared. So it would make sense to increase the top rates on them and eliminate a break on income from investments.And dividends and capital gains from investments are taxed at a total top rate of only 23.8 percent. It would be reasonable to tax wages and investments at the same rates.Over all, the richest 1 percent pay 33 percent of their total income in taxes; if rates were changed so they paid 40 percent, it would generate $170 billion of revenue in the first year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.There is rare bipartisan consensus that closing loopholes in order to lower the top corporate rate of 35 percent would help American businesses compete globally. But there is no agreement on which loopholes to close or where to set the rate.But even before lawmakers get into the weeds of corporate write-offs, they should agree to close a single huge loophole: the ability of corporations to defer tax on profits earned abroad or placed in overseas entities through accounting maneuvers. Intended to allow companies to more easily invest the profits abroad, this benefit has morphed into an abusive tax shelter that now shields $2.6 trillion.To tax the untaxed sums, Democrats should give up their opposition to granting corporations a discounted tax rate for the profits they bring home. Republicans should give up their support for only a voluntary repatriation at a near-zero rate. A compromise would give corporations a modest discount but require them to pay the tax and prevent them from stashing untaxed profits abroad anymore.A value-added tax would be akin to a national sales tax, but harder to evade than traditional sales taxes and thus an efficient revenue raiser well suited to a consumer-oriented economy. Since it would unduly burden low-income people, who spend most of their income, a VAT would need to be paired with measures like an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for the working poor.Real reform entails more than just cutting taxes, and will require hard work. But the net result could be a fairer and more productive system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Alaskan Salmon: Just Bring a Net and Expect a Crowd", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosKENAI, Alaska \u2014 Wenceslous Fru, a physician assistant from Anchorage, stood on the sandy shore of the Kenai River and imagined the dinner he would put together once he felt the jostle of a salmon in his long-handled dip net. He would make it the way they do back home in Cameroon, splitting it down the belly and opening it like a book, rubbing it with ginger, garlic and spices, and then slipping it under the broiler.Fishing nearby, Raviwan Dougherty, an Anchorage restaurant worker from Thailand, envisioned steaming hers and bathing it in fish sauce, lime juice and chiles.Lyubov Miroshnick, who works in a dental office in Wasilla, planned to smoke her catch after a soak in her Ukrainian grandparents\u2019 brine recipe.\u201cMainly, we fish for the winter,\u201d said Ms. Miroshnick, who had a dozen family members with her. \u201cThat\u2019s how most people survive here. It\u2019s the cheaper way.\u201dThere is no more popular fishery in Alaska than the Kenai (KEEN-eye), a three-hour drive southwest of Anchorage, where millions of sockeye salmon ripple through the silty turquoise water each summer to spawn.And there is most likely no more democratic fishing spot in America \u2014 a place where any Alaska resident, from an oil company executive to a carwash attendant, can fill a freezer with premium salmon for only the cost of gas and gear.Most of the Kenai\u2019s fish are caught by commercial boats and sold around the world. The rest go to sport fishermen, who catch them with a rod and reel, and, increasingly, a wildly diverse group of mostly urban dip-netters, who crowd the river\u2019s mouth for three weeks in July, hoping to score a winter\u2019s supply of wild salmon that most can\u2019t afford to buy. In the roughly 20 years since the state started regulating dip-net fishing in the region, the number of permits it issues has doubled, to more than 30,000.Now, when the dip-netters descend, the beach takes on the motley, slightly claustrophobic feel of a music festival. Whole families set up camp in the sand, hauling tents, chairs, dogs, children and nets by four-wheelers from the packed parking lot.This year, a church group brought in a bouncy house and grilled hot dogs. A cart sold espresso. People on the beach spoke Hmong, Korean, Tagalog, Spanish and Thai. They played Christian rock, reggaeton and Pacific Island R&B.July\u2019s dip-net army lifts the economy in the town of Kenai, but it also clogs the highway and litters the beach with fish heads and guts that have to be raked to the water at night by special tractors. Hundreds of gulls cry overhead, diving to feast on entrails. On weekends, when crowding is at its worst, there are dust-ups over fishing territory, tangled gear, pilfered bags of ice and stolen coolers. Differences in culture, language and notions of personal space sometimes fuel the conflicts.\u201cIt used to be 200 people \u2014 now it\u2019s 5,000\u201d on a given day, said Scott Turney, an Anchorage telecommunications engineer who has been fishing on the beach for more than 30 years. \u201cThere never used to be any conflicts, but the newcomers don\u2019t have the same courtesy. As soon as you drag a fish out, one or two people will come take your place.\u201dEven with the crowds, he said, landing a big haul of fish is worth the hassle: \u201cl still love it. I\u2019ll never stop.\u201dTo fish, most people stand elbow to elbow along the shoreline, wearing waders, chest-high in the cold river. Each holds a long steel pole with a five-foot-wide net basket on the end. When a fish hits the net, the fisher drags it onto the beach and bonks it on the head with a short bat. Some people also fish by boat to avoid the crowd, holding their nets overboard as they drift with the current.Occasionally, a commercial boat putters by. There\u2019s always a little tension.Commercial fishermen catch salmon by stretching large nets in the inlet near the mouth of the river. When things are slow, dip-netters grumble that the larger boats take too many fish.The commercial fishermen, on the other hand, must sometimes stop work for a few days at the direction of state biologists who monitor the number of fish in the river for conservation purposes. They don\u2019t love watching the dip-netters filling their coolers.\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to not be catching fish,\u201d said Hannah Heimbuch, who runs a 32-foot aluminum commercial boat, Salmon Slut, in the inlet. \u201cI feel like our harvest is pretty responsible and pretty moderate.\u201dA single dip-netter is allowed to take home 25 sockeye, or red, salmon, and an additional 10 for each family member per season \u2014 limits enforced by state officers who patrol the beach.An estimated 90,000 people, fishers and their families, share about 400,000 sockeye annually, Mr. Gease said, which breaks down to 2.4 million meals, the majority of fish coming from the Kenai. Food-bank workers in Anchorage say salmon has also become a supplemental source of protein for the city\u2019s hungry.\u201cOutside the revenues generated from oil,\u201d Mr. Gease said, \u201cthis is the largest single shared natural resource in Alaska for residents.\u201dOver the years, the town has become better at managing the parking, the trash and the fish waste. The number of dip-netting permits has dropped a bit the past few years, leading to speculation that the fishery has reached its saturation point.She planned to bake her fish with mayonnaise, lemon pepper and green onion, she said. Her Anchorage church, Manai Fou Assembly of God, holds services in Samoan. About 30 church members were catching fish that day to share with the congregation, she said.They used the Samoan word \u201cmafutaga\u201d \u2014 fellowship \u2014 to describe what it feels like to be on the beach with so many people.\u201cSome of our elders cannot fish, so we fish for them,\u201d Ms. Tulimasealii said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about fishing, though.

{"Headline": "Samsung\u2019s Size Could Make It Tough to Keep Its Leader in Prison", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySamsung Town, an office park in the Gangnam Station area of Seoul. The Samsung brand, known abroad primarily for electronics and appliances, encompasses many more sectors in South Korea.\u00a0SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 This is a partial list of the businesses of Samsung, the South Korean business empire: smartphones, microchips, insurance, gas ovens, hospitals, dishwashers, cargo ships, stocks, microwave ovens, apartment buildings, vacuum cleaners, credit cards, pharmaceuticals, air-conditioners and bidets.Samsung is South Korea\u2019s No. 1 brand and, when all its products are added together, its single biggest export. It dominates South Korean business and social life in a way that can be difficult for outsiders to comprehend.That dominance may make it difficult to keep its top executive in prison.Mr. Lee is not the first big business figure in South Korea to be convicted, but if he stays in prison it would represent something of a milestone. His father, Samsung\u2019s longtime chief, was twice convicted of crimes and twice pardoned by a South Korean president. Other top business South Korean leaders have avoided conviction, negotiated light sentences or been allowed to run their corporate empires from prison.South Korea\u2019s government is now run by a president, Moon Jae-in, and a political party that have criticized the excesses of the country\u2019s biggest companies. That has many in South Korea predicting that Mr. Lee, if his conviction is upheld, will serve out his prison term.But to many South Koreans, Samsung and its many corporate offshoots symbolize the country\u2019s rise from war and poverty to become one of the original Asian economic success stories. Should Samsung stumble while Mr. Lee is in prison, public pressure could mount to free him.\u201cSamsung is the No. 1 brand of Korea, one we\u2019re proud of,\u201d said Cho Wung-ki, a 78-year-old retired businessman, whose son works at a Samsung company that provides engineering services, runs resorts and owns a fashion line.\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe putting Lee Jae-yong in jail actually helps the country at all.\u201dSamsung is among a group of family-run companies called chaebol, \u201crich clan\u201d in Korean. The 10 largest chaebols generate revenue accounting for over 80 percent of South Korea\u2019s gross domestic product. They are among the companies that South Korea\u2019s pre-democratic military rulers partnered with to build a global exporting powerhouse after the Korean War \u2014 a partnership that South Korean school textbooks credit with helping the country\u2019s rise.\u201cIt\u2019s high time to think hard about whether the chaebol system is the right one for Korea,\u201d said Yoo-Kyung Park, director at APG Asset Management, the investment manager of the Dutch pension fund that holds stakes in Samsung companies. She added, \u201cIn the 21st century, you can\u2019t have one person calling the shots. That is too dangerous.\u201dThe sentence could put greater pressure on front-line Samsung executives like Kwon Oh-hyun, head of the company\u2019s huge and profitable semiconductor business. Samsung portrays Mr. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and its acting leader since his father slipped into a coma three years ago, as the company\u2019s strategic visionary, though experts say the businesses are generally run by technocrats.But even behind bars, Mr. Lee could still hold effective control over the Samsung empire. Other South Korean companies have been run by powerful family members behind bars, and Mr. Lee will most likely have significant access to top Samsung executives while in prison.\u201dIf they need to pursue M.&A.s and make crucial investments, they will do it,\u201d said Lee Seung-woo, a senior analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities in Seoul, referring to mergers and acquisitions. \u201cThey would have a road map and fundamentally the course wouldn\u2019t be altered.\u201dPart of that power comes from the sheer breadth of the Samsung business. Beyond its famous smartphone and television brands, it makes heavy equipment like cargo ships and even manages some of the country\u2019s most respected hospitals. Samsung sponsors some of South Korea\u2019s highest-achieving athletes, and many children of the elite seek employment there.Samsung was also among the first major businesses to offer name-brand apartments. Samsung built scores of apartment complexes around the country under brand names that included Raemian, which means \u201cmay the future be beautiful and comfortable.\u201d The complexes, which became popular in a country where American-style single-family houses are unusual, offered a brand and reputation that suggested a strong resale value. They also symbolized aspirational wealth, as portrayed in a 2007 commercial in which a boy who lives in a Raemian complex wins over a classmate through its well-appointed playground.\u201cI\u2019ve had good experiences with Samsung products and customer service,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is no relation to the Samsung-controlling family.That combination of business success and familial power-hoarding complicates Mr. Lee\u2019s fate. In some ways, his sentence reflects frustration from South Koreans outraged that his father, Lee Kun-hee, twice avoided prison despite his convictions.At the same time, the Lee family rivets attention in ways that would be unusual for business figures in other countries. When the younger Mr. Lee appeared at a parliamentary hearing on the bribery scandal last year, the lip balm he sporadically used on camera was among the top-searched items on Naver, the country\u2019s most popular search engine.Kim On-soo, 30-year-old administrative staff member of a university in the South Korean city of Daejeon, said he had been taught from an early age that the more South Korean companies exported, the better it was for the country. Samsung, with its world-famous Galaxy brand of smartphones, represented an example of that success.\u201cUntil the Galaxy was released, my American friends thought Samsung was Japanese,\u201d he said.Mr. Kim said the bribery trial had soured his view of Samsung, though he would still buy the brand.\u201cI sometimes wonder if we\u2019ve all been brainwashed,\u201d he said.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Widens Rift With Congress as Critical Showdowns Loom", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has widened an extraordinary rift with his own party, as he threatened a government shutdown over his long-promised border wall and attacked key lawmakers whose votes he needs heading into a crucial legislative period.The escalating tensions between the Republican president and the Republican Congress endanger delicate negotiations in the coming weeks to overhaul the tax system, keep the government running and avoid a costly default on the country\u2019s debt. They are the clearest signs to date that the uncomfortable alliance between Mr. Trump, who won the presidency promising to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d and Republican lawmakers who hoped to enact long-stalled conservative priorities, has begun to fray.In a challenge to Republicans late Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to shut down the government in a matter of weeks if Congress did not fund the wall on the southern border that was a signature promise of his campaign for the White House.\u201cIf we have to close down our government, we\u2019re building that wall,\u201d Mr. Trump told a raucous rally in Phoenix as his supporters chanted, \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d\u201cThe American people voted for immigration control \u2014 that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here,\u201d he added. \u201cOne way or the other, we\u2019re going to get that wall.\u201d\u201cNot a fan of Jeff Flake,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post. \u201cWeak on crime & border!\u201d\u201cIf Republican Senate doesn\u2019t get rid of the Filibuster Rule & go to a simple majority, which the Dems would do, they are just wasting time!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter, suggesting a change that Mr. McConnell and other Senate Republican leaders have repeatedly rejected.Mr. McConnell on Wednesday sought to play down the friction between himself and the president, issuing a statement in which he insisted that their common legislative priorities were on track.\u201cThe president and I, and our teams, have been and continue to be in regular contact about our shared goals,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cWe are working together to develop tax reform and infrastructure legislation so we can grow the economy and create jobs; to prevent a government default; to fund the government so we can advance our priorities in the short and long terms; to pass the defense authorization and defense appropriations bills so we can support our troops and help implement an effective strategy against ISIL; to provide relief from Obamacare; and to continue our progress for our nation\u2019s veterans.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, echoed that statement and said the president and Mr. McConnell \u201cwill hold previously scheduled meetings following the August recess to discuss these critical items with members of the congressional leadership and the president\u2019s cabinet.\u201dBut there is growing evidence of tensions that have erupted privately between the president and other senior Republicans as well. In a testy call this month, first reported by Politico, Mr. Trump vented angrily to Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, over Russia sanctions legislation he said would damage his presidency, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Corker insisted that he would not back down on the measure, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.Mr. Trump has asked Congress to allocate $1.6 billion this year toward building a wall along the roughly 1,900-mile border with Mexico. Currently, a mix of barriers \u2014 from chain-link fences and steel walling that keep people from crossing to steel beams to stop vehicles \u2014 stretch across about 650 miles of the border. So far, Congress has provided $341 million this year to repair and bolster the existing border barriers.Overall, the Trump administration is seeking $3.6 billion for the border wall over the next two fiscal years. In the past, however, Mr. Trump has said there is no need for a wall along the entire border, which spans four states: California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.Congressional leaders distanced themselves from the president\u2019s threat. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said on Wednesday in Oregon that no one wanted a dispute over the border wall to result in a lapse in government funding, adding that he did not believe that such a confrontation would be necessary.White House officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s words were not meant as a legislative directive or veto promise so much as a message to lawmakers, including Democrats who have previously supported spending on border fencing.\u201cProtecting our borders is only controversial if you are looking for reasons to obstruct a longstanding and bipartisan effort,\u201d said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.On the other hand, Mr. Trump\u2019s bare-knuckled tactics could alienate congressional Republicans when he can ill afford to lose their support.The president wants to push through a tax overhaul by year\u2019s end, but first Republicans must approve a budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 to trigger special procedures that would allow the package to pass the Senate with only 51 votes, instead of the 60 required for most legislation.A budget resolution is always difficult, but it will probably become entangled in another divisive issue, the debt ceiling: The Treasury Department has estimated that the government will reach its borrowing limit sometime in October, at which point Congress will have to vote to increase the debt limit to avoid a default.Most immediately, the government will run out of money on Oct. 1 unless Congress approves new government spending bills. But in that conflict, the president may have handed Senate Democrats the whip, while inoculating them from blame. They can now filibuster any spending bill that contains wall funding, forcing Republicans to strip out the money and challenge Mr. Trump to veto it.\u201cIf the president pursues this path, against the wishes of both Republicans and Democrats, as well as the majority of the American people, he will be heading toward a government shutdown, which nobody will like and which won\u2019t accomplish anything,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, said Mr. Trump\u2019s threat had made it clear that he was willing to sow chaos in the service of his top policy priority. \u201cThe president said he will purposefully hurt American communities to force American taxpayers to fund an immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall,\u201d she said.Republicans privately vented their dismay at the president\u2019s tactics and language \u2014 especially his political maneuvering against their colleagues. The contest between Mr. Flake and Ms. Ward appears to have become something of a proxy fight between the president and the majority leader.\u201cI would just say that I think it\u2019s important that we all stay unified as Republicans to complete our agenda,\u201d Mr. Ryan cautioned.But Ms. Sanders signaled that the president was willing to stoke such disputes if he believed it served his purposes.\u201cI think everybody knows this president isn\u2019t somebody who backs down,\u201d she told reporters on Air Force One as Mr. Trump returned to Washington on Wednesday. \u201cIf he thinks we need to lean in a little, I\u2019m sure we will.\u201dThe president criticized Mr. Flake only obliquely in the speech \u2014 \u201cNobody knows who the hell he is,\u201d Mr. Trump said \u2014 and waited until Wednesday morning to take aim at the senator by name on Twitter.In an interview Wednesday on \u201cThe Brian Kilmeade Show\u201d on Fox News Radio, Mr. Flake said, \u201cI will continue to support the president and work with him when I think he\u2019s right, and challenge him when I think he is going in the wrong direction.\u201dMr. Trump appears to be in a fighting mood. Before his exit, Mr. Bannon repeatedly warned Mr. Trump and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, that September could be the breaking point for the Trump presidency \u2014 \u201ca total meat grinder,\u201d Mr. Bannon told them.Conservatives will object to raising the debt ceiling unless it contains some provisions to help rein in government spending \u2014 an unlikely scenario. Instead, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell will have to rely on Democratic votes to pass the increase \u2014 and put the president in the awkward position of having to sign it despite repeatedly promising to tackle the country\u2019s debt.Mr. Bannon warned White House colleagues that that could send the conservative House Freedom Caucus into open revolt against the speaker. To placate them, Mr. Bannon counseled, the White House must extract wall funding at all costs.Eileen Sullivan, Jeremy W. Peters and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

A shiny 2017 Volkswagen Passat is stationed near the entryway and labeled: \u201cDesigned in Germany. Built in Chattanooga.\u201dThe American map is dotted with towns drained of jobs after homegrown factories bolted to lower-wage countries. But for many spots throughout the country, the same strategy of moving operations overseas \u2014 when practiced by foreign companies \u2014 has buoyed local fortunes.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d Mayor Andy Berke said over sweet tea and French toast at the Bluegrass Grill on Main Street.Mr. Berke will travel to Japan this fall in hopes of persuading more companies to hang a shingle at the foot of the Appalachians. \u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dFor employers and workers here, though, the labels can be confusing. \u201cThere is no such thing as just \u2018American built\u2019 anymore,\u201d said Randy Topping, who owns a tractor and equipment dealership in Chattanooga.The parts are made in the United States as well as India, South Korea and Japan. \u201cEverything has foreign content,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s hard work,\u201d Mr. Topping acknowledged as the temperature outside neared 97 degrees, making the air in the assembly shed hot and thick. \u201cBut this is a close-margin business,\u201d he said, explaining why he is not offering more money despite adding a second shift.Bill Phillips, 57, the production line leader, worked for Mahindra in northern Georgia for eight years before transferring to this plant in 2009. Whether it\u2019s a foreign company or not, \u201cit\u2019s still a job,\u201d said Mr. Phillips, whose shaggy gray mustache hangs on his face like an upside-down U. \u201cI\u2019m working. I\u2019m making a living.\u201d\u201cWe love to say, \u2018Buy American,\u2019\u201d said William B. Kilbride, the chamber\u2019s president and chief executive, \u201cbut we both know how hard that is.\u201dHe pointed to Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, a large chicken processing plant in the Southside neighborhood. It employs 1,200 people, and many of the chickens are raised on north Georgia farms, but most of the profits flow back to the majority owner, JBS of Brazil.\u201cSo are you buying American or not?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou can throw a baseball and almost hit the Volkswagen plant,\u201d said Corey Jahn, the Gestamp plant director, standing next to powerful cold-stamping machines that press sheets of metal into wheelhouses, door sills and floor plenums. The neighborhood supply chain significantly reduces shipping costs and turnaround times, while an American presence avoids the effect of currency fluctuations on profits.\u201cWe follow our customers throughout the world,\u201d Mr. Jahn said.Japan is the biggest foreign investor, employing 3,000 nearby residents at Japanese companies like Komatsu, Toshiba, Hitachi Metals and Toyota. The Haier Group of China has 1,500 people working at its appliance manufacturing factory. Wacker Polysilicon North America, a German company, employed 650 people full time in its Bradley County plant after investing $2.5 billion \u2014 the largest private investment in the state\u2019s history. A $150 million expansion will add 50 jobs.Many of the companies have also established apprenticeship, training and internship programs with the local community college and high schools, Mr. Kilbride said.Still, the antitrade talk currently streaming out of the White House is unsettling.\u201cThat keeps me up at night,\u201d said Mary Beth Hudson, vice president of Wacker Polysilicon. \u201cWe depend on global trade.\u201d Some raw materials, equipment and spare parts come from abroad, she said.\u201cWe want to make sure there\u2019s customers out there to buy our materials,\u201d Ms. Hudson said.Germany sells much more to the United States than it buys, creating a multibillion-dollar trade imbalance that has agitated the White House. \u201cWe have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted in May. \u201cVery bad for U.S. This will change.\u201dIt is much too early to measure whether recent pronouncements in Washington have put off potential foreign investors. But Mr. Kilbride of the chamber worries that uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s trade, tax and immigration policies could have a chilling effect.\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about anything, you sit it out,\u201d he said.For other firms, the decision to set up manufacturing in the United States has much less to do with who is in the White House than who will buy their product. Nokian Tyres, a Finnish company that is preparing to break ground on a $360 million plant with 400 jobs, can grow only if it has a local presence, said Tommi Heinonen, head of Nokian North America.\u201cWhen we started the project, there was a different administration, and it will be different again,\u201d Mr. Heinonen said, noting that the company started scouting American locations in 2015. \u201cThe factory is built to be there for decades. If you start to change your corporate strategy every time there is a new person in some chair, you end up changing it quite often.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Brexit Nears, \u2018Discounters\u2019 Gain Ground in U.K. Supermarket Wars", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 At the vast Sainsbury\u2019s grocery store in south London\u2019s Tooting Broadway neighborhood, a basket of milk, eggs, bread, cornflakes and butter will cost shoppers four pounds and 70 pence, or about $6.15. A short walk away at Aldi and Lidl \u2014 two German discount grocery stores \u2014 those same items amount to \u00a33.92.Those small differences in price are having a major impact on grocery shopping in Britain.Opting for cheaper grocery stores like Aldi and Lidl is one such option, and the two retailers are taking advantage.Britain\u2019s supermarket sector is ruthlessly competitive. Major retailers like Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Walmart\u2019s Asda all jostle for market share by offering loyalty schemes, online shopping, home delivery and special offers (Amazon, by comparison, is a relative minnow in the grocery sector).Long dismissed in Britain as shops targeting only lower-income discount-hunters, Aldi and Lidl have steadily made progress and, since Brexit, their growth in market share has accelerated.Spending at the two stores grew by double digits in the 12 weeks to mid-July, according to Kantar Worldpanel, a research group, outpacing not only the wider industry but every other major supermarket. Together, they now account for more than 12 percent of the country\u2019s spending on groceries, up from just 4 percent a decade ago.\u201cWhen I was growing up, there used to be a bit of a stigma around shopping at discount stores at my school,\u201d said Christina Carr, who works at a bank in Newcastle, in northern England. If you shopped at one, \u201cyou\u2019d be classed as a poor family, and the kids would be horrible.\u201dWhen Ms. Carr, a 28-year-old bank employee, moved out of her grandparents\u2019 home, she found herself thinking much harder about her finances. She and her partner spent \u00a360 on groceries every week, which looked increasingly unaffordable.In November, she relented, switching from Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s to Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThe difference in price,\u201d Ms. Carr said, \u201cit\u2019s really significant.\u201dThat started to change when the financial crisis hit. Britain\u2019s economy went into recession and unemployment rose above 8 percent. Pay slumped in the years after the crisis, and though it has recovered somewhat, average wages are still lower in real terms than they were before the crisis.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cU.K. households are quite sensitive to pressure on disposable income,\u201d said Edouard Aubin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThat is why they are switching to cheaper alternatives.\u201dAldi and Lidl push their low-price messages relentlessly, both in advertising campaigns and in stores. The two retailers stock significantly fewer products \u2014 typically only a tenth as many as competitors \u2014 with a greater focus on items sold under their own lower-cost brands. Many goods are placed on shelves still in the crates or boxes in which they were delivered.At the Lidl in Tooting, stacks of vegetable boxes run down the middle of the store, while bright orange signs overhead advertise price cuts. The store\u2019s glass exterior is emblazoned with heart-shaped Union Jack flags and the words \u201cFresh British.\u201d Visitors to the Aldi across the road have to keep on the move to avoid staff members hurriedly restocking shelves or rushing to open cashier stalls.They currently have nearly 1,400 outlets between them, and their sales have risen faster than those of rivals. Three in every five British households have shopped at either Aldi or Lidl, and the demographics of their customers are now similar to that of the broader population, according to Mr. Aubin at Morgan Stanley.\u201cAlthough they\u2019re small in the U.K., they\u2019re massive businesses in their own right,\u201d said James Walton, chief economist at IGD, which carries out research on the food and grocery industries. \u201cThey have great scale when considered globally, and they\u2019re only buying a fairly limited range of products.\u201dAs their customer base has expanded, the stores have expanded their offerings, adding seasonal product lines that include luxury goods like lobster or magnums of prosecco. Lidl, for example, is selling inflatable pool toys, avocado oil and Iberico ham.That has helped retain a broader range of customers, like Mark Whitfield, who frequents both Aldi and Lidl in Sittingbourne, about 45 miles from London. \u201cYou\u2019re buying unusual or luxury products, but not paying as much,\u201d said Mr. Whitfield, 52.Their expansion extends beyond Britain.The American supermarket sector is significantly more fragmented than Britain\u2019s, and the German retailers have set their sights on expanding there. Among lower-price grocery stores, Aldi already has 1,600 stores in the United States and is planning to expand to 2,500 within the next five years. Lidl is looking at opening 100 outlets as well, after opening its first American stores in June.\u201cWhether you look at the U.S., U.K.,\u201d said Mikey Vu, a partner focused on retail on Bain & Company, a consultant firm, \u201cthere\u2019s a larger proportion of the population that\u2019s concerned with where they\u2019re spending their money.\u201d\u201cThe economy makes things a lot tougher for a lot of people,\u201d he said of American consumers. \u201cPeople are watching their pennies more. The hard discounter model is attractive to them, just like we saw in the U.K.\u201dThe shift toward \u201cthe discounters\u201d is not just a short-term issue for Britain\u2019s supermarket sector. Younger shoppers are increasingly willing to try supermarket-brand items, which are no longer seen as lower-quality knockoffs, a trend that could be accentuated if the economy takes a turn for the worse again.\u201cYou\u2019re paying for the name\u201d at other supermarkets, said Lucy Deacon, a 27-year-old who was shopping at the Aldi in Tooting. Ms. Deacon, who works in a local betting shop, said she would focus her shopping even further on discount supermarkets if Britain saw another downturn.As she picked through spices for a curry she planned to cook that evening, Ms. Deacon said, \u201cYou get more for your money here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Language is important, but it can be slippery. Consider that the phrase, the American Dream, has changed radically through the years.Mr. Trump and Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, have suggested it involves owning a beautiful home and a roaring business, but it wasn\u2019t always so. Instead, in the 1930s, it meant freedom, mutual respect and equality of opportunity. It had more to do with morality than material success.Conflating the American dream with expensive housing has had dangerous consequences: It may have even contributed to the last housing bubble, the one that led to the financial crisis of 2008-9.These days, Mr. Trump is using the hallowed phrase in pointed ways. In his January speech, he framed the slogan as though it were an entrepreneurial aspiration. \u201cWe are going to create an environment for small business like we haven\u2019t seen in many many decades,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cSo, essentially, we are getting rid of regulations to a massive extent, could be as much as 75 percent.\u201dIn the 1930s and \u201940s, the term appeared occasionally in advertisements for intellectual products: plays, books and church sermons, book reviews and high-minded articles. During these years, it rarely, if ever, referred to business success or homeownership.By 1950, shortly after World War II and the triumph against fascism, it was still about freedom and equality. In a book published in 1954, Peter Marshall, former chaplain of the United States Senate, defined the American Dream with spiritually resounding words: \u201cReligious liberty to worship God according to the dictates of one\u2019s own conscience and equal opportunity for all men,\u201d he said, \u201care the twin pillars of the American Dream.\u201dBut as the term became more commonplace, its connection with notions of equality and community weakened. In the 1970s and \u201980s, home builders used it extensively in advertisements, perhaps to make conspicuous consumption seem patriotic.But the last decade has shown that with a little encouragement, many can easily become excessively lustful about homeownership and wealth, to the detriment of our economy and society.Robert J.

{"Headline": "What a Fraternity Hazing Death Revealed About the Painful Search for an Asian-American Identity", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "FeatureWhen Michael Deng, a college freshman, joined an Asian-American fraternity, he was looking for a sense of belonging and identity. Two months later he was dead.Supported byOn an overcast, chilly day in October 2015, Sheldon Wong, Charles Lai, Kenny Kwan, Raymond Lam and Daniel Li were arraigned in the Pocono Pines courthouse. All five belonged to Pi Delta Psi, an Asian-\u00adAmerican college fraternity. All five were young men from Chinese families who grew up in Queens. When I arrived at the courthouse that morning, one of the TV cameramen who had gathered in the parking lot began following me. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not on trial,\u2019\u2019 I said. He chuckled and tilted his head at his colleagues, who had perked up and slung their rigs up to their shoulders. \u2018\u2018Well, you\u2019re going to get more of the same when those guys see you,\u2019\u2019 he said. He was right: The cameras swarmed. And I suppose, given the surroundings, that I couldn\u2019t much blame them. By choosing these gray hills for an initiation ceremony, the fraternity brothers had unintentionally made it possible that their fates could be decided by a jury made up of locals who wondered just what these Asian men had been doing here.Friends and families of the defendants sat in the back of the courtroom, staring stolidly into space. When the proceedings started, the younger relatives of the defendants quietly translated, for their elders in the gallery, the greetings between Judge Richard S. Claypool and the small army of defense lawyers and the lengthy reading of charges, which included hazing, hindering the investigation, assault, conspiracy and murder in the third degree.Claypool, a tall, bald man who looked as if he had rolled out of bed in his magisterial robes, appeared to be unmoved by the defense lawyers\u2019 attempts to reduce the $500,000 bail or to characterize their clients, none of whom had a criminal record, as law-\u00adabiding citizens. \u2018\u2018I know that what I\u2019m supposed to be seeing in front of me are some nicely dressed, cooperative kids,\u2019\u2019 Claypool said in a flat drawl. \u2018\u2018What we\u2019re seeing here is different from what happened that night. Reading the affidavit shows a lot of poor judgment from the kids.\u2019\u2019 Claypool\u2019s mild manner then veered into something closer to exasperation: \u2018\u2018Reviewing the charges, I am surprised that the D.A.\u2019s office came in as low as they did. The $500,000 bail stands.\u2019\u2019Now came the business of sorting out who could pay bail and who would be headed to jail. The lawyers whispered instructions to their clients, who tried to put on a brave face for their visibly shocked parents. Lam and Wong left with their lawyers. Kwan and Lai, who could not come up with bail at the time, were escorted to a side room and handcuffed. (Kwan would eventually make bail, as would Li, for a lesser amount, $150,000.)Outside, as the press waited for Kwan and Lai to be led to a waiting police car, I spoke to an Asian television-\u00adnews producer who had also made the trip from New York. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m just imagining what my parents would think about all this,\u2019\u2019 she said. We had one of those talks common among people of any marginalized group, in which it\u2019s possible to unload your neuroses without having to explain everything. I told her, absurdly, that if I had been charged with murder, I would have faked my death so my parents wouldn\u2019t know.The families of the defendants straggled out the front door of the courthouse, some holding up their forearms to shield their faces from the cameras.\u2018\u2018What are they thinking?\u2019\u2019 the producer asked under her breath.When Chun Hsien was born in 1995, his mother realized that he would need an American name. She found a ranking of the most popular names for American boys and chose \u2018\u2018Michael\u2019\u2019 when she saw it at the top. While Michael\u2019s father flew to and from China for work, young Michael and his mother trudged through the mundane adjustments and small humiliations of life in America \u2014 new grocery stores, new bus systems, a Balkanized gathering of fellow immigrants who may look like you but who are not like you in the ways that matter.Michael quickly became ensconced within the Asian bubble of Queens. In 1990, Asians made up 22.1 percent of Flushing\u2019s population. By 2010, that figure topped 70 percent. The population began to creep out into nearby middle-\u00adclass neighborhoods like Bayside, where the schools were better and the relatively spacious houses sat on quiet streets with tidy, uniformly rectilinear front lawns. By the time Michael entered Middle School 74, in Bayside, the school\u2019s population was majority Asian.Michael\u2019s mother left her job and studied up on the subjects Michael was taking in school. \u2018\u2018Math and science, of course I could help him with that,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But English and history \u2014 those things \u2014 I could only encourage him and try to keep up.\u2019\u2019 In his free time, Michael roamed the handball courts in Bayside and became a formidable player. In eighth grade, he took the city\u2019s Specialized High School Admissions Test and placed into Bronx Science, which is in New York\u2019s top tier of selective public schools, with Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech.Like Middle School 74, Bronx Science\u2019s student body is majority Asian. There are all-\u00adAsian cliques from Flushing, all-\u00adAsian cliques from Manhattan, all-\u00adAsian cliques from Sunset Park in Brooklyn. These groups might be created by immigration patterns, school districts and real \u00adestate developments, but they are reinforced through long hours in standardized-\u00adtest tutoring, weekends spent at Chinese- or Korean-\u00adlanguage classes and long subway trips up to the Bronx.It was on one of those long rides that Michael got to know William Yuan. They recognized each other from art class and decided to skip school to play handball. The boys became fast friends.Deng and Yuan were popular enough \u2014 not quite in the party crowd at Bronx Science but not quite nerds. When I asked Yuan what he and his friends had done for fun, he began to describe a life that would feel very familiar to anyone who grew up in any of the Asian enclaves in the United States: boba shops, Pok\u00e9mon, study groups, rich F.O.B.s (Asian immigrants who are \u2018\u2018fresh off the boat\u2019\u2019) and the uneven attention from parents who feel the need to pressure their children but who, because of the language barrier and cultural ignorance, often don\u2019t know what they have become.\u2018\u2018We\u2019d play League of Legends\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a multiplayer computer game \u2014 \u2018\u2018and play handball and eat,\u2019\u2019 Yuan said, describing a typical weekend. \u2018\u2018I know it might sound like a simple life, but it never felt all that simple to us. When we hung out, we hung with almost all Chinese kids, but it wasn\u2019t racist or anything. I guess it\u2019s human nature to hang out with people who are like you.\u2019\u2019When it was time to choose a college, Deng was faced with a choice between following Yuan to Stony Brook University on Long Island or going somewhere more local. He didn\u2019t want to leave his mother, so he decided to enroll at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York and a commuter school whose entire campus consists of a handful of buildings near Gramercy Park in Manhattan. Most of Baruch\u2019s students live off campus, but Deng wanted a college experience that felt a bit more like what he had seen in the movies \u2014 pranks, girls and freedom from parents \u2014 so he moved into the nearby dormitories. His assigned roommate was Jay Chen, an 18-year-old freshman from Long Island. Deng and Chen tried to build their own small version of campus life, with Deng taking the cockier, worldly lead and Chen playing his sidekick. Two years after Deng\u2019s death, Chen recalled their time together in a letter addressed to the memory of his old roommate: \u2018\u2018I remember on my birthday, freshman year, you brought home a six pack of Corona for us to celebrate. I never questioned how you were able to get your hands on it, but I was just glad you did. Of course, being the type of people we were, we didn\u2019t have bottle openers. Obviously the most important thing to do at that moment was to figure out ways to open a bottle without a bottle opener. Thanks to you, I now know about 900 different ways to open a bottle without a bottle opener.\u2019\u2019What little social life existed on campus at Baruch was dominated by its tiny Greek system, and freshmen, especially those who showed any interest in campus life, were aggressively recruited. At night in their room, Deng and Chen lay in their beds and debated whether to rush one of two big Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternities at Baruch, Pi Delta Psi and Lambda Phi Epsilon. Chen decided fraternities weren\u2019t for him. Deng chose Pi Delta Psi.\u2018\u2018Michael would come home and tell me about all the people he had met,\u2019\u2019 Chen said. \u2018\u2018He seemed enthusiastic at first. But as pledging continued, he seemed to get more tired, and he became less of his normal self. We spoke less. Every time he came home, he was absolutely exhausted and usually fell straight to sleep.\u2019\u2019On Thanksgiving weekend, Deng went home to Flushing. His new friends from Baruch, many from families who lived nearby, came and went from his house. Deng had started dating a member of one of Baruch\u2019s Asian sororities who grew up a few miles away from the Dengs in Queens. She told him that her family did not eat turkey on the holidays, so Deng had his mother cook more than usual and took a box of leftovers to her house. He did not tell his mother, his girlfriend or Jay Chen about his coming trip to the Poconos.Discrimination is what really binds Asian-\u00adAmericans together. The early scholars of Asian-\u00adAmerican studies came out of the \u2018\u2018Third World Liberation Front\u2019\u2019 of the late \u201960s, which pushed against the Eurocentric bent of the academy. When Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies programs began spreading in California in the early \u201970s, their curriculums grew out of personal narratives of oppression, solidarity forged through the exhumation of common hardships. \u2018\u2018Roots: An Asian-\u00adAmerican Reader,\u2019\u2019 one of the first textbooks offered to Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies students at U.C.L.A., was published in 1971; the roots of the title referred not to some collective Asian heritage but, the editors wrote, to the \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018roots\u2019 of the issues facing Asians in America.\u2019\u2019The project of defining Asian-\u00adAmerican identity was largely limited to Ivy League and West Coast universities until 1982, when Vincent Chin, who worked at an automotive engineering firm in Detroit, was beaten to death by assailants who blamed Japanese competition for the downturn in the American auto market. When Chin\u2019s killers were sentenced to probation and fined $3,000, protesters marched in cities across the country, giving rise to a new Pan-\u00adAsian unity forged by the realization that if Chin, the son of Chinese immigrants, could be killed because of Japanese auto imports, the concept of an \u2018\u2018Asian-\u00adAmerican\u2019\u2019 identity had consequences.\u2018\u2018His death was this great moment of realization,\u2019\u2019 Christine Choy, a Korean-\u00adAmerican filmmaker and former member of the Black Panther Party, told me. \u2018\u2018It galvanized a lot of people who said they can\u2019t stand by anymore and let things go without any sort of legal or political representation.\u2019\u2019Chin\u2019s death came at the beginning of a huge demographic shift on college campuses. The children of the hundreds of thousands of Asian immigrants who flooded into the country after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 had grown up. Between 1976 and 2008, the number of Asian-\u00adAmericans enrolled in four-year colleges increased sixfold. Many of these young men and women had graduated from the same magnet schools, attended the same churches, studied together in the same test-prep classes, but their sense of Asian-\u00adness had never been explained to them, at least not in the codified language of the multicultural academy.\u2018\u2018Who Killed Vincent Chin?\u2019\u2019 a 1989 documentary directed by Choy and Renee Tajima-\u00adPe\u00f1a, was shown in Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies classes across the country. Over the next decade, a rhetoric took hold that argued for a collective identity rooted in both the death of Vincent Chin and the debates over affirmative action, but it still felt strange to those who had grown up Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino. Whether expressed through scholarship or private, daily conversation, this vocabulary was imprecise and cloistered within the academy. By the early \u201990s, when the Los Angeles riots thrust Asian-\u00adAmericans onto the national stage, the brio of \u2018\u2018Roots\u2019\u2019 had mostly been supplanted by a shy, scholarly neurosis that sought to figure out why Asian \u2014 particularly Korean \u2014 businesses had been targeted by rioters, but lacked the platform or the confidence to ask.The modern Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternity was born out of the protests of the \u201980s and the growing alienation that Asian-\u00adAmericans felt on campus. Of the 18 Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternities and sororities recognized by the National Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Panhellenic Association, 16 were founded between 1990 and 2000. Their mission statements promise the \u2018\u2018making of successful leaders,\u2019\u2019 as well as a commitment to service and \u2018\u2018community awareness.\u2019\u2019 The messages from the fraternities and sororities are remarkably similar \u2014 unity to achieve unexpected success, brotherhood and sisterhood devoted to establishing a professional network of high-\u00adfunctioning alumni. Initiations tend to promote a vague vision of Pan-\u00adAsian identity that reflects the history of Asian-\u00adAmerican scholarship and activism, but whose urgency has been hollowed out by years of apathy.In 1994, the same year Michael Deng\u2019s parents immigrated from China, 11 students at Binghamton University founded the first chapter of Pi Delta Psi. By 2000, the fraternity had chapters at 11 colleges in four states. In those early days, the brothers pieced together a mission from bits of what they had been learning in Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies classes. Each fraternity chapter\u2019s \u2018\u2018educator\u2019\u2019 developed a curriculum for pledges. Some weeks were devoted to more predictable topics like ethnic foods or the origin of Asian flags, but the focus was overwhelmingly on instances of racism experienced by Asian-\u00adAmericans. Over the last two decades, the curriculum has been updated modestly, depending on the chapter. There is, for example, a \u2018\u2018function\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the fraternity\u2019s term for an educational activity \u2014 in which pledges research and write reports on the murder of Vincent Chin. Another function centers on the Los Angeles riots and their catastrophic impact on Korean small-\u00adbusiness owners. Around the time of Deng\u2019s death, there were plans to introduce a function highlighting the death of Danny Chen, a young man from Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown who committed suicide after a military hazing incident. \u2018\u2018It was kind of like taking a half-course credit,\u2019\u2019 Lex Ngoto, a Pi Delta Psi alumnus from New York University who now works in banking, told me. \u2018\u2018We would even meet in classrooms and get assignments and reports. Then we\u2019d get tested by the brothers, and if we missed a question, we\u2019d have to do push-ups.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018I ended up appreciating it. I hung out with Asian kids in high school, but we weren\u2019t really aware, if that makes sense. Learning about what happened to us \u2014 you know, Asian people in America \u2014 it awakened me to a lot of things.\u2019\u2019This was a common refrain among many of the Pi Delta Psi alumni I spoke to: kinship through a common history of suffering, consciousness through education. They also told of pledge functions that sound much more like typical, if sometimes even laughably innocuous, hazing. While always dressed in black sweats or military fatigues, they took part in trust falls, scavenger hunts and the \u2018\u2018divide and conquer\u2019\u2019 function, in which pledges were dropped off in different locations without their cellphones and instructed to find one another at a predetermined meet-up spot. Before \u2018\u2018crossing\u2019\u2019 into brotherhood, the pledges were subjected to \u2018\u2018hell week,\u2019\u2019 deprived of sleep and made to carry book bags typically filled with bricks, concrete blocks or bowling balls.Not all Pi Delta Psi pledges experienced a profound racial awakening. A former member of the University at Buffalo\u2019s chapter told me that he was more ambivalent about the fraternity\u2019s cultural curriculum. \u2018\u2018The fraternity says they are about raising awareness of Asian-\u00adAmericans, but it\u2019s all [expletive],\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really just about partying and feeling like you belong to something.\u2019\u2019 All the Pi Delta Psi alumni I spoke to said push-ups were one of the most common forms of physical punishment. The University at Buffalo brother recalled being blindfolded for hours during his initiation ceremony and shoved into the dirt. Everyone recalls being roughed up in a ritual called the Glass Ceiling.The night before, Deng drove with some classmates from New York City to a house on Candlewood Drive in Tunkhannock Township, a tiny community in the Poconos. The place, which had been rented for the weekend, was big and plain in the sprawling style found in towns where acreage is no object. A line of spindly young trees marked the border of a grassy, flat backyard where Deng and his fellow pledges would be initiated into Pi Delta Psi.As older brothers from Baruch and St. John\u2019s University in Queens arrived throughout the night, Deng and the pledges served food, dealt cards and performed some of the fraternity\u2019s initiation rituals, including the \u2018\u2018Bataan Death March,\u2019\u2019 in which, in some Pan-\u00adAsian effort to understand the hardships inflicted upon Filipino P.O.W.s by the Imperial Japanese Army, they dragged themselves across the ground on their elbows.Sometime after midnight, the brothers gathered for the Glass Ceiling, one of the fraternity\u2019s most hallowed rituals. Also known as the Gauntlet, or just the \u2018\u2018G,\u2019\u2019 the ceremony varies from chapter to chapter, but it typically plays out in three stages: First, a pledge is blindfolded and separated from his assigned \u2018\u2018Big,\u2019\u2019 an older fraternity brother, by a line of brothers whose arms are linked together. For the most part, this line signifies the barrier between glumly accepting America\u2019s vision of emasculated, toadying Asian men and the great promise of success and masculine fulfillment. As his Big calls out his name, a pledge, or \u2018\u2018Little,\u2019\u2019 crosses his arms across his chest and walks toward his Big\u2019s voice. He soon runs into the line of brothers, who call him \u2018\u2018chink,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018gook\u2019\u2019 and whatever other racial slurs they can muster. The verbal abuse lasts for 10 minutes or more. In the second stage, the pledge is instructed to push through the wall of brothers, who in turn shove him back toward his starting spot. The third stage isn\u2019t much different from the second: The pledge is still wandering blindfolded toward his Big\u2019s calls, but instead of being pushed, he is knocked to the ground or, in some chapters, even tackled. Once the pledge educator determines that the pledge has had enough, he calls for a halt and may ask, Why did you not ask your brothers for help?I did not know to ask, the pledge responds.Ask your brothers for their help, the pledge educator instructs.The pledge asks for help. His brothers form a line behind him and, in solemn unison, guide him to his Big.While all this is happening, the pledge is supposed to be thinking about his parents and the sacrifices they made as immigrants, the humiliations they faced and the oppressive invisibility of Asian lives in America. The pushing, the tackling and the racial abuse are meant to be the physical expression of their struggle. That final walk, in which the pledge is shepherded to his Big by all of the fraternity\u2019s members, is intended to teach him that solidarity with his fellow Asians is his only hope of making it in a white world.Officially, the national fraternity does not allow the sort of tackling that took place during Deng\u2019s initiation. A lawyer representing Pi Delta Psi refers to it as \u2018\u2018a direct violation of the fraternity\u2019s policies.\u2019\u2019 But every former member I spoke to, from several different colleges, told me that the Glass Ceiling is deeply ingrained in the fraternity\u2019s culture. \u2018\u2018In reality,\u2019\u2019 Daniel Li told the court, referring to the ritual\u2019s rendition at Baruch \u2014 he was the president of Pi Delta Psi there at the time of Deng\u2019s death \u2014 the national Pi Delta Psi leaders \u2018\u2018knew what was going on.\u2019\u2019Deng was the last of his pledge class to go through the Glass Ceiling. He made it through the first two stages, but in the middle of the third he got up unsteadily after one tackle. Then, according to testimony later given by Li, the pledge assistant Kenny Kwan, starting 10 to 15 feet away, ran at full speed into Deng and slammed him to the ground. Deng did not get up.Li, 21 at the time, would later tell prosecutors that Deng was making \u2018\u2018groaning sounds.\u2019\u2019 According to Li, Sheldon Wong, who was 21 and the pledge educator, picked Deng up and, with others\u2019 help, carried him inside the rental house. Charles Lai, who was 23 and Deng\u2019s Big, told detectives that Deng\u2019s body felt \u2018\u2018straight like a board.\u2019\u2019 Fraternity members stripped off his clothes, cold and wet with frost, and laid him down by the fireplace and covered him with a blanket. At 5:05 a.m., the police timeline indicates, one brother called his girlfriend, a nurse, to ask what she thought could be causing Deng to be so unresponsive. Eight minutes later, another brother Googled \u2018\u2018conscious\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018unconscious.\u2019\u2019 At 5:55, a fraternity brother named Revel Deng texted a friend four times to ask about his grandfather\u2019s fatal fall down the stairs. During this period, none of the three dozen brothers in the Poconos called 911. Nobody summoned an ambulance because, according to a statement given to detectives, someone had looked up how much it would cost and determined that the price would be too high.Around 6 a.m., Wong, Lai and a third brother drove Michael Deng to the emergency room of Geisinger Wyoming Valley hospital. Shortly after they arrived, at 6:42, Deng\u2019s mother received a call from the hospital telling her that her son was in a coma and asking if he had any medical allergies. The hospital also contacted the local police.As Lai waited for an update on his Little\u2019s condition, he started sending texts, the police later discovered, to the national president of Pi Delta Psi, Andy Meng, the brother of Grace Meng, a congresswoman who represents the heavily Asian Sixth District in Queens. At 7:25 a.m., Lai texted Revel Deng: \u2018\u2018Put everything away.\u2019\u2019 Lai told a detective at the hospital that he had been in contact with a brother at the national fraternity; texts on Lai\u2019s phone showed that Andy Meng encouraged the hiding of fraternity items.Andy Meng\u2019s lawyer, Michael A. Ventrella, says Meng is cooperating with police. \u2018\u2018He was not at the scene,\u2019\u2019 according to Ventrella, \u2018\u2018and only found out about it after the incident. Under his watch, the fraternity had previously handed out strict guidelines prohibiting the actions that took place.\u2019\u2019 (Revel Deng, Lai and Lam refused to comment for this article.)Michael Deng died the next morning with his mother by his bedside. A forensic pathologist later determined that he had died from multiple traumatic injuries to the head and that the delay in treatment had \u2018\u2018significantly contributed\u2019\u2019 to his death.As Li testified, the four remaining brothers slumped in their chairs and stared at their hands. There were none of the courthouse theatrics that they must have seen in Mafia movies when a rat takes the stand; no one glared at Li or whispered angrily to their lawyers. Instead, an awkward hush fell over the courtroom, in part because Li couldn\u2019t make it through an answer without being reprompted by the prosecutor, but also because the lie of solidarity was being unraveled and laid out in front of the young men who had been stupid enough to believe in it. For Li\u2019s cooperation in the case against his four brothers, the State of Pennsylvania reduced the charges against him \u2014 they no longer include murder \u2014 and delayed his court proceedings.A few days later, Kwan called me at home in Brooklyn. He said he had heard that an Asian writer was going to write about the case from an Asian perspective. I told him that I was, indeed, an Asian writer. He paused and asked if I knew someone who could help him get his story out in a way that wasn\u2019t biased against Asians. I told him that I\u2019d be happy to talk to him, but I wanted to be clear: I wasn\u2019t working on an article whose aim was to exonerate him and his brothers, and he should talk to his lawyer before calling me back. Over the past year, I\u2019ve found myself wondering what exactly Kwan might have meant by an \u2018\u2018Asian perspective.\u2019\u2019 Was he asking for fairness or was he asking me to choose sides?Kwan never called back, but he wasn\u2019t the only Baruch brother who wondered if there might be some value in talking to me. Months before, I met Sheldon Wong at his lawyer\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan. Wong is tall and handsome, with sharp cheekbones and a puckered mouth that twitches when he\u2019s anxious. At the arraignment in the Poconos, Wong stared at a spot on the carpet as his fraternity brothers squirmed and slouched and tried to screw on brave faces. During our meeting, Wong switched between what looked like nerves and a quiet earnestness. In those more candid moments, I could see why he had taken on the role of pledge educator \u2014 why, he said, his mother had encouraged him to seek a career as a psychologist.His life, at least on the surface, wasn\u2019t much different from Michael Deng\u2019s. He was born in Flushing but spent his early childhood in a predominantly Italian-\u00adAmerican neighborhood in Jamaica, Queens. His mother, who immigrated from Hong Kong to New York as a teenager, left his father, a construction worker, when Wong was 5 and moved the two of them to Flushing, where she worked as a waitress. \u2018\u2018When I was in Jamaica, most of my friends were the Italian kids in the neighborhood,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018When we moved to Flushing, there weren\u2019t as many Asian kids as there are now. I was still one of the only ones. Most of my friends were black or Hispanic \u2014 I just hung out with whoever I was around at the time.\u2019\u2019Wong attended Junior High School 185 in Flushing, not far from Deng\u2019s childhood home. \u2018\u2018The Asian kids hung out with each other,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018The cliques went by race and extracurricular activities \u2014 sports, clubs, whatever. As the years went by, I noticed it was harder for kids to branch out and talk to people outside their race.\u2019\u2019 He continued in a careful, almost scholarly way: \u2018\u2018I know New York is supposed to be this melting pot, but if you\u2019re from Queens, it\u2019s more like a bubble. The people you meet are pretty similar to yourself.\u2019\u2019In the spring of his freshman year at Baruch, Wong was approached by a \u2018\u2018neophyte\u2019\u2019 (the word for a newly anointed brother) in Pi Delta Psi. Given Baruch\u2019s commuter-\u00adstudent culture, where most students socialized with their friends from city high schools, Pi Delta Psi\u2019s recruitment strategy was to approach all eligible males, even some non-\u00adAsians, and ask them to join. Wong went to a meeting, got along with a few of the guys there and decided to give the fraternity a shot.Until he pledged Pi Delta Psi, Wong said, he did not know how badly his people had suffered. He did not know about the death of Vincent Chin. He did not know about Korematsu v. United States, the 1944 Supreme Court case that upheld Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s executive order to send Japanese-\u00adAmericans to internment camps. As he immersed himself in Pi Delta Psi\u2019s misshapen yet still revelatory history of Asian-\u00adAmerican oppression, he grew increasingly frustrated with the gaps in his New York City public-\u00adschool education. Wong said the omissions were unfair. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t understand why we wouldn\u2019t focus on a certain ethnic group or why we would ignore it,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018Sometimes, it felt like things that happened to Asians were less important.\u2019\u2019The new education changed him; the silence that separates so many immigrant children from their parents began to close. For the first time in his life, Wong talked to his mother about her early days in the United States, the fear she had felt in a country where she did not speak the language, the small yet persistent flare-\u00adups in which she could feel both her invisibility and her irrelevance in a country dominated by whites. He said he never felt closer to his mother than in those early days of his awakening. \u2018\u2018You know how it is with Asian parents,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018If you don\u2019t ask them about their lives, you won\u2019t find out.\u2019\u2019 He started to feel as if he were part of something. Wong was offered a \u2018\u2018bid\u2019\u2019 and began Pi Delta Psi\u2019s pledging process, where he learned more about the oppression of Asian-\u00adAmericans, the same lessons he would teach Michael Deng a couple of years later.Kimberly A. Metzger, an assistant district attorney, sat at the table reserved for the state. She leaned back in her chair, staring out at the gathering gallery. The families squirmed, and their narrow, wooden seats creaked, but there were none of the consoling or furtive glances among the defendants that there had been on earlier court dates. They did not look at one another as Metzger briefly summarized the roles they had played in Michael Deng\u2019s death \u2014 the tackles, the text messages, the delays in seeking medical help, the scramble to dispose evidence that would tie them to Pi Delta Psi. When the judge asked if they were aware of what their pleas meant, they said \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 in meek unison.The Pi Delta Psi brothers pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension. (About 30 members of Pi Delta Psi, including Andy Meng and Revel Deng, are still facing lesser charges connected to Michael Deng\u2019s death. The fraternity itself has also been charged with third-\u00addegree murder and other crimes. And the Dengs have filed a civil suit against the defendants.) Lai, Wong, Lam and Kwan will not be sentenced until the end of this year. According to Pennsylvania guidelines, the recommended sentence for these charges for a defendant with no criminal record is 22 to 33 months.Asians are the loneliest Americans. The collective political consciousness of the \u201980s has been replaced by the quiet, unaddressed isolation that comes with knowing that you can be born in this country, excel in its schools and find a comfortable place in its economy and still feel no stake in the national conversation. The current vision of solidarity among Asian-\u00adAmericans is cartoonish and blurry and relegated to conversations at family picnics, in drunken exchanges over food that reminds everyone at the table of how their mom used to make it. Everything else is the confusion of never knowing what side to choose because choosing our own side has so rarely been an option. Asian pride is a laughable concept to most Americans. Racist incidents pass without prompting any real outcry, and claims of racism are quickly dismissed. A common past can be accessed only through dusty, dug-up things: the murder of Vincent Chin, Korematsu v. United States, the Bataan Death March and the illusion that we are going through all these things together. The Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternity is not much more than a clumsy step toward finding an identity in a country where there are no more reference points for how we should act, how we should think about ourselves. But in its honest confrontation with being Asian and its refusal to fall into familiar silence, it can also be seen as a statement of self-\u00adworth. These young men, in their doomed way, were trying to amend the American dream that had brought their parents to this country with one caveat:I will succeed, they say. But not without my brothers!Michael\u2019s mother took me upstairs to what had been his part of the house: a bedroom with the blinds drawn and a study room with an ornate dark wooden desk that looked as though it had been salvaged from a TV lawyer\u2019s office. She said she hadn\u2019t touched the rooms since Michael left for Baruch. SAT prep books and a handful of composition notebooks lined the bookshelves in which Michael, in neat, rounded handwriting that slanted a bit to the left, had written out his thoughts on the Ace style of handball, breakdowns of New York City\u2019s Specialized High Schools and his observations about the world around him. In October 2008, when he was in eighth grade, he wrote, \u2018\u2018Wearing a winter coat, going to Alley Pond Park, getting under a tree (to hide from the snow) and watch the snow fall down to the trees and ground is my favorite way to pass time in winter.\u2019\u2019His mother told me about the night she spent at the hospital in the Poconos. Her son was already past saving, but she decided to keep him breathing so that his father would have time to arrive from China. That night, she stayed by Michael\u2019s bedside and stuck acupuncture needles in his arm in a desperate attempt to save her son. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t believe that this could happen to such a big healthy, happy boy,\u2019\u2019 she told me. \u2018\u2018I learned acupuncture back in China, and I thought maybe it will help his comeback. The doctors knew he was already gone, so they let me do it, because they wanted me to have that moment of hope that I could bring him back.\u2019\u2019An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a university. It is University at Buffalo, which is part of the State University of New York system; it is not University of Buffalo.An article on Aug. 13 about a fraternity hazing death misstated the name and location of a public school in New York City. It is Junior High School 185 in Flushing, Queens; there is no Middle School 185 in Bayside.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Immigration: Moral and Economic Perspectives", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Cases made in these terms are tantamount to saying that our society should admit immigrants primarily, if not exclusively, for our own benefit. By contrast, some of us are convinced, either for religious or humanitarian reasons, that every person in deep physical or psychological need is morally entitled to whatever help we can reasonably give. Refugees and asylum seekers have a prima facie moral entitlement to that help.Unquestionably, we as a society are unable to satisfy all such valid claims, but that does not diminish the claims\u2019 validity. We have an obligation to seek ways to increase our ability to take in more of these people, even if it is economically or emotionally costly for us to do so.To the Editor:The Senate immigration bill that your editorial denounces is similar to what Barbara Jordan proposed while running a commission on immigration reform under President Bill Clinton.Ironically, if the recommendations of Ms. Jordan\u2019s commission had been followed, Donald Trump, who campaigned chiefly on an immigration crackdown, would have probably never gained the White House.To the Editor:Your editorial opposing President Trump\u2019s endorsement of a bill that would slash immigration limits is slightly off the mark. It asserts that this endorsement, like his opposition to transgender people serving in the military and his encouragement of overly aggressive police behavior, is primarily aimed at recapturing his base.This conjures an image of the president deliberately formulating political strategy, and it is far from obvious that our president is capable of such rational action. To the contrary, I believe that our president is the genuine article \u2014 a genuine nativist, a genuine bigot, a genuine bully. Although his positions may be pleasing to his base, they are primarily, as it is said, Trump being Trump.ALAN STEVENS, BELLPORT, N.Y.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kurds\u2019 Risky Dream of Independence", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter yearning for independence for generations, Kurds in Iraq are scheduled to take a major step in that direction with a nonbinding referendum set for Sept. 25. The vote, expected to endorse a separate state, would be a mistake, increasing turmoil in a part of the world roiled by the fight against the Islamic State and further threatening Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity. Postponement makes better sense.In many ways, independence is a logical next step for the five million Iraqi Kurds, who carved out their semiautonomous enclave after the 1991 gulf war. Now that their military forces have played a pivotal role in helping to defeat the Islamic State, the Kurds think they are entitled to this long-promised referendum.Kurdistan has evolved into a relatively peaceful region. It was lucky enough to have oil and gas resources that opened up trade with Turkey and Iran and brought needed revenue. After the 2003 American invasion, Washington worked with the Iraqis to draw up a constitution that ensured Kurdistan\u2019s semiautonomous status.There are also serious problems. Two families, the Barzanis and the Talabanis, control politics; corruption is widespread. Because of political infighting, Kurdistan\u2019s parliament has not met since October 2015; the region\u2019s president, Masoud Barzani, remains in office four years after his term ended. Declining oil prices and disputes with Iraq\u2019s central government have left the Kurdistan government in debt. Kurdish authorities are accused of discriminating against minorities. Could Kurdistan make it as an independent state if Iraq and neighboring states stayed hostile to the idea?The Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War I. While the Constitution guarantees them a role in the federal government as well as regional autonomy, the Kurds don\u2019t believe the Shiite majority has given them a fair shake. But the referendum would heighten tensions, make it harder to stabilize Iraq and divert attention as the United States, Iraq and their partners work to defeat ISIS and rebuild Iraqi communities.Some Kurds have dreamed of merging the whole community \u2014 30 million people across Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran \u2014 into a single entity. That\u2019s not feasible now and worries leaders in Turkey and Iran who see a greater Kurdistan as a territorial threat. Turkey\u2019s deputy prime minister recently warned that the Iraq vote would \u201ccontribute to instability.\u201d Iraq\u2019s prime minister said the vote would be \u201cillegal\u201d because it conflicts with Kurdistan\u2019s constitutional commitments as part of Iraq\u2019s federal government. One sore point is that the boundaries in the referendum include Kirkuk, an oil-rich area the Kurds control and want to incorporate.The Americans and Europeans have urged the Kurds to postpone the vote until after next year\u2019s Iraqi elections. Mr. Barzani responded by assuring critics the vote would not lead immediately to independence but rather a prolonged negotiation with Baghdad over a split. At this point, postponement is the better option. A Kurdish breakaway is risky; without sufficient preparation, it would further marginalize Iraq\u2019s Sunni minority, already disenfranchised by the Shiite majority and prey to Sunni extremists like ISIS.Self-determination is an understandable goal. But just voting for independence is no guarantee that whatever state emerges will govern fairly or well. It does the Kurdish people little good if their leaders do not make a strong effort to first ensure that Kurdistan\u2019s democratic institutions are functioning, the economy is strong and they have support from Iraq and other countries before striking out alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tax Reform America Needs (and Probably Won\u2019t Get)", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCanada\u2019s tax rate on corporate profits has fallen by more than 14 percentage points since the turn of the century, to just 15 percent this year. In Denmark it has shrunk to 22 percent from 32 percent over the period; Britain\u2019s has declined to 19 percent, from 30 percent; Ireland\u2019s to barely 12.5 percent, from 24 percent. Hungary\u2019s is even lower.What happened was globalization. As multinational corporations have hopscotched around the globe to find the most profitable base from which to run their affairs, they have set off furious competition among governments hoping to lure investment by slashing tax rates to the bone.Smaller countries like Ireland or Hungary have been the most aggressive in this race. But big industrial powers have followed, too. Among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the policy think tank of the world\u2019s industrialized countries, almost every one has reduced its corporate tax rate over the last 17 years.There are two exceptions: Chile and, alone among the world\u2019s wealthy nations, the United States.Once one of the lowest among economically advanced countries, the American tax rate on corporate profits is by now the highest. And still, corporate tax revenues amount to only 2.2 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, half a percentage point less than the O.E.C.D. average. Even Ireland collects more as a share of its economy.While this is probably the most blatant shortcoming of the American tax code, it is hardly the only one. By the standards of most economists, the United States has one of the most counterproductive tax regimes among advanced nations \u2014 one that raises little money yet vastly distorts decisions on investing and saving, and encourages all sorts of trickery to avoid the Internal Revenue Service. That shortcoming is keeping the American state from raising the money it needs.Indirect taxes, such as a sales or consumption tax, or \u2014 even better \u2014 taxes on immovable property, don\u2019t reduce people\u2019s incentive to save or invest, as direct taxes on personal or corporate income do.And yet when designing the tax code, Washington eschewed indirect taxes. Instead, the American political system chose the most economically counterproductive tax structure available. On average, indirect taxes amount to 38 percent of tax revenues across the O.E.C.D. In the United States they account for 27 percent. And that is only because of high property taxes, which are levied mostly at the municipal level.(Here, too, Washington skews investment behavior by making property taxes, and mortgage interest, deductible from federal income taxes, pulling money into housing that would generate a bigger economic return elsewhere.)That makes American tax revenues uniquely vulnerable. Corporate profits have soared, rising to 13 percent of the nation\u2019s income in the years of the new millennium, from 9 percent. And yet the I.R.S. just hasn\u2019t been able to touch the stash.\u201cIt is something we need to confront,\u201d said Alan J. Auerbach, a tax expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cI\u2019m a little skeptical that we will be able to come up with something.\u201dThey, too, will most likely fail, and for the same reason. Rewriting the tax code \u2014 cutting rates on corporate profits, say, and switching to a system in which only domestic profits are taxed \u2014 would cost money. Plugging the shortfall would require raising revenues somewhere else.That is something the United States political system and its inefficient tax structure find extraordinarily difficult to do.Consider how other industrialized nations managed the decline in corporate tax rates. For starters, they expanded the tax base \u2014 removing some incentives to investments, trimming exceptions, loopholes and the like. But they also had a big pot of money that the United States did not: revenues from a value-added tax, which is levied on the consumption of goods and services.Taxes on consumption \u2014 raised mostly through a V.A.T. \u2014 add up to one-third of total taxes in O.E.C.D. economies, on average. In the United States, sales taxes \u2014 levied by states rather than the federal government \u2014 amount to just 17 percent of total taxes.Congressional Republicans understand that tax reform requires money. They originally proposed raising $1 trillion with a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax \u2014 a levy on sales that would confer tax-free status on exports but would bar businesses from taking imports as an expense.But now the border adjustment is off the table, opposed by retailers whose businesses rely on imports. So the options for meaningful reform have fizzled, too.\u201cThe revenue loss from the corporate rate reduction is about $100 billion per point over 10 years, so going from 35 percent to 20 percent will cost $1.5 trillion,\u201d Professor Graetz told me. \u201cWhere are you going to find the money?\u201dProfessor Auerbach suggests that without new revenues, President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul may amount to nothing more than a big tax cut with nothing to pay for it, which would require some political legerdemain to become law with no Democratic votes. (That was the case with President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts, designed to \u201csunset\u201d after 10 years.)But this is not what the country needs. What it needs, looking into the future, is to acknowledge both demographic change and globalization.Globalization is unlikely to slow much. Governments\u2019 efforts to lure investment with low taxes are unlikely to be over. \u201cCorporate tax rates will probably continue to decrease in the near future,\u201d the O.E.C.D. said. \u201cMoreover, tax revenue is put under pressure at an increasing rate as corporations in a globalized world engage more and more in tax-minimizing strategies.\u201dMaybe this combination of pressures will ultimately push the American political system to embrace an efficient tax system \u2014 one that inflicts less damage on the economy. Then it might be able to raise the money that the American government needs.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about tax reform, referred incorrectly to consumption taxes in the United States and for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Those taxes represent one-third of the total taxes \u2014 not of gross domestic product \u2014 in the O.E.C.D. economies, and 17 percent of the total taxes in the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Groups Court White House Even After C.E.O. Defections", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast Wednesday, even as top executives were abandoning President Trump\u2019s business advisory councils after his remarks on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., other industry leaders were busy making their interests known to a business-friendly White House.Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group, traveled to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to meet with Mark Calabria, the chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence. The men talked tax reform, and Mr. Howard pressed for incentives including the mortgage interest deduction.Now, with some signs that the worst fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville has passed \u2014 and with the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s volatile strategist \u2014 some in the business community are voicing hope that the administration can tackle tax reform.\u201cEveryone is similarly motivated to reach some version of success, to get a tax bill to the president\u2019s desk that he can sign,\u201d said Rohit Kumar, a tax specialist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cOn tax, there\u2019s a lot of business community support, there\u2019s a lot of similar incentives.\u201dEfforts to overhaul the tax code are expected to begin in earnest this fall. Already, big business groups are lining up to support the White House\u2019s efforts.The Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of the largest companies, has started an advertising campaign calling for a tax overhaul that is supported by the White House, the Treasury Department and Republican congressional leadership.Such coordination between industry groups and the White House stands in contrast to last week\u2019s unraveling of the business advisory groups, but confirms what many in the corporate world say: Behind the scenes, there is still active dialogue between business groups and the administration.\u201cWe have had broad access to the administration and cabinet members,\u201d said Mr. Howard, who has been in associations and lobbying groups for 30 years. \u201cOur access, and their receptivity to our requests for meetings, has been better than I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dFour people in particular have emerged as go-to contacts for executives and lobbyists seeking to sway the debate: Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell; and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.All four are familiar faces to business leaders. Mr. Cohn, Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Powell are alumni of Goldman Sachs, the powerful investment bank, and Mr. Ross ran a private equity firm.Expectations of a more stable partnership with business appeared to hearten investors. The major stock market indexes rose sharply on Tuesday, in part buoyed by investor hopes that with the departure of Mr. Bannon, more pragmatic voices within the administration will gain strength, possibly resulting in a tax overhaul bill. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up nearly 1 percent, its biggest gain in a week.\u201cI think investors are picking up on this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, a stock market strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis. \u201cWe now have people around the president who are more moderate and pro-business, like Gary Cohn.\u201dMr. Paulsen also suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s measured speech on Monday about sending more troops to Afghanistan could be seen by those still willing to bet on the Trump economy that there is now \u201cchange within the administration.\u201dThere was a mass exodus of executives from presidential advisory councils as they opposed stances taken by President Trump.Still, repairing relations with the White House itself will take time. While the Business Roundtable is supporting efforts for tax reform, its chairman, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has joined the chorus of leaders criticizing Mr. Trump last week.The schism between Mr. Trump and top chief executives is real, and could have meaningful implications.Former White House officials and executives said that while it is useful for executives to interact with cabinet-level officials and members of the vice president\u2019s staff, such relationships are no substitute to a working relationship with the Oval Office.\u201cYou will see a lot of connecting points at the cabinet level, and that\u2019s natural and good,\u201d said Mack McLarty, President Bill Clinton\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president is going to make the final decision on policies and how legislation is approached. So there has got to be some ability for businesses, hopefully large and small, to engage with this administration, as there was such great promise going in.\u201dThere are even questions about whether or not the executives who once made up his advisory councils will be willing to speak out in support of causes they shared with the White House, including a tax code overhaul.\u201cFor this president, losing both councils is terrifically challenging,\u201d said Richard Levick, founder of the Washington public relations firm Levick. \u201cThey were more than symbolic. These C.E.O.s were going to be the ambassadors for the administration to talk about tax reform, about health care reform, about infrastructure.\u201dAnd there are other issues where business interests and the wishes of the White House diverge.Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Export-Import Bank, which supports American exports, is facing stiff opposition from business groups.The nominee, Scott Garrett, a former congressman from New Jersey once said Ex-Im, as it is known, \u201cembodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.\u201dThat has rattled big companies such as Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar, which rely on Ex-Im to help finance their overseas sales.Now, as the prospect of hearings and a confirmation vote on Mr. Garrett\u2019s appointment draw closer, big business groups have stepped up their efforts to quash his nomination. The National Association of Manufacturers is leading a campaign to drum up opposition to Mr. Garrett.And the Business Roundtable spoke out against Mr. Garrett on Twitter, writing \u201cBRT cannot support Scott Garrett or any #ExIm nominee who does not demonstrate strong support for the bank and commitment to get it promptly back to work, fully executing its mission.\u201dIt is not clear if Mr. Garrett will lead Ex-Im, or if the efforts to derail his nomination will succeed. But even if big companies are able to sway the administration on the Ex-Im leadership, and even if a tax overhaul is enacted, it may be some time before corporate chieftains want to sit alongside Mr. Trump again.\u201cOur clients were coming to me eight months ago and saying, \u2018What if we are the victims of a nasty Trump tweet?\u2019\u201d Mr. Levick said. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying, \u2018What do we do if the president wants a photo op?\u2019 You don\u2019t want to be seen with this president.\u201dLandon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Croatian Island Wants Tourists Who Don\u2019t Behave Badly", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe are genetically disposed to tourism,\u201d said Riki Novak, mayor of the island\u2019s main town, also called Hvar. \u201cBut this party tourism is not something that we asked for. It\u2019s not something we wanted.\u201dThe island, with a permanent population of about 11,000, was for decades a beloved watering hole for the summer yacht crowd and global celebrities. After abandoning the British throne for the woman he loved, King Edward VIII and his paramour stopped by for a swim in 1936. Jacqueline Onassis visited, shortly after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination, as did Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Tom Cruise, Orson Welles, Bono and dozens of others over the years.But the mayor and other residents say those glittering guests have recently been nudged aside by party boats, all-night clubs and hostels full of wobbly backpackers, changing the character of the island.Tourists were responsible for an estimated 700,000 overnight stays on Hvar last year, plus another 200,000 day trips, putting millions into the local economy on a wave of tourism that has been growing from 7 to 10 percent each of the last five years. The first seven months of 2017 showed a 20 percent increase in visitor arrivals over the same period last year and a 10 percent increase in overnight stays.\u201cWe have a problem that a lot of our longtime guests, who came with their yachts and rented the big villas, don\u2019t see themselves here anymore,\u201d Mr. Novak said. \u201cThey are finding other versions of Hvar elsewhere.\u201d\u201cThere used to be art galleries along the pier,\u201d Mr. Bradbury said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all bars.\u201dThere is still high-end tourism as well. In the next year, three hotels are scheduled to open on Hvar \u2014 all five-star resorts, the island\u2019s first. Events like Ultra Europe, a music festival in nearby Split that holds its \u201cafter parties\u201d on Hvar, keep the archipelago teeming through the hot months.Hoping to keep it that way, the mayor and local business owners came up with this summer\u2019s campaign to alert visitors that the town would be taking a harder line on enforcing its public behavior statutes than in the past.Mr. Novak, 47, said the campaign, which was rolled out slowly in late June, would focus at first on spreading the word about the renewed enforcement, with only egregious violators who refuse to heed police warnings being fined. So far, the police have been able to maintain order with the warnings, said George Buj, a member of the Hvar Tourism Board, and no one has been fined.\u201cThe police say they\u2019re making fewer interventions and seeing fewer incidents during the day,\u201d Mr. Buj said. \u201cThere are still individuals, especially in the evening and night time, but over all there\u2019s a noticeable difference.\u201dBut the crowds continue to grow, perhaps in part because terrorist attacks have made some vacationers shy away from formerly popular resorts in North Africa or the Middle East. Recent waves of refugees have also made some European travelers wary of resorts in Greece and Italy.\u201cBecause of our neighbors\u2019 troubles, tourists are coming here instead,\u201d said Eduard Andric, 66, president of the Tourism and Services Union of Croatia. \u201cLast year was a record-breaker, and this year promises to be one, too.\u201dLjubo Jurcic, president of the Croatian Association of Economists, said that, ideally, tourism should account for about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. Instead, recent estimates put it around 18 percent, which Mr. Jurcic said is a sign of the weakness of other segments of the economy, like manufacturing.Carpe Diem was \u201cinitially high class,\u201d Mr. Bradbury said. But as other clubs opened, spreading into the town and transforming once-peaceful cafes into techno-thumping nuisances, the crowds became increasingly younger and rowdier.Instead of Jackie O casting an elegant shadow across the deck of her yacht, there was Yacht Week, in which several hundred visitors, mostly young people, drink their way down the Dalmatian Coast, putting into Hvar three times a week.\u201cThey arrive at 5 p.m., 300 or 400 people who have already been drinking all day,\u201d Mr. Bradbury lamented. \u201cThey drink some more in Hvar and then wander around the village. There are bodies just everywhere. And then, at midnight, they get on the boat and go to Carpe Diem or one of the other nightclubs.\u201dKatia Zaninovic Dawnay, 57, works for a real estate firm and said it had become unpleasant in the summer to wander the old town and step over the recumbent bodies.\u201cNobody wants to wake up and find that your doorway has been pissed on, excuse my English,\u201d Ms. Dawnay said. \u201cOr even worse.\u201d\u201cThe idea isn\u2019t to have so many people,\u201d Ms. Dawnay said. \u201cThe idea is to have fewer people who spend more money.\u201dMany of the hostels and most of the restaurants and cafes have joined the crusade to improve behavior on the island.\u201cThis new generation that\u2019s coming in, who come to rollick, who come to drink cheap alcohol, we don\u2019t want that type of clientele,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen someone comes to Hvar, they expect a cultured, quality town,\u201d Ms. Halebic said. \u201cThese folks sleep in hostels, drink alcohol out of bottles around town. Some exclusive guest in his large yacht doesn\u2019t want to see young drunks sleeping on the pier in the morning.\u201dJoseph Orovic contributed reporting from Split, Croatia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Report Could Force Trump to Choose Between Science and His Base", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The impending release of a key government report on climate change will force President Trump to choose between accepting the conclusions of his administration\u2019s scientists and the demands of his conservative supporters, who remain deeply unconvinced that humans are the cause of the planet\u2019s warming.But the looming publication of the climate report \u2014 which concludes that \u201cevidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans\u201d \u2014 once again raises a contentious policy issue that has deeply divided Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers since he arrived in the Oval Office.A scientific report on climate change obtained by The New York Times shows that warming is already having a large effect on the United States.\u201cA lot of it\u2019s a hoax, it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d said Mr. Trump, then a Republican primary candidate. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a moneymaking industry, O.K.? It\u2019s a hoax, a lot of it.\u201dMr. Trump could quietly publish the special report this year and the broader assessment when the final version is due in 2018. He could also make the case that the findings should be tempered by the economic effects that fighting climate change could have on American workers and businesses.Or, as some scientists fear, he could try to alter or suppress the special report before it is actually released.President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration released the first National Climate Assessment in 2000 to little fanfare, wary of injecting the scientific report into a presidential campaign in progress. Mr. Bush\u2019s administration delayed for years on releasing an updated version until the environmental groups successfully sued it. A final version was quietly released beginning in May 2008.The draft special report on climate change now under review by the White House focuses primarily on the physical science of global warming, and will feed into a much broader evaluation of the potential social and economic consequences of climate change.Ms. Sanders said the issue was still under consideration inside the administration, and she criticized The New York Times for writing about a draft that was not yet complete.Scientists who fear that the White House could tamper with the report have focused on this review, noting that political appointees could demand major changes or deletions, or simply refuse to approve the report at all.So far, there are no signs of such tampering, said Robert E. Kopp of Rutgers University, one of the contributing authors of the draft. \u201cI would be surprised if they chose to make major changes, given that the report is already public,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect we will know more later this month.\u201dA bigger question is whether Mr. Trump will choose to discuss the climate science report and the broader National Climate Assessment when they are finally released \u2014 or if he will play them down.\u201cAt some point, the political and communications staff gets involved and decides how they want to handle the report,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, who coordinated communications strategy in the Clinton White House for the first assessment report in 2000.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the middle initial of a contributing author to the climate science report. It is Robert E. Kopp, not Robert M. Kopp.Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Tax Reform Lessons, Congress Needn\u2019t Look Far", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor inspiration, maybe Mr. Trump and lawmakers in Congress should look in their own backyard.The District of Columbia, a political entity whose city council lies ideologically somewhere to the left of Bernie Sanders, has done exactly that.The capital\u2019s financial affairs were in such disarray by the mid-1990s that they were taken over by a federal financial control board that operated until 2001. Yet in 2014 the council cut corporate and business taxes, reduced individual rates for everyone earning less than $1 million and broadened the tax base by eliminating many loopholes.In the ensuing years, economic growth and tax receipts have surged, enabling the city to accelerate cuts that were being phased in. The legislation was not revenue neutral, in the sense that broadening the tax base offset the reduction in rates. It was a tax cut. But in a development that would surely warm the hearts of pro-growth Republicans, the economic lift was so strong that tax receipts increased, and last year hit a record.Even more remarkable, the plan drew praise from across the ideological spectrum, including that of conservative supply-side advocates like Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases.Among the organizations lauding the effort were the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, and the National Taxpayers Union.\u201cWhat makes D.C. so unusual was the bipartisan support,\u201d said Joseph Henchman, executive vice president of the Tax Foundation and an expert on state taxes.The council chairman, Phil Mendelson, who led the effort, said the capital had to reform its tax code and ease the burden on business and middle- and low-income taxpayers to stay competitive.\u201cWe now have the lowest general sales tax and lowest property taxes in the region, and the business tax is the same as Maryland,\u201d he said. While he conceded that there is no way of knowing to what extent the tax cuts stimulated growth, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re no longer seen as the high-tax jurisdiction. People feel good about that, which is a psychological factor that I feel is very important.\u201dTax reform is never easy, and it wasn\u2019t in the District of Columbia, either. There are no Republicans on the council, but as the Republicans have discovered, there can be sharp divisions within the same party. Among elected officials, the main opposition came from Vincent C. Gray, then the mayor, and the most liberal council members, who favored spending increases over tax cuts.\u201cThe counterweight is always to spend the money,\u201d Mr. Mendelson told me this week. \u201cThe mayor wanted to spend it, so I had to step up. Other members were willing to stand behind me as long as I was willing to take the political heat.\u201dThe council passed the measure by a vote of 11 to 2. Opponents have fought a rear-guard action to delay putting the measure\u2019s remaining cuts into effect, without success.To raise revenue, the plan extended the sales tax to service businesses, which swept tanning salons and fitness centers into the tax base. They mounted a spirited opposition, calling the plan a \u201cyoga tax\u201d and a misguided effort to tax exercise, fitness and health.\u201cThey almost succeeded in derailing it,\u201d Mr. Henchman said. \u201cIt was really just a loophole, but every loophole has a constituency, and they can be very vocal.\u201dWhat can lawmakers now trying to reform the federal tax code glean from the District of Columbia\u2019s experience?The federal tax code is obviously far more complicated. Taxpayers in the capital, as in most states, generally report just their federal adjusted gross income. So thorny issues like mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local tax deductions weren\u2019t part of the debate.The capital also had a balanced budget that was generating a surplus, which gave it more leeway for tax cuts.But the philosophy behind the local effort could well apply to the federal government. Steven M. Rosenthal, who served as staff director of the District of Columbia\u2019s tax revision commission and is a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said the Trump administration and lawmakers should seek to \u201clower rates for competitiveness but tackle loopholes at the same time.\u201d\u201cLower rates mean fewer economic distortions \u2014 and the broader the base, the more we remove taxes as a driver of economic decisions,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the tried-and-true theory of tax reform.\u201dMr. Mendelson said Republicans might need to sacrifice ideological purity in pursuit of a common goal. \u201cThe goal should be to get to 51 percent of the votes in Congress, not 100 percent support within the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have unanimity in the party, you need strong majority leadership that\u2019s willing to form a bipartisan coalition with some dissent within the party.\u201dMr. Henchman also stressed compromise. \u201cNobody got everything they wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they got enough that they felt it advanced their goals.\u201dHe also cited the \u201chigh-level leadership\u201d provided by Mr. Mendelson \u2014 someone who can stand up to special interests and make a persuasive case, as he did, that the code could be fairer and more competitive.That\u2019s a challenge that now falls to Mr. Trump, especially since he largely abdicated any leadership role in the failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.Speaking this week in Missouri, he kicked off the campaign with broad themes and few details, pledging to \u201cdramatically simplify\u201d the federal tax code, \u201celiminate special-interest loopholes\u201d and create a \u201ccompetitive tax code that creates more jobs and better wages.\u201dThose may be platitudes, but the most important lesson from the District of Columbia may be a simple one: It can happen.An earlier version of this column misstated the budget deficit looming in Kansas before legislators passed a tax increase. It was $900 million, not $900 billion.Third in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might take.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Make America a Little Better", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOne of the few practical job-building promises of the Trump presidential campaign \u2014 a $1 trillion investment in repairing the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure \u2014 is turning out to be as hollow as a pothole. Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to push for passage of the plan in the first 100 days of his presidency is sliding off the calendar amid the daily chaos of his incumbency and the Republican obsession with crippling Obamacare.Infrastructure repair should be a bipartisan no-brainer. But Republican lawmakers now concede that a fully detailed plan might not surface from the administration until next year, if ever. The White House heightened the sense of flatlining last month in announcing creation of a 15-member infrastructure study commission that will have until the end of 2018 to work on advisory proposals.While Congress has refused to raise the federal gasoline tax since 1993, depleting the Highway Trust Fund as a basic resource for road repairs, states and cities have been raising local gas taxes and approving initiatives to face transportation problems. But these are far short of the full need.Voters in 23 states passed $225 billion worth of transportation initiatives last year, accepting 55 of 77 proposals. Some states, like Connecticut and Washington, are pursuing multiyear transportation initiatives. But many are pulling back from ambitious plans, awaiting word from Washington. In February, the National Governors Association forwarded a list of 428 \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects to the Trump administration, but no new federal money has materialized, and the states stress that they can\u2019t afford to pick up the difference.In fact, there has been a falling trend in the states\u2019 investment in infrastructure as a share of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, falling from 3 percent in the 1960s to about 2 percent recently, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Clearly, major federal support is needed beyond state and local efforts, if the nation\u2019s eroding infrastructure is to be modernized.\u201cSo even though the economy is about six times larger than it was in 1955,\u201d the report noted, \u201cWe are investing no more in our critical infrastructure today than our grandparents did.\u201dThe challenge begs for the bipartisanship currently shunned by Republican congressional leaders. Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cmillions\u201d of jobs in a repair plan \u201csecond to none\u201d has fast faded into a campaign fantasy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Bathroom Bill Dies Again, Raising Republican Acrimony", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 A bill to restrict which bathroom transgender people can use in public buildings and schools died in the Texas Legislature on Tuesday evening, a rare defeat for social conservatives in a state they usually dominate.The failure of the so-called bathroom bill at the end of a special legislative session was the second time in three months that the bill had fallen short, and it deepened the ideological discord within the Texas Republican Party. But it did not kill the issue entirely.The Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, who pushed for the bill\u2019s North Carolina-style restrictions on transgender bathroom use, virtually guaranteed that the issue would arise again in future legislative sessions. And it is still possible that Gov. Greg Abbott, who supported the bill, will recall lawmakers for a second special session to give the bill another chance at passage.\u201cYou know why it\u2019s going to be back next session? Because the people will demand it,\u201d Mr. Patrick told reporters Tuesday night. \u201cThe issue is not going to go away.\u201dOpponents of the measure, including gay rights activists, corporate executives, transgender Texans and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, hailed the bill\u2019s demise in the special session as a significant achievement, even if it proves to be short-lived. The Legislature had previously failed to pass it during the regular session that ended in May.\u201cDefeating this discriminatory and dangerous legislation in Texas is a huge victory that will have an impact far beyond the Lone Star State,\u201d Kasey Suffredini, the acting chief executive of Freedom for All Americans, a national gay rights and transgender rights group, said in a statement.The bills would effectively have required transgender people to use bathrooms, locker rooms or showers corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates, not their gender identity, in government buildings and schools.The debate over the bill illustrated the increasingly rightward tilt of Texas politics in recent years.Mr. Patrick, Mr. Abbott and other Republican leaders pushed for the bill over the objections of many of the state\u2019s corporate leaders and large companies. The state\u2019s political and business leaders typically align on policy issues.The willingness of social conservatives to break with business interests on the bill showed how far to the right they want to push Texas, while the success of moderate Republicans in killing the bill showed that they still retain some power to pull Texas back toward the center-right.Business leaders played a pivotal role in persuading moderate Republicans to stand up to the lieutenant governor, the governor and other influential social conservatives. The Texas Association of Business mounted a large and well-financed lobbying campaign against the bathroom legislation, and released studies that forecast billions of dollars in economic losses if it were to pass. IBM took out full-page ads opposing the bill in major Texas newspapers, and corporate giants like American Airlines, AT&T and Texas Instruments warned Mr. Abbott in a letter that the bill \u201cwould seriously hurt the state\u2019s ability\u201d to attract jobs and investment.\u201cFor me, having the business community weighing in as strongly as they did to say this would have a chilling effect on the business climate and opportunity in this state is a huge factor,\u201d said Byron Cook, the Republican chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, who refused to hold a hearing on a House version of the bathroom bill during the special session.Supporters of the bill warned that Mr. Straus, Mr. Cook and others who opposed the measure would pay a price in the 2018 Republican primaries. Grass-roots social conservative activists and voters hold tremendous sway in Texas\u2019s low-turnout primary elections.Jonathan M. Saenz, president of Texas Values Action, which helped lead the push for the bathroom bill, said that his organization would make the issue a top priority next year and that Mr. Cook and other opponents of the bill \u201care going to be vulnerable when it comes time for re-election.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Abbott, Matt Hirsch, put it even more bluntly: \u201cThis is why we have elections.\u201dMr. Cook defended his position, pointing out that his committee held a marathon hearing on the bill during the regular session that ended in May. \u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent on officeholders to do what\u2019s right, period,\u201d Mr. Cook said.The governor convened the special session that began on July 18 and set the agenda for it. The bathroom bill was one of 20 items of business, most of them social conservative priorities that the Legislature failed to pass during the regular session. That regular session devolved into bitter intraparty squabbling toward the end, and the special session ended the same way Tuesday night.The special session was originally expected to last 30 days and wrap up on Wednesday, but the House abruptly adjourned Tuesday night over a dispute with the Senate on a property tax bill. The Senate followed suit later in the evening.In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr. Abbott said he had not ruled out ordering a second special session for the property tax bill, one of his top priorities. If he does so, he could add the bathroom bill to the agenda.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that all 20 items that I put on the agenda did not receive the up-or-down vote that I wanted, but more important, that the constituents of these members deserved,\u201d Mr. Abbott said in an interview on KTRH radio. He said the Legislature \u201chad plenty of time to consider all of these items, and the voters of the state of Texas deserved to know where their legislators stood.\u201dThough only half of the governor\u2019s agenda items were passed, Mr. Abbott\u2019s supporters and aides called the session a success. \u201cOur office believes this special session has produced a far better Texas than before,\u201d said John Wittman, a spokesman for the governor.But Mr. Abbott\u2019s failure to get the Republican-dominated Legislature to enact his whole social conservative agenda has opened him up to a new round of criticism that he is strong in rhetoric but weak in influence.\u201cLike his tenure in office, Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s first special session was bad for Texas,\u201d State Representative Eddie Rodriguez, Democrat of Austin, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this charade at a cost of over $1 million to Texas taxpayers, and we must not make the mistake of coming back for a second.\u201dMr. Abbott and Mr. Patrick had strong words for Mr. Straus. The governor, in a series of radio interviews, accused Mr. Straus and the House of moving slowly on his agenda and \u201cwasting time.\u201d Mr. Patrick criticized Mr. Straus for adjourning the House early, a move that helped kill the property tax legislation.Mr. Straus took a different tack, issuing a statement that refrained from any sharp criticism.\u201cWe considered every idea carefully, listened to constituents and acted on a number of critical issues, such as helping retired teachers,\u201d Mr. Straus said. \u201cHouse members voted for new limits on property tax growth and significant school finance reforms, but in the short time available, we did not reach final agreement with the Senate on those issues.\u201dDavid Montgomery reported from Austin, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Search for a Response After Charlottesville Violence", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Democratic National Committee is pressing a broad activist campaign to rally supporters under the banner #RiseAndOrganize, but just what they are to rise against is unclear. The committee held more than 200 events this past weekend around the campaign.With control of neither the White House nor a chamber of Congress, all of these separate efforts threaten to dilute a unified message and keep Democrats sidelined from the debates sparked by Charlottesville. Some even question why so much attention is being paid to identity politics after Democrats lost an election to a presidential candidate who focused on populist economics.\u201cI totally understand the passion of those who want to bring those statues down, but Democrats cannot lose focus on the overriding issue of midterm elections, which is building the middle class back up,\u201d said Steve Israel, a recently retired House Democrat who chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThe midterm elections need to be a referendum on whether President Trump has delivered to a middle class that has been pummeled.\u201dJess O\u2019Connell, the chief executive of the Democratic National Committee, disagreed and said the party must \u201coperate on all levels.\u201d\u201cIf we learned anything over the past few months, we know that silence is not an option,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to hold Republicans accountable, not just President Trump, but Republicans who remain silent.\u201dDemocratic leaders argue that all of their efforts are consistent with the twin goals of civil rights and economic rights, while they work to hold Mr. Trump accountable for saying that there were \u201csome very fine people on both sides\u201d of the unrest in Virginia.Ms. O\u2019Connell said that the Democratic Party must stand against the Confederate statues and focus on the problems that face voters daily, like health care and jobs.The Rise and Organize campaign has rallied Democrats to knock on doors and call people to encourage them to participate in electoral politics.\u201cPeople are still asking us about health care. They\u2019re asking us about the economy and about how to raise wages,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connell said. \u201cAnd those are the things that we are working on as well.\u201dBut so vague is the slogan #RiseAndOrganize that supporters of Robert James Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock, are using it on Twitter to rally conservatives around the Michigan Republican\u2019s possible Senate campaign. On the left, activists have used it for anti-racism programs, for trying to stop the Dakota Access pipeline and for voter registration.Republicans say all of this only underscores the president\u2019s contention that Democrats have become the party of obstructionism, blocking progress on overhauling the tax code, on building a wall on the southern border and on reviving the nation\u2019s infrastructure.In his opinion article, Mr. Schumer called for a concentrated focus on Mr. Trump\u2019s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas\u2019 hard-line conservative secretary of state, Kris Kobach.\u201cThis is how the appalling failure to use the right words and stand up to hate in the aftermath of Charlottesville is made real in the form of policy; they are two edges of the same sword,\u201d Mr. Schumer wrote of racism and the commission. \u201cUnder the guise of voter fraud, which experts agree is practically non-existent, conservative forces in the administration, cheered on by white-supremacy-stoking publications like Breitbart News, are reviving the old playbook of disenfranchising minority voters.\u201dDrew Hammill, a spokesman for Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said that Ms. Pelosi also wants to see the commission disbanded, but that she is also pushing to have Congress censure the president, hold congressional hearings on white supremacists and make the case to voters that Democrats will do more to help the middle class.\u201cOne can do all of these things,\u201d Mr. Hammill said. \u201cThose things are not mutually exclusive.\u201dJoseph Pinion III, a Republican strategist, warned that Democrats may get too caught up in fighting \u201ccosmetic\u201d racism and symbols. Mr. Pinion said that, as an African-American, he wants to see Confederate symbols gone and the president\u2019s election commission disbanded. But, he said, Democrats need to look at why they lost the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe truth is the Democratic Party to this day, in the wake of Hillary Clinton, has gone about absolving itself of any wrongdoing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the easiest thing to do and also the most dangerous thing to do.\u201dUntil Democrats learn to communicate beyond an activist base to a greater American public, he added, \u201cthey are still going to be going nowhere fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia-West Balancing Act Grows Ever More Wobbly in Belarus", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINSK, Belarus \u2014 Western officials and the news media have for years routinely described President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus as \u201cthe last dictator of Europe.\u201dFor Mr. Lukashenko, however, the performance was old hat.Over two decades, he has perfected the art of playing Russia and the West against each other. Belarus has been both an indispensable ally and ward of the Kremlin, depending on Russian subsidies to keep its economy afloat, and an important buffer for the West against the Kremlin\u2019s growing military aggressiveness.There are widespread fears in Minsk that when Russian servicemen come to Belarus for the war games, known as Zapad, Russian for \u201cWest,\u201d they will never leave. Intensifying those concerns are official reports that Russia has rented 4,162 railway cars to transport only 3,000 soldiers and no more than 680 articles of military equipment to Belarus.The troops started to move into the country in late July, with the exercises scheduled for mid-September. Both the Russian and Belarussian authorities have vowed publicly that the troops will return home after the exercise.Over the years, as Mr. Lukashenko has sought to demonstrate his independence, he has periodically picked fights with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 stage-managed affairs that have been quickly patched up in highly public displays of Slavic brotherhood.As Moscow\u2019s relations with the West have plunged to levels last seen during Soviet times, however, Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s balancing act has grown increasingly untenable. The time may be approaching when he will have to choose between the two camps, a decision that carries decided risks.An overt move to embrace the West could provoke a reaction from the Kremlin, as happened in Ukraine after the ouster of President Viktor F. Yanukovych. The West almost certainly would not oppose such a move militarily.But a complete embrace of Russia would collapse Belarus\u2019s sovereignty and could renew the street demonstrations that erupted this year among a population already seething over declining living standards.Most analysts assume that Mr. Lukashenko, if forced to choose, will throw his lot in with his patrons in Moscow.A landlocked country squeezed by Russia, Ukraine and three NATO states \u2014 Poland, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 Belarus has historically served as an invasion corridor for the major powers. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained several major military bases there, which included nuclear-tipped missiles.In 2015, Belarus rebuffed a Kremlin request for permission to establish a military base. But analysts wonder how long Mr. Lukashenko can continue to resist in the face of strong Russian pressure.\u201cFor the Kremlin, it is very important to have its own troops here to have the ability to escalate the situation in the region at any time,\u201d said Arsen Sivitski, director of the Center for Strategic and Foreign Policy Studies, a Minsk-based research group. \u201cFor Belarus, it is important to restrain the Kremlin. Otherwise, Minsk would have no strategic value for Europe.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthe Kremlin has the ability to break this game at any time.\u201dSince it gained independence in 1991, Belarus has survived in large part on heavy subsidies from Moscow in what a local economist, Sergei Chaly, called an \u201coil for kisses\u201d scheme.\u201cMr. Lukashenko has fulfilled an important historic mission,\u201d Mr. Chaly said. \u201cHe came up with the best system for how a post-Soviet state can deal with Russia.\u201dMinsk was permitted to purchase Siberian oil at a low price, process it at its two refineries, then sell it in the West at market prices, pocketing the difference.Various estimates put the overall Russian subsidy at more than $50 billion over the past two decades. Mr. Lukashenko used the money to prop up his so-called zombie factories, hopelessly outdated and decrepit industrial enterprises that allowed him to boast that he was the only post-Soviet leader who kept industry afloat.In return for the subsidies, Mr. Lukashenko pledged brotherly unity, allowing Mr. Putin to show that he has allies beyond Russia\u2019s borders. The relationship grew testy in 2014, however, when Minsk stopped short of officially recognizing Crimea as a part of Russia. Then, a year later, there was the standoff over Russia\u2019s request for a military base.Fed up, the Kremlin retaliated by raising natural gas prices. When Mr. Lukashenko refused to pay them, Moscow dismissed any concern about driving Belarus into the Western camp and cut the supply of oil, leaving the Belarussian economy high and dry.\u201cThe Kremlin understands well that with all his flirtations with the West, Mr. Lukashenko is still a dictator and cannot move Belarus into another geopolitical space,\u201d said Pavel Usov, director of the Center for Political Analysis and Prognosis. \u201cThe dependency is so strong that Russia can manipulate any political process and event in Belarus.\u201dSometimes, this dependency manifests itself in odd ways.Exports of \u201cBelarussian\u201d apples to Russia jumped 50 percent last year, whereas local production remained steady. Belarus, a country with severe winters, became the origin of such tropical species as pineapples, mandarin oranges and kiwi fruit, and also the butt of much sarcasm.This scheme still could not generate enough income, though, and with help from Russia shrinking, the economy of Belarus contracted for the second year in a row in 2016. In June, Belarus had to borrow $1.4 billion on the European market, and it is negotiating $3 billion more from the International Monetary Fund.Salaries have dropped by more than 13 percent over the past two years and the country\u2019s finances have soured, forcing the government to introduce one of the more remarkable tax laws in the world: a requirement that people who are not employed full time pay $240 a year as \u201ccompensation\u201d for lost taxes.With living standards declining, ordinary people took to the streets at the end of March to take part in the biggest wave of antigovernment protests in years.\u201cHe will lead this situation to what had happened in Ukraine,\u201d said Aleksandr Konches, a pensioner and one of the protesters. \u201cLook at who came out \u2014 pensioners, workers, simple people.\u201dHowever, many local people said that even if Mr. Lukashenko were ousted amid antigovernment protests, they doubted the country would turn against Russia.Viktor V. Bocharenko has spent his whole life in Redzki, a picturesque village of 150 people on the border with Russia. After heading a local collective farm for 13 years, he now leads the life of a simple retiree, growing potatoes and sometimes selling a sack at a healthy markup in the Russian region of Smolensk.Mr. Bocharenko, 65, said he sees little evidence of the stricter border controls Moscow said it was imposing in an attempt to reduce the transshipment of Western food. \u201cThey just look into my car and let me go,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cWhat happened between Russia and Ukraine will never happen between us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great Wall Motor of China Sets Its Sights on Jeep", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is trying to clamp down on overseas acquisitions by its companies. Hostility is growing in the United States toward Chinese deals. And the auto industry faces substantial change in the form of battery-powered vehicles and autonomous cars.None of that deterred one Chinese automaker, Great Wall Motor Company, from saying on Monday that it was interested in buying the Jeep brand \u2014 a quintessentially American car that is known for its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, but that also has a strong resonance in China.Fiat Chrysler is an obvious target because its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, has signaled interest in finding a buyer. It would also be relatively cheap, valued at $19 billion on the stock market.The automaker owns the Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep brands, as well as the Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands in Europe.The seriousness of Great Wall\u2019s interest in a deal could not immediately be determined, and a company spokeswoman declined to say whether the two parties had even met. The Chinese carmaker, controlled by the billionaire Wei Jianjun, has struggled in recent years to find success with new models in China, but it has since enjoyed faster-growing revenue and profit from freshened-up models of S.U.V.s.In a statement on Monday, Fiat Chrysler said it had \u201cnot been approached by Great Wall Motors in connection with the Jeep brand, or any other matter relating to its business.\u201d The carmaker\u2019s shares were nevertheless up 4 percent in Milan.Gerald C. Meyers, at the time the chairman and chief executive of American Motors, which owned the Jeep brand, has said that he initially saw China as a low-cost place to build vehicles for the Australian market, and never anticipated that the country would grow into such a major well of customers.The brand\u2019s experience is far from unique, as a long list of Western companies have seen Chinese companies absorb their technology and become global competitors in sectors like diesel freight locomotives, high-speed electric trains and power station turbines.Tariffs and other taxes shielded the domestic automotive industry in particular from international competition and allowed companies like Great Wall to grow into strong competitors. Chinese manufacturers now hold not only much of their home country\u2019s market for sport utility vehicles, but also large shares of emerging markets in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, where cost-conscious buyers like Chinese producers\u2019 deeply discounted prices and don\u2019t mind the basic designs and sometimes uneven quality.More recently, Fiat Chrysler has been expanding Jeep manufacturing in the past two years in China, starting production in Changsha and Guangzhou, two big manufacturing centers in the country\u2019s southeast. But it now faces well-financed domestic competitors with highly developed supply chains and considerable economies of scale.Great Wall\u2019s expression of interest might prod other suitors to come forward and start a process that could lead to Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sale or breakup. Companies such as Volkswagen might be interested in parts of Fiat Chrysler such as Alfa Romeo, a maker of small and midsize passenger cars known for their Italian styling.But any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Great Wall would face considerable obstacles.A major issue for Chinese automakers is a lack of brand recognition overseas. Even at home, most Chinese car buyers prefer Chevrolets, Fords and Volkswagens made by foreign companies working with local partners.Geely Holding established a template when it acquired Volvo. Volvo\u2019s revenue has grown, in part because of rising sales in China, and Geely has provided funds that have allowed Volvo to invest more in new products and expansion, including at a new factory in Berkeley County, S.C.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back-to-School Clothes, Back in the U.S.S.R.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesWhen summer winds down and my teenage daughter gets ready to start the new school year, she and I go through a ritual. I open her closet and take things out. She wrinkles her nose, rolls her eyes and ignores me, her eyes firmly glued to a screen. I pile clothes on her bed, taking them off hangers or rescuing them from drawers filled to such capacity that opening them is a challenge. She takes her eyes off Instagram for a moment, and says:\u201cMother, I don\u2019t want to go through this now. Can\u2019t we do it another day?\u201dI keep going.Eventually she sighs a great, big sigh, puts away her phone and joins me. The process of separating clothes into three piles begins. One for charity, another one for the local second-hand-sale Facebook group, and yet another for out-of-season storage (we live in Europe, where our closets are too small to hold several seasons worth of clothes). It\u2019ll take us a couple of hours to go through all of her stuff, but for me, it\u2019s not work. It\u2019s a welcome bonding experience that pulls my daughter away from her usual pursuits: maintaining her Snapchat streaks, talking with friends on WhatsApp and bingeing on recent Netflix releases.When I was a teenager, my mother and I also often bonded over clothes \u2014 but in a very different way.I grew up in Moscow in the Soviet era, and my peers and I despised the apparel churned out at the time by the planned Soviet economy. Constantly on the hunt for foreign-made clothes, we spared no time, effort or ingenuity to find a pair of pants, a dress or a blouse that didn\u2019t look as if it came off the conveyor belt in the textile center Ivanovo. We saved money to purchase them on the black market, begged to borrow them from classmates fortunate enough to have parents who traveled to Warsaw Pact countries, or \u2014 in my case \u2014 made them ourselves.In 1980s Moscow, the fashion magazine BurdaModen \u2014 a German monthly \u2014 was second only in popularity to bootlegged tapes of Vladimir Vysotsky, Russia\u2019s outspoken bard. Smuggled in by those lucky enough to travel abroad, each issue that made it behind the Iron Curtain created a fury of organizing activity in the Soviet workplace. At the Economic Institute where my mother worked on generating five-year plans and at the state gas company, Gazprom, where my father designed pipelines, a sheet of paper made the rounds as soon as the new issue of Burda came into someone\u2019s possession. By the end of the day that paper was full of names of co-workers desperate to borrow the magazine. With access to its pages limited to just a couple of days for each person on the list, we quickly replicated patterns that caught our eye and then passed it to the next fortunate soul.My mother and I pored over the magazine the very night she brought it home. We discussed silhouette lines, we considered the potential ease or difficulty of the job, and we estimated the availability of compatible cloth in the empty Soviet stores. In the end, with the decision made on what was to be my next skirt or my next pair of pants, I copied the patterns from Burda onto the old front pages of Moskovsky Komsomolets, the daily newspaper of Moscow\u2019s Komsomol chapter.My mother, meanwhile, scouted the city for fabric on her lunch breaks. If the magazine model wore plaid, she had to find plaid. If it was stripes, she looked for stripes. If polka-dot seemed in style, she crisscrossed the city searching for polka-dot. Occasionally someone would buy the same fabric for the same Burda pattern and later we\u2019d run into each other on the metro, dressed as if we had stood in the same queue at GUM, Moscow\u2019s central department store, to partake in a rare apparel shipment from one of our Eastern Bloc allies.Once my mother and I started each new sewing project, we worked on it for days, stealing an hour or two during the week from homework and housework and teaming up with my grandmother on the weekends. To the hum of the sewing machine and the squeak of our old scissors, I learned to spread the fabric flat on the kitchen table, pin the pattern to it and trace it with chalk. I practiced eyeballing a one-centimeter margin when cutting it out and I mastered threading and rethreading our clunky Tula, the Soviet-made sewing machine. Each fitting brought me closer to finishing a blouse meant for the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, to putting final touches on the sarafan destined for the spring dance, and to owning the pants I wore on my first date with a boy I liked.While we worked, we talked: about fashion, about school, about the demise of the latest Politburo leader, and about which banned samizdat book we were reading. We drank tea: sometimes with jam, conserved the summer before by my grandmother, and sometimes with my mother\u2019s famous sharlotka, or apple cake. When we finished a garment \u2014 several fittings and often weeks later \u2014 I ironed it and hung it in my closet along with our previous creations. Then I wore it day in and day out. There was no rule that stipulated a daily change of clothes in the Soviet Union. We didn\u2019t own enough garments to warrant that.It\u2019s now been over 30 years since I last traced a pattern or basted a seam. I no longer own a sewing machine and most of my clothes come off sale racks at the local Zara. When I want a skirt hemmed or a pair of pants taken in I go to a tailor. My only connection with needle and thread is an occasional sock that needs mending or a button that has to be reattached. Unfortunately my daughter doesn\u2019t even know how to do that. With cheap clothes readily available in our neighborhood, teaching her to make her own didn\u2019t seem essential. I never showed her how to sew.She knows how to shop, though. Every year she declares that she needs to overhaul her closet and disappears into Pull&Bear, her favorite store. There she assembles the styles she\u2019s seen and liked either on the streets of Madrid, on television or among her friends. Rather than planning each outfit, buying the fabric and stitching the garments, her new wardrobe quickly materializes in shopping bags. But the concept is the same: She cares about controlling the image she presents to the world just as I did at that age.She\u2019s excited about each new item, but clothes don\u2019t mean nearly as much to her as they did to me as a teenager.Yet they do their job: My daughter and I talk while we sort, and once every season I can count on her closet to guarantee some together time.Margarita Gokun Silver is a writer and an artist living in Madrid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Wants Innovation, but It\u2019s Arresting Its Innovators", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAKADEMGORODOK, Russia \u2014 Dmitri Trubitsyn is a young physicist-entrepreneur with a patriotic reputation, seen in this part of Siberia as an exemplar of the talents, dedication and enterprise that President Vladimir V. Putin has hailed as vital for Russia\u2019s future economic health.A court last Thursday extended Mr. Trubitsyn\u2019s house arrest until at least October, which bars him from leaving his apartment or communicating with anyone other than his immediate family. Mr. Trubitsyn, 36, whose company, Tion, manufactures high-tech air-purification systems for homes and hospitals, is accused of risking the lives of hospital patients, and trying to lift profits, by upgrading the purifiers so they would consume less electricity.Most important, he is accused of doing this without state regulators certifying the changes.It is a case that highlights the tensions between Mr. Putin\u2019s aspirations for a dynamic private sector and his determination to enhance the powers of Russia\u2019s security apparatus. Using a 2014 law meant to protect Russians from counterfeit medicine, investigators from the Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet KGB, and other agencies have accused Mr. Trubitsyn of leading a criminal conspiracy to, essentially, innovate too fast and too freely.The situation has outraged fellow scientists, would-be entrepreneurs and others in Akademgorodok, a freethinking settlement of broad avenues, forested pathways and 35 Soviet-era research institutes near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. They see it as the Russian government undermining its own stated economic goal \u2014 to nurture enterprises that harness Russian brain power instead of sucking oil, gas and minerals out of the ground.More than 5,000 people have signed a petition appealing to Mr. Putin to stop \u201cthis shameful example of forceful pressure on a law-abiding business.\u201d Mr. Trubitsyn and his company \u201care, without exaggeration, the pride of Akademgorodok,\u201d it said. \u201cThey are a strong symbol of a prospering Russia in which real technological business can develop to world standards.\u201dMr. Putin did not respond, but in a statement, his business ombudsman, Boris Titov, called Mr. Trubitsyn \u201ca young, energetic representative of the innovation sector, the development of which is most needed for a modern Russia.\u201dBut Mr. Titov has made similar statements before, to little effect. Despite official state support for innovation under Mr. Putin, the growing power of Russia\u2019s security services and rampant official corruption frequently push in the opposite direction.The first sign of the storm approaching Akademgorodok came early in 2016, when Mr. Trubitsyn and his colleagues began hearing that their competitors were telling hospitals that Tion\u2019s air purifiers were dangerous and were being investigated by Roszdravnadzor, a state agency that regulates medical equipment.State television then broadcast a report accusing the company of jeopardizing the health of hospital patients. State hospitals began removing Tion devices.\u201cFor years we were praised as a success story and then all these strange things suddenly started happening,\u201d said Mikhail Amelkin, Tion\u2019s chief technical officer.Mr. Amelkin said the company was approached by the regulatory agency and said that it had changed its design and removed a supplementary filtering device that laboratory tests had shown was redundant and wasted electricity. The company then amended its registration documents and thought the matter was over, Mr. Amelkin said. But armed police officers showed up in June to arrest Mr. Trubitsyn and search for evidence of what later court documents described as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to produce counterfeit medical supplies. (No co-conspirators have been named, but a conspiracy charge allows prosecutors to seek more jail time.)Natalia Pinus, Akademgorodok\u2019s elected representative to the regional council, is one of many local residents who see Mr. Trubitsyn\u2019s troubles as the fault of unscrupulous operators able to manipulate law-enforcement agencies to wipe out competitors.\u201cThis is not just about a single company,\u201d she said, but \u201cwhether you can conduct honest business in Russia or whether that is impossible.\u201dThe decline in global oil prices has, however, also meant less money is available for siphoning by venal officials. That has turned even relatively small companies into attractive targets by the police and the courts operating in partnership with business.Anton Latkin, a computer programmer who has known Mr. Trubitsyn since boyhood science clubs, said Tion had fallen prey to attack by government officials who \u201cdon\u2019t understand anything about physics, don\u2019t understand anything about chemistry and don\u2019t understand anything about biology.\u201dMr. Amelkin, Tion\u2019s chief technical officer, said he and his staff had been unable to figure out who or what was behind the investigation. \u201cIf you try to find out who is responsible for anything in this system, you will only find an echo in the cave,\u201d he said, adding that the Russian state \u201cis not a single organism with one brain\u201d but a sprawling mass of separate and often competing fiefs.Mr. Putin has been a forceful advocate of ending Russia\u2019s long record as an economic also-ran in all spheres other than oil and gas, repeatedly hailing Russia\u2019s technical and scientific prowess as an asset on which it can build a vibrant and diversified economy.Last month, at a meeting of his Council for Strategic Development, Mr. Putin again lectured officials on the need to move Russia\u2019s faltering economy \u2014 now smaller than that of Italy and 11 other countries \u2014 beyond its reliance on natural resources. \u201cWe need a breakthrough, and we must ensure it,\u201d he said.Mr. Trubitsyn\u2019s troubles, though, may help explain why such a breakthrough has proved so elusive: The Russian state, which is Mr. Putin\u2019s main vehicle for his plans for the nation\u2019s resurgence, often stifles growth.Mr. Trubitsyn\u2019s company began in such a state-funded park, one of a dozen such zones set up across Russia after Mr. Putin visited India\u2019s tech hub in Bangalore in 2005. Mr. Putin so enthusiastic about what he saw in Bangalore that he stopped in Akademgorodok on his way back to Moscow to talk with scientists and officials about how Russia could copy India\u2019s example.Dmitri Verkhovod, a mathematician who was appointed to run the operation, said Tion was \u201cone of our first start-ups,\u201d opening in 2006, and had proved that innovative Russian companies can compete on the global market.The objective, he added, was \u201cto show that you can do business and make money here in Russia and don\u2019t need to go abroad.\u201d One of the few Russian companies outside the energy sector that export to China, Tion grew steadily to employ 250 people in Akademgorodok, Moscow, China and Kazakhstan by 2017. It has tributes from government-linked bodies, including being named Innovation Company of the Year by a Siberian forum in 2012.(Mr. Verkhovod is entangled in a separate dispute and was fired in January as director of the Akademgorodok technopark.)But she said Mr. Trubitsyn\u2019s arrest had delivered a grave blow to the community\u2019s sense of security.\u201cIn principle, anyone can fall into this situation,\u201d Ms. Travina said, praising Mr. Trubitsyn as a patriot because he had not moved abroad and had invested time and money in science education for local children. \u201cIt can happen to anybody,\u201d she added. \u201cEveryone has some sort of skeleton in their closet. Maybe nothing big, but they can always find something to throw you in jail for.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a mathematician.

{"Headline": "What Would It Take for Trump to Get His Corporate Tax Wish?", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor President Trump, 15 is the magic number.That\u2019s the percentage at which he wants to cap the corporate tax rate, a steep cut from the current top rate of 35 percent and much lower than the ordinary income rates paid by many partnerships and small-business entities.There\u2019s no doubt that a cut to 15 percent would be big, bold and historic. It might even be the biggest cut ever in corporate tax rates, to use another superlative Mr. Trump is fond of invoking.It might do wonders for economic growth, level the competitive playing field, and encourage United States corporations to keep their headquarters in this country and invest trillions in cash currently stashed in offshore accounts.A 15 percent rate would take the United States from having the highest corporate tax rate among industrialized nations to having one of the lowest. Britain is moving to 17 percent, Canada\u2019s federal rate has already gotten to 15 percent, and Ireland\u2019s is at 12.5 percent.After last week\u2019s collapse of health care legislation, many believe Republicans can\u2019t afford to fail again, especially on what is widely considered their signature issue: taxes. As Scott A. Hodge, president of the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told me this week: \u201cIf the Republicans fail with tax reform, it would be truly catastrophic. It\u2019s really all or nothing at this point.\u201dThere\u2019s only one major stumbling block to a 15 percent rate, and the conventional wisdom is that it\u2019s an intractable one: how to pay for it.According to estimates by the Tax Foundation, a cut in the corporate rate to 15 percent would add $2.2 trillion to the deficit over 10 years on a \u201cstatic\u201d basis, which assumes no additional economic growth. After factoring in growth and higher resulting tax receipts, known as \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring, the deficit would grow by $1 trillion, according to the foundation.And if rates also go to 15 percent for pass-through entities \u2014 businesses that pay taxes at individual rates, like limited-liability corporations and partnerships \u2014 that adds another $1.5 trillion on a static basis, and $1.3 trillion on a dynamic basis, the foundation estimates. (A cut in pass-through rates has much less impact under dynamic scoring, because individuals and small businesses spend far less on capital projects and thus do less to stimulate the economy.)Paying for corporate tax cuts of that magnitude \u201cis a tremendous challenge if you don\u2019t want to blow a hole in the deficit,\u201d Mr. Hodge said. \u201cAnyone writing tax legislation will find that the options are very limited.\u201dHow big is the challenge? In their tax blueprint, House Republicans could only get the corporate rate to 20 percent. The 2014 proposal from Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who was then the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, struggled to reach 25 percent. And when President Barack Obama nearly reached a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on tax reform with Republicans in 2013, he could only get to 28 percent, with 25 percent for some manufacturers.\u201cThe math is really hard,\u201d said Ray Beeman, a tax expert at Ernst & Young and a former adviser to Mr. Camp. \u201cThere\u2019s really no big source of revenue that won\u2019t rile people up.\u201dAnd yet 15 percent just might be possible.For starters, eliminating the deductions and loopholes in the corporate tax code would go a long way toward paying for a significant corporate rate cut. There are so many of these that few companies actually pay the 35 percent statutory rate.\u201cCorporations benefit from all kinds of loopholes, especially the one allowing earnings to accumulate offshore without being taxed,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that in 2016 the corporate income tax raised $300 billion in revenue, while what it called \u201ctargeted subsidies\u201d cost about $270 billion. In other words, Congress could eliminate the subsidies and cut the corporate rate nearly in half without any significant loss in revenue.Another possibility would be to shift at least some of the tax burden from corporations to shareholders, by raising tax rates on capital gains and dividend income. Many economists favor that approach, because it reduces the double-taxation problem embedded in the current system. (Corporations pay taxes on profits, and then, when these are distributed, shareholders pay.) The added tax burden would fall primarily on affluent taxpayers since they tend to own stocks, helping to rebut the argument that slashing the corporate rate would be a tax cut for the wealthy.While it\u2019s difficult to estimate how much additional tax revenue would be generated if dividends and capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, it would surely be substantial, another big step toward a 15 percent corporate rate.Taxing ordinary income, capital gains and dividends at the same rate would also greatly simplify the tax code. The notion does, however, run up against Republican orthodoxy that low capital-gains rates stimulate growth.There are many other ways to raise revenue, of course. House Republicans proposed a border adjustment tax, popular with many pro-growth economists, which powerful retail interests shot down. Most European countries fund their low corporate taxes with some form of a value-added tax, on consumption rather than income. House Republicans have nodded in that direction, but a value-added tax runs afoul of many of the same interests that opposed the border tax, and has never been popular in the consumption-friendly United States.Environmentalists and many economists would love to see a carbon tax, which would presumably be repellent to an administration that is skeptical of climate change and wants to promote the coal industry.The point, however, is that if Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are serious about a 15 percent rate without vastly increasing the deficit, there are many ways to get there.Then there\u2019s the 15 percent pass-through rate. While taxing small businesses and partnerships at the same rate as corporations has a superficial appeal, there\u2019s nothing that says they have to be the same. As the Tax Foundation maintains, cutting rates on these businesses has relatively little impact on growth. The House Republican blueprint was comfortable with a rate of 25 percent for small businesses and pass-through taxpayers, still a significant reduction from current ordinary income rates. And the 1986 reform act didn\u2019t require that pass-through entities pay the same rate as corporations.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about 15 percent,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said.The closer the pass-through rate is to ordinary income rates, the lower the incentive for lawyers, accountants, doctors and other service professionals to reorganize themselves into pass-through entities to avoid paying the higher rates. How to distinguish individual professionals from actual businesses has long vexed legislators trying to rewrite the tax code. \u201cA big issue has always been, how do you prevent a pass-through owner who is really a wage earner or service provider from escaping the higher ordinary income tax rate?\u201d Mr. Beeman said.Everyone I spoke to mentioned that lowering corporate tax rates to anything close to 15 percent requires political courage and leadership to overcome the powerful special interests that benefit from existing loopholes \u2014 starting with real estate. Whether Mr. Trump can set aside personal interests and rise to the challenge remains to be seen.Many tax experts hope he will.\u201cWhat\u2019s important is not just getting a home run under his belt,\u201d Mr. Hodge said. \u201cThe Republicans have to get tax reform right. They have to make sure it delivers the kind of growth that boosts productivity and real wages and living standards. If they do get it right, it can dramatically improve the lives of the people who feel most aggrieved about globalization and the state of the economy \u2014 the same people who voted for Trump.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about hurdles that President Trump faces in reducing corporate tax rates, misstated an estimate by the Tax Policy Center for the 10-year federal revenue increase from eliminating the interest deduction. The projection is $700 billion, not $700 million.Second in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might take.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Running Stride? The One That Comes Naturally", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhys EdRunners, if you have worried about your stride, relax. It is almost certainly fine, according to a comforting new study.Researchers found that both experienced and beginning runners tend to settle into the stride that is most efficient for them. Tinkering with how you run is unlikely to be beneficial for performance and could make running more difficult, the study found.As a species, humans are innately capable of running. Unless we are disabled, most of us start running as toddlers and continue, sporadically, throughout our lives, racing through airports or after the fast-receding bus we just missed. But because we can run, does this mean that we naturally run well?Many experts, including running coaches and exercise physiologists, have debated that question in recent years, pondering whether there is a platonic ideal running form that everyone should adopt.In particular, they have argued about stride length and cadence, or the number of steps runners take per minute. Stride length and cadence are intimately connected, and experts and runners have wondered whether altering these variables might make someone a better, faster runner. Many of us who run have been told at various times that we should shorten our strides in order to run faster, or maybe lengthen them, and perhaps aim for a cadence above 160 steps per minute.But there has been surprisingly little scientific evidence that either reinforces or refutes the idea that modifying how we run is advisable, especially if we are newcomers to the sport.They began by recruiting 19 skilled, competitive runners, including 10 members of the university\u2019s Division I women\u2019s cross-country team. The researchers also gathered an additional 14 active people from other sports, including cycling and swimming, all of whom were fit but none of whom had done much if any running in the past two years.They then had each volunteer run on a treadmill in the university\u2019s human performance lab at whatever speed they felt to be most comfortable. For the experienced runners, this was their typical training speed. For the novice runners, it was the fastest pace that they felt they could maintain for at least 20 minutes.The researchers manually counted each volunteer\u2019s steps, a number that they verified with videotape, and then arithmetically determined the length of each person\u2019s stride when they ran at their favorite speed.Finally, during a second day at the lab, they fitted everyone with masks that determined their oxygen intake, in order to track their running economy.Running economy is important. In physiological terms, economy is a measure of physical demand. If one form of moving requires less oxygen than another, it is more economical, less strenuous and will be easier to maintain. So, if one way of running is more economical than another, a runner employing that style will run longer and with greater ease than if he or she runs differently.So on this second lab visit, the researchers began by having their volunteers run at the same pace and stride length that they had originally chosen as their personal favorite.Then the researchers used a metronome to sneakily alter people\u2019s strides by asking them to match their footfalls to the metronome\u2019s tone \u2014 landing with their right foot every time the metronome sounded. The treadmill\u2019s speed remained unchanged, but the researchers sped up or slowed the metronome\u2019s cadence by first 8 and then 16 percent.In order to keep pace, the runners had to shorten or lengthen their strides accordingly.The researchers had them maintain these strides for two minutes, while tracking their breathing throughout.Then they examined the data to see how the volunteers\u2019 running economy had been affected.They found that the effects had been considerable. When the runners modified their preferred running strides, whether lengthening or shortening them, their economy generally declined. The running became physically more difficult.Interestingly, this finding held true for both the experienced and inexperienced runners, and to about the same extent. Despite their inexperience, the novices instinctively chose their most efficient pace and stride at the start of the study. Lengthening or shortening their strides subsequently did not make them more economical; instead, it made them less efficient.These findings indicate that \u201cour bodies know what they are doing\u201d when it comes to choosing running form, even without the benefit of any instruction, says Iain Hunter, a professor of exercise science at B.Y.U. who oversaw the study and is also a staff scientist for USA Track & Field.Of course, this was a one-time look at a small group of runners and focused on a single, sustainable running speed for each. It can\u2019t tell us whether there are other situations in which runners might benefit from altering their strides, including to prevent injuries, or sprint madly toward a finish line in order to set a personal best or pass one\u2019s spouse.But the general message is encouraging and empowering, Dr. Hunter says. For most of us who run, our most efficient stride is not something we have to learn from coaches or other experts, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s built in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Unveils Contentious Labor Overhaul in Big Test for Macron", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 After 30 years of fraught attempts to make France\u2019s labor market more flexible, the government announced sweeping changes on Thursday with the potential to radically shift the balance of power from workers to employers.The step was the first of several that President Emmanuel Macron and his government are planning to take to galvanize the French economy. It was cheered in European capitals, where an invigorated France is considered critical to the survival of a European Union that is finally showing signs of revival after a lost decade.Economists in France and across Europe expressed optimism about the new law, however, suggesting that Mr. Macron had seized the moment just after his election, when the country might be more receptive to what was being characterized as a revolutionary change.France has stagnated for years under chronically elevated unemployment and slow growth. The country\u2019s strong worker protections and expensive benefits have been blamed by some for being at least partly at the root of the problem.But some analysts fear that the government is going too far, giving employers too much of an upper hand and greatly eroding the power of unions, prompting at least one of them to promise a nationwide strike.Mr. Macron\u2019s changes make it easier to hire and fire workers and allow some workplace issues to be negotiated directly at the company level, rather than through industrywide agreements, in hopes of stimulating both growth and job creation. The government focused especially on smaller businesses with fewer than 50 employees \u2014 the majority of French businesses \u2014 which have complained bitterly about excessive red tape and regulations.\u201cThis reform brings a radical change, a big bang in the functioning of the French labor market,\u201d said Gilbert Cette, an economist at the University of Aix-Marseille. \u201cThis is a new approach that turns the market upside down completely,\u201d he said, referring to the decentralization of labor negotiations especially for smaller companies.The step by France was also important to Europe, where far-right and populist forces have fed on economic stagnation as well as on the disruption caused by globalization. The new step by Mr. Macron tries to answer both those challenges, belatedly, on France\u2019s own terms.France had put off fundamental changes to revitalize its economy far longer than its European Union partners. Germany crossed that Rubicon in the 1990s under Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. More recently, painful changes were forced upon a host of other nations by the euro and debt crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s no long term sustainability for the eurozone if France is not managing to reform structurally like for example what Spain did, what Portugal did a bit, what Ireland did,\u201d said Karel Lannoo, the chief executive officer of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization in Brussels.\u201cIf one of the core partners doesn\u2019t reform or just piggybacks off Germany, then one day or another, the currency collapses,\u201d Mr. Lannoo warned.Others agreed.Roughly 15 years ago, \u201cFrance and Germany had economies that were more or less comparable, and that ceased to be the case because the Germans wisely did micro-reforms and the French did not,\u201d said Sebastian Mallaby, senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.So the French ended up with \u201chigh unemployment, which fed populism, and getting out of that trap is vital to a country where the ratio of public debt to G.D.P. on current trends would eventually turn France into Italy,\u201d Mr. Mallaby said.A more economically sound France will have more influence with Berlin, and could help soften Germany\u2019s \u201crather inflexible economic policy for the rest of the E.U.,\u201d he added. In the last few years, \u201cwe could have done with more France and less Germany.\u201dBut there is little doubt that for France the changes will bring both opportunity and risk.\u201cWe are entering into an economy built on innovation, skills, digitalization,\u201d said Mr. Macron in an interview Thursday with the weekly newsmagazine Le Point.\u201cTo succeed in this world we need an economy that is much more flexible, much faster moving.\u201dEmployees will no longer have jobs that last for a lifetime, but periods of unemployment are more likely to be temporary and go in hand-in-hand with more frequent job changes and retraining, he said.Among the changes in the decrees published Thursday is license for employers to directly negotiate with their workers over certain workplace issues rather than having to follow industrywide agreements. That will allow a car parts factory in one region to have a different agreement with its workers than a similar company elsewhere.Small companies especially are being given more leeway to bargain directly with workers or their representatives, without the mediation of unions.Not everyone saw the changes as positive ones.\u201cMacron has amplified something that has been in the air for a bit: to move labor negotiations closer to the ground,\u201d said Michel Pigenet, a historian of work and social movements at the Sorbonne, one of France\u2019s most prestigious universities.\u201cBut closer to the ground, it\u2019s a fact that unions are weaker,\u201d he said. \u201cThus the negotiation is certainly going to become less balanced.\u201dUnlike several French leaders before him, Mr. Macron was able to push through the changes so quickly because he had \u2014 controversially \u2014 circumvented parliamentary debate by persuading lawmakers to allow him to make the changes by decrees.Since his party had a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, and the opposition on both the left and right are divided among themselves, winning assent for the decrees was scarcely in doubt.The labor changes were then discussed with businesses and unions behind closed doors. They were unveiled Thursday and will go into effect after they are officially adopted at a cabinet meeting on Sept. 22, then signed by Mr. Macron and officially published.Parliament has to ratify the provisions in the decrees in the coming months for them to become law, but at this stage that is not expected to be difficult.Leaders of one major union, the General Confederation of Labor, or CGT, said that the changes were as bad as they expected, and that they would go ahead with a national strike on Sept. 12. Though the demonstration could be volatile, it is not expected to block the changes.More moderate unions were more cautious, accepting some of the government\u2019s compromises, but worrying about other provisions. Business groups struck a more optimistic note.The relative equanimity came in large part because the Macron government went to great lengths to consult with everyone whose interests would be affected by the changes, holding more than 100 meetings since May to discuss the different provisions.\u201cWe multiplied the meeting with the social partners and did not exclude anyone,\u201d said \u00c9douard Philippe, the prime minister, referring to both unions and employers, who were briefed on the final version just before the measure was detailed in a televised news conference.Two larger unions, the CFDT and Force Ouvri\u00e8re, have already announced although they were not completely satisfied with the changes, they would not take part in the Sept. 12 protest.The decision by Force Ouvri\u00e8re was significant because last year when Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, then the president, tried to win approval for changes in France\u2019s labor laws, its members took to the streets along with the most hard-line union, the CGT.This year it is different, there was \u201creal consultation\u201d said Jean-Claude Mailly, Force Ouvri\u00e8re\u2019s leader.\u201cThere were things we got, there were things we avoided and there are things we don\u2019t agree with,\u201d he said, adding that his union had to thoroughly study the changes.The economist Gilbert Cette and others, including Agn\u00e8s B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, president of the semi-independent Council on Economic Analysis, which reports to the prime minister, warned that the impact would probably not be immediate.Ms. B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said that while there might be more job creation, it could be offset by more workers being fired in the near term. \u201cThe short-term impact is not completely clear,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt will encourage hiring but also could free employers to fire. It\u2019s double-edged: The goal is to make the market more fluid.\u201d\u201cMacron wants to break with the old system,\u201d Ms. B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said, adding that the fluidity would mean that while at first more people might experience periods of unemployment, the hope is that it will be short term.While some optimism surrounded the changes, the country still had more work to do, most economists agreed.\u201cWe cannot wait for this reform to be the solution to France\u2019s problems,\u201d said Mr. Cette, noting that labor reforms cannot take three or four years to have the desired impact.\u201cIt is one element along with tax reform, education and professional training that will have an effect,\u201d he added, \u201cbut on its own, it\u2019s not enough to bring us back to full employment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the president of the Council on Economic Analysis. She is Agn\u00e8s B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, not B\u00e9nnassy-Q\u00e9uer\u00e9.An article on Friday about a labor overhaul in France misstated part of the name of a research institute.

{"Headline": "I Voted for Trump. And I Sorely Regret It.", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWhen Donald Trump first announced his presidential campaign, I, like most people, thought it would be a short-lived publicity stunt. A month later, though, I happened to catch one of his political rallies on C-Span. I was riveted.It is now clear that my optimism was unfounded. I can\u2019t stand by this disgraceful administration any longer, and I would urge anyone who once supported him as I did to stop defending the 45th president.Far from making America great again, Mr. Trump has betrayed the foundations of our common citizenship. And his actions are jeopardizing any prospect of enacting an agenda that might restore the promise of American life.***What, you may wonder, especially in the wake of Charlottesville, Va., did I possibly see in this candidate?Although crude and meandering for almost all of the primary campaign, Mr. Trump eschewed strict ideologies and directly addressed themes that the more conventional candidates of both parties preferred to ignore. Rather than recite paeans to American enterprise, he acknowledged that our \u201cinformation economy\u201d has delivered little wage or productivity growth. He was willing to criticize the bipartisan consensus on trade and pointed out the devastating effects of deindustrialization felt in many communities. He forthrightly addressed the foreign policy failures of both parties, such as the debacles in Iraq and Libya, and rejected the utopian rhetoric of \u201cdemocracy promotion.\u201d He talked about the issue of widening income inequality \u2014 almost unheard of for a Republican candidate \u2014 and didn\u2019t pretend that simply cutting taxes or shrinking government would solve the problem.He criticized corporations for offshoring jobs, attacked financial-industry executives for avoiding taxes and bemoaned America\u2019s reliance on economic bubbles over the last few decades. He blasted the Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz campaigns for insincerely mouthing focus-grouped platitudes while catering to their largest donors \u2014 and he was right. Voters loved that he was willing to buck conventional wisdom and the establishment.He flouted G.O.P. orthodoxy on entitlements, infrastructure spending and, at times, even health care and \u201cculture war\u201d issues like funding Planned Parenthood. His statements on immigration were often needlessly inflammatory, but he correctly diagnosed that our current system makes little sense for most Americans, as well as many immigrants, and seems designed to benefit the wealthy at the expense of working people.Yes, Mr. Trump\u2019s policy positions were poorly defined, but these days, most candidates\u2019 positions are. And yes, he had little support from the Republican Party leadership. But many of us thought even this might be a positive if it forced him to focus on \u201cmaking deals\u201d rather than on Washington\u2019s usual ideological posturing. He was never going to fulfill all of his over-the-top promises, but we believed that his administration might achieve some meaningful successes.In my writing, I tried to steer this administration in the right direction. During the presidential primaries, the blog I helped organize, called the Journal of American Greatness, was one of the leading voices supporting certain themes of Trump\u2019s campaign. (Michael Anton, now a National Security Council adviser, was our most prolific writer.) Then, after the election, I founded a quarterly journal, American Affairs, largely to question elements of what is often called the neoliberal policy consensus \u2014 totally open borders for capital and labor; transferring power from national governments to transnational technocracies; unfettered markets; and democracy promotion as the sole premise of foreign policy. In other words, the disappointing legacy we inherited from the Bushes and the Clintons that helped pave the way to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.In this role, as one of the few people in the media who has been somewhat sympathetic to Mr. Trump, I am often asked to comment on his surprise victory, or more recently on his statements, policies and the gusher of news pouring out of this White House. For months, despite increasing chaos and incoherence, I have given Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t really think he is a racist,\u201d I have told skeptical audiences. \u201cYes, he says some stupid things, but none of it really matters; he\u2019s not really that incompetent.\u201d Or: \u201cThey\u2019ve made some mistakes, but it\u2019s still early.\u201dIt\u2019s no longer early. Not only has the president failed to make the course corrections necessary to save his administration, but his increasingly appalling conduct will continue to repel anyone who might once have been inclined to work with him.From the very start of his run, one of the most serious charges against Mr. Trump was that he panders to racists. Many of his supporters, myself included, managed to convince ourselves that his more outrageous comments \u2014 such as the Judge Gonzalo Curiel controversy or his initial hesitance to disavow David Duke\u2019s endorsement \u2014 were merely Bidenesque gaffes committed during the heat of a campaign.It is now clear that we were deluding ourselves. Either Mr. Trump is genuinely sympathetic to the David Duke types, or he is so obtuse as to be utterly incapable of learning from his worst mistakes. Either way, he continues to prove his harshest critics right.Mr. Trump once boasted that he could shoot someone in the street and not lose voters. Well, someone was just killed in the street by a white supremacist in Charlottesville. His refusal this weekend to specifically and immediately denounce the groups responsible for this intolerable violence was both morally disgusting and monumentally stupid. In this, Mr. Trump failed perhaps the easiest imaginable test of presidential leadership. Rather than advance a vision of national unity that he claims to represent, his indefensible equivocation can only inflame the most vicious forces of division within our country.If Mr. Trump had been speaking about the overall political climate, he might have been right to say that \u201cmany sides\u201d are responsible for exacerbating social tensions. Yet during the events in Charlottesville this past weekend, only one side \u2014 a deranged white nationalist \u2014 was responsible for killing anyone. To equivocate about this fact is the height of irresponsibility. Even those concerned about the overzealous enforcement of political correctness can hardly think that apologizing for neo-Nazis is a sensible alternative.Those of us who supported Mr. Trump were never so na\u00efve as to expect that he would transform himself into a model of presidential decorum upon taking office. But our calculation was that a few cringe-inducing tweets were an acceptable trade-off for a successful governing agenda.Yet after more than 200 days in office, Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior grows only more reprehensible. Meanwhile, his administration has no significant legislative accomplishments \u2014 and no apparent plan to deliver any. Wilbur Ross\u2019s Commerce Department has advanced some sensible and appropriately incremental changes to trade policy, but no long-term agenda has been articulated. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue\u2019s recently proposed legislation offers a sound basis for reforming immigration policy, but seems to have no prospects and has received comparatively little attention. The administration inexplicably downgraded infrastructure and corporate tax reform \u2014 issues with potentially broad-based support \u2014 to pursue a warmed-over version of Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal, which ended, predictably, in a humiliating failure.Effectively a third-party president without a party, Mr. Trump has faced extraordinary resistance from the media, the bureaucracy and even within the Republican Party. But the administration has committed too many unforced errors and deserves most of the blame for its failures. Far from making the transformative \u201cdeals\u201d he promised voters, his only talent appears to be creating grotesque media frenzies \u2014 just as all his critics said.Those who found some admirable things in the hazy outlines of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 a trade policy focused on national industrial development; a less quixotic foreign policy; less ideological approaches to infrastructure, health care and entitlements \u2014 will have to salvage that agenda from the wreckage of his presidency. On that, I\u2019m not ready to give up.This story has been updated to reflect news events.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Supports Plan to Cut Legal Immigration by Half", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump embraced a proposal on Wednesday to slash legal immigration to the United States in half within a decade by sharply curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country.The plan would enact the most far-reaching changes to the system of legal immigration in decades and represents the president\u2019s latest effort to stem the flow of newcomers to the United States. Since taking office, he has barred many visitors from select Muslim-majority countries, limited the influx of refugees, increased immigration arrests and pressed to build a wall along the southern border.In asking Congress to curb legal immigration, Mr. Trump intensified a debate about national identity, economic growth, worker fairness and American values that animated his campaign last year. Critics said the proposal would undercut the fundamental vision of the United States as a haven for the poor and huddled masses, while the president and his allies said the country had taken in too many low-skilled immigrants for too long to the detriment of American workers.\u201cThis legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century, but it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a White House event alongside two Republican senators sponsoring the bill. \u201cThis legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first.\u201dIn throwing his weight behind a bill, Mr. Trump added one more long-odds priority to a legislative agenda already packed with them in the wake of the defeat of legislation to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care program. The president has already vowed to overhaul the tax code and rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, airports and other infrastructure.But by endorsing legal immigration cuts, a move he has long supported, Mr. Trump returned to a theme that has defined his short political career and excites his conservative base at a time when his poll numbers continue to sink. Just 33 percent of Americans approved of his performance in the latest Quinnipiac University survey, the lowest rating of his presidency, and down from 40 percent a month ago.Democrats and some Republicans quickly criticized the move. \u201cInstead of catching criminals, Trump wants to tear apart communities and punish immigrant families that are making valuable contributions to our economy,\u201d said Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThat\u2019s not what America stands for.\u201dThe bill, sponsored by Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, would institute a merit-based system to determine who is admitted to the country and granted legal residency green cards, favoring applicants based on skills, education and language ability rather than relations with people already here. The proposal revives an idea included in broader immigration legislation supported by President George W. Bush that died in 2007.More than one million people are granted legal residency each year, and the proposal would reduce that by 41 percent in its first year and 50 percent by its 10th year, according to projections cited by its sponsors. The reductions would come largely from those brought in through family connections. The number of immigrants granted legal residency on the basis of job skills, about 140,000, would remain roughly the same.Under the current system, most legal immigrants are admitted to the United States based on family ties. American citizens can sponsor spouses, parents and minor children for an unrestricted number of visas, while siblings and adult children are given preferences for a limited number of visas available to them. Legal permanent residents holding green cards can also sponsor spouses and children.In 2014, 64 percent of immigrants admitted with legal residency were immediate relatives of American citizens or sponsored by family members. Just 15 percent entered through employment-based preferences, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent research organization. But that does not mean that those who came in on family ties were necessarily low skilled or uneducated.The legislation would award points based on education, ability to speak English, high-paying job offers, age, record of achievement and entrepreneurial initiative. But while it would still allow spouses and minor children of Americans and legal residents to come in, it would eliminate preferences for other relatives, like siblings and adult children. The bill would create a renewable temporary visa for older-adult parents who come for caretaking purposes.The projections cited by the sponsors said legal immigration would decrease to 637,960 after a year and to 539,958 after a decade.\u201cOur current system does not work,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. \u201cIt keeps America from being competitive and it does not meet the needs of our economy today.\u201dMr. Cotton said low-skilled immigrants pushed down wages for those who worked with their hands. \u201cFor some people, they may think that that\u2019s a symbol of America\u2019s virtue and generosity,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a symbol that we\u2019re not committed to working-class Americans, and we need to change that.\u201dBut Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, noted that agriculture and tourism were his state\u2019s top two industries. \u201cIf this proposal were to become law, it would be devastating to our state\u2019s economy, which relies on this immigrant work force,\u201d he said. \u201cHotels, restaurants, golf courses and farmers,\u201d he added, \u201cwill tell you this proposal to cut legal immigration in half would put their business in peril.\u201dCutting legal immigration would make it harder for Mr. Trump to reach the stronger economic growth that he has promised. Bringing in more workers, especially during a time of low unemployment, increases the size of an economy. Critics said the plan would result in labor shortages, especially in lower-wage jobs that many Americans do not want.The National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group, said the country was already facing a work force gap of 7.5 million jobs by 2020. \u201cCutting legal immigration for the sake of cutting immigration would cause irreparable harm to the American worker and their family,\u201d said Ali Noorani, the group\u2019s executive director.The plan endorsed by Mr. Trump generated a fiery exchange at the White House briefing when Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s policy adviser and a longtime advocate of immigration limits, defended the proposal. Pressed for statistics to back up claims that immigration was costing Americans jobs, he cited several studies that have been debated by experts.\u201cBut let\u2019s also use common sense here, folks,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAt the end of the day, why do special interests want to bring in more low-skill workers?\u201dHe rejected the argument that immigration policy should also be based on compassion. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time we had compassion for American workers,\u201d he said.When a reporter read him some of the words from the Statue of Liberty \u2014 \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\u201d \u2014 Mr. Miller dismissed them. \u201cThe poem that you\u2019re referring to was added later,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty.\u201dHe noted that in 1970, the United States allowed in only a third as many legal immigrants as it now does: \u201cWas that violating or not violating the Statue of Liberty law of the land?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated part of President Trump\u2019s effort to stem the flow of immigrants into the United States. He has increased immigration arrests, not deportations.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter @peterbakernytJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Susan C. Beachy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When you hear people say \u201cWe\u2019re creating more jobs,\u201d what they don\u2019t say is that, while that\u2019s true, most of that has been in the Bay Area and along the coast.I think we should all be concerned that Marin County has among the nation\u2019s highest rankings for well-being and 100 miles away in the Central Valley, they have among the lowest.What\u2019s your pitch to the Bay Area?The pitch to the Bay Area and to the affluent parts of Los Angeles or San Diego or any place on the coast is that we won\u2019t survive and thrive if we\u2019re not growing together.A high-wage worker puts more money into our Social Security system. A high-wage worker is buying more goods. A high-wage worker is less dependent on the public health system.How do you assess Eric Garcetti\u2019s tenure as mayor of Los Angeles?Oh, I\u2019m not running against Garcetti.You\u2019re the former mayor, you must ... I take a page out of Bush\u2019s playbook, where he didn\u2019t comment about Obama, and Obama doesn\u2019t comment for the most part about Trump \u2014 you would think he\u2019d comment a lot more given what Trump does \u2014 but you know Garcetti is a very popular mayor in this town.

{"Headline": "The Debt-Ceiling Crisis Is Real", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSometime in October, the United States is likely to default on its obligation to pay its bills as they come due, having failed to raise the federal debt ceiling. This will cost the Treasury tens of billions of dollars every year for decades to come in higher interest charges and probably trigger a severe recession.The debt ceiling is politically imposed, and the decision not to raise it, and therefore to choose to default, is also political. It\u2019s something America has avoided in the past. This time, though, will be different.This country has hit the debt ceiling once, in 1979, and then largely by accident and only to a minor extent. But even that foot fault was estimated to cost the United States about 0.6 percent in higher interest costs for an indefinite period. More recently, congressional debt ceiling brinkmanship in 2011 led Standard & Poor\u2019s to downgrade the credit rating of the United States.An increase in Treasury interest rates of just 0.2 percent a year would cost the government about $400 billion over the next 10 years. It also would lead to higher borrowing costs for American businesses, because borrowing rates are set by reference to Treasury rates. Moreover, each month holders of tens of billions of dollars in valid claims against the United States would go unpaid, triggering a major recession.None of this is particularly speculative; almost all economists and policy makers agree on the enormous fiscal, economic and reputational costs of default. That\u2019s why, in the past, we\u2019ve always managed to avoid it. What\u2019s different in 2017?First, the administration is confounded by inexperience, incompetence and infighting. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has little expertise in congressional stage management, but he understands the gravity of the situation and has lobbied for a clean debt ceiling bill \u2014 one without conditions or unnecessary amendments.But that puts him in tension with his White House colleague Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, who has intimated that breaching the debt ceiling would not be that consequential, and who has argued that the must-pass legislation should be used to advance the hard right\u2019s agenda. Without a firm signal from the White House that the debt ceiling should not be held hostage to political agendas, it will be hard to get Congress to do the right thing.And that\u2019s the second problem: Congress, and in particular the Freedom Caucus. As the health care fight showed, the caucus is fixated on cutting entitlement spending. It has made it clear that if the House leadership balks on their demands for major cuts in the 2018 budget, they\u2019ll refuse to vote on raising the debt ceiling.Finally, some conservative policy makers besides Mr. Mulvaney have convinced themselves that crashing into the debt ceiling won\u2019t be a big deal because the government can \u201cprioritize\u201d its bill payments, so that interest on Treasury debt will be paid on a current basis, while other bills sit unpaid.Understanding the false allure of prioritization requires a little background. Hitting the debt ceiling is not the same as a government shutdown or other fiscal brinkmanship. Think of the United States, acting through the Treasury, as holding a bank account at the Federal Reserve. Every day, millions of bills arrive and are promptly paid by debiting Treasury\u2019s account at the Fed. At the same time, millions of dollars in tax and other receipts arrive and are credited to that bank account. The money coming in is systematically less than the money being disbursed (that\u2019s what it means to run a deficit), and Treasury makes up the difference by borrowing in the capital markets.A government shutdown occurs when the Treasury has money in its bank account but Congress refuses to appropriate the funds necessary for the government to function. Crashing into the debt ceiling, by contrast, would occur if Treasury had no money in its bank account because Congress prohibited it from funding deficits through incremental borrowing.If Treasury hits the ceiling, it has only two realistic responses. Treasury can pay the government\u2019s bills on a first-in, first-out basis, with the wait for payment growing every month, or it can prioritize bills, as Mr. Mulvaney and others have suggested it would.But there are profound doubts as to whether the Treasury could even implement prioritization, beyond ring fencing interest payments, because its payment systems are designed to pay all claims as they are due, regardless of their origin. More important, prioritization is default by another name. The consequences are the same, regardless of which i.o.u.s Treasury chooses to dishonor.All valid claims against the United States are backed by the credit of the United States, full stop; the Constitution does not contemplate that some claims are more senior than others. The deliberate nonpayment of billions of dollars of uncontested claims every month thus constitutes default, even if the Treasury is paying some of its other debts. The resulting class-action lawsuits will enrich generations of lawyers.These are noisy times in Washington. But even in this context, the awfulness of a debt ceiling crisis should galvanize us. Like an impending execution, it should concentrate our minds \u2014 now, while something can still be done.Edward D.

{"Headline": "Why Are American Liberals So Afraid of Russia?", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 There is something mystifying about the American obsession with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. The Kremlin\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula, its military involvement in Syria and its meddling in elections abroad may help explain some of America\u2019s sense of alarm. But they fail to explain why liberals in the United States are so much more vexed by Russia than they are by, say, the growing economic power and geopolitical ambitions of China, or the global ideological challenge of radical Islam or the sheer craziness of a nuclear-armed North Korea.Russia suffers from demographic decline and arrested modernization. Its economy is overdependent on exporting natural resources. Its population has one of the highest percentages of university-educated people but the lowest labor productivity in the industrialized world. And although Mr. Putin is a strong and ruthless leader who enjoys popular support at home and celebrity status abroad, Russia\u2019s institutions are corrupt and dysfunctional: Russian bureaucrats spend much of their energy fighting one another over money and power and have no time to cooperate. And Russia\u2019s future after Mr. Putin \u2014 whenever that may come \u2014 is anybody\u2019s guess.And yet despite all of this, Americans are mesmerized and terrified by Russia. Is it simply that for liberal America, \u201cRussia\u201d is a code name for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d?As for many of the great questions of our times, an explanation can be found in Russian classical literature. In this case, Fyodor Dostoyevsky\u2019s novella \u201cThe Double.\u201d It is the story of a government clerk who winds up in the madhouse after meeting his doppelg\u00e4nger \u2014 a man who looks like him and speaks like him, but who displays all the charm and self-confidence that the tortured protagonist lacks. The doppelg\u00e4nger in Dostoyevsky\u2019s story does not drive the protagonist insane just because they look alike but because he makes the protagonist realize what it is he doesn\u2019t like about himself. And such it is with the United States and Russia today.It was the Kremlin that for the past two decades tried to explain away its problems and failures by blaming foreign meddling. Now America is doing the same. Everything that liberal Americans dislike \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral victory, the reverse of the process of democratization in the world and the decline of American power \u2014 are viewed as the results of Mr. Putin\u2019s plottings.Russia also embodies what politics can look like when the elites are completely divorced from the people. It is not only a highly unequal society but also one in which rising inequality is normal, and a handful of very rich and politically unaccountable rulers have managed to stay on top without having to use much violence. The privileged few do not need to dominate or control their fellow citizens; they can simply ignore them like an irrelevant nuisance.It may take a while before working-class Americans start to realize that while the American economy is dramatically different from that of Russia, the technological revolution led by Silicon Valley could in time tilt Western societies toward authoritarian politics in the same way that an abundance of natural resources has made Mr. Putin\u2019s regime possible. Robots \u2014 not unlike post-Soviet citizens \u2014 are not that interested in democracy.For many years, Americans were able to look at Russia and its social and political problems and see a country stuck in the past, perhaps someday to develop into a modern country like the United States.

{"Headline": "Russian Conglomerate\u2019s $2.3 Billion Fine May Chill Investors", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A court ordered Russia\u2019s largest privately owned business conglomerate on Wednesday to pay $2.3 billion to the country\u2019s state oil company in a case closely watched by investors worried about the unraveling of private property rights.The conglomerate, Sistema, called the ruling troubling because the penalty was imposed in part for transactions that preceded a planned initial public offering, suggesting that any company preparing to go public could be seen as violating the law.\u201cThe judge has in effect cast into question the legality of standard corporate procedures such as preparations for an I.P.O., and buyback and cancellation of a company\u2019s own shares,\u201d said Sergei Kopytov, a spokesman for Sistema. \u201cWe think that this ruling will have a significant negative impact.\u201d Sistema said it would appeal the ruling.The dispute dates to the nationalization in 2014 of the Bashneft oil company, a former subsidiary of Sistema. The nationalization was another zigzag in Russia\u2019s on-again, off-again embrace of private property in the post-Soviet period.Sistema had acquired a controlling stake from regional elites, who had in turn bought the shares from a regional government. But a state property agency asserted that the original transfer of Bashneft to the regional government in 1993 was illegal, and voided all subsequent transactions. The agency then sold Bashneft to Rosneft, the state oil company.Rosneft then sued Sistema, accusing it of mismanaging Bashneft and stripping it of assets, and demanded $3 billion in compensation. Sistema denied the allegations and said the transactions at issue, such as the share buyback, were intended to prepare Bashneft for a public offering of stock.In the ruling Wednesday, the court reduced the award but otherwise supported much of Rosneft\u2019s claim.\u201cWe are satisfied with the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Rosneft said in a statement. \u201cThe court fully accepted our legal position.\u201d Rosneft said its lawyers would review options for appealing to win the additional money it had sought.At an annual shareholder meeting last month, Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Rosneft, said the suit was improving Russia\u2019s investment climate by rooting out poor corporate governance.The conflict pits two of Russia\u2019s largest companies. As the overall economy stagnates amid sanctions and low oil prices, the country\u2019s elite may end up fighting over a smaller pie, with businesses seeking to gain advantage by using courts and law enforcement agencies widely seen as vulnerable to corruption.It has also cast a light on the struggles facing Rosneft, which cannot raise money directly from international banks because of sanctions imposed after the conflict in Ukraine. The sanctions prohibit long-term lending to the company and some others.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zuma to Face No-Confidence Vote, This Time by Secret Ballot", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 Over his eight increasingly embattled years in power, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa has fended off five parliamentary no-confidence motions that would have forced him from office. On Tuesday, he is to face another, with a difference: Lawmakers will vote anonymously.The speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete, announced late on Monday afternoon that a vote of no confidence would take place by secret ballot, following a request from a coalition of opposition parties.Mr. Zuma has come under increasing pressure as evidence of high-level corruption in his administration has mounted, most recently with a trove of leaked emails that appeared to expose the extent of links between senior A.N.C. officials and an influential family, the Guptas.The motion requires only a simple majority to pass South Africa\u2019s 400-member Parliament.If the motion passed, Mr. Zuma and his entire cabinet, including deputy ministers, would have to step down, with Ms. Mbete becoming interim president, though he would remain president of the A.N.C.The party\u2019s chief whip in Parliament, Jackson Mthembu, said on Friday that voting against Mr. Zuma would be \u201ctantamount to throwing a nuclear bomb\u201d at South Africa, and that only a \u201cbewitched\u201d party would vote against its own president.The family\u2019s relationship with the presidency has introduced a new portmanteau term into the South African political lexicon \u2014 \u201cZupta\u201d \u2014 and prompted a critical report last year from the public protector, a national anti-corruption figure.Somadoda Fikeni, a political analyst, said the no-confidence motion was unlikely to succeed, even in a secret ballot. \u201cThe A.N.C. doesn\u2019t want to be seen changing its leadership on the back of pressure from the opposition, even though half the party believes that Mr. Zuma has become a serious political liability,\u201d he said.A more serious challenge to Mr. Zuma may come in December, when the A.N.C. is to hold its national conference and elect its next leader.\u201cThe President\u2019s opponents in the A.N.C. \u2014 and there are many \u2014 have clearly decided to wait until December to try and get rid of him,\u201d said a political analyst, Steven Friedman. \u201cThe fight that matters is taking place within the party. Until we have millions of people marching on the streets, instead of merely thousands, the A.N.C. is going to remained focused on this internal struggle.\u201dProtesters gathered in Cape Town on Monday afternoon, led by a coalition of civil society and religious leaders called #UniteBehind. A brief but spirited counterprotest by members of the A.N.C.\u2019s Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association, numbering some 50 people, was disbanded by police.The protest, organized by a coalition of more than 20 civil society organizations, was a \u201ccall for accountability from A.N.C. members,\u201d said its organizer Mandisa Dyantyi, deputy secretary general of the Social Justice Coalition, which helped organize the protest. \u201cThey\u2019re in Parliament to represent the people who elected them, not their party,\u201d she said.Mr. Jonas \u2014 who has accused a member of the Gupta family of offering him a bribe, a claim the family has strongly denied \u2014 told the protesters: \u201cWe cannot allow our freedom to be sold so cheaply. We have to fight. We\u2019re gathered here to shape the future of this country.\u201d\u201cThis march is a distraction from the real issues in South Africa,\u201d said Banzi Siwe, 23, a student, who added: \u201cCompared to what the white people stole before, this is nothing.\u201dKhaya Yozi, a spokesman for the A.N.C. in Cape Town, said that the party\u2019s members \u201cwould not be provoked\u201d by opposition protesters. \u201cWe need to set aside the divisions within our party and protect the A.N.C.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a spokesman for the African National Congress, Zizi Kodwa.

{"Headline": "A Deal for an Australian Dairy Wrapped in Layers of Chinese Loans", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt looked like a good match. Australia was hungry for Chinese money. And the businessman, Lu Xianfeng, presented himself as a well-heeled investor, promising to protect existing jobs and add even more.Like much of the splashier overseas spending by Chinese conglomerates, the acquisition of the dairy was financed by layers upon layers of debt, the type of financial complexity and opaque deal making that worry regulators in China and around the world.Mr. Lu paid for the purchase with three loans, one from a lender in Australia and two from Chinese lenders, including the biggest state-run bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to the filings of his publicly traded company. He then pledged shares in the public company, Ningbo Xianfeng New Materials, to raise even more money. Lately, his businesses have been on shaky financial footing, with Ningbo Xianfeng halting trading in its shares in China, citing a restructuring.The acquisition of the Tasmanian dairy, known as Van Diemen\u2019s Land Company, or VDL, is spurring questions about whether the Australian government is fully assessing the risks.Major purchases by overseas buyers are vetted by Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board. While the board analyzes deals for threats to the country\u2019s national interests, its mandate does not require deep due diligence on the buyers\u2019 finances.\u201cThe Australian assumption has been that Chinese business operates like Australian ones,\u201d said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \u201cBut they operate in ways that don\u2019t fit with how we do business in the Australian economy.\u201dThe review process, he said, appears to lack basic due diligence on potential foreign buyers. \u201cIf they have the capacity, they are very good at hiding it,\u201d he said.Mr. Lu is not the only Chinese buyer with precarious finances.Mr. Lu did not respond to requests for comment sent through his Chinese and Australian companies. A spokeswoman for his Chinese company, Ningbo Xianfeng, declined to comment.A spokesman for the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, said in a statement that \u201cthe government considers a broad range of factors against the national interest when assessing foreign investment proposals,\u201d including financing arrangements and impact on the economy.The Tasmanian government has been courting Chinese investors since it hosted President Xi with fanfare in 2014. Bolstered by an Australia-China free trade agreement, Tasmanian exports of fresh produce to China have soared.From the outset, the deal for the lush land perched high above the southern Pacific Ocean attracted attention. The roots of VDL, Australia\u2019s most prestigious dairy, stretch back to the settlement of Tasmania by the British in the early 1800s. The British owned it for more than a century; the dairy was owned by a New Zealand company before Mr. Lu bought it.\u201cHere was a proposal from a savvy Chinese investor,\u201d said the chief executive of VDL Farms, Evan Rolley, a former state government official. \u201cHe could take the Tasmanian product right into the consumer markets in China.\u201dTo help gain acceptance in tight-knit Tasmania, where the population is just 500,000, Mr. Lu chose a well-connected former politician, David Crean, as the deputy chairman of Moon Lake. Mr. Lu impressed officials with his pledge to honor the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people on the property, Mr. Rolley said.\u201cThey have a na\u00efve fixation\u201d with China, Mark Harrison, associate professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Tasmania, said of the state government.\u201cMr. Lu\u2019s financial problems were well covered in the Chinese press and in financial filings,\u201d he said. \u201cI know about them. Why doesn\u2019t the government?\u201dAfter striking an agreement to buy the dairy in late 2015, Mr. Lu established Kaixin Investment, a Ningbo-based company, to acquire the assets. That company obtained loans of $74 million from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and $22 million from the China Zheshang Bank to finance the purchase.The loans were guaranteed by Ningbo Xianfeng, which in turn was backed by all the dairy farm\u2019s assets, according to corporate filings. Separate public filings showed that a $56 million loan from Rabobank in Australia also funded the deal, debt that was also backed by the dairy\u2019s assets.The Chinese loans were not presented to the review board, according to the managing director of Moon Lake, Sean Shwe, who helped prepare documents for the board. Mr. Shwe said he was not aware of the loans from the Chinese lenders.Such loans are generally extended at high interest rates. They can sour quickly if shares plunge in value, a possibility in China\u2019s seesawing stock market.In an interview, the spokesman for Mr. Morrison, the Australian treasurer, said that Mr. Morrison was \u201ccomfortable with the advice provided by the review board on the dairy acquisition.\u201dThe Australian review board said the documents presented by the Chinese buyer were confidential.Rabobank declined to comment.Mr. Lu\u2019s businesses have been struggling. Ningbo Xianfeng has not traded since April. It announced in July that profits were expected to drop at least 70 percent in the first six months of 2017.The window-shade business Mr. Lu owns in Perth, Australia, has failed to turn an annual profit since Ningbo Xianfeng acquired it in 2014.Last month, Ningbo Xianfeng announced it would sell an online auto-parts business in Shanghai. Employees had staged a revolt, saying Mr. Lu didn\u2019t live up to his pledges, according to press reports and public filings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Is Said to Open Broad Inquiry Into China\u2019s Trade Practices", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is preparing to open a broad investigation into China\u2019s trade practices, according to people with knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s plans, amid growing worries in the United States over a Chinese government-led effort to make the country a global leader in microchips, electric cars and other crucial technologies of the future.The investigation will focus on alleged Chinese violations of American intellectual property, according to three people with a detailed knowledge of the administration\u2019s plans. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not yet public.Any move by the Trump administration to punish China over its trade practices would raise tensions within the world\u2019s largest trade relationship between two countries. China\u2019s export sector still contributes heavily to its economy growth despite Beijing\u2019s efforts to diversify its economy, and China represents a lucrative market for American automakers, technology companies like Apple, farmers and many others.At the same time, the Chinese government has demanded that American companies cut the licensing fees that they charge for key patents and has insisted that companies set up joint ventures to do business in China.Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official and longtime trade expert who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing research group, said that the Chinese government would study any American trade case before deciding how to respond and whether to seek intervention from the World Trade Organization, which hears trade disputes.\u201cChina thinks that the bilateral trade relation is governed by W.T.O. rules, not American domestic law,\u201d Mr. He said.Then the policy began to founder.The two sides met on July 19 to produce a series of trade deals that could be portrayed as an \u201cearly harvest\u201d in the three months following Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with President Xi Jinping of China last spring at Mar-a-Lago, Trump administration officials and trade policy advisers said. The two sides were unable to agree on any deals that went significantly beyond what China had previously promised the Obama administration, they said. Both sides ended up abruptly canceling the news conferences they had scheduled to discuss what were supposed to have been their accomplishments.China has also publicly dismissed linking trade and North Korea policy and defended its efforts to improve intellectual property protections. \u201cChina highly emphasizes intellectual property protection and has taken many effective measures,\u201d said Sun Jiwen, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, in May following criticism from American trade officials.Under the process that the Trump administration plans to set in motion, the Office of the United States Trade Representative will start an investigation into China\u2019s trade practices. Following the investigation, which could be completed in as little as a few months, the United States could impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports, rescind licenses for Chinese companies to do business in the United States, or take other measures. The process is known as a Section 301 investigation, after the relevant portions of the 1974 Trade Act.Much is at stake for both sides. Exports to the United States represent more than 4 percent of China\u2019s entire economic output. Those exports have created tens of millions of jobs in China and prompted multinationals to shift thousands of factories to China along with much of their latest technology. American exports to China are much smaller, representing about two-thirds of 1 percent of the American economy.American companies have tended to supply the Chinese market using factories and staff in China, instead of exports from the United States. But their profits from the Chinese market are large enough that many corporate executives have been loath to cooperate with United States trade officials, for fear that Chinese government ministries may retaliate against them.The potential impact of the American investigation is unclear at this early stage. Still, previous cases suggest their effect on China\u2019s industrial ambitions may be limited.Mindful of those limits, Congressional Republicans discussed in recent months whether to include what is known as a border adjusted tax, which would penalize all imports while benefiting exports, in their plans to overhaul the tax code this year. But the proposed tax ran into heavy opposition from retailers like Wal-Mart that rely heavily on selling goods imported from China.Until a couple weeks ago, it had looked as though the first industry on which the Trump administration would confront China would be steel. But any move to punish Chinese steel imports could hit other nations, too, and the Trump administration decided last month to rely instead on negotiations among the Group of 20 member countries scheduled for August and November.The United States used Section 301 energetically against other countries during the Reagan administration and the administration of President George Bush. Mr. Lighthizer was a deputy United States trade representative in the Reagan administration and has been an advocate of shielding the American industrial base from government-assisted foreign competitors.But the cases then thoroughly antagonized America\u2019s trading partners.\u201cIt was really the aggressive uses of this in the late 1980s and early 1990s that prompted the rest of the world to set up the dispute resolution system\u201d of the World Trade Organization, said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics here.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherJane Perlez contributed reporting, and Ailin Tang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Exxon Mobil Didn\u2019t Say About Climate Change", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsScrutiny is mounting on the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil and gas company. On multiple legal fronts the question is being asked: Did Exxon Mobil\u2019s communications about climate change break the law?The question dominating these cases is whether the company misled consumers, shareholders or the public about the environmental or business risks of climate change, or about the risk that oil and gas reserves might become stranded assets that won\u2019t be developed, affecting shareholder value.\u201cRead the documents,\u201d the company said, \u201cand make up your own mind.\u201dOur findings are clear: Exxon Mobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications. Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what Exxon Mobil\u2019s scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private and in academic circles, and what it presented to the general public.In total, we analyzed 187 documents generated between 1977 and 2014. We coded each document to characterize its positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious and solvable. (Research has shown that these four factors are key predictors of public support for climate policies. Not coincidentally, they also underpin most narratives of climate skepticism and denial.) We found that, from as early as the 1970s, Exxon Mobil (and its predecessors Exxon and Mobil) not only knew about emerging climate science, but also contributed research to it. Scientific reports and articles written or cowritten by Exxon Mobil employees acknowledged that global warming was a real and serious threat. They also noted it could be addressed by reducing fossil fuel use, meaning that fossil fuel reserves might one day become stranded assets.For the most part their research was highly technical, hidden behind the walls of Exxon Mobil offices, or reported in academic publications with access only through a paywall.In 1997, for instance, in an ad titled \u201cReset the Alarm,\u201d the company argued: \u201cLet\u2019s face it: The science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet.\u201dSome advertorials conflicted with Exxon Mobil research published the very same year.In short, Exxon Mobil contributed quietly to climate science and loudly to raising doubts about it. We found that, accounting for reasonable doubt given the state of the science at the time of each document, roughly 80 percent of the company\u2019s academic and internal papers acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused.

{"Headline": "In a Move Away From Tradition, Cremations Increase", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy comparison, burials accounted for 43.5 percent of funerals last year, down from 45.4 percent in 2015, and the president of the association, W. Ashley Cozine, predicted that the cremation rate would continue to rise. By 2025, the association is forecasting that 63.8 percent of the people who die in the United States will be cremated, and by 2035, 78.8 percent.The reasons include the weakening hold of religion on American life as well as a loosening of strictures against cremation by some denominations. The proportion of consumers 40 and older who think it is important to have religion as part of a funeral has dropped by 20 percent since 2012, according to the funeral directors\u2019 association.Cost can also be a factor \u2014 cremation is usually less expensive than conventional burial.\u201cMost funeral directors have seen a lot of families move away from tradition, move away from ceremony,\u201d said R. Bryant Hightower Jr., the secretary of the funeral directors\u2019 association, \u201cand in their minds, ceremony and tradition are tied to the burial side more than the cremation side. So they have said, \u2018If I want it simple and I don\u2019t want it in a church or a synagogue and I don\u2019t want a rabbi or a minister, then I want cremation.\u2019\u201dThe Roman Catholic Church has allowed cremation for decades \u2014 in 1963, the Vatican expressed a preference for burial but said that cremation was not \u201copposed per se to the Christian religion\u201d and that funeral rites should not be denied to Catholics who sought cremation.Many Catholic cemeteries now have niches and above-ground mausoleums for cremated remains. Andrew Schafer, the executive director of Catholic cemeteries for the Archdiocese of Newark, said the cremation rate at the eight cemeteries he oversees had risen to 18 percent a year, up from 10 percent five years ago.\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing steady growth of 1 percent a year,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in the Northeast, we\u2019re a little more conservative with our traditions. That could be a reason we do not have the same numbers as on the West Coast, where the cremation rate is significantly higher.\u201dMr. Hightower, a funeral director in Carrollton, Ga., said the economy also figured in people\u2019s decisions on cremation. It typically costs less than a third of a funeral with a conventional burial, and for many families, the difference is crucial.\u201cThe housing market here got crippled\u201d in the recession, he said. \u201cWe saw people who had planned for the date and time of their loss. The family came in and said they had X dollars and if they could spend less, they could pay next month\u2019s mortgage payment or the tuition payment for a grandson.\u201dIn the metropolitan region, traditional burials still outnumbered cremations in 2015, the last year for which statistics are available \u2014 but not by much. The funeral directors\u2019 association said 44.3 percent of the deaths in Connecticut ended in burials and 43.4 percent in cremations. The comparable figures for New York were 51.8 percent for burials and 41.9 percent for cremations, and in New Jersey, 47 percent for burials and 41.9 percent for cremations.That was the case with the granite bench that Mr. Angueira and his sister chose for Ms. Rosa\u2019s cremated remains \u2014 a bench that he or anyone else visiting the cemetery can sit on. The remains, in a small sealed container, are in a cylinder-shaped urn, which was placed in a round space in the seat of the granite bench that was drilled out.The bench occupies a patch of lawn in an older section of the cemetery, near formal columned mausoleums that date to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. In one are the remains of F. W. Woolworth, the five-and-10-cent store mogul who died in 1919, and his granddaughter, the socialite Barbara Hutton, who died in 1979.Mr. Angueira said he and his sister decided on the bench after considering other possibilities. \u201cThey can inter you in a rock with a brook running by,\u201d he said. Woodlawn is expanding, putting more boulders by the stream, which runs to the Bronx River from a lake on the cemetery grounds.But they were not sure that it fit instructions in Ms. Rosa\u2019s letter that she preferred for her cremated remains to be above ground. So they decided on the bench, which cost about $30,000 and has space for as many as seven more sets of cremated remains.\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure how we\u2019d feel sitting on it,\u201d Mr. Angueira said, \u201cbut it\u2019s supercomfortable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was a victory for President Hassan Rouhani, who was sworn into office on Saturday after being re-elected this year promising to revitalize an economy hurt by sanctions.Iran, an Islamic republic, is increasingly attracting foreign investors, despite restrictions imposed by the United States over its missile program and its military activities in the region.Its economy has limped along, surviving mainly on oil sales in recent years, with youth unemployment topping 40 percent and the state controlling many sectors. American restrictions stop most international banks from providing financing or credit to Iran, and the country is cut off from international payments systems for using debit and credit cards.Still, the agreement to establish a joint venture with a government-run conglomerate is welcome news for Iran.Renault has pledged to open two factories with Iranian partners.One partner, the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization, a government conglomerate known as IDRO and which controls 117 companies, was long under sanctions by the United States and Europe which accused it of supporting Iran\u2019s missile program. Those sanctions were lifted under Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement with world powers last year, which allowed Renault and other foreign companies, including the American plane manufacturer Boeing, to do business with the country.Sanctions lawyers in the United States said Renault\u2019s decision to proceed with the joint venture indicated it was confident that the nuclear deal would survive, despite the Trump administration\u2019s threats to withdraw from it.Farhad Alavi, managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group in Washington, said Renault\u2019s decision also signaled that it had \u201clikely undertaken a great deal of care to ensure that it is fully compliant.\u201dBut despite the various agreements, Iran remains a difficult and opaque place to do business. Corruption is widespread, and political opposition to foreign investment can raise obstacles.The French company will hold a 60 percent share in the joint venture, according to Mansour Moazzami, the chairman of IDRO. The rest will be split evenly between the conglomerate and the other partner, Negin Khodro, a private company that represents Renault in Iran.Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the North Koreans developed nuclear weapons to ensure their country\u2019s survival. This strategy has worked so far.One can condemn the regime and still try to understand its perspective in order to engage in meaningful diplomacy.

Rice\u2019s otherwise excellent analysis of the situation in North Korea. First she says, \u201cBy most assessments, Mr. Kim is vicious and impetuous, but not irrational.\u201d Kim Jong-un is paranoid and for little reason; no one wants to invade the North, for there is nothing to gain. The economy is in shambles, poverty reigns, the people live in fear, and they produce nothing of value save some natural resources.Her second point with which I take exception is: \u201cHistory shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea \u2014 the same way we tolerated the far greater threat of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War.\u201d At that time both the United States and the Soviet Union had leaders in charge who knew from experience the horrors of both conventional and nuclear war. I strongly believe that knowledge, above all, acted as a pause button in both countries. I do not believe that Mr. Kim has such self-control. I think he just wants to blow something up.To the Editor:Let us not lose sight of this: The closer Robert Mueller gets to unraveling the connections between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the more Mr. Trump will attempt to obfuscate and deflect attention, even if it could lead to nuclear war.

{"Headline": "South Korea Faces an Uncomfortable Reality: A Nuclear Neighbor", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 As the United States debates the wisdom of military action against North Korea, its allies in South Korea have largely moved on and reached an uncomfortable conclusion \u2014 that they may have no choice but to live with a nuclear-armed neighbor.\u201cIn South Korea, whether you are a conservative or progressive, military action is not an option you can choose,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, the capital. \u201cIt\u2019s an option of mass destruction.\u201dMr. Moon contends that North Korea can be persuaded to forsake nuclear weapons through a combination of deft diplomacy and tough economic sanctions. Yet many across South Korea find that prospect highly unlikely. Ask people in the South whether the North will ever abandon its arsenal, and more often than not, the answer is: Would you if you were North Korean?They cannot do so not because they do not believe that \u2014 many do \u2014 but because it would be politically difficult to accept the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal without putting South Korea on equal footing with its own nuclear weapons.\u201cEven if the North has effectively become a nuclear power, acknowledging it as one without South Korea itself going nuclear is politically untenable,\u201d said Paik Hak-soon, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank south of Seoul.At the same time, South Korean leaders are unwilling to accept the view of Ms. Rice\u2019s successor, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who has maintained that \u201cclassical deterrence theory\u201d cannot be applied to the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, given his unpredictable nature and brutal record. Some South Korean analysts fear that such thinking would all but justify starting a war.To South Koreans, the idea that North Korea would fire a nuclear-armed ICBM at the United States without being attacked is absurd. They argue that Mr. Kim knows the United States would retaliate by destroying the North and that they do not regard him as suicidal. Instead, the fear in South Korea is that the North will try to use its nuclear arsenal to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies in the region.In some ways, it is already doing so.At the same time, a common question among South Koreans these days is whether the United States will hesitate to come to their aid after the North demonstrates it can deliver nuclear warheads to American cities.In recent years, the United States has repeatedly sent nuclear-capable strategic bombers over South Korea to signal that its \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d extends over the nation. But some local newspapers have dismissed the flights, likening them to \u201cpolice patrol cars that pass through the neighborhood but never catch the thief.\u201dKim Sung-han, a former vice foreign minister who is a professor at Korea University in Seoul, said the United States and South Korea must discuss new ways to assure the public of America\u2019s commitment to protect it.With public confidence in the United States slipping, recent polls show a majority in South Korea now favor arming the country with nuclear weapons of its own. And last week, the main conservative opposition group, the Liberty Korea Party, formally called on Washington to reintroduce tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from South Korea in the early 1990s. The proposal, though popular, presents the South Korean government with another dilemma: Officials said the presence of nuclear arms in the country would make it far more difficult to persuade the North to give up its own.In the past two decades, Washington has repeatedly tightened sanctions against North Korea. But \u201cthe more they isolated and pressured the North,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, \u201cthe more advanced its nuclear program has become.\u201dMr. Moon has urged a more flexible approach, suggesting that Washington\u2019s past insistence that North Korea commit to nuclear disarmament as a precondition for talks to begin may no longer be realistic. Instead, he has argued that the priority should be a freeze of the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, though he has not been specific about how to achieve that.Mr. Koh, the Dongguk University professor, said the government\u2019s best hope might be to transform North Korea in the long term \u201clike in the old Soviet Union\u201d by encouraging economic liberalization and promoting the flow of information into the isolated nation, including South Korean movies and television dramas.But other analysts warn that may be more wishful thinking. Unlike China and Russia, they note, North Korea shares a peninsula with a neighbor with which its people will always draw direct comparisons. As long as the South remains the more successful Korean state \u2014 its economy is now more than 20 times bigger \u2014 the autocratic government in the North will consider it an existential threat, they argue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morocco\u2019s Stability Is Roiled by Monthslong Protests Over Fishmonger\u2019s Death", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAL HOCEIMA, Morocco \u2014 The house, down a dusty dirt track in a small village near the city of Al Hoceima in northern Morocco, looked dreary outside, with its unpainted facade, but inside the mood was cheery. Friends and family were celebrating the return of a young singer and human rights activist who had just been released from jail.King Mohammed VI pardoned the young woman, Salima Ziani, 23, late last month after his annual speech commemorating his ascension to the throne, which is usually followed by mass pardons.Ms. Ziani had been eating dinner with her three cellmates in Oukacha Prison in Casablanca when she was summoned to the office of the prison warden. The warden gave her a flower and said she was free to return to her hometown, Al Hoceima, in the mountainous Rif region along Morocco\u2019s northern coast.The protesters are seeking to draw attention to government corruption, as well as to the neglect of infrastructure and economic development in the region. Nasser Zefzafi, the leader of the group organizing the protests \u2014 known as Hirak Chaabi, or the Popular Movement \u2014 has been in jail since late May.Ms. Ziani\u2019s joy at her release was quickly tempered by the thought of so many fellow protesters still in prison.\u201cI felt so much happiness, I thought that the Rif was going to go back to normal,\u201d she said in a recent interview.But she added: \u201cI felt so sad that the boys weren\u2019t released. One of the reasons we had been protesting all these months was because we wanted all our brothers who were unjustly arrested to walk free.\u201dWhen the Arab Spring protests toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011, Moroccans also took to the streets. In response, the king pushed for constitutional reforms and ceded some power to the Parliament. The country also enshrined Tamazight, the local Berber tongue, as an official state language in its Constitution.As a result of those relatively modest changes, Morocco had been mostly stable, even while uprising convulsed many countries in the region. But the death of the fishmonger, Mouhcine Fikri, jarred the status quo.Mr. Fikri, 31, was crushed in a garbage compactor as he tried to retrieve his catch, which was confiscated by the police because it contained swordfish that was caught illegally out of season. His death galvanized a public deeply resentful of officials who are seen as heartless, corrupt and ruling over a stagnant economy.The Moroccan government came down hard on the protesters, arresting more than 200, and Human Rights Watch said it had received 43 complaints of torture by the police.\u201cThis is a serious deterioration of the human rights climate in Morocco,\u201d said Ahmed Benchemsi, a spokesman for Human Rights Watch. \u201cEpisodic cases of police abuse and a crackdown on peaceful protests have been documented in the recent past, but not in such a large scale in many years.\u201dAl Hoceima, the cultural capital of the Rif, has long had tense relations with the monarchy. The Berber population in the region waged war against Spain, then Morocco\u2019s colonial ruler, in the 1920s, defeating the Spanish Army and declaring the Rif Republic, which lasted from 1923 to 1926.But the rise and fall of the Rif Republic, the only Berber state in modern history, are \u201cseared in the region\u2019s memory,\u201d Mr. Aidi said.A few years after Morocco gained its independence from France in 1956, Crown Prince Hassan \u2014 the current monarch\u2019s father, who would become King Hassan II in 1961 \u2014 violently crushed a rebellion in the Rif.For decades after that, the central government ignored the region, and tens of thousands of mostly young people left to pursue a better life in Europe and elsewhere.After succeeding his father in 1999, King Mohammed introduced a policy of reconciliation with the Rif, pushing for economic development projects, including tourism, to try to lift the region out of poverty.But that plan never went far, and the eastern part of the Rif has remained economically marginalized, with no industry or universities and an economy that relies heavily on remittances from abroad and cannabis cultivation, Mr. Aidi said. Moroccan officials could address those needs better, he said, rather than resorting to repressive tactics.\u201cThe Moroccan regime\u2019s response has been disproportionate,\u201d he said. \u201cClamping down on peaceful protesters, imprisoning young bloggers and artists, will only harden Riffian nationalism.\u201dThe Moroccan Interior Ministry declined to comment about the accusations of torture and repression of peaceful protesters, and the government\u2019s spokesman did not return requests for comment.During his speech in July, King Mohammed blamed political parties for the Rif unrest, but he did not offer specific solutions to the grievances of the area\u2019s residents.\u201cIf the king of Morocco is not convinced by the way political activity is conducted, and if he does not trust a number of politicians, what are the citizens left with?\u201d he said.In July, the police used tear gas to disperse a protest in Al Hoceima, injuring a demonstrator who fell into a coma and later died.Currently, police blockades surround the city and protests are banned. Police trucks and uniformed officers have taken the place of the carousels, concerts and street entertainments that typically fill Moroccan cities during the summer months. Black flags mark the houses of those jailed during last month\u2019s protests.On Tuesdays, families of the prisoners held in Casablanca gather at night in front of the bus that takes them to the jailhouse 11 hours away for visits.Rachida Kaddouri, 46, a civil servant, has been going to Casablanca every week, sometimes taking her two daughters with her. Her husband, Mohamed Mejjaoui, a teacher, who was arrested in late May, is considered to be one of the leaders of the Hirak movement.Ms. Kaddouri said the solidarity among the prisoners\u2019 families was helping her through the hardship.\u201cWhat is most important is that my husband is released,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He only defended the rights of his countrymen. They could also at least transfer them to a jail closer to us.\u201dSome of the demands of the July protesters have been met. An oncology unit was opened in Al Hoceima, and the government agreed to hire more civil servants. But many believe that the high level of repression will only amplify the unrest.Omghar Fikri, a civil servant and a volunteer who helps the families of prisoners organize their weekly visits, believes there is space for compromise.\u201cWe have to create a conversation,\u201d said Mr. Fikri, who is not related to Mouhcine Fikri, the fish seller. \u201cOne of the deepest roots of the Hirak movement was the bad relationship with the state. There is a political apathy and a complete loss of trust in politicians. And these problems need to be fixed.\u201dMs. Ziani, the released prisoner, who is most commonly known by her artist and Berber name, Silya, has always been a vocal human rights activist. She quit college in October to engage in demonstrations full time, and she has written numerous songs about Mouhcine Fikri and the protests.\u201cWhen I wrote the songs, I cried,\u201d she said. \u201cI expressed myself through my songs. That was my way of expressing my anger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He walked, not drove, hung out on playgrounds, not in restaurants. He got into a lot of fights. He did poorly in school, but he doesn\u2019t remember his teachers seeming surprised. Expectations were low, and he bent to fit them. He slept a lot in class. At 18, he dropped out.Fort Smith has two country clubs, several golf courses, a Talbots and a symphony orchestra. But a proliferation of pawnshops and a circuit court crowded with indigent defendants are reminders of the grinding poverty all around, in the rural areas of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma.For years, those divisions had been etched into the city\u2019s geography. Poorer families lived on the north side of town and wealthier families on the south. Race followed the same pattern, with the south predominantly white and much of the city\u2019s black population in the north.But time has scrambled those old lines. Latinos came here to work in the poultry industry. Pho shops dot the city\u2019s main drag, property of Vietnamese who began arriving as refugees after the fall of Saigon. R & R\u2019s Curry Express serves deliciously spicy North Indian food at a Finish Line gas station.Muslims from different countries came, too \u2014 some to study, some to work in the city\u2019s growing medical industry. Many had money. Hisham Yasin did not.A Palestinian who grew up just outside Damascus in Syria, Hisham sold fruits and vegetables in an outdoor market. He came to the United States in 1996, joining his parents and an older brother. Hisham imagined Beverly Hills, but found himself in western Arkansas in a rotting house with rats and cockroaches. He washed dishes at the Golden Corral. His father collected cans. He and a brother, Abdul Rahman, opened a used-car business. They called it A & H Auto Sales.Today, Hisham lives in a grand house in Fort Smith with sparkling chandeliers on the edge of a thick green forest of oak and pine. He is 49 and has the look of an affable neighborhood baker, with a big belly and a broad smile. He is giving his three children what he calls a \u201cfive-star life\u201d compared with his own, which he says began at \u201cbelow zero.\u201d He follows the news about Syria daily. But Arkansas is his home. He considers the day he came to the United States \u2014 Feb. 11 \u2014 his birthday.Hisham was one of the founders of the mosque that Abraham helped vandalize. They called it Al Salam \u2014 meaning \u201cpeace\u201d in Arabic. Since 2009, it has been in a brick ranch formerly used as a law office. It is on a busy road, South 28th Street, between a library branch and a nursing home. The founders wanted it that way. They thought the Muslims of Fort Smith should be forthright and confident, not hiding somewhere off the beaten path. This, they believed, would gain the community\u2019s trust and respect, maybe even help guard against the noxious stream of negative news about Muslims.The truth was that until the vandalism, few people in Fort Smith knew that Muslims lived in their city.Abraham did. He had gone to high school with Hisham\u2019s older son, Wasim Yasin. They often ate lunch together in the cafeteria. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t easy being Muslim in high school, Wasim said. But around Abraham, it was.\u201cAbraham was a good guy, a \u2018whatever\u2019 kind of guy, he never had any problems with that,\u201d Wasim said. \u201cYou know how people can talk about Muslims. He came up to me and he said: \u2018I\u2019m with you, man. If anybody bothers you, just let me know. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201dMonths passed after the vandalism without contact from the police, and Abraham began to feel relief. He had only helped a friend, he told himself. \u201cMy mind was trying to let me off the hook,\u201d he said.But his dreams were less forgiving. In one, he was walking through a crowd of parents and their children. The children were looking at some writing and crying. \u201cIt was like one of those Scrooge stories,\u201d he said. He could see the children, but they could not see him. He saw their frightened faces and woke up sweating.Now, sitting in the Sebastian County jail, Abraham was not entirely surprised he had ended up here. Expectations for him were so low \u2014 at his church, at school, even in his own mind \u2014 that he sometimes saw the line of his life pointing toward prison.But not like this. Not with swastikas. So Abraham decided to use another piece of paper the jail guard had given him to write to the mosque. He wanted to tell the people there how sorry he was for what he\u2019d done. What, after all, did he have to lose?He sat on the floor of the cell, and placed a yellow sheet of paper on one of the metal seats bolted to the wall. He did not know the mosque\u2019s name. So he copied it, a letter at a time, from his paperwork.\u201cDear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,\u201d he began.The sky was just brightening the morning of Oct. 20 when Hisham pulled into the mosque\u2019s driveway. He liked to do his morning prayers there when he could. The quiet of the early hour was soothing, and he\u2019d been told that praying at the mosque meant more rewards from God. But he had not come to pray this morning. He had sped there in his white Infiniti, carrying his gun, after receiving a distressed phone call from the imam.Al Salam\u2019s members had already been anxious. For months the year before, a man had sent the mosque disturbing emails. \u201cSharia is a cancer that must be eliminated,\u201d the man warned, until someone called the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump was calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Few thought that was possible, but it seemed to loosen some dark impulse in the land.Rolling up to the mosque, Hisham saw the first swastika from the street, spray-painted in black on the bottom left corner of the small curbside sign. It was off-kilter, like a creeping spider.There was more on the building: \u201cGo Home\u201d on the wooden front door, just above a babysitter-wanted sign. On the garage: \u201cWe Don\u2019t Want You Here U.S.A.\u201d And on one of the front windows, among profanities about Islam and Allah, a phrase Hisham did not recognize: \u201cDeus Vult.\u201d It is Latin for \u201cIt is God\u2019s will\u201d \u2014 a medieval rallying cry for the Crusades.Hisham\u2019s heart hurt. He thought about how little the vandals understood. America was the only true home Hisham had ever known. As a Palestinian in Syria he had been stateless. America gave him a country. America gave him a kidney, through a transplant. It gave him the dignity of being able to travel in the world. He still cries when he explains this.\u201cThey never let me go to Dubai,\u201d Hisham said, blowing his nose and wiping his eyes. \u201cThen I went with my American passport, and they stand up straight \u2014 they say, \u2018You\u2019re welcome, Mr. Hisham!\u2019\u201dAt the mosque that morning, Hisham sprang into action like a rescue worker after an earthquake. He called the police. He called the mosque\u2019s board members. He called journalists.By early afternoon, the story was breaking.Then something wonderful happened. The mosque\u2019s phone started ringing, and didn\u2019t stop. Churches called. A synagogue called. Buddhists called. So did residents who had seen the news or simply driven by. One man called, crying. His daughter had seen the graffiti on her way to work and told him about it. He said the vandals could not have been Christians. No true Christian would have done it.Anas Bensalah, a mosque member who had taken the day off to help with the cleanup, told the man that he understood completely: That was exactly how he felt every time there was an attack by the Islamic State.Over the next week, the mosque was snowed under with cards and letters. Some people brought flowers. Most of the letters were from Fort Smith and the surrounding towns, but some were from as far as Reston, Va.Hisham was overjoyed. He kept them, as if they were jewels, in a drawer in his office.The night the mosque was vandalized, Kristin Collins, 45, had been worrying about her white minivan. There was a knocking sound under the hood, and it sometimes lurched unexpectedly. She was afraid the transmission was going, and she could not afford to fix it. Her last job was at a day care center in 2013. She quit after her husband, who had Parkinson\u2019s, began having trouble putting diapers on their 1-year-old. The next year, Kristin learned she had leukemia. She and her husband receive disability insurance \u2014 a total of about $1,700 a month to support them, Kristin\u2019s son Abraham and his younger brothers, Noah Davis and Gabriel Collins.Fixing the van was on a long list of things they couldn\u2019t afford: the $25 monster costume that Gabriel, 4, wanted for Halloween; the several thousand dollars in back rent on their small brick ranch house. Kristin sometimes had to go to church food banks at the end of the month. And she had the sinking feeling she would have to rely on charity for a turkey on Thanksgiving, only a month away.So when Abraham asked to borrow the van, she was reluctant. Kristin loved her son. At 20, he was still more a teenager than a man, with a sparse goatee and \u2014 at 5 feet 11 inches and 139 pounds \u2014 a boyish frame. He was outgoing, loved people and liked to show off his break dancing and singing. She remembers his sweet head, hair dyed green, asleep on her hospital couch during her cancer treatment. But he was also directionless and unemployed, and spent too much time drinking and smoking pot with his friends.Kristin\u2019s boys were so different. Her middle son, Noah, was shy and sensitive but also a striver. He rose many days at 6 a.m. to work at a sandwich shop downtown. He had a girlfriend and a car. Where Noah was determined, Abraham just floated through, escaping into comic books and cartoons.Yet the brothers, only 15 months apart, were extremely close. As kids they played pirates, drinking sweet tea as whiskey on bunk bed boats. Abraham was protective of Noah, a frequent target for bullies with his surgically repaired cleft palate. Abraham was also quick to fight. At 9, he pummeled a boy who had made fun of Noah.Something was lodged in Abraham from the beginning, like a shard of glass in his heel. Kristin says it came from his father, Hud Davis, who grew up in a violent home. He had one real leg and cartoon flames painted on his fake one, the result of stepping on a downed power line. To his friends, he was full of life. At home, he was cruel. Kristin remembers him grabbing her by the neck and slamming her into the laundry-room door.Noah would sit on his toy dump truck and wheel himself backward into the closet to hide during the eruptions. Abraham remembers his father screaming that he would not have had to marry \u201cyour whore mother\u201d if Abraham had not come along.At 5, Abraham said, he got down on his knees in his bedroom and asked God \u201cto take him and save my mom.\u201d When his 33-year-old father died a month later, after a seizure, Abraham believed he was responsible.As he grew older, Abraham had trouble controlling his anger. Hank Needham, the principal of Cavanaugh Elementary in Fort Smith, remembers him as a polite little boy \u2014 but one with an angry streak. He once threw a fit when the school took away his screwdriver, which had belonged to his father.\u201cHe had a big heart and a short fuse, and he\u2019d just start cussing,\u201d Mr. Needham said. \u201cHe had an adult mouth in the second grade.\u201dMr. Needham gained Abraham\u2019s trust, and medication for hyperactivity helped smooth his moods. By the sixth grade, he was an all-star student. His picture still hangs in a hallway promoting good attendance: Abraham, in a yellow sweatshirt, grinning.It didn\u2019t last. By the time he got to Southside High, Abraham had made peace with his place in the social hierarchy. He was, as he put it, \u201cone of the outcasts.\u201d But he was O.K. with that. He did not crave being in the popular crowd, which would have been impossible anyway.He didn\u2019t have money for meals at the mall or the latest phone. He couldn\u2019t afford fashionable sneakers or jeans; Kristin shopped at Goodwill. When Mr. Needham bought sneakers for Abraham one year, he expected the teenager to pick out the most expensive style. He chose a modest pair.\u201cHe said, \u2018Mr. Needham, that is not me,\u2019\u201d the principal remembered. \u201c\u2018That is not who I am.\u2019\u201dAbraham was himself with a small, tight group of friends, which included Craig Wigginton, a tall, intense teenager who lived in a small apartment across town. They bonded over their backgrounds. Craig had spent his early childhood on the carnival circuit with his parents, his father, Rick Wigginton, said. His mother eventually left the family. Last year, when his father was sent to prison for a while, Craig was left alone to care for his younger brother. Abraham helped babysit.Abraham believed Craig was \u201ccollege professor brilliant.\u201d He sometimes walked eight miles across town to see him. But Craig made Kristin nervous. She was driving him and Abraham somewhere once and a woman in a hijab drove by. She remembers Craig pointing out the \u201csand monkey in a Cadillac.\u201d He seemed jealous.Mr. Wigginton said his son never used words like that around him. Craig did not respond to requests for comment for this piece.Craig was the friend Abraham wanted to meet up with the night he asked his mother for the van. Kristin let him take it. It would be four months before she learned what he\u2019d done with it.Fort Smith was on the edge of the United States when it appeared in 1817 as a military outpost in Indian Territory, along what is now the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. A federal judge, Isaac Parker, made the place famous in the 1870s by presiding over one of the most prolific courts in the country. Known as the \u201cHanging Judge,\u201d he sentenced 160 people to death; 79 were executed.Today, Fort Smith is a mix of the South and the West, a peanut butter cup of libertarian and Southern Baptist sensibilities. The Old South still haunts the place: A monument to the first white child born in Fort Smith, erected in 1936, still stands, barely noticed, in a small park behind a beverage distributorship. Southside High\u2019s Dixie fight song was not retired until 2015, and its Johnny Rebel mascot a year later \u2014 and not without a fight.But the New South is here, too. Vibrant murals adorn downtown buildings, including a 100-foot-tall painting of an African-American woman and an Apache man on a grain tower. And while the city had a precipitous decline in manufacturing jobs, its economy is now doing other things.In February, a Milwaukee-based real estate company bought the old Whirlpool building, where thousands of workers made refrigerators. A large \u201cAvailable\u201d sign is now stuck to its facade. Health care and transportation companies have been hiring, particularly people with an education. The city\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than the national average, and its population \u2014 88,000 \u2014 is up since the last census.Fort Smith may have its country clubs, but the city\u2019s residents are largely middle and lower-middle class. Some homes cost more than $1 million, but a typical home is around $113,000.No one knows exactly when the first Muslims immigrated to Fort Smith. Dr. Louay Nassri, a pediatric pulmonologist who is the president of Al Salam Mosque and who came to Fort Smith in 1980, said there was at least one Muslim living here in the early 1970s.Nearly 450 people attended the main Ramadan celebration in June, the closest thing the community has to a census. They are for the most part educated, affluent, integrated. Many are doctors. Others are accountants, business owners, professors and teachers.Hisham remembers when they were just a curiosity.\u201cBefore 9/11, people thought we were Mexican,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d go to Walmart and they\u2019d say, \u2018Como est\u00e1, amigo?\u2019 We were laughing. I said, \u2018Excuse me, I don\u2019t speak Spanish.\u2019 They say, \u2018Where you from?\u2019 I say Palestine. They say, \u2018I never heard about it.\u2019 I say, \u2018I think you hear about Israel, right?\u2019 They say yes. I say, \u2018That\u2019s my homeland.\u2019\u201dEach family adapted in its own way.Dr. Hania Al-Shahrouri, a kidney specialist from Jordan, got used to people staring at her head covering. Wearing a hijab in the United States is as much an act of bravery as it is an act of faith, she said. When she first moved to Fort Smith, a man walked up to her in the grocery store.\u201cIn our religion, we don\u2019t hit our women,\u201d he said. \u201cWe let them wear whatever they want.\u201dTall and confident, with the poise of a ballet dancer, Dr. Al-Shahrouri tells herself that people stare because she is pretty, or because they like the color of her hijab. But she worries that her children, including her 13-year-old daughter, may not be able to summon the same self-confidence. So she wields what weapons she has to protect them: her status as a doctor and her wealth. She drives a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle. She carries an expensive hand bag.She doesn\u2019t like herself for it, but she knows that money commands respect, and in some ways, the Muslims who have it are often spared the bigotry that can bedevil those who do not.Mr. Bensalah understands, too. He came to Fort Smith from Morocco in 2000 to attend college. His first job was as a dishwasher. He fell in love with and married a local woman whose family refused to accept him \u2014 more because of his skin color, he said, though looking back it was also probably his religion.\u201cThey kept telling her, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you marrying your own kind?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhite women were supposed to marry white men.\u201dOn Sept. 25, 2001, his wife was in the hospital for the birth of their first child, and several of her relatives stopped him from entering the building. Standing outside, pleading with them to no avail, was one of the worst experiences of his life, he said. He did not witness the birth of his son. Nor did he tell his mother that he had become a father, fearing she would try to visit.\u201cI saw the power of anger and ignorance,\u201d he said.Determined, Mr. Bensalah wore down his in-laws with wit and generosity. He started with the smokers, standing around and cracking jokes. He bought beer. He went hunting. One day he came home from his job as an accountant to find his wife\u2019s cousin on his couch, and they talked for hours. The man became addicted to drugs, and Mr. Bensalah visited him in the hospital after he overdosed. He brought a Bible. As the man recovered, Mr. Bensalah taught him how to budget. He told him that he was worth something. Now the man lives in Colorado with three kids, a wife, and a good job at a mining company.Out of the worst of America could come the best of America.This is what makes Dr. Al-Shahrouri love the United States fiercely: There may be bigotry, but the system is fair, she said. She remembers entering a kidney transplant ward in 2004 with her medical team in San Antonio and being told to leave by the patient\u2019s wife, who raved that Dr. Al-Shahrouri would kill her husband \u201clike they killed us on 9/11.\u201d The doctor in charge warned the woman that if Dr. Al-Shahrouri wasn\u2019t allowed to treat her husband, no one would. Then the entire medical team walked out.On the night of Feb. 17, nearly four months after the mosque was vandalized, the police came to Abraham\u2019s house with a warrant for his arrest. Noah thought it was a case of mistaken identity. His brother had been in trouble twice before \u2014 once for having pot paraphernalia in his backpack, once for hanging around too late on a playground \u2014 but nothing that had required a $15,000 bond.Abraham wasn\u2019t home, but Noah knew where he was. \u201cDude, the cops came to arrest you,\u201d he said, driving to pick Abraham up in the minivan so that he could turn himself in. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201dLater, when Abraham really thought about it, he saw so many things that had brought him to this point. Too much Kentucky Deluxe. An inescapable feeling of worthlessness. Unquestioning loyalty to his friends.Craig lifted Abraham up. He made him feel good about himself. A history buff, Craig liked to use Hitler as an example, Abraham said.\u201cHe said, \u2018I understand Hitler did bad things, but on the other side of the coin he is the shining example of why no one can ever say that one man can\u2019t change the world,\u2019\u201d Abraham recounted. \u201c\u2018He was just one man from a broken country that was being destroyed by its debts, and he turned it into the most formidable fighting force and almost took over the world.\u2019\u201dAbraham, Craig and another friend, Ezra Pedraza, would sit around in Kristin\u2019s garage, amusing themselves with conspiracy theories and talking about their lives. Ezra went with them on the night of the vandalism.\u201cHe used to tell me and Ezra that we have the power to change the environment around us, too, to do great things and to shape this world,\u201d Abraham said.Abraham understands how the attack on the mosque looks. The swastikas. The reference to the Crusades. Craig\u2019s father said he was horrified at his son\u2019s use of swastikas. Abraham argued that these were intended not as expressions of racism or white power, but merely as the most offensive images they could conjure \u2014 a kind of measure of their manly capacity to shock.Mr. Bensalah said the symbols had their desired effect precisely because they were racist and threatening. Simple insults would not have gotten people\u2019s attention. But swastikas did.\u201cA swastika is a small act of terrorism if you think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, yes, it\u2019s scary.\u201dFor all the regret and penance that the act of vandalism caused Abraham, the decision to commit it took no time at all. The three friends had been drinking and talking about ISIS, he said. Craig was angry about American soldiers being killed, about children dying.And then an impulse: \u201cLet\u2019s retaliate.\u201dThey got into the white van, and Abraham drove to the mosque on South 28th Street. They went to the other mosque in town that night, too, and drew on it as well.Abraham burns with regret now. At their ignorance, for lumping all Muslims together. \u201cThat\u2019s like meeting one racist, and you say all white guys are like him,\u201d he said.At his weakness, for not stopping it: \u201cI wish I could go back in time and say, \u2018Hey, dumbass, I\u2019m the future you, and I\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201dBut he\u2019d done it. And now he was on his way to jail in the passenger seat of his mom\u2019s white van. Noah drove by the house so Abraham could say goodbye. His mother was sobbing in big, deep gulps. He had felt it before, the dead weight of her disappointment. It made him feel disgusting.\u201cShe cried like a woman who had just got broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about that a lot. It\u2019s stuff like that that hurts you while you are in jail. You replay and replay. It\u2019s torture on your mind. Worse than any knife.\u201dIf Abraham had $1,580 for a bail bond, he could have waited for his court date at home. But his family couldn\u2019t get the money together. So he waited in jail.At the Sebastian County Adult Detention Center, a hulking building with window slits like mail slots, he became the third person in a two-man cell with drafty concrete floors and two metal beds sticking out of the wall.Abraham was given a sheet and a thin blue sleeping pad, with a pillow area sewn into one end where the stuffing had been torn out. His skinny body was on high alert. He felt cold a lot. He barely slept the first week.Jail reminded him of high school. The prison guards were like the popular kids, lording their power over everybody else. The days were long and boring. People were constantly sizing each other up. New inmates quickly adapted to a rigid social hierarchy.Pretty much every group was represented. He made friends with a black man who was into Japanese cartoons and a Muslim who showed him the Quran. He had never seen one. The man told Abraham not to bother to look for the part where martyrdom brings 72 virgins. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t there and he knew because he had looked for it himself,\u201d Abraham said, laughing.There were white supremacists of several varieties. One took an interest in Abraham after learning that he had vandalized the mosque, even offered him a tattoo. Abraham told Noah later that he had said no.It took a month and several upsetting tangles with a confusing appointment system for Kristin to arrange her first visit with Abraham in jail. When she finally saw his face behind the glass, she started to cry. He did, too. Recounting this scene later, he raised his two hands to his cheeks and said, \u201cTwo rivers.\u201dThe telephone for talking through the glass barely worked. They laughed about it. Abraham\u2019s mouth moved, but the sound came out delayed, or not at all, like an old kung fu movie. Kristin and Noah visited every Saturday after that.Abraham had spent his entire life trying to become strong enough to protect his family, but it was not until jail, he said, that he realized that he was the one who had inflicted the most hurt. He felt a powerful urge to set things right.The letter to the mosque, he said, was a first step.\u201cI was just so tired of doing the wrong thing,\u201d he said.He was terrified of going to prison. But his fate was out of his hands. And, anyway, the truth was out: The mosque\u2019s security camera had captured the act.Abraham did not know the mosque\u2019s address, so he mailed it to his mother, with a small note asking her to deliver it. The postmark was Feb. 22.\u201cDear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,\u201d Abraham wrote. \u201cI know you guys probably don\u2019t want to hear from me at all but I really want to get this to y\u2019all. I\u2019m so sorry about having a hand in vandalising your mosque. It was wrong and y\u2019all did not deserve to have that done to you. I hurt y\u2019all and I am haunted by it. And even after all this you still forgave me. You are much better people than I.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me, and that is honestly really scary. But I just wouldn\u2019t want to keep going on without trying to make amends. I wish I could undo the pain I helped to cause. I used to walk by your mosque a lot and ask myself why I would do that. I don\u2019t even hate Muslims. Or anyone for that matter.\u201cAll in all,\u201d he concluded, \u201cI just want to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201dNoah drove the letter to the mosque on a Friday. He took off his shoes as a sign of respect and introduced himself. Dr. Nassri was moved. No one had expected to hear from the vandals. Certainly not like this.Dr. Nassri called a meeting of senior members of the mosque. Hisham was there. So was Mr. Bensalah, the accountant from Morocco.The sermon had just reminded them of their duty as Muslims to forgive. It didn\u2019t take them long to do it.\u201cIf one of my kids did something stupid like that I would want them to be forgiven,\u201d Mr. Bensalah said.Later, when Dr. Nassri met with a man from the prosecutor\u2019s office, he made clear that the mosque did not want to press charges and strongly opposed a felony charge for Abraham.\u201cWe did not want this to destroy his life,\u201d Dr. Nassri said.The long wooden benches in the gallery of Courtroom 201 were already packed on May 24, the day of Abraham\u2019s hearing. Nearly everyone was white. Most of the defendants were poor.The morning unfolded in a relentless stream of misery over crimes like drug possession and writing bad checks.Kristin and Noah walked in at 9 a.m. sharp. Noah, in his best jeans and plaid shirt, sat with his chin in his hands. Kristin kept nervously shifting in her seat. Hisham walked in, wearing jeans and an electric-lime shirt. He wedged himself in next to Kristin, but had no idea who she was.Abraham\u2019s case had taken an unexpected turn.Dr. Nassri had gone to meet the prosecutors again. They had bad news: Abraham would have to plead guilty to a felony, not a mere misdemeanor, or face a trial. He would avoid prison, but only if he remained on good behavior for three years. Any minor violation could land him behind bars for six years. The best outcome he could hope for would be to get a judge to seal his record \u2014 in eight years.Dr. Nassri was taken aback. \u201cI said, \u2018You guys are asking for more than we want,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey call us the victims, and the victims say, \u2018Hey, guys, loosen up!\u2019\u201dBut the prosecutors were unmoved. Daniel Shue, the head prosecuting attorney, said that actions had consequences and that all three men had participated. And this was not just a run-of-the-mill vandalism, it was an act of bigotry.The mosque\u2019s camera had captured Craig in the act of writing, and his punishment was steepest. The prosecutor said that there was no clear proof that either of the other two had done any writing but that no one could know without a trial.The law was straightforward: If the spray painting and other vandalism cost the mosque more than $1,000 to repair, the case was a felony. Anything equal or less than that was a misdemeanor. Dr. Nassri submitted paperwork showing the mosque had spent only $500 on cleanup. But the prosecutor\u2019s office sought its own estimate from a local restoration company, which claimed the damage would cost about $1,800 to clean up.Abraham\u2019s public defender told him that they could attack that evidence at trial. But Abraham wanted to get out of jail.Around 11:15 a.m., he shuffled into the courtroom through a side door in an orange jump suit and leg irons. Craig was with him. Ezra Pedraza, who had been out on bail, wore a plaid shirt and jeans.The prosecutor noted that the victims \u201casked for mercy and leniency.\u201dThe judge looked out at the defendants. \u201cMercy. Hmmm.\u201dHe accepted their pleas. Then he lectured them.\u201cIf the victims in this case had not approved of this, I would not have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would have gone to trial, and there is a good chance all three of you would have gone to prison. So you need to think twice before you do something, which is just stupid. What you did was just stupid.\u201dKristin, losing patience, said under her breath: \u201cThank you. Point taken.\u201dIt is summer in Fort Smith. The sun is searing. On Hisham\u2019s car lot, small fruit trees and vegetables grow in dirt-filled kiddie swimming pools. He is already harvesting figs and hot peppers, as well as Syrian thyme and mint that he uses to flavor his visitors\u2019 tea.Hisham believes the vandalism of his mosque was one of the best things to happen to the Muslims of Fort Smith. The crime allowed them to reveal themselves \u2014 to say, \u201cWe are your doctors, your accountants and your used-car salesmen.\u201d They now have a relationship with the synagogue in town. Several members, including Dr. Al-Shahrouri, the kidney specialist, have begun speaking to local audiences about Islam.Hisham was reminded of a saying from the Quran.\u201cYou might hate something that happens to you, but actually it\u2019s excellent for you,\u201d he said, sitting in his small, cluttered shop, surrounded by artifacts of his life: a revolving display of birthday key chains, a giant dried bean pod the size of an arm, an Elvis belt buckle and two plaques he got in the mail after he donated to a Sept. 11 fund. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to us: Something very bad. But very good result.\u201dBut Hisham also doesn\u2019t like how hard it is to get a second chance in America. You can do a stupid thing and pay for it, but afterward no one will hire you. Hisham has helped two men in this situation. They do odd jobs at his car lot. He went to court with them when no one else would. He helped one buy a washing machine, and paid for the other to bury a relative.\u201cSomeone messes up and it sticks with him all his life,\u201d Hisham said. \u201cEven if he tries to become a good man, the community say to him, \u2018You are a bad man!\u2019 They encourage him to be a bad man.\u201dFor Abraham, jail became a dividing line between the mistakes of his past and some unknown future.When Noah first saw his brother after he was released, Abraham was standing alone outside the jail, holding an envelope and a Bible. Noah parked the car and jumped out without shutting his door, sprinting across the street to embrace him.Back at home, Abraham\u2019s family gathered around him in the driveway, laughing and talking. The night was warm, and the stars were out. Gabriel was ecstatic, hopping up and down.\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed,\u201d Abraham said, looking at the sky.Kristin wanted to sing a song with her son: \u201cFind Your Wings,\u201d by the Christian singer Mark Harris. They sang, haltingly and softly, in harmony:\u201cThat\u2019s my boy,\u201d Kristin said, beaming at Abraham. \u201cThat\u2019s my baby boy.\u201dBut he was now a felon, and there were daily reminders of that. A police car regularly circled their block. He had community service to perform, and within a few days he was sorting donations at a Goodwill store.He owed about $3,200 in fines and restitution, but landing a job would be harder now. Kristin found about 20 employers in Fort Smith that hired felons. Abraham wanted to fill out paper applications but was told to apply online. He did not have a computer, which meant he had to go to the library whenever he needed one.His family\u2019s finances had not improved while he was away. The day he started at Goodwill, the water was cut off at the house and the phone was about to be disconnected.He felt embarrassed to tell people what he had done, like the manager at Goodwill, who recognized Abraham from when he used to come in as a boy. But he would feel better afterward, as if confessing was helping him grow some stub of a new self.It was a daily struggle. \u201cI wake up and look in the mirror and I just think, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d Abraham said.He wanted badly to visit the mosque, to say hello and thank the people there. Dr. Nassri had asked the prosecutor to allow Abraham to come, but was told no. Mr. Bensalah suggested meeting Abraham in a cafe, but the public defender advised against it.After he got out of jail, Abraham posted a note on Facebook.\u201cWell, I\u2019m home now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI just want to say thank you to all those who have been supporting me and a big thanks to the guys at the mosque who have been supportive and helpful and I pray blessings over them.\u201dThe next day, he saw a response from Wasim, Hisham\u2019s son.\u201cBro move on with life we forgave you from the first time you apologized don\u2019t let that mistake bring you down,\u201d he had written. And then, Abraham\u2019s favorite line: \u201cI speak for the whole Muslim community of fort smith we love you and want you to be the best example in life we don\u2019t hold grudges against anybody!\u201dIt was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Exasperation and Australian Humor", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 22_____In my case, I often feel as though I never see the United States quite so clearly as I do when I\u2019ve just returned after a long time away, which was the case last week. I was home for a wedding, a bit of work and a little vacation, and at every stop, I found myself marveling at the sheer American-ness of conversations and experiences.Americans Are ExhaustedLove him or hate him, Donald Trump seems to be wearing people out.Many of the journalists I talked to seemed spent, tired from covering a country that seems to convulse again and again, with each passing week. And among voters on opposite sides of the Trump divide, I heard a lot of exasperation and not a whole lot of understanding.A few Trump critics I saw at my friend\u2019s wedding chewed over every speech and every new development after the Charlottesville protests; others seemed to have less capacity for continuous outrage, offering little more than an \u201cI know\u201d and a shake of the head, asking how anyone could see any Trump as a positive force.Meanwhile, Trump supporters I know chose not to engage. One of my brothers, a Trump voter, said he\u2019d expected chaos given that Trump is taking on a broken system. During a long car ride, he told me he figured the news coverage of Charlottesville would just be more of the same, from more of the people who want Trump gone. He never even watched Trump\u2019s controversial speeches (though he may have now after I insisted he watch the raw clips).What I sensed in that conversation and many others was less a desire to find middle ground than a craving for calm, in a country drowning in political adrenaline.Empowered, for Good and IllOn a subway train in Manhattan last week, a petite Asian woman with a thick accent scolded me for not noticing that there was a pregnant woman near the doors who needed a seat.I quickly got up, effusive with apology. Then I thought: Would that exchange have happened in Sydney?There was no denying that the woman felt empowered. Once I stood, she started talking to me \u2014 loudly \u2014 about all the other men in the subway car who had been there longer and seen the mother-to-be and stayed seated. And what could be more American than that?Australians often remark on the American love affair with individual rights over the collective (it\u2019s what explains American gun laws, they correctly note), and on my trip home, I again saw how much of American life continues to be shaped by that individualist ethos.Yes, it drives politics. The American propensity for self-empowerment fuels both the white nationalist and anti-racist counter-protester.But what I found equally striking during this last trip was the degree to which it governs smaller, more intimate interactions. Americans call each other out, often. There\u2019s a comfort with inquiry and confrontation that, coming from another country, seems peculiar \u2014 or so it did to me.Efficiency or BustThis is a more minor point, but wow, the United States \u2014 or rather New York \u2014 sure does strive for maximum efficiency.I almost forgot what it was like to get dirty looks for walking too slowly on Manhattan sidewalks. I found it odd that at wine stores, restaurants and cafes the staff eagerly attended to my every need, delivering quick, friendly service, consistently.I won\u2019t delve into the possible reasons (yes, there are many, and I\u2019m not concluding which country\u2019s service economy is better or worse overall) but here\u2019s what hit me at one point: Sydneysiders are competitive about anything having to do with sports. New Yorkers are competitive with customer care.In the meantime, check out another batch of New York Times stories you might have otherwise missed below, plus a roundup of your responses to my last newsletter (especially on the question of whether Australians are quicker to joke than self-reflect).______________________________Here\u2019s a sampling, lightly edited for space and clarity. Thanks to all who contributed.It\u2019s been a revelation to me elsewhere to see women accused of being highly emotional or crying at work, because Australian girls learn very early on not to cry. The penalty for crying at school or being over emotional is quite severe.That friendly attitude can become a coded form of attack with which to shut out people, or shut down difficult conversations (particularly those that are critical of the dominant culture). The compulsion to be blokey and tough, to let everything slide off your back for better or worse, dismisses an individual\u2019s experience and opinion. It also allows people to brush off horrible behaviour with the excuse of \u201cjust having a laugh,\u201d expecting others to buck up and move on.Watching from a distance, these lesser aspects of Aussie nature seem to be playing out horrifically in our current politics.\u2014 Tenille BonoguoreIn my experience, this just doesn\u2019t happen with Australians. If the topic strays into serious territory, everyone needs to be smiling and joking. As soon as the smiles disappear, someone will crack a joke and change the topic.I think Damien\u2019s observations are spot on \u2014 we are a friendly people (we prioritize fun and laughter) but that\u2019s mixed in with a touch of anti-intellectualism (because we don\u2019t like tall poppies). Personally, I find this both an endearing and incredibly frustrating aspect of our culture.\u2014 Marleena ForwardIt often surprised my companions when I explained that I found no humour in the statements. I was obliged with, \u201cYou Americans are so politically correct.\u201d I think some of us are somewhat more socially aware and slightly more socially responsible.\u2014 Sydnye AllenMany people protest all of these aspects of modern Australia in different ways, through art, plays, novels, movies, petitions, protests.\u2014 Gabrielle Herderschee-Hunter\u2014 Tim ElliottAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Books That Can Help Explain the Crisis in Venezuela", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNewsbookAs conflict in Venezuela intensifies and a recently elected constituent assembly prepares to rewrite the country\u2019s constitution, here are three books that offer essential background and one vision for a way forward.To understand the landscape of Venezuelan politics, one must first understand the role of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who was known in the United States as the George Washington of South America for liberating Venezuela and much of the continent in the 1800s. Though progressive in many regards \u2014 for instance, he called for the abolition of slavery in 1816 \u2014 his vision was not of a democratic state. Instead, he insisted that the racial diversity in the region necessitated an \u201cinfinitely firm hand,\u201d which in his view meant uniting the newly independent countries into one grand Latin American federation and implementing a presidency-for-life system, naming himself the \u201cLiberator and Dictator.\u201d These ideas lost him the support of the United States and inspired an assassination attempt by a group of his own associates. Bol\u00edvar\u2019s political and military exploits are recounted in this entertaining volume.Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ruled Venezuela for 14 years, from 1999 to 2013, won over the masses by promising what Rory Carroll describes as a \u201cBolivarian revolution, a self-styled radical effort to transform state and society into a vision worthy of Bol\u00edvar, a beacon of democracy, socialism and enlightenment.\u201d At first, he seemed successful; he used the country\u2019s wealth from oil revenue to fund programs that advanced social causes. But after a few years, Ch\u00e1vez became frustrated with the slow pace of democracy, and opted for more expedient but corrupt means. He intimidated government ministers and provided irresponsible, unsustainable handouts to Venezuela\u2019s poor. In this posthumous biography, Carroll, who covered Venezuela for The Guardian for six years, explains why Ch\u00e1vez kept getting re-elected, arguing that the self-proclaimed savior of Venezuela was a master \u201cillusionist\u201d who manipulated the country\u2019s citizens and news media to dismantle its democracy and create \u201ca laboratory of power and charisma that veered between hope, dread and farce.\u201dThe farce has not held up since Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death in 2013. As a country that makes most of its money from oil, Venezuela is highly susceptible to the ups and downs of that market. In this book, Ra\u00fal Gallegos, a former Caracas-based correspondent, explains how mismanagement of this revenue by the government over the last century has caused the current crisis. When oil prices went down, it became clear that the country did not have the money or manufacturing infrastructure to provide basic necessities; goods such as milk, sugar and toilet paper started to disappear from the shelves. Gallegos provides crucial background for the country\u2019s present situation, and also offers a solution for fixing the country\u2019s economy and helping it re-enter the global energy industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Louise Linton Goes From the Lap of Luxury to the Center of a Social Media Storm", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As anyone associated with the Trump administration knows, it only takes one outburst \u2014 a few haphazard emojis here, a call to The New Yorker there \u2014 to cement a new reputation. This week, in the time it took her to type out an Instagram screed, Louise Linton transformed herself from the Treasury secretary\u2019s wife to a Real Housewife of the Treasury.She zipped around on a speedboat in an Italian lake. She sipped wine at a restaurant overlooking the Louvre. She lounged in a very nice-looking pool with a very nice-looking giant inflatable swan, a tiny Chihuahua nestled in her arms.Along the way, Ms. Linton tagged and touted a parade of designers. \u201c#TomFord.\u201d \u201c#Valentinorockstudheels.\u201d \u201c#HermesScarf.\u201dThe debacle started after Ms. Linton took a day trip to Kentucky with Mr. Mnuchin and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Ms. Linton, a spun-sugar blond who cuts an over-the-top glamorous figure in Washington, posted an Instagram photo of herself, Hermes bag on one arm and a Hermes scarf on the other, disembarking from a government jet. Her message contained praise for Kentucky: \u201c#nicest #people #beautiful,\u201d she wrote in Trumpian, hash-tagged prose.As happens on social media, a stranger rained on Ms. Linton\u2019s photo op by posting a mean comment.\u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable,\u201d Jenni Miller, a 45-year-old mother of three who lives in Oregon, wrote under the photograph.Ms. Linton\u2019s response was not quite as rose-colored as her original photo caption had been.\u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?\u201d Ms. Linton wrote.She wasn\u2019t done.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u2018trip\u2019 than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.\u201dAnd then, Ms. Linton, fresh from a European vacation punctuated by rides at SoulCycle and trips to the Hamptons, delivered a blow to the offending commoner: \u201cYou\u2019re adorably out of touch.\u201d\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t made her account private, I would have written back with a very snide Marie Antoinette joke,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Ms. Linton is not the first woman associated with Mr. Trump to earn a comparison to Marie Antoinette. As protests erupted around the country over her father\u2019s proposed travel ban in January, an Instagram photo of Ivanka Trump wearing a silver dress was quickly dubbed the \u201clet them eat cake\u201d photograph. Ms. Linton also is not the only woman in the president\u2019s orbit who is dripping in diamonds and draped in Chanel.But she is the first to be bluntly unapologetic about her luxurious lifestyle, one that affords her a comfortable, swan-shaped perch to view the country\u2019s infighting.The other difference, of course, is that Ms. Linton is not a White House official, nor an elected one. She is an actress whose most recent work includes a role as a character named Betty on a 2016 movie called \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201d She often shares photos of her past roles on Instagram. In July, she shared an image of a 2007 \u201cCSI: NY\u201d appearance. Her character in that episode was dressed as Marie Antoinette.When in Washington, Ms. Linton said that she and Mr. Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a former Hollywood film financier, enjoy exploring the city. \u201cDC Architecture reminds me of the architecture in Edinburgh where I was raised,\u201d she wrote in an email in June.The pair are often spotted dining at Cafe Milano or the Trump International Hotel, where in late July they had dinner with the president. Ms. Linton has readily found her place in a circle of distinctly Washington socialites, including Amy Baier, the wife of Bret Baier, the Fox News host, and Abeer Al Otaiba, the wife of Yousef al-Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador.But the scrutiny over their lifestyle follows them. Even on day trips.A Treasury Department official said that the Mnuchins had, in fact, reimbursed the government for the Kentucky trip. And Ms. Linton\u2019s label-loving shout-out was not rewarded with free products or compensation, at least not in the case of her \u201c#valentinorockstudheels\u201d and \u201c#valentino\u201d tags, a spokeswoman for the brand said in an email on Tuesday.Hours later, Ms. Linton did something rare for someone associated with Trump administration: She said she was sorry.\u201cI apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response,\u201d Ms. Linton said in a statement relayed through her publicist. \u201cIt was inappropriate and highly insensitive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Buhari Returns to Nigeria, Facing Serious Challenges", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Throngs of cheering people lined a freeway in Abuja, Nigeria, over the weekend to welcome a countryman who has spent much of 2017 overseas: the president.With the president abroad and little information available about his condition, some old wounds in the country have begun to reopen.\u201cI am so glad to be home,\u201d Mr. Buhari said in an address on Monday.Fights between nomadic herdsmen and farmers in the middle of the country have left hundreds dead. A spate of kidnappings for ransom has plagued some parts of the country. Some of the president\u2019s political opponents have called for secession.Much of Mr. Buhari\u2019s short speech on Monday seemed directed at those rivals, some of whom engaged in a bloody civil war decades ago to create an independent republic of Biafra in the southeast. The president singled out foes who \u201chave crossed our national red lines by daring to question our collective existence as a nation. This is a step too far.\u201d\u201cNigeria\u2019s unity is settled and not negotiable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shall not allow irresponsible elements to start trouble, and when things get bad they run away and saddle others with the responsibility of bringing back order, if necessary with their blood.\u201d\u201cThe recovery and the recuperation of the president is in some sense symbolic of the recovery of Nigeria,\u201d Mr. Osinbajo said on Saturday.In his speech on Monday, Mr. Buhari made only passing reference to the economy, now in recession. He seemed more focused on calming political disputes that had festered while he was away.Concerns about the president\u2019s health have prompted early speculation about the ticket for his party, the All Progressive Congress, in a presidential election set for 2019. In Nigeria, informal agreements call for the presidency to alternate after two terms between a candidate from the predominantly Muslim north and one from the Christian south. Under the terms of the Constitution, if Mr. Buhari, a northerner, were to leave office early, Mr. Osinbajo, a southerner, would take over until the 2019 election. But disputes could escalate if northerners argue their term was cut short.While managing the political jockeying, Mr. Buhari must also face a war against Boko Haram that worsened in his absence. After months of losing territory, the militant group has staged regular suicide bombings in markets and camps for displaced people, and attacks against soldiers and military convoys.Mr. Buhari vowed to escalate the campaign against Boko Haram.\u201cWe are going to reinforce and reinvigorate the fight not only against elements of Boko Haram which are attempting a new series of attacks on soft targets,\u201d he said, but also \u201ckidnappings, farmers versus herdsmen clashes in addition to ethnic violence fueled by political mischief makers. We shall tackle them all.\u201dIn particular, Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said it had traced nearly half a billion dollars\u2019 worth of real estate and cash from Diezani Alison-Madueke, the oil minister under the previous administration. Much of the property, which includes penthouses, a 13-bedroom home and entire apartment buildings, had been bought through shell companies, the commission said.But the president has yet to fix the nation\u2019s crumbling roads and other infrastructure, or to curb power outages that make life miserable for those who do not have expensive generators. He must also try to calm frustrations in the oil-rich south, where residents have insisted for years that their impoverished communities do not receive a fair share of oil revenue.The president\u2019s long absences fueled grass-roots protests calling on him to return to work or resign. Last week, some demonstrators in Abuja were attacked.Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa, an entertainer who is the movement\u2019s leader, said his group of no more than a dozen had been outnumbered and that some protesters had been injured.\u201cIt was like trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer,\u201d he said.It was unclear who the aggressors were \u2014 some blamed thugs from a nearby market, others blamed the president\u2019s supporters. Mr. Oputa said the aggressors were police officers armed with dogs, water cannons and tear gas.Rights activists denounced the violence, saying it was a sign of the palpable anxiety in the nation.\u201cThat attack should be condemned by any right-thinking Nigerian,\u201d said Richard Akinnola, chairman of the Center for Free Speech in Lagos. \u201cWe can disagree on our positions without resorting to violence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Human Rights Chief Condemns Trump\u2019s Attacks on Media", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that President Trump\u2019s repeated denunciations of some media outlets as \u201cfake news\u201d could amount to incitement to violence and had potentially dangerous consequences outside the United States.The rebuke by Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, at a news conference in Geneva was an unusually forceful criticism of a head of state by a United Nations official.In Phoenix, the president\u2019s words also appeared to whip up audience hostility toward journalists.\u201cIt\u2019s really quite amazing when you think that freedom of the press, not only a cornerstone of the Constitution but very much something the United States defended over the years, is now itself under attack from the president himself,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stunning turnaround.\u201dAsked for comment, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in an emailed statement, \u201cWe believe in free press and think it is an important part of our democracy, but the press also has a big responsibility to the American people to be truthful. Their job is to report the news, not create it.\u201cIs it not \u2018dangerous\u2019 for the media,\u201d she continued, \u201cto create false narratives and overzealous attacks against the president that the American people chose to be their leader? The president is focused on growing our economy, creating jobs, securing our border and protecting Americans. Since those are also the priorities of most Americans, hopefully the media will make covering them theirs.\u201dIn an attempt to deflect criticism that he had stoked racial divisions by failing to unequivocally condemn the actions of neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville as racist, Mr. Trump had accused the news media of giving a platform to hate groups.He singled out by name The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post.Mr. al-Hussein said that the violence in Charlottesville was \u201can abomination.\u201d The Nazi salutes, the display of swastikas and the anti-Semitic chants had no place in the United States or anywhere else, he said.\u201cTo call these news organizations fake does tremendous damage,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein added. \u201cI believe it could amount to incitement. At an enormous rally, referring to journalists as very, very bad people \u2014 you don\u2019t have to stretch the imagination to see then what could happen to journalists.\u201dBefore the presidential election, Mr. al-Hussein had warned that Mr. Trump could be a danger to international stability, but on Wednesday, at a news conference to discuss Venezuela, the human rights chief focused mainly on more recent domestic events.Mr. al-Hussein said the president\u2019s demonization of the news media was \u201cpoisonous because it has consequences elsewhere.\u201d If a journalist were to be harmed, he asked, \u201cdoes the president not bear responsibility for this, for having fanned this?\u201dCountries that did not recognize the essential role of the news media could be inspired if journalists in the United States were attacked, he said. He noted that Cambodia\u2019s government, for example, had withdrawn licenses from the news media and it had cited Mr. Trump as an inspiration for doing so.Mr. al-Hussein also condemned the president\u2019s comments regarding Muslims, minorities and transgender people as \u201cgrossly irresponsible.\u201d\u201cIt emboldens those who think similarly to sharpen their assaults on these communities,\u201d he said.The number of anti-Semitic attacks in the United States in the first three months of this year was 86 percent higher than in the same period last year, he said, citing figures from the Anti-Defamation League.Mr. al-Hussein compared Mr. Trump to a bus driver \u201ccareening down a mountain path.\u201d From a human rights perspective, he said, \u201cit seems to be reckless driving.\u201dGlenn Thrush contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Sends Labour Back to Class", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Whatever else it may have been, the Brexit vote was a working-class revolt. Britain\u2019s two main political parties, Conservative and Labour, are still grappling with that fact. So far, it has created more problems than opportunities for both, but especially for Labour.At the core of this strongly pro-Brexit group are workers who have enough to get by, and so something to lose, but not enough to get ahead. They are sandwiched between the unemployed on welfare and their more affluent employers; they see themselves as aspirational, but their reality is to belong to the squeezed middle.The so-called Essex Man, an approximate equivalent of the Reagan Democrat, wanted to get ahead economically \u2014 purchasing shares in newly privatized utilities and buying his own home, a \u201ccouncil house\u201d that had formerly belonged to the public housing stock. Such workers also shared Margaret Thatcher\u2019s social conservatism on the virtues of owning property, immigration, Europe, patriotism and crime.How can they be won back?For those Labour Remainers, this means reconciling with Brexit and giving up on the liberal internationalist aims of a united Europe and open borders. That is the price for remaining electorally relevant and trying to reverse the trend of Labour\u2019s loss of three elections in a row and its failure to win a parliamentary majority in 12 years. In the long run, it will enable Labour to be a player in the battle over Britain\u2019s future, instead of merely a spectator.The alternative is for Labour to turn up the volume of its attacks on Brexit.

{"Headline": "Hurricane to Cost Tens of Billions, but a Quick Recovery Is Expected", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut economists say the region is likely to recover quickly and may even experience a bump in growth from rebuilding.The area has a large and growing population and attracts continuous investment in oil-related manufacturing. It is also an important cog in global trade. Texas accounts for about half of petroleum and gas exports, along with about a fifth of chemical exports.\u201cThe economic damage will be moderate, with disruptions to the heart of the nation\u2019s refinery and petrochemical industries in August and September,\u201d said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank.Texas is often thought of as a center of oil production, but the Houston area and the nearby Gulf Coast is where much of that black gold is turned into refined products like gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and other distillates.Mr. Dye said the Texas Gulf coast was home to about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s refining capacity, with about half of that now shuttered by the storm.Maps and animated satellite imagery show the scale and reach of the storm.On the other hand, crude oil prices fell as traders anticipated that demand would fall, with fewer refineries open and able to take delivery of the crude.\u201cIt may take weeks for refineries to repair and replace damaged equipment,\u201d Mr. Dye said. \u201cPort facilities have also been damaged, and this may result in an export bottleneck.\u201dIndeed, with the Port of Houston and Corpus Christi\u2019s smaller port directly in the storm\u2019s path, a key logistics hub for the south-central United States is set to be out of commission for days, if not weeks.Nearly half of the exports from Houston consist of resins, plastics, chemicals and minerals, reflecting the concentration of the nation\u2019s petrochemical industry on the Gulf Coast. Major imports flowing through the port include food, construction materials, machinery and retail consumer goods.Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said that although Hurricane Harvey\u2019s impact on national gross domestic product in the third quarter might be fairly neutral, \u201cthe lagged effects of rebuilding homes and replacing motor vehicles can lost longer,\u201d providing a lift to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter and beyond.On the other hand, an extended rise in gasoline prices could have a more immediate effect. Each 10-cent rise in the price of gasoline is equivalent to a $10 billion tax on consumers, Ms. Zentner said, so \u201cshould higher prices be sustained, it would rob other categories of spending as dollars are diverted to filling tanks.\u201dSimilarly, a lengthy outage at petrochemical facilities that produce the raw materials for plastic, like polyethylene, could also raise prices for a range of goods, including toys, garbage bags and PVC pipe.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to cause some dislocations in the wholesale market for plastics components,\u201d said Chris Lafakis, director at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThis is a huge hub for petrochemicals.\u201dThe economic impact of the storm will not be clear with any degree of accuracy for a while. But given Houston\u2019s commercial importance \u2014 and its perch along a well-trod hurricane zone \u2014 economists and others have long taken it for granted that an epic storm would hit the region eventually, so have a head start on the numbers.About two years ago, Ray Perryman, the head of an economic analysis firm, looked at the hypothetical economic damage that would be wrought if storms of various sizes and magnitudes hit coastal Texas. The estimates ranged from around $11 billion to $80 billion \u2014 and the earliest estimates suggest this disaster will be on the upper end of that range.Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that the damage will be $40 billion to $50 billion. The first and smaller set of losses \u2014 less than $10 billion \u2014 will come from things that do not happen: homes not purchased, sales not closed, gas not bought or shipped. The second and larger set of losses, totaling tens of billions, will come from property damage.\u201cThings are too preliminary to know at this point, but I would expect Harvey to be one of the two most costly in history when all is said and done,\u201d said Mr. Perryman, chief executive of the Perryman Group of Waco, Tex.The damage, while serious and expensive, is likely to be a fraction of the $130 billion in damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. Katrina was one of the worst disasters in American history, and the final toll, human and economic, was staggering. When the levees broke, flooding was sudden and immediate and eventually killed close to 2,000 people.The flooding from Harvey appears to be spread over a bigger area that had more time to mobilize, suggesting that the number of deaths will be far lower, Mr. Perryman said. Hurricane Katrina appeared to have had a greater impact on oil production and refining.The Gulf Coast of Texas is also more prosperous and populous than New Orleans. And despite wobbly oil prices, local job growth has accelerated, along with continued improvement in home sales and construction. The number of Texas oil rigs has been rising over the past year, giving a big lift to exploration and chemical manufacturing jobs.So far, the storm seems to have damaged things that can be replenished or replaced relatively quickly. Houston has huge amounts of economic assets that appear to be largely undamaged and are unlikely to be offline for much time.Moreover, factories and refineries are rarely running at full capacity, and as they come back online, they can ramp up production to meet the backlogs that accrue. \u201cBusinesses have stockpiles and the ability to catch up,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm.As the floodwaters drain away and Texas shifts to clean-up mode, followed by a mammoth effort to replace what was lost, the daily modes of commerce will shift but not stop. Disruptions, displacement and property damage are quickly followed by federal aid and insurance checks.\u201cThis is going to be disruptive, but the Houston economy will overcome it very quickly, just like other regions,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.In fact, when natural disasters do show up in economic data, it is usually as a small growth bump a few months after the storm, when rebuilding accelerates and insurance checks are cut.An earlier version of this article incorrectly rendered the surname of a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute.

{"Headline": "As Washington Tries to Protect Tech, China Could Fight Back", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration moves to take on China over intellectual property, Washington will find it has limited firepower. Beijing has a strong grip on American technology companies, and global trade rules could favor China.But China can play a strong defense. The country has broad latitude, under special rules it negotiated with the World Trade Organization, to maintain restrictions within its market.\u201cThe problem is that U.S. trade negotiators agreed to provisions allowing China to limit market access for U.S. companies unless they engaged in joint ventures,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which Congress created to monitor the relationship between the two countries.\u201cPotential Chinese partners demand the family jewels,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies can say no, but too many give in to Chinese pressure to make a quick buck.\u201dThe current trade frictions trace back to the Clinton administration.When China was entering the W.T.O. in 1999 and 2000, American negotiators gave Beijing some leeway, a position later supported by the administration of George W. Bush. As a developing country, China was allowed extra protections, such as requirements that companies in critical industries work with Chinese partners. China, in return, promised to shed the extra rules gradually as its economy matured.But Beijing did not open up, even as China evolved into an economic powerhouse. Quite the opposite has happened under President Xi Jinping, who has pursued a more nationalistic agenda than his reform-minded predecessors.China now sees the technology sector as a critical piece of its industrial policy \u2014 a policy that Beijing is aggressively enlisting American tech giants to support and that the leadership will most likely go all out to protect.Beijing\u2019s demands have been partly driven by security concerns, particularly after disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, of electronic spying by the United States on China\u2019s rapid military buildup.China has also been explicit about its economic motives, seeking to dominate fast-growing global industries that could create millions of well-paid jobs for a generation of increasingly well-educated young Chinese.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.In several cases, China\u2019s strategy to control technology approaches the kind of oversight most countries reserve for industries serving the military or government.In the chip sector, a major initiative intended to lift Chinese capabilities has drafted America\u2019s biggest makers of the electronic brains that run everything from smartphones to driverless cars. Over the past four years, America\u2019s largest chip companies have entered into a dizzying network of partnerships unlike anything they have anywhere else.Qualcomm works with a company in southwest China to develop server chips. In 2014, Intel signed agreements with two Chinese chip makers, Spreadtrum and Rockchip, to give it a leg up in the market for China\u2019s smartphones and tablets. Last year, Intel agreed to a partnership with the influential Tsinghua University in China as part of a bid to make server chips that match local specifications.American technology companies can find themselves at a serious disadvantage in China unless they agree to cooperate with government-linked Chinese businesses.Take cloud computing, the fast-growing business of leasing computer power to companies. Chinese laws require foreign companies to join with local partners and allow them only a minority stake. International businesses are also blocked from branding such services under their own names.Both Microsoft and Amazon, dominant forces in cloud computing in the United States, have local partnerships in China. By contrast, China\u2019s e-commerce giant Alibaba operates two data centers in the United States without any partner.Another rule calls for data about Chinese consumers or business operations to be stored in China. Apple and Amazon recently set up data centers in China, again with local partners, to store more customer information in the country.Against that backdrop, the call for trade action is attracting bipartisan support.China can make its own play under global trade rules. Beijing can quickly demand binding arbitration \u2014 and could have a good chance of winning. China was allowed into the W.T.O. with very few limits on its ability to regulate services or foreign investment, two categories in which China was fairly weak when it entered the organization in 2001.If China did win a W.T.O. case, it would then have the right to restrict American exports to the same extent that the United States restricts Chinese imports.China consistently exports four times as much to the United States as it imports. Even so, China could penalize American companies like Apple and Starbucks that have very large operations that produce and sell in China with minimal imports from the United States.\u201cU.S. negotiators, I think, basically dropped the ball,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a longtime trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to the rules on services that were negotiated when China entered the W.T.O. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think China was very important.\u201dOn Twitter follow Keith Bradsher, @KeithBradsher, and Paul Mozur, @PaulMozurPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

But that was not enough to keep his daughter healthy, and her skin went pale as she grew thin.Like more than half of Yemenis, the family did not have immediate access to a working medical center, so Mr. Jayefi borrowed money from friends and relatives to take his daughter to the capital.\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for doom or for a breakthrough from heaven,\u201d he said.How did a country in a region with such great wealth fall so far and so fast into crisis?Saudi-led coalition presenceHouthi-Saleh presenceSparselypopulatedareasSaadaAreas where Al-Qaeda operatesSaywunYemenSanaMaribAreas where ISIS has claimed attacksAl MukallaAreas where Al-Qaeda operatesTaizHouthi-Saleh presenceSaudi-led coalition presenceAreas where ISIS has claimed attacksAdenAreas where Al-Qaeda operatesSaadaSaudi-led coalition presenceYemenSanaHouthi-Saleh presenceAl MukallaTaizAreas where Al-Qaeda operatesHouthi-Saleh presenceSaudi-led coalition presenceAreas where ISIS has claimed attacksAdenSaadaYemenMaribSanaAl MukallaTaizAdenAreas where Al-Qaeda operatesHouthi-Saleh presenceSaudi-led coalition presenceAreas where ISIS has claimed attacksIn March 2015, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab nations launched a military campaign aimed at pushing back the Houthis and restoring the government.The campaign has so far failed to do so, and the country remains split between Houthi-controlled territory in the west and land controlled by the government and its Arab backers in the south and east.The Saudi-led coalition has also kept Sana\u2019s international airport closed to civilian air traffic for more than a year, meaning that merchants cannot fly goods in, and sick and wounded Yemenis cannot fly abroad for treatment. Many of them have died.Neither of Yemen\u2019s two competing administrations has paid regular salaries to many civil servants in over a year, impoverishing their families as there is little other work to be found. Among those affected are professionals whose work is essential to dealing with the crisis, like doctors, nurses and sewage system technicians, leading to the near collapse of their sectors.Damage from the war has turned Yemen into a fertile environment for cholera, a bacterial infection spread by water contaminated with feces. As garbage has piled up and sewage systems have failed, more Yemenis are relying on easily polluted wells for drinking water. Heavy rains since April accelerated the wells\u2019 contamination.Sewage systems failed during the rainy season, sparking the current cholera crisis.45,000casesYemen40,00035,00030,00025,00020,00015,00010,0005,000Countries with cholera or cholera-like infections.JanuaryAprilMayJulySewage systems failed during the rainy season, sparking the current cholera crisis.Yemen40,000cases30,00020,00010,000Countries with cholera or cholera-like infections.Jan.AprilJulyIn developed countries, cholera is not life-threatening and can be easily treated, with antibiotics if severe.

A poor agricultural laborer, Mr. Nasir had borrowed money to take his son to the hospital but did not have enough to return home even if the baby recovered. \u201cMy situation is bad,\u201d he said.Five tents had been erected in the backyard of the cholera ward to cope with the sudden increase in patients. All day, families brought sick relatives.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Would Sooner Tax the Rich Than Befriend Them", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2014, one of New York City\u2019s largest private employers, JPMorgan Chase, sought to make a deal with the newly minted administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio. The company wanted to move thousands of workers to a pair of new office towers in the Hudson Yards development, but it demanded a host of incentives from the city to make it happen.The episode offered an early demonstration of how a new mayor, who ran on a platform of ending income inequality and seemed proud not to have ties to the city\u2019s titans of finance, would deal with demands from major businesses.Nearly three years later, Mr. de Blasio has not changed his core philosophy or his approach to Wall Street leaders; as he nears the end of his first term, the mayor has not fostered close relationships with the city\u2019s business giants.Last week, when Mr. de Blasio proposed a tax on those making more than $500,000 a year to raise more money for the struggling subway system, he did not first seek support from the business community.Yet so far, at least, the mayor\u2019s seeming indifference to business leaders has not hurt his chances at re-election, especially with calls to rein in Wall Street becoming a common refrain, and cities, including New York, rethinking the wisdom of offering tax incentives to companies as an inducement to stay.The mayor\u2019s stance also has not hurt the economy of the nation\u2019s largest city.In interviews, financial and real estate executives as well as other members of the city\u2019s corporate class expressed little enthusiasm for the mayor. But he remains strong with Democratic voters in polls.\u201cMost C.E.O.s dislike the mayor\u2019s political rhetoric and doubt his interest or effectiveness in managing city services,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, the city\u2019s premier business group. \u201cBut so long as the city is safe and its fiscal condition is solid, they pretty much ignore what they disagree with.\u201dCorporate leaders have, when asked, stood with Mr. de Blasio in support of policy goals they believe will benefit the city, such as mayoral control of city schools. They have attended dinners at Gracie Mansion when invited in recent months.Mr. de Blasio has engaged in some outreach since the election of President Trump, including a meeting on April 21 at City Hall with the chief executive of Citigroup, Michael L. Corbat, and Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone Group.During that meeting, the mayor sought to enlist their help in resisting cuts to federal funding, and support for the city\u2019s policies on immigration. (Earlier that month, the two executives had been in Washington to meet with the Trump administration and discuss the interests of New York City\u2019s business community.)No one expected that Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat who came from modest means, would enjoy the warm embrace that greeted Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire and philanthropist at home in the city\u2019s upper echelons.\u201cComparing him to his predecessor is a little unfair because Mike came from the business community,\u201d said Edward Skyler, an executive at Citigroup and a former deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cWhile the mayor has made efforts to engage with business leaders, they are never going to embrace his tax policies.\u201dFrom the start, Mr. de Blasio made a point of eschewing the world of Manhattan galas that often bring together the city\u2019s civic and corporate leaders and other markers of the inequality he sought to end. He does not appear in society pages in the manner of Mr. Bloomberg, and, aides say, he would not want to.\u201cIt\u2019s not junior high school. This is not about going to the prom. This is about whether or not people are feeling good about the City of New York as a whole,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor and former Goldman Sachs executive. \u201cI think people would be hard pressed, other than saying, \u2018Oh, you know, it would be nice if I saw him at the opera,\u2019 to say anything about the state of New York City.\u201dShe pointed to the East Midtown rezoning as proof of things being done that business supports. \u201cThe fact that Pfizer could have sold the building and swanned off to suburban New Jersey but chose actively to reinvest in New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cThat to me speaks volumes about how companies are seeing New York City and its future and its present.\u201dFor more than a year, Mr. de Blasio has tried meeting business leaders in a format that better suits him: dinners with his wife, Chirlane McCray, at Gracie Mansion. At first Mr. de Blasio was skeptical, aides said, but he has warmed to the events and held eight such dinners so far. \u201cThere is way more common ground than disagreement on the big issues,\u201d said Gabrielle Fialkoff, a senior adviser to Mr. de Blasio who began organizing the dinners in 2016.While others are eating, Mr. de Blasio delivers remarks about his tenure for much of the meal, then takes questions, according to several people who have attended. One person, who attended a dinner in June, compared the mayor\u2019s speech to a campaign event, but noted that the mayor did not circulate to each table and greet everyone.\u201cHe starts his remarks by saying, \u2018I don\u2019t get to hang out with you guys,\u2019\u201d said Robert S. Tucker, the chief executive of T & M Protection Resources, a security firm, who attended a recent dinner. \u201cI walked out of there thinking very differently about him than I did going it.\u201dFew corporate executives or business owners were willing to openly discuss Mr. de Blasio for fear of antagonizing a mayor who most expect will be easily re-elected. He is facing challenges from long-shot candidates in the Democratic primary race, and polls give him a wide margin in the general election as well.State labor statistics show that, contrary to the fears of some at the start of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure, jobs have stayed in New York. Workers from fashion to finance are eager to live in the city, where unemployment and crime are low. New business creation is up, though with notable declines in retail shops, a trend mirrored nationally, said David Belkin, a senior economist at the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office.With the November vote looming, Mr. de Blasio has returned to campaign mode and embraced a Bernie Sanders-style of populist rhetoric of the sort that turned off some business types last time.The mayor has turned down numerous invitations to visit the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, which remains in Manhattan. \u201cHe\u2019s been invited in, but he has never accepted,\u201d said Joseph Evangelisti, a company spokesman.To get his ear, one businessman decided, the best way was to donate to the mayor\u2019s re-election.\u201cHe\u2019s not my first choice; he\u2019s not necessarily my third choice,\u201d said a businessman who donated the maximum of $4,950 to the mayor\u2019s re-election campaign and requested anonymity to discuss his reasons for doing so.\u201cI\u2019d rather be able to pick up the phone and call him if I think that he\u2019s off base on something, rather than having no relation.\u201dAnd sure enough, he said, soon after the donation he got a personal call from the mayor.Advertisement"}

She was 78.The cause was a brain tumor, her husband, Arthur Boatin, said.Ms. Ford\u2019s five published novels and her many short stories found their power in details and in ordinary, believable characters, often working women in Massachusetts or Maine who were confronting the consequences of choices made and paths not taken.Elaine Ford was born on Dec. 12, 1938, in White Plains. She grew up in northern New Jersey, where her father, John, was a bank loan officer and her mother, Ruth, was active in education causes.In 1964, now with three children, she received her bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard. More travel and relocation followed. Eventually there were five children, and then a sea change.\u201cIn 1972 my mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and I had to come to terms with the fact that we\u2019re all mortal,\u201d Ms. Ford wrote. \u201cIf I was going to be a writer I\u2019d better get cracking, children or no.\u201dShe and Mr. Bunker lived in Northern Ireland for a time before divorcing in 1976. She returned to the United States and, in 1977, married Mr. Boatin, who helped get her first novel, \u201cThe Playhouse,\u201d published in 1980.\u201cElaine Ford writes in the laconic, present-tense declarative style so attractive to young writers just now, but her tone lacks the disaffection of some of her contemporaries,\u201d Gail Godwin said in her review of \u201cThe Playhouse\u201d in The New York Times. \u201cShe obviously cares, she believes that life can be made meaningful through perseverance and struggle, and this concern adds genuinely felt depth to a finely written novel.\u201dThe couple moved to Maine in 1985, and Ms. Ford began teaching creative writing and literature at the University of Maine at Orono. She retired in 2005. She had recently been working on a historical novel based on her family genealogy, which she had been researching extensively.\u201cEvery life is full of drama within,\u201d Ms. Ford told The Maine Sunday Telegram in 1987. \u201cThe trick is to persuade the reader that the story is worth telling. That\u2019s my reason for writing novels.\u201dIn addition to her husband, she is survived by her children Mark Bunker, Lisa Magill, Andrew Bunker and Annebeth Santin; 10 grandchildren; and a brother, Thomas Ford.

{"Headline": "Welcome to the N.F.L.\u2019s Luxury Camp in the Mountains", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir two-and-a-half-hour session last week began around 9:45 a.m., which precluded the players from partaking in activities available during that window to the Greenbrier resort\u2019s other guests: an 80-minute Segway tour of the grounds, the Body Sculpt fitness class, a culinary demonstration featuring crab salad and a Jeep off-road adventure.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d linebacker Shakeel Rashad said, \u201cbut it sounds amazing.\u201dFor roughly 14 hours each day, the Texans resemble every other N.F.L. team preparing for the season. They study film and compete for roster spots, lift weights and meet with coaches. But then their walk-through concludes at 8 p.m., and they are free to unwind not by playing video games on personal consoles but in an arcade \u2014 housed in an eight-lane bowling alley.The Texans decamped to this picturesque cranny of southeastern West Virginia, chiseled into the lush Allegheny Mountains, not to lavish players in luxury but to promote productivity. By escaping the energy-sapping heat in Houston, the Texans believe they will train more efficiently, and with less strain on their bodies. The measurements gleaned by the team\u2019s sports science analysts, General Manager Rick Smith said, have already justified the move.\u201cThe objectives and goals of training camp don\u2019t change because the environment changes,\u201d said Smith, sitting on a couch on the second-floor veranda of the team\u2019s base of operations here, a 55,000-square-foot sports performance center across Route 60 from the Greenbrier. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out the 53 guys who are going to help us win a championship. That is the primary objective and it stays that way, and our guys know that.\u201dA few days later, the rookie offensive lineman Juli\u00e9n Davenport got lost returning to his room. He took the wrong elevator and needed a map to reorient himself. For the rookie running back Dare Ogunbowale, a rumor he heard that bears lurked in the trails near the practice fields almost paled next to another discovery he made.\u201cThere\u2019s a bidet in my bathroom,\u201d Ogunbowale said. \u201cI\u2019d never seen one in person.\u201d\u201cA real big question early was, \u2018What\u2019s your wallpaper like?\u2019\u201d Rashad said. \u201cSome people have flowers. Some people have bright colors, like I do. You wake up in the morning and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 You\u2019re immediately excited.\u201dThe Greenbrier, founded in 1778, rambles across 11,000 acres on the western fringe of town, just past the Virginia border, about a mile from an eclectic set of businesses: a confectionery, a Jamaican diner, a pawnshop. One does not happen upon White Sulphur Springs. Reaching here requires effort, a lovely drive through the mountains, and that relative seclusion both appealed to and confused the Texans, some of whom wondered why they had to go all the way to West Virginia for camp.\u201cThen we got here, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Yes, this is it,\u2019\u201d tight end C. J. Fiedorowicz said.The camp\u2019s remoteness has created logistical challenges, demanding of Smith and his staff more forethought when inviting free agents for workouts. With the closest major airports 80 miles (Roanoke, Va.) and 120 miles (Charleston, W.Va.) away, coordinating travel is essential.The isolation has also produced meager crowds, a natural consequence of training 1,200 miles from home, in an area not easily accessible by major commercial airlines. Instead of drawing a few thousand fans as they would in Houston, the Texans attracted at most 300 for each of two sessions last week, and the atmosphere was lacking because of it.Among the sparse crowd was Richard Porfirio, 28, of suburban Clear Lake, Tex., who loaded camping equipment into his 2005 Nissan Maxima and set off to watch his favorite football team. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said.The primary beneficiaries have been displaced Texans fans like Jennifer Brannan, 42, of Frederick, Md. She and her husband, Kevin Spurgers, 46, a native Houstonian, booked a vacation here with their children, Finn, 6, and Grace, 4, as soon as the camp dates were announced. Hanish Patel, 28, who is from the Houston area, moved to Roanoke in June to begin a residency in internal medicine and considered the Texans\u2019 arrival mutually beneficial.\u201cCan you imagine training in July and August in Texas?\u201d Patel said. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal by 7 a.m. there.\u201dThe temperature here on Thursday last week topped out at 82 degrees. It was, players said, the hottest day to that point. As a cool breeze wafted through the air, Covington remarked, \u201cIf we were in Houston, we\u2019d be melting.\u201dFiedorowicz said: \u201cMentally, by the end of practice, your brain would be fried. You\u2019re just exhausted. I\u2019m coming out here every day, and I\u2019ve got energy.\u201dFor years, Smith said, the Texans studied the cumulative effects of training in intense heat. They wondered, for instance, whether warm-weather teams fared better or worse at the beginning and end of the season, but no worthwhile patterns emerged.Last August, though, the Texans practiced with the 49ers in Santa Clara, Calif., and the team\u2019s tracking data revealed that players were able to endure a greater workload in the cooler weather \u2014 and at the fast tempo favored by Chip Kelly, San Francisco\u2019s coach at the time \u2014 without their bodies absorbing as much wear and tear.Smith said that he had already scouted alternative training camp sites, at Appalachian State in Boone, N.C., and the United States Military Academy at West Point, but that the revelation at 49ers camp had further motivated him. He spoke with his New Orleans counterpart, Mickey Loomis, to express interest in shifting to the Greenbrier if the Saints ever decided to leave.Smith said the Texans, who will practice with the Patriots here next week before leaving West Virginia on Thursday, were committed to spending at least two summers here.Such continuity would deepen the Texans\u2019 ties to a region about 225 miles from the nearest N.F.L. team, the Carolina Panthers, in Charlotte, N.C. Residents\u2019 allegiances tend to tilt even farther afield, toward the Pittsburgh Steelers (260 miles away), the Washington Redskins (270) and, as of 2014, the Saints (880).\u201cThe same people would drive up every year,\u201d said Sherry Rosynek, who works at Cook\u2019s Country Kitchen here, where the staff won over Saints quarterback Drew Brees by accommodating him past closing time with his favorite meal: country fried steak, mashed potatoes and green beans. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they were regulars of mine, because I\u2019d look forward to seeing them when the Saints were in town.\u201dThe sports performance center was built for the Saints, and their presence gave a lift to the local economy. The team\u2019s generosity after devastating floods pummeled the area in June 2016 intensified the connection. The Saints rebuilt a community park on the day players reported to camp last July. But when the Saints acknowledged in February that they were leaving, residents were concerned that the N.F.L. would not return.\u201cIf you\u2019re used to conveniences, to run to Target or Hallmark to buy a card, that just doesn\u2019t happen here,\u201d Massie said. \u201cSo to even have a football team, and then to think we might be losing it, everybody panicked.\u201dOnly about a week passed before the Texans announced they were coming, and residents set about learning the names of players not named J. J. Watt. Shop owners soon put their Saints paraphernalia into storage and hoisted banners and welcome signs across the Greenbrier Valley. One, on West Main Street, proclaimed: \u201cWelcome Texans: Wattage is low here Need visit from JJ.\u201d\u201cWe got used to the Saints,\u201d Rosynek said, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get used to the Texans, too.\u201dThrough their first week or so in town, players had little time to explore beyond their day off, which many used to relax \u2014 running back Lamar Miller recommended the room-service chicken wings. Others roamed the surroundings. Kicker Nick Novak went fly-fishing with punter Shane Lechler. Fiedorowicz commandeered a golf cart for a tour, while Covington wandered by the underground bunker, completed in 1961 and decommissioned in 1992, constructed to withstand a nuclear attack.Players said they were not restricted from any activity, but do not expect to see Watt zip-lining anytime soon. There is always the pocket square seminar or, for the less adventurous, the infinity pool overlooking the 18th hole of the Greenbrier course, where last week the Tree Tops Caf\u00e9 offered a custom drink special: a Big Texan Margarita.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron\u2019s Honeymoon Comes to a Halt", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron, who upended France\u2019s political establishment with his election in May, is breaking ground again, but in an unwelcome way: a rapid and nearly unequaled drop in the polls.The young president lost 10 points in one month in one poll, eight in another and seven in a third. Not since the first months of Jacques Chirac in the mid-1990s has any president fallen so far so fast.Mr. Macron, at the head of a fledgling political movement, marked a victory that was always as tenuous as it was momentous. A former investment banker, he bested France\u2019s traditional political parties and fashioned himself as something of a centrist, giving both left and right reason to support him, but also ample room to regard him with suspicion.Now, it appears that France\u2019s initial romance with the untested outsider to politics may be quickly fading.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a conjunction of discontent,\u201d said Jerome Fourquet of IFOP, one of France\u2019s leading pollsters, who conducted one of the first polls to show Mr. Macron\u2019s tumble.\u201cThe drop is serious. It\u2019s a warning signal,\u201d Mr. Fourquet said in an interview. \u201cThe causes of this discontent are deep. It is touching on some important elements in Macron\u2019s agenda,\u201d he added, pointing out that Mr. Macron had angered all sides of the political spectrum.Nobody denies that Mr. Macron, 39, already has a roster of accomplishments, even before the coming summer break.The representatives, elected on his ticket, have passed a significant ethics law that bars deputies from employing family members and regulates parliamentary expense accounts. And he has set in motion a tough new antiterrorism law, widely criticized by civil libertarians.While opposition politicians have pounced gleefully on the shrinking poll numbers, much of the drop may simply have been waiting to happen.Mr. Macron avoided crowd-pleasing promises during his campaign, with one significant exception, a cut in the housing tax. He did not promise lavish spending initiatives or to hire thousands of new civil servants, like several of his opponents.\u201cThe problem with a very presidentialized system is that the president takes everything on his shoulders, and he pays the price,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, an emeritus political scientist at Sciences Po, a university in Paris.\u201cDiscontent fixes itself very quickly on the president,\u201d Mr. Grunberg added. \u201cIt\u2019s even more for Macron because he\u2019s had this image of being the providential man. So that at the first disappointment, it all shrinks very quickly.\u201dHis vow to pare down the French state was bound to anger significant constituencies in a country where state spending is 56 percent of gross domestic product, the highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s advanced economies.Then the discovery after his election of a $9.5 billion budget shortfall left by his predecessor, combined with Mr. Macron\u2019s vow to make the deficit conform to European Union norms at 3 percent of gross domestic product, led inevitably to promises of further cuts, including $1 billion in military spending.But some of the wounds are self-inflicted. Previous vulnerabilities are coming to the fore. A product of France\u2019s elite schools, the Olympian Mr. Macron doesn\u2019t have the common touch, was never previously elected to anything, and since his election has preferred high-tech salons to trips to France\u2019s struggling provinces.He was booed by workers when he visited a threatened auto-parts factory in central France, not helping himself there by proclaiming that he was no \u201cFather Christmas.\u201dHis abrupt handling of General de Villiers, a man nearly 30 years his senior \u2014 the president let it be known that he was furious at the general\u2019s criticism of cuts to the military budget \u2014 was seen as \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d a word that recurred in French press accounts.Bewilderment greeted the government\u2019s vagueness about when the promised housing tax cut, destined for nearly 80 percent of French households, would be put in place: The prime minister first said it would be phased in gradually, but the outcry prompted officials to correct themselves a week later, promising a rollout by 2018.\u201cThis was one of Macron\u2019s signature issues. And then it was announced that this cut would only happen slowly. People said, well, it was just a campaign promise after all,\u201d Mr. Fourquet said. A five-euro aid cut to low-income renters was met with groans and cries of unfairness.Then, the president coupled television images of himself posing with military \u2014 on a submarine and with French troops in Mali \u2014 with the military budget cut.\u201cThe risk is that an excess of Hollywood-style communication produces an opposite result to the one intended,\u201d Mr. Fourquet said.For all of Mr. Macron\u2019s current polling weakness, the May election\u2019s fundamental equation has not changed: He stands alone. The French left is weak and rudderless, the right is deeply divided, and the populist far right has all but disappeared from the political scene.\u201cHe\u2019s sufficiently overturned the system that there is not much in front of him,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. \u201cWithin the system, the position of Macron is very strong. There is no leader on the right or the left. So you have got to put all this in perspective.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s fierce champions in Parliament \u2014 the weakened opposition derides them for being mere rubber-stamp \u201crobots\u201d bolstering a personality cult \u2014 insist that the poll drop is temporary, and reflects France\u2019s impatience for results.The opposition has made great sport of mocking the inexperience of Mr. Macron\u2019s civil-society deputies in Parliament, political novices for the most part, many from the private sector: their fumbling attempts at running committee meetings and their ignorance of procedure and protocol.Le Monde wryly noted that the Assembl\u00e9e\u2019s canteen, used to doling out glasses of wine at night sessions, now had to get used to orange juice and Coca-Cola. But these young men and women are now the ones in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cIt\u2019s normal, when you\u2019re at the controls, that expectations are very high. Plus there is a very strong desire to change France,\u201d said Matthieu Orphelin, a newly elected member of Parliament in Mr. Macron\u2019s movement, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, or the Republic on the Move.\u201cThis should encourage us to persevere in what we are trying to do, to go fast in transforming the country,\u201d Mr. Orphelin said. Besides, he said, \u201cOur work is not based on the polls. We are working on the program.\u201dFran\u00e7ois Patriat, a senator from Burgundy in Mr. Macron\u2019s political movement, said: \u201cHe went up very high, and now he is back to normal. The French are coming back down to the nitty-gritty.\u201dBut Mr. Macron\u2019s progress so far \u201cproves that breaking the left-right barrier, which he wanted, is finding results.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Outcry as Trump Rebukes Charlottesville Racists 2 Days Later", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The crisis in Charlottesville, Va., presented President Trump with a choice between adopting the unifying tone of a traditional president or doubling down on the go-it-alone approach that got him elected in 2016.On Monday, Mr. Trump offered a glimpse of a more calming and conventional president, but he ended the day with a flurry of angry tweets that left little doubt he intended to govern on his own terms.Mr. Trump, after two days of issuing equivocal statements, bowed to overwhelming pressure that he personally condemn white supremacists who incited bloody weekend demonstrations in Charlottesville.\u201cRacism is evil,\u201d said Mr. Trump, delivering a statement from the White House at a hastily arranged appearance meant to halt the growing political threat posed by the unrest. \u201cAnd those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\u201dBut before and after his conciliatory statement \u2014 which called for \u201clove,\u201d \u201cjoy\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump issued classically caustic Twitter attacks on Kenneth C. Frazier, the head of Merck Pharmaceuticals and one of the country\u2019s top African-American executives.Mr. Frazier announced Monday morning that he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council \u2014 the first of three chief executives who quit the advisory panel on Monday \u2014 to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s initial equivocal statements on Charlottesville.Shortly before leaving the capital, Mr. Trump attacked the news media for blowing the episode out of proportion.\u201cMade additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!\u201d he wrote Monday evening.\u201cTrump faced a fork in the road today, and he took it,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House minority leader. \u201cHe showed cowardice on Saturday by refusing to call out the racists and neo-Nazis, and on Monday he showed how uncomfortable he was in delivering another kind of message.\u201dEven Mr. Trump\u2019s allies worried that his measured remarks, delivered two days after dozens of public figures issued more forceful denunciations of the violence in Virginia, came too late to reverse the self-inflicted damage on his moral standing as president.Even after a wave of disapproval that included a majority of Senate Republicans \u2014 and stronger statements delivered by allies, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump seemed reluctant to tackle the issue head-on when he appeared Monday before the cameras.\u201cTo anyone who acted criminally in this weekend\u2019s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who had just concluded a meeting with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director.Mr. Trump has had a career-long pattern of delaying and muting his criticism of white nationalism. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he refused to immediately denounce David Duke, a former Klansman who supported his candidacy.Some human rights activists, skeptical that Mr. Trump\u2019s latest remarks on the issue represented a change of heart, called on him to fire so-called nationalists \u2014 a group of hard-right populists led by Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist \u2014 working in the West Wing.\u201cThe president should make sure that no one on his staff has ties to white supremacists,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a telephone briefing on Monday afternoon. He added, \u201cNor should they be on the payroll of the American people.\u201dHe said that the Justice Department and the Office of Government Ethics should \u201cdo an investigation and make that determination\u201d to see if anyone in the White House has had links to hate groups.Mr. Trump and his staff have consistently denied any connection to such organizations, and the president called for racial harmony in his remarks on Monday.\u201cAs I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.\u201dFar-right leaders, including Richard B. Spencer, who attended the Charlottesville rally, said they did not take the president\u2019s remarks seriously.\u201cThe statement today was more \u2018kumbaya\u2019 nonsense,\u201d Mr. Spencer told reporters on Monday. \u201cHe sounded like a Sunday school teacher.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that Donald Trump is a dumb person, and only a dumb person would take those lines seriously,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.As Mr. Trump was delivering the kind of statement his critics had demanded over the weekend, Fox News reported that the president was considering pardoning Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., a political ally who has been accused of federal civil rights violations for allegedly mistreating prisoners, many of them black and Hispanic.The timing of the interview was especially striking, given that it came at the height of the controversy over his tepid remarks about Charlottesville.\u201cI am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,\u201d the president said in the interview on Sunday, speaking from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cHe has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He\u2019s a great American patriot, and I hate to see what has happened to him.\u201dTwo themes \u2014 uniting the country while defending himself \u2014 collided on Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed earlier on Monday.It is not unusual for Mr. Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticizes or even mildly questions his actions. But his decision to take on Mr. Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism the president faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathizers who rampaged in Charlottesville.Mr. Frazier\u2019s exit from the business council marks a mini-exodus of business leaders from presidential advisory panels as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on social issues and the environment. His recent decision to leave the Paris climate accord prompted Elon Musk of Tesla to resign, as did the chief executive of Disney, Bob Iger.Additionally, the chief executives of the athletic clothing line Under Armour and of Intel announced they too would step down from the American Manufacturing Council \u2014 the same panel from which Mr. Frazier resigned.Kevin Plank, the head of Under Armour, said he was resigning to focus on \u201cthe power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion.\u201dIntel chief executive Brian Krzanich said he would be willing to serve in the government again when \u201cthose who have stood up for equality\u201d are honored. \u201cI resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said in a statement.Mr. Trump\u2019s shot at Mr. Frazier, one of the country\u2019s best-known black executives, prompted an immediate outpouring of support for the Merck chief executive from major figures in business, media and politics.Last month, Mr. Frazier appeared next to Mr. Trump at the White House to announce an agreement among drug makers that would create 1,000 jobs.He is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm, and rose to prominence as Merck\u2019s general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.An earlier version of this article misquoted part of President Trump\u2019s statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Va. He blamed \u201cmany sides,\u201d not \u201call sides,\u201d for the violence that left one woman dead.Laurie Goodstein and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Officials are pursuing banks and corporations for violating foreign exchange regulations, and investigations are reportedly underway into big offshore investments by private companies. There are signs that capital is still sneaking out of China through disguised channels like tourism spending. Thus the only currency liberalization under consideration is a widening of the yuan\u2019s trading band, a move that would make no practical difference.But conservatism is not costless. China wants more overseas money in the debt markets, to lift the pressure on domestic banks, introduce more market discipline and push the internationalization of its currency. Capital controls deter otherwise enthusiastic foreign institutions from investing. Lifting them would help convince skeptics that Beijing is ready to resume reform. It would also serve as a sign of confidence that might dissuade Chinese onlookers from rushing for the exits before they close even tighter.To be sure, some caution is warranted. If the United States economy keeps heating up, the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates aggressively, and the dollar could rise again. Alternatively, a disaster \u2014 like a war with North Korea \u2014 could set off a flight to dollar safety.But even if the dollar were to strengthen again, that would not necessarily result in another round of panicked outflows. Many of the worries that aggravated capital flight in 2016 have since eased. Producer prices, industrial profits, private investment and market interest rates are all rising.The stock market is snortingly bullish; the benchmark Shanghai stock index is up more than 12 percent this year. And in any case, the Trump era is damaging the dollar\u2019s status as a safe-haven currency. This year, it\u2019s the euro that is rallying.If Beijing believes this economic upturn is durable, there is a window of opportunity to reopen the capital doors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt-Ridden Chinese Giant Now a Shadow of Its Former Size", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUHAN, China \u2014 The Han Show here in central China was supposed to turn the city of Wuhan into a leading tourist destination, with a dazzling spectacle of lights, water jets and acrobats by the former creative director of Cirque du Soleil. But the custom-built 2,000-seat theater is seldom even half full despite deeply discounted tickets.Nearby stands an enormous, elegant building, with yellow undulating walls reminiscent of Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. The complex, which housed motion-simulator rides meant to instill a love of Chinese films, closed a year ago for lack of visitors.The Wanda Reign Hotel was supposed to be the first \u201cseven star\u201d luxury hotel in central China, with towering reception walls clad in jade. Now rooms rent for $160 a night, a cut-rate price at which the hotel still struggles to find takers.The buildings here are among the few left in the once vast collection of the Dalian Wanda Group \u2014 a high-priced reminder of the rapidly changing fortunes of many Chinese conglomerates.Wanda rode China\u2019s ever-rising rivers of debt and political connections to become one of the country\u2019s largest real estate and entertainment conglomerates. Theme parks were central to the strategic vision of its billionaire founder, Wang Jianlin, to diversify beyond the company\u2019s roots developing apartment towers, office blocks and shopping malls.But most of Wanda\u2019s empire is being dismantled, as the company faces pressure to pay off its debt. The government is increasing its scrutiny of prolific dealmakers like Wanda that depended heavily on loans from state-controlled banks, concerned that they pose a threat to the financial system and economic growth.Wanda\u2019s hastily reworked deal last month to sell a portfolio of theme parks and hotels shows the extent of the retreat. With the sale, the company will also liquidate most of its real estate holdings.Wanda\u2019s $6.5 billion sale of 13 theme parks to Sunac includes vast real estate projects in various stages of development. The properties, when completed, will comprise 635 million square feet of floor space. By comparison, all of Manhattan has 500 million square feet of office space.By dumping much of its real estate, Wanda is pursuing what the founder describes as an \u201casset-light\u201d strategy, after the government\u2019s recent policy discouraging overseas investments and heavy borrowing. Rather than owning properties that require big loans, it will try to make money by managing hotels, theme parks and shopping malls.As part of the deal with Sunac, Wanda will get almost $100 million annually for the next 20 years to manage all 13 projects. Its main business will be building shopping malls for other investors and managing them, in exchange for about 30 percent of each location\u2019s revenues.That represents a hope that many Chinese will keep shopping at malls, when the popularity of e-commerce is soaring instead. But Mr. Wang, once one of the wealthiest men in Asia, dismissed that worry.\u201cE-commerce will never substitute for real shops,\u201d he said in a written reply to questions. \u201cThe real economy has come into an era in which it needs to be transformed and upgraded.\u201dMr. Wang initially modeled Wanda after the Walt Disney Company, which acquired nearly 40 square miles near Orlando, Fla., and built hotels and planned communities around theme parks. Mr. Wang, a former army officer with political connections, persuaded 13 second-tier cities around China to hand him vast plots of land at low cost.In Nanchang, in southeastern China, Wanda built the highest and fastest roller coaster in China. In Xishuangbanna, in southwestern China, Wanda built a vast \u201cscience and technology theater\u201d with a roof shaped like an enormous golden palm leaf.When Disney opened a theme park in Shanghai, Mr. Wang promised to defeat the American entertainment giant.Much of his empire, now being sold off, remains half finished. Only four of the 13 theme parks have opened; the others are still under construction, along with the apartment towers around them. Wanda and Sunac are still negotiating over whether that movie studio will be included in the deal.The project at Wuhan, which holds the main real estate left in the portfolio, is in better shape.The company poured more than $7 billion into the city over the last decade, building a mile-long street of stores and restaurants flanked by apartment buildings and office towers. Wanda moved in early, before most developers realized that the city would evolve from basic steel-making into one of the biggest auto manufacturing hubs in China.Wuhan handed over for redevelopment a big chunk of downtown that previously had many state-owned dormitories. Almost every other city granted large plots of outlying land to Wanda.Unlike elsewhere, essentially all of Wanda\u2019s construction here is done. Approximately half the apartments have already been sold in a booming local market.Real estate agents here said that the luxurious apartments sold for twice as much per square foot as other apartments in Wuhan. It likely means Wanda was able pay off much or all of the debt associated with the project, allowing it to book considerable profit on sales of the remaining apartments.Wanda declined to comment.But Wuhan also shows why Wanda will not be a major challenger to Disney.The Wanda Movie Park, a huge indoor theme park near the heart of Wuhan, closed just 19 months after opening. Attendance was anemic. A dozen ticket windows, all shuttered, still list entrance prices. The going rate was steep: $35 for an adult, several days\u2019 wages for a blue-collar worker in this city.Local residents complained that the six activity areas in the park, with names like Star Journey, Ultimate Energy and Power of Nature, weren\u2019t worth the price. They consisted largely of sitting in motion-simulator chairs or walking through mock-ups of sets designed to promote Wanda\u2019s movies.Wanda has so enthusiastically followed Beijing\u2019s message of instilling national pride that other attractions sometimes verged on propaganda. The show at the 2,000-seat theater, by the former director of Cirque du Soleil, Franco Dragone, is supposed to combine acrobatic stunts and artistic pageantry with the heritage of China\u2019s Han ethnic majority. Even Mr. Wang\u2019s son complained on social media that the Han Show was incomprehensible.Dalian Wanda has said that it will redesign the activities here and reopen the park. But there was little sign of activity during a recent visit.\u201cIf it were a choice of going to Disney again or Wanda again, I would go to Disney,\u201d said Liu Lina, a 38-year-old solar-panel installation manager here. \u201cThe Disney parks have lots of activities to experience.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Harvey Shifts Political Winds in Washington", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonGone are the confrontational talk of a government shutdown and the brinkmanship over the debt limit. Instead, both Mr. Trump and his putative allies in Congress \u2014 many of them professed fiscal hawks \u2014 are promising an outpouring of federal aid to begin a recovery and rebuilding effort that will last for years and require tens of billions of dollars, if not substantially more, from Washington.The storm has utterly transformed the federal fiscal picture.\u201cThis is going to change the whole dynamic for September and, quite frankly, for the Republican establishment for the remainder of the 115th Congress,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, a longtime chief budget adviser to Senate Republicans who is now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, they don\u2019t need money to build a wall in Texas, but to rebuild the shoreline in Texas.\u201dMr. Trump is eager to be seen as a competent manager in his first big test in a natural disaster, and a shutdown could shatter that image. Lawmakers want to deliver for the Texas and Louisiana communities pounded by Harvey, a region that is not only a driver of the national economy but a center of Republican strength.At the same time, a huge relief program tacked on to the federal deficit could undermine the claim by the president and his party that they are stewards of a leaner, more efficient federal bureaucracy.The magnitude of the storm threatens to overwhelm that agenda as well as relegate to the background Mr. Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, has already said that members of his group will not insist, for now, on funding it.And it may make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to follow through on his promises of a broad crackdown on illegal immigration.\u201cThis is going to be costly,\u201d Mr. Hoagland said, \u201cand the Cruzes of the world are going to have to belly up to the bar in a way they are not familiar with.\u201dRepublicans who had been bracing for a September showdown over how to fund the government are rapidly changing course. While they await potentially staggering damage assessments, they are pledging to do whatever it takes to help those flooded out along the Gulf Coast.As Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee, put it, \u201cThere will be members who will have to eat a little crow, but the bottom line is the votes are there\u201d because \u201cCongress wants to look functional.\u201dPart of looking functional, he said, is ending discussion of shuttering the government in a dispute over whether to provide money for a wall border on the southern border.\u201cYou certainly can\u2019t have the government shut down in the middle of a national crisis,\u201d Mr. Cole said.The storm\u2019s ramifications for the conservative agenda beyond fiscal issues have yet to play out.The storm-driven congressional budget reassessment is already underway. Before Hurricane Harvey, House Republicans were planning to vote next week on a spending bill that would have shifted nearly $876 million away from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That plan is now out the window, and lawmakers are instead focused on funneling more money toward FEMA.\u201cBudgetary circumstances have changed significantly since the bill was drafted earlier this summer,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the Appropriations Committee. \u201cGiven the current situation, the committee is reassessing the issue and is actively involved in communication with the administration on the needs and the timing of those needs.\u201dThe specifics of how the spending package will come together have yet to be determined. Hurricane relief will be part of a messy confluence of issues that include the debt-limit hike, a still-emerging tax-cut proposal that could also add to the deficit and a Republican push for more Pentagon spending.At a minimum, Republican leaders seem ready to act quickly to make sure sufficient money is available to respond to Harvey while passing a stopgap measure to keep the government open past the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under that framework, the toughest spending decisions would be pushed off until as late as December.While supporting the storm aid, some House conservatives are warning that they will not look kindly on any effort to link the debt-limit hike to hurricane relief. And conservative advocacy groups, warily eying hurricane spending, are worried it could quickly get out of hand.Mr. Cornyn sought to provide reassurance that Congress was not going to go overboard on disaster spending, saying that \u201cthis is not just money that\u2019s doled out for any purpose.\u201d\u201cThis has to be targeted for disaster relief and recovery from Hurricane Harvey,\u201d he said.But it is clear that Republicans \u2014 already struggling, despite their control of the White House and both houses of Congress \u2014 are entering a changed political and fiscal environment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyWhen Americans think of Communism in Eastern Europe, they imagine travel restrictions, bleak landscapes of gray concrete, miserable men and women languishing in long lines to shop in empty markets and security services snooping on the private lives of citizens. While much of this was true, our collective stereotype of Communist life does not tell the whole story.Some might remember that Eastern bloc women enjoyed many rights and privileges unknown in liberal democracies at the time, including major state investments in their education and training, their full incorporation into the labor force, generous maternity leave allowances and guaranteed free child care. But there\u2019s one advantage that has received little attention: Women under Communism enjoyed more sexual pleasure.How to account for this facet of life behind the Iron Curtain?Consider Ana Durcheva from Bulgaria, who was 65 when I first met her in 2011. Having lived her first 43 years under Communism, she often complained that the new free market hindered Bulgarians\u2019 ability to develop healthy amorous relationships.\u201cSure, some things were bad during that time, but my life was full of romance,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter my divorce, I had my job and my salary, and I didn\u2019t need a man to support me. I could do as I pleased.\u201dMs. Durcheva was a single mother for many years, but she insisted that her life before 1989 was more gratifying than the stressful existence of her daughter, who was born in the late 1970s.\u201cAll she does is work and work,\u201d Ms. Durcheva told me in 2013, \u201cand when she comes home at night she is too tired to be with her husband. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because he is tired, too. They sit together in front of the television like zombies. When I was her age, we had much more fun.\u201dLast year in Jena, a university town in the former East Germany, I spoke with a recently married 30-something named Daniela Gruber. Her own mother \u2014 born and raised under the Communist system \u2014 was putting pressure on Ms. Gruber to have a baby.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand how much harder it is now \u2014 it was so easy for women before the Wall fell,\u201d she told me, referring to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1989. \u201cThey had kindergartens and cr\u00e8ches, and they could take maternity leave and have their jobs held for them. I work contract to contract, and don\u2019t have time to get pregnant.\u201dAlthough East European Communist states needed women\u2019s labor to realize their programs for rapid industrialization after World War II, the ideological foundation for women\u2019s equality with men was laid by August Bebel and Friedrich Engels in the 19th century. After the Bolshevik takeover, Vladimir Lenin and Aleksandra Kollontai enabled a sexual revolution in the early years of the Soviet Union, with Kollontai arguing that love should be freed from economic considerations.Russia extended full suffrage to women in 1917, three years before the United States did. The Bolsheviks also liberalized divorce laws, guaranteed reproductive rights and attempted to socialize domestic labor by investing in public laundries and people\u2019s canteens. Women were mobilized into the labor force and became financially untethered from men.In Central Asia in the 1920s, Russian women crusaded for the liberation of Muslim women. This top-down campaign met a violent backlash from local patriarchs not keen to see their sisters, wives and daughters freed from the shackles of tradition.In the 1930s, Joseph Stalin reversed much of the Soviet Union\u2019s early progress in women\u2019s rights \u2014 outlawing abortion and promoting the nuclear family. However, the acute male labor shortages that followed World War II spurred other Communist governments to push forward with various programs for women\u2019s emancipation, including state-sponsored research on the mysteries of female sexuality. Most Eastern European women could not travel to the West or read a free press, but scientific socialism did come with some benefits.\u201cAs early as 1952, Czechoslovak sexologists started doing research on the female orgasm, and in 1961 they held a conference solely devoted to the topic,\u201d Katerina Liskova, a professor at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, told me. \u201cThey focused on the importance of the equality between men and women as a core component of female pleasure. Some even argued that men need to share housework and child rearing, otherwise there would be no good sex.\u201dAgnieszka Koscianska, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Warsaw, told me that pre-1989 Polish sexologists \u201cdidn\u2019t limit sex to bodily experiences and stressed the importance of social and cultural contexts for sexual pleasure.\u201d It was state socialism\u2019s answer to work-life balance: \u201cEven the best stimulation, they argued, will not help to achieve pleasure if a woman is stressed or overworked, worried about her future and financial stability.\u201dIn all the Warsaw Pact countries, the imposition of one-party rule precipitated a sweeping overhaul of laws regarding the family. Communists invested major resources in the education and training of women and in guaranteeing their employment. State-run women\u2019s committees sought to re-educate boys to accept girls as full comrades, and they attempted to convince their compatriots that male chauvinism was a remnant of the pre-socialist past.Although gender wage disparities and labor segregation persisted, and although the Communists never fully reformed domestic patriarchy, Communist women enjoyed a degree of self-sufficiency that few Western women could have imagined. Eastern bloc women did not need to marry, or have sex, for money. The socialist state met their basic needs and countries such as Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany committed extra resources to support single mothers, divorc\u00e9es and widows. With the noted exceptions of Romania, Albania and Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union, most Eastern European countries guaranteed access to sex education and abortion. This reduced the social costs of accidental pregnancy and lowered the opportunity costs of becoming a mother.The result, unfortunately, has been that many of the advances of women\u2019s liberation in the former Warsaw Pact countries have been lost or reversed. Ms. Durcheva\u2019s adult daughter and the younger Ms. Gruber now struggle to resolve the work-life problems that Communist governments had once solved for their mothers.\u201cThe Republic gave me my freedom,\u201d Ms. Durcheva once told me, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of Bulgaria. \u201cDemocracy took some of that freedom away.\u201dAs for Ms. Gruber, she has no illusions about the brutalities of East German Communism; she just wishes \u201cthings weren\u2019t so much harder now.\u201dBecause they championed sexual equality \u2014 at work, at home and in the bedroom \u2014 and were willing to enforce it, Communist women who occupied positions in the state apparatus could be called cultural imperialists. But the liberation they imposed radically transformed millions of lives across the globe, including those of many women who still walk among us as the mothers and grandmothers of adults in the now democratic member states of the European Union. Those comrades\u2019 insistence on government intervention may seem heavy-handed to our postmodern sensibilities, but sometimes necessary social change \u2014 which soon comes to be seen as the natural order of things \u2014 needs an emancipation proclamation from above.An opinion essay last week about Eastern European women\u2019s lives under Communism misattributed responsibility for enacting women\u2019s suffrage in Russia in 1917. It was achieved under the provisional government in July, not by the Bolsheviks, who did not seize power until November.Kristen R. Ghodsee, a professor of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania, is the author of numerous books on European Communism and its aftermath, including, most recently, \u201cRed Hangover: Legacies of 20th-Century Communism.\u201dThis is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toyota to Take 5 Percent Stake in Mazda and Build Joint U.S. Plant", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies.The factory\u2019s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said.Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States.The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. \u201cToyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!\u201d he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a \u201cbig border tax.\u201dThe alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology.In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts \u2014 especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars \u2014 many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution.\u201cTotally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said. \u201cWe need to cooperate and compete with them.\u201dJapan\u2019s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew.Toyota has been extending its reach, as well.Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership.With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges \u2014 both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla.Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company\u2019s products more flair.Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda\u2019s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent.Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion.\u201cAs Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi\u2019s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,\u201d said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers.Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. \u201cAny manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,\u201d Gov. Rick Snyder said. \u201cWe are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.\u201dAnd a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: \u201cToyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas \u2014 just recently opening their new North American headquarters \u2014 and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion.Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}

And it is still unclear how enthusiastic Democrats would really be about making compromises that would allow Mr. Trump to score a major legislative victory.But the Dow\u2019s rise nearly mirrors a fall in the dollar. Currencies including the euro, the yen, the renminbi and the Mexican peso have been climbing against the dollar, while trillions of dollars slosh around the global economy to places where investors can receive a higher return, whether that\u2019s junk bonds or Dow stalwarts like Amazon.The slip in the dollar has also been matched by tough talk on trade from the Trump administration.Related Reading\u2022 Dalian Wanda has become one of China\u2019s largest real estate and entertainment conglomerates, helped by political connections and a huge pile of debt.Wanda sold theme parks that covered more floor space than all the offices in Manhattan in a $6.5 billion deal. It off-loaded 77 hotels at a fire sale price of $3 billion.The conglomerate is a shadow of its former self. And, as The New York Times found in Wuhan, where Wanda has poured in money, it is still far from being the grand rival to Disney that the founder, Wang Jianlin, boasted of.Its $264.4 million deal for International Currency Exchange, based in London, and its takeover of Rezidor Hotel Group in Sweden have faced regulatory roadblocks.But executives are likely to feel uncomfortable holding onto trophy assets that leave them open to political attacks, so they will consider reasonable offers.The man who has invested in a circus and a margarine company wants to eliminate irrational investments.\u2013 \u201cIt can certainly eliminate a lot of irrational investments and therefore potential threats to financial security.

{"Headline": "White House Raises Pressure on Venezuela With New Financial Sanctions", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela on Friday, modestly ratcheting up the pressure on the embattled government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for increasingly repressive policies.The sanctions restrict trading of Venezuelan bonds sold by the government in the American financial markets to raise money. The effect could increase the likelihood of a Venezuelan default on its debts at the end of the year.The administration stopped short of prohibiting imports of Venezuelan crude oil to American refineries, which would almost certainly be a crippling step. American refiners have lobbied hard against sanctions against oil imports, arguing that they would raise fuel prices, slash profit margins and potentially cost oil company jobs along the Gulf Coast.Financial and political analysts said the new sanctions would not represent a lethal blow to Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. But many say its survival over the next year is in serious doubt, partly because of continuing problems raising money to pay interest on its onerous debts while paying for food imports.\u201cIt certainly sends a message,\u201d Risa Grais-Targow, the lead Venezuela analyst at Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consulting firm, said of the new sanctions. \u201cBut I would say in many ways it\u2019s not going to be that impactful because the Venezuela government effectively already lacks market access and hasn\u2019t been able to issue new debt for quite a while.\u201dThe new sanctions have broad loopholes, allowing for the financing of most commercial trade, including the export of American light crude oil to Venezuela for mixing with its heavy crude, and financing for humanitarian services to the Venezuelan people.Financing of import and export transactions of Pdvsa\u2019s American affiliate, Citgo, which has several refineries in the Gulf of Mexico along with a network of pipelines and gasoline stations, will also be exempted from the new sanctions. However, even while Citgo can still sell debt, it cannot directly send profits back to the Venezuelan government.\u201cThese measures are carefully calibrated,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, \u201cto deny the Maduro dictatorship a critical source of financing to maintain its illegitimate rule, protect the United States financial system from complicity in Venezuela\u2019s corruption and in the impoverishment of the Venezuelan people, and allow for humanitarian assistance.\u201dWhile limited, the move is the latest in a series of actions since Mr. Maduro\u2019s government held elections for a Constituent Assembly this month to circumvent the powers of the democratically elected Congress and rewrite the Constitution. The administration has placed financial sanctions on 20 leaders and individuals close to the government, including Mr. Maduro himself.President Trump has even suggested that the United States might consider military action in Venezuela. That possibility was strongly criticized in Latin America and the United States as a throwback to the days of Yankee imperialism.Still, top aides to Mr. Trump have been increasingly strident in their denunciations of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.\u201cWe will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,\u201d Ms. Sanders said as she announced the new executive order applying sanctions.Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, aimed her criticism directly at Mr. Maduro.\u201cWe will not stand for the dictatorship he\u2019s trying to create,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cand we will continue to take decisive action until he takes steps to return Venezuela to the prosperous democracy it once was.\u201dAside from political turbulence, Venezuela is suffering one of the worst economic crises in modern Latin American history. Hunger is common, store shelves are empty and oil production \u2014 the country\u2019s life blood \u2014 is in sharp decline. The government still has more than $9 billion in reserves, but those are quickly shrinking with $3.7 billion in loan payments due later this year.Venezuela has roughly $97 billion in foreign debt, strangling an economy that has been eroding for years, especially as oil prices have plummeted since 2014. The financial crisis is drawing the country closer to Russia, with the Russian oil company Rosneft supplying some financing to Pdvsa in exchange for exploration and production rights.The Trump administration has been debating whether to ban imports of Venezuelan oil for months, and officials say that option is still open. The United States buys roughly half of Venezuela\u2019s oil because many of its refineries were built to process heavy grades of crude that originate in Venezuela, Mexico and Canada. Few countries have refineries with ample capacity to refine Venezuela\u2019s heavy oil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islamic State and Climate Change Seen as World\u2019s Greatest Threats, Poll Says", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResidents of 13 countries ranked climate change as the greatest threat to national security, while in 17 countries the Islamic State was considered a more immediate problem.In the United States, however, a gaping partisan divide pushed climate change to third-most severe perceived threat, after ISIS and cyberwarfare. Just 56 percent of Americans surveyed identified global warming as the most serious threat to the country, compared to 71 percent for cyberwarfare and 74 percent for Islamic State attacks.The American intelligence community concluded that Russia used cyberweapons to interfere with the presidential election last year, perhaps accounting for the heightened sense of threat. The Trump administration has consistently played down the dangers of a warming climate and has withdrawn the United States from the Paris accord on climate change signed by nearly 200 nations.\u201cThe stark partisan divide between those on the left and the right means there is a large portion in the United States that doesn\u2019t see climate change as a threat,\u201d Mr. Poushter said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a large percentage that does, so that lowers the number.\u201dThe survey of 41,953 people in 38 countries was conducted from February through May. Beyond the top line figures, the survey offers other insights about how people around the world view global warming.But 74 percent of people surveyed in seven South American and Latin American countries cite climate as their top global concern, the highest of any region surveyed.\u201cIn Latin America the impacts of climate change both in terms of extreme events as well as the intensity and frequency of events has really gained momentum,\u201d said Ms. Caballero, who formerly served as Colombia\u2019s lead United Nations negotiator on climate change.Russia ranked climate change fifth among its global concerns in the Pew survey, below the Islamic State, the economy, the refugee crisis and the influence of the United States.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.What do the Russians worry about even less than climate change? Cyberattacks.We have long known Americans break heavily along party lines over the causes, solutions and very existence of man-made climate change. The Pew study lays that chasm bare.Among Americans who consider themselves left-leaning, 86 percent cite rising emissions as a dangerous threat, compared with only 31 percent on the right. That 55 percent divide is larger than the partisan split on ISIS and on the migrant crisis.Terrorism is the biggest worry for Americans, with 74 percent putting ISIS as the top threat to the country. Close behind are cyberattacks.Mr. Poushter noted the surveys were conducted in the spring amid national attention on the finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election by hacking Democrats\u2019 emails and distributing online propaganda.Climate change is ranked third among Americans, with 56 percent of people surveyed believing it is a major threat.Four virtual-reality films take you on, above and below the Antarctic ice.Lower levels of concern about climate change were found in Poland, Russia, India, Israel Jordan, Tunisia, Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria and Venezuela.\u201cClimate change is in many ways a small skirmish in the midst of a much larger political struggle that\u2019s been going on in this country since its founding,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between government and a society of free individuals? That\u2019s playing out across the board on a lot of other issues, from tax policy to health care.\u201dPew did not survey many of the top oil exporters other than Russia, so it\u2019s hard to know how people feel in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait. But among the world\u2019s biggest coal exporters the story is a fairly nuanced one.And among the big coal importers? Only 47 percent of people in India surveyed named climate change as a top concern, but that was enough to put the issue second after ISIS. In South Korea, 79 percent of people are worried about the climate.An earlier version of this article misstated when Venezuela ratified the Paris climate accord.

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Make a Wall Deal", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s been a busy time for border wall aficionados. Seems like every day there\u2019s a new dramatic development:The House passed a bill that would pony up nearly $1.6 billion for the first stretch of Donald Trump\u2019s pet project.Then there was the release of the transcript of Trump\u2019s crazy pay-for-the-wall conversation with the president of Mexico.And the release of a government report that estimates the Department of Homeland Security would have to screen 750,000 applicants to meet the president\u2019s target for new Border Patrol hires.And the discovery that Trump\u2019s sudden announcement about barring transgender volunteers from the military was actually all about getting money to start building the \u2026 barrier. (Sometimes you get tired of saying \u201cwall.\u201d It comes up so often, we should create synonyms. Fortification of the Future. Donald\u2019s Divider. Keep working on it.)The merging of transgender rights with barrier-building was certainly a surprise. Republicans in Congress had been working on a defense spending bill, to which Trump managed to attach the totally nondefense-related money for a Large Panel Between Us and Mexico. But final passage was being held up by social conservatives, who were trying unsuccessfully to add an amendment barring the military from paying for gender reassignment surgery.To appease them, Trump raced out and tweeted that after \u201cconsultation with my generals and military experts\u201d \u2014 which of course had never happened \u2014 \u201cthe United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\u201dYou will notice that the House argument was about whether military health care should cover a particular medical procedure, not whether transgender volunteers should be banned from the service. It\u2019s possible that Trump, whose lack of attention to detail is so enormous it\u2019s a wonder he ever remembers to breathe, didn\u2019t focus on the exact issue at hand. Or maybe he just thought the best way to resolve the problem was with as much sweeping discrimination as possible.The vision of what the president wants in a wall keeps shifting. At first it was a 2,000-mile, 50-foot-tall concrete monolith. Then it became maybe a little shorter, and something with solar panels. Lately he\u2019s talked about making the wall transparent, so Americans passing by won\u2019t be hit on the head with \u201clarge sacks of drugs\u201d being tossed over from the Mexican side.But Trump was fixated on his promise to make Mexico pay for the wall \u2014 not actually making it happen so much as making Mexico say it would happen. Or that \u201cwe will work it out.\u201d Or just not mentioning that Mexico was never going to put up a dime. (\u201c\u2026 you cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that.\u201d)So it\u2019s all about image. Maybe he sees himself going down in history as a great builder like Dwight Eisenhower (interstate highway system) or DeWitt Clinton (Erie Canal) \u2014 except that instead of helping people move faster, he would stop them from moving altogether. More like Qin Shi Huang, creator of the Great Wall of China. Trump closes his eyes and imagines tourists in 4017, coming in droves to admire the amazing, tall, transparent Great Thingie of the Mexican Border.The chances we\u2019ll ever see this $20-billion-plus project completed are minimal. But just keeping up pretenses will mean an enormous waste of money and effort. Maybe we could make a deal like the one Trump was trying to urge on the Mexicans. Whenever the subject of the wall comes up, we would all agree to say, \u201cHey, you never can tell.\u201d In return, the president would devote that first $1.6 billion to infrastructure repair.If he promises to leave the transgender soldiers alone, we could add, \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a metaphor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Wants to Make Nafta Its Friend. Here\u2019s the Problem.", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCan Nafta be re-engineered to raise workers\u2019 wages?Fooled once by a labor \u201cside agreement\u201d that Mr. Clinton added to Nafta to gain union approval, but that proved unable to constrain employers\u2019 misdeeds in any significant way, labor is aiming this time for the heart of what it considers unfair competition. It is demanding a guarantee that wages \u2014 especially Mexican wages \u2014 rise to ensure a \u201clevel playing field.\u201dExporting a product that involved workers paid less than this living wage, at any point in the production chain, would be an outright violation of Nafta, subject to standard punitive procedures.Mexican workers would undoubtedly appreciate being able to pay for all that stuff. Demanding a wage floor is the kind of straightforward arm-twisting that Mr. Trump might appreciate. Still, using Nafta to protect American jobs by mandating Mexico\u2019s standard of living remains a fairly loopy idea.\u201cStipulating that countries must pay above-market wages when producing export goods for the U.S. feels like outrageous economic imperialism,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cShould Germany also impose this rule on the U.S., since our manufacturing workers surely make less than their German counterparts who are working under industry-level labor agreements?\u201dIt is not the first time organized labor has thought along these lines. In the early \u201990s, when Nafta had yet to become law, the union-backed Alliance for Responsible Trade argued that minimum wages in the tradable-goods sectors of all three North American countries should \u201cmove as quickly as possible toward that of the highest-wage country\u201d and allow for a decent quality of life.This time, though, labor has a better hand. It can afford to be bolder. A quarter of a century ago, unions reluctantly acquiesced to Nafta based on the premise that American workers would get the better end of the deal \u2014 new high-skilled, well-paid jobs in a regional supply chain that sent only its low-skill, low-wage bits south of the border.What\u2019s more, the cheap labor they so feared would become more expensive over time. Investment in Mexico by multinationals serving the North American market would naturally lift Mexico\u2019s standards of living to converge with those of its neighbor to the north, turning Mexicans into rich consumers hungry for American-made products.This didn\u2019t quite happen. American manufacturing has lost millions of jobs, and typical household incomes have increased by less than half a percent per year. Most troubling for American workers staring into a future in which Nafta is still the name of the game, the wage gap with Mexico has not closed, even with the tepid wage growth in the United States.Mexico\u2019s depressed wages remain a potent symbol of the shortcomings of Nafta as a tool for economic development. They offer a note of caution against the proposition that liberalized trade and investment alone can deliver the developing world from poverty.\u201cWages are really low in both absolute and relative terms, among the lowest wages in Latin America,\u201d said Ben Davis, director of international affairs at the United Steelworkers union.\u201cLow wages in manufacturing are not because of low productivity,\u201d he said, but because of Mexico\u2019s policy \u201cof keeping wages low as an incentive for companies to locate there.\u201dPresented with a new shot at the trade deal, labor unions do not want to be fooled again. \u201cIn 1990 we would have been laughed out of the room had we talked about living wage,\u201d said Thea Lee, who resigned as deputy chief of staff at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in May after two decades at the organization. But \u201ca lot of the comforting narrative didn\u2019t happen.\u201dStill, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s argument does not quite deliver the justice for workers it so forcefully promises. Though Nafta has not produced a rich and prosperous Mexico, the labor federation\u2019s demand for Mexican wages to be pulled up to a North American floor is unlikely to improve jobs or wages in the United States. What\u2019s more, such a move could halt Mexico\u2019s development.The idea of a living wage, said Dani Rodrik of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, \u201cis very difficult to define and can be harmful to employment if enforced too strictly.\u201dMexico\u2019s dismal wages are an urgent problem. They will not rise by fiat, however, but only by improving productivity across the economy. Mexican labor productivity has grown less than 10 percent since Nafta came into effect, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That\u2019s less than a third of the productivity growth in Canada, and less than a fourth of that in the United States.Labor is right to worry about low wages in both the United States and Mexico, noted another economist, Gordon Hanson of the University of California, San Diego. \u201cBut a living-wage law would apply only to the formal sector, and that would make the formal sector even smaller.\u201dNafta could be improved to better protect workers\u2019 rights, assuming this is what the Trump administration really wants to do. Proposals by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to facilitate complaints against abusive employers and to ensure quick and effective enforcement of agreed labor standards could prevent violations.Some jobs are likely to relocate to Mexico under this new deal, though. Policy makers must offer more than lip service to people displaced from their jobs by these transformations \u2014 including serious training programs and more robust safety-net services like, say, extended unemployment insurance and maybe even wage subsidies for workers who end up in lower-paying jobs.But the core challenge is to figure out what will help productive, competitive industries grow in North America. That is something that putting a wage floor under the Mexican labor force will not do.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Loves Arizona", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhen President Trump sought solace from arguably the most disastrous week of his presidency, he headed toward Arizona \u2014 and seemed to have a grand old time. His speech Tuesday in Phoenix was classic Trump: He lambasted the \u201cvery dishonest media,\u201d for almost a half hour; he relitigated his Charlottesville responses in petulant detail; he defended Confederate statues as \u201cour history and our heritage.\u201d And, just for fun, he dangled a possible pardon for Joe Arpaio, the hometown authoritarian former sheriff who was convicted of criminal contempt in July.What better venue for Mr. Trump, praised just the night before as presidential during his Afghanistan speech, to revert to his natural form? Arizona, after all, is the state that effectively made him president, and not merely for the 11 electoral votes it awarded him last November.The 45th president\u2019s journey from a stunt candidate to a serious force began in Phoenix, on July 11, 2015, less than a month after his escalator-ride announcement in which he spontaneously excoriated Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists.\u201d His tiny staff found themselves overwhelmed with ticket requests for a rally at a Phoenix hotel and had to book the Phoenix Convention Center on short notice. Something was about to burst forth that nobody full understood at the time \u2014 perhaps not even Mr. Trump himself.A few immigration activists showed up with banners, and were immediately set upon by an angry crowd of rally attendees who had just discovered that a loudmouth with a Queens accent was just the right person to shout their frustrations by proxy. Perhaps not coincidentally, this was one of the first rallies of his campaign to be broadcast live on cable. The rowdiness and near-gladiatorial atmosphere \u2014 along with the symbiotic and contradictory dynamic of media-bashing and media glare \u2014 made for ratings gold and would persist at Trump rallies through the campaign. But this strange recipe got its first taste-test in Phoenix.Arizona had prepared Mr. Trump\u2019s path in more spiritual ways that long predated that transformative 2015 rally. With an economy built on real-estate deals, and some outright land hustles, Arizona was primed to embrace an outsider promising quick miracles. Bashing Mexican immigrants has played well for at least 20 years with the state\u2019s other significant base of immigrants: Anglo retirees with nest eggs and a leeriness of their new Latino neighbors. And the luxury resorts ringing metro Phoenix are models of gilded Trumpian tackiness.Perhaps more importantly, Arizona has a distrust of political establishments and a lengthy history of electing tough-talking disappointments. Former governors Fife Symington and Evan Mecham left office in the midst of criminal proceedings. Last month, Mr. Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for ordering his deputies to harass selected Latino drivers in their constant hunt for illegal immigrants. But the crowd at the rally seemed to think he was Gary Cooper. \u201cI\u2019ll make a prediction \u2014 I think he is going to be just fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said to cheers.It makes sense. Mr. Arpaio was basically Mr. Trump with a badge: a blunt Northeasterner (Mr. Arpaio is from Springfield, Mass.) with a taste for fame who was able to sniff out the raw nativist sentiment in his electorate and position himself as a refreshing alternative to the more mealy-mouthed establishment politicians. He privately courted journalists even as he trashed them in public. And he made outlandish sales pitches with no shame.Mr. Trump has already a similar penchant for stunt, but his recent choice of mood-booster \u2014 ranting in front of Phoenix crowds \u2014 might be the strangest thing of all. Theodore Roosevelt went to the woods to shoot large animals. Bill Clinton liked action movies. Richard Nixon sought lofty words in stone when he ordered his valet to take him to the Lincoln Memorial at 4 a.m. after the 1970 killings at Kent State. And at this fragile moment in his presidency, Mr. Trump chose the format of the mega-rally and the vendetta-filled rant for personal inspiration.Arizona has a reputation of being the \u201cchoke\u201d state for presidential candidates, fielding a strong team of seekers who didn\u2019t quite make it over the top: Barry Goldwater, Morris Udall, Bruce Babbitt, John McCain. But Arizona can now make a rightful claim to being the effective home state of the 45th president of the United States \u2014 a place where his ideas and style had been accepted before he ever came along.Tom Zoellner, a fifth-generation Arizonan, is the politics editor of the Los Angeles Review of Books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bidding Before California Car Show Suggests Collectible Market Is Healthy", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe year-over-year figures for the auctions decreased, to $327 million from $338 million. But the decline was much gentler than expected, an indication that the market may be stabilizing.\u201cReally, it was the best result possible,\u201d said Cam Ingram, a collector and restorer in Durham, N.C. \u201cThe Monterey auctions were a healthy barometer of a stable market, with educated buyers making the right buys for right reasons.\u201dIf there was any doubt, it was erased in a suspenseful 27 minutes on Friday, during the sale of a 1956 Aston Martin DBR1 racecar and a 1970 Porsche 917K racecar.The RM Sotheby\u2019s auctioneer at the event hammered to signal that the Aston Martin had been sold for $22.5 million, about 10 percent above the pre-sale estimate. On the same day, a rival auction house, Gooding & Company, sold the Porsche for $14.08 million in about seven minutes. Both sales were met with more than polite applause.\u201cThe expensive high-profile cars that had to sell, almost all sold, and less-expensive, well-presented cars that carried a realistic reserve sold for market-correct numbers to enthusiast, end-user owners,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cThe speculators all seem to have gone elsewhere for the moment.\u201dThere were a few reasons for the anxiety before the auctions: Surging stock and real estate markets now compete with passion investments. Perhaps more worrisome, car collectors are getting older, with some baby boomers deciding to leave the market. As a result, the collector car market is well off its 2014 peak despite an improving economy.Prices have fallen before, including during a recession-induced contraction in 2008-09. But that fall did not last long. Things were already starting to look up by 2011, with buyers at the top of the market \u2014 those bidding for cars costing more than $1 million \u2014 spending conspicuously again. Mid- and entry-level buyers returned to the auctions in 2012-13.Brian Rabold, vice president for valuation services at Hagerty, an insurance and data-analytics firm in Traverse City, Mich., that focuses on classic cars, said that \u201c2014 may have been the peak year in dollars at the Monterey auctions, but it probably simply reflected the fact that the smartest of the smart money timed their exits well. The momentum probably reached its height in late 2013.\u201dIt was not all sunny drives and humming engines in Monterey, Calif.Sellers expecting to get as much as they would have 18 months ago went home with their cars. This was particularly evident in the part of the market where prices were at or below $250,000. The experience of the consignor of a pretty 1973 Ferrari 246 Dino illustrated this. Prices for the model peaked in 2015 and have been sliding gently since. The high bid of $220,000 at Gooding & Company may have been market-correct for 2017, but the seller opted to hold out for something closer to the pre-sale estimate of $250,000.In contrast, a different seller at the same auction decided to take just $137,000 for a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 190SL roadster, despite an estimate of $200,000.Still, there were many eye-popping sales. In addition to the Aston Martin DBR1 and the Porsche 917, a 1995 McLaren F1 went for $15 million at the Bonhams auction. Interesting transactions were made for less expensive cars, too.\u201cIt\u2019s taken a younger generation\u2019s appreciation for great midcentury modern design to fully embrace the Avanti,\u201d said John Kraman, a television commentator and an analyst for Mecum Auctions.The mood created by the Monterey-area auctions, which typically set the tone of the market for the rest of the year and perhaps beyond, was far more upbeat than had generally been expected.For those inclined to worry, plenty of concerns remain on the horizon for the collector car market. It is an actuarial certainty that car collections amassed by baby boomers will come to market in increasing numbers, and probably relatively soon. It is unclear whether Gen Xers and millennials will have the money or the interest to absorb such an abundant supply of collectible cars.But that is hand-wringing for another day. For now, the strong breeze coming off Monterey Bay on Sunday could easily have been mistaken for a collective sigh of relief.Advertisement"}

David Davis, Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary, urged his interlocutors to be \u201cmore imaginative and flexible\u201d in its approach.At times, Mrs. May has seemed almost a bystander in the debates within her own cabinet. When she took an extended vacation during the feuding this summer, her absence was barely noticed.Ultimately, Conservative lawmakers will decide whether \u2014 or when \u2014 her leadership should end, with the next test being her reception at the party\u2019s annual convention in October.Potential successors, like the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, and Mr. Davis, may be circling, but none calculate it is in their interests to strike now. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has struggled on the international stage, and Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and arguably the party\u2019s best performer, does not have a seat at the Westminster Parliament, which she would need to become leader.Speculation has even grown about the leadership prospects of Jacob Rees-Mogg, a cerebral lawmaker who is almost a caricature of an old-line Tory.This does not resolve Labour\u2019s long-term dilemma about the sort of Brexit it wants. But it does give the party the chance to harry Mrs. May in Parliament, where she will battle to pass the legislation she needs for Brexit, and where a small number of Conservative lawmakers favor Labour\u2019s policy.A parliamentary defeat there could topple Mrs. May. Yet, if she retreats, and falls into line with Labour\u2019s plans for a transition, that may destabilize her own party and anger her Brexit hard-liners.Either situation would benefit Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who is himself a Euroskeptic, but whose priority is to force another general election, which he thinks he can win.But speaking on the BBC, the magazine\u2019s political editor, James Forsyth, concluded that most of the party\u2019s lawmakers would not even try. The reason the reaction to her latest statement was relatively muted, he said, is that \u201cthey don\u2019t take it that seriously.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yellen Warns Against Erasing Regulations Made After Financial Crisis", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, delivered a strong rebuttal on Friday to Republican criticism that financial regulation is impeding economic growth.In a speech that amounted to a warning to the Trump administration, Ms. Yellen said that people were forgetting the lessons of the crisis that began a decade ago.\u201cAlready, for some, memories of this experience may be fading \u2014 memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and why certain steps were taken in response,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen\u2019s forceful support for financial regulation may complicate her prospects for renomination as Fed chairwoman. Her four-year term ends in February, and President Trump has said he is considering whether to name someone else in her place. Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, whom Mr. Trump has described as a candidate for the Fed job, is an architect of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans.Speaking at an annual conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Ms. Yellen said increased regulation had strengthened the financial system. She said there was little evidence that regulation had reduced the availability of credit. But even if safety had come at some cost, she urged a focus on the bigger picture: Financial crises cause large declines in the availability of credit for virtually everyone.She also cautioned against overconfidence, noting that policy makers gathered at this same conference a decade ago were optimistic about the resilience of the system \u2014 which was even then in the process of falling apart. One goal of the changes enacted since the crisis is to guard against the problems that regulators do not anticipate.\u201cThe events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented and these reforms have made the system safer,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to reduce financial regulation. He told a round table of business leaders in February that his friends could not get loans.\u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,\u201d he said, referring to the 2010 law signed by President Barack Obama that strengthened financial regulation.Ms. Yellen, who rarely spoke about regulatory issues during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, has been increasingly outspoken in defense of those changes.Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory policy consulting firm, described the comments as a watershed moment for the Fed. Historically, she said, Fed officials have deferred to politicians on regulatory issues to preserve the Fed from a backlash that might limit its independence to make monetary policy.\u201cI think the Fischer-Yellen counterattack is unprecedented in its openness, and signals the strong commitment since the crisis by the Fed \u2014 at least this board \u2014 to a new dual mandate: macroeconomic growth and financial stability,\u201d she said.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, joined the chorus in a lunchtime address.\u201cThere is never a good time for having lax regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cAny reversal would call into question whether the lessons of the crisis have indeed been learned.\u201dBoth Ms. Yellen and Mr. Draghi took the day off from saying anything of substance about monetary policy, although Mr. Draghi said in response to a question that the European Central Bank needed to be \u201cvery patient\u201d in deciding how long to maintain its stimulus campaign.The world\u2019s major economies are all expanding for the first time since the financial crisis, but the pace of growth remains disappointingly slow. The annual conference here brings together officials from around the world, and much of the discussion has focused on ways to increase growth. There is a consensus that monetary policy has done what it can.Mr. Draghi argued that the developed world must remain committed to globalization, which he described as critical to future prosperity. The importance of trade \u201cmay actually be growing\u201d because developed nations must rely on innovation, particularly given the burdens of aging work forces and high levels of public debt. He highlighted research that shows openness to trade keeps national economies closer to the technological frontier.\u201cTo foster a dynamic global economy, we need to resist protectionist urges,\u201d he said.\u201cThe pain is real,\u201d said Ann Harrison, a University of Pennsylvania economist. \u201cThis may seem obvious to us, but for many decades, economists just assumed trade was win-win. And either there were no losers, or those losers were being appropriately compensated.\u201dThere was broad agreement that more should be done for those workers, but there were few ideas beyond better education and better jobs.Mostly, the economists gathered here expressed hope that people would embrace the broader benefits of trade rather than focusing on the narrow costs. \u201cAll I can hope is that we are having a pause in the progress toward peaceful economic integration,\u201d rather than a permanent decline, said John Van Reenen, an economics professor at M.I.T.In a similar vein, Ms. Yellen argued that the United States must remain committed to strong financial regulation to provide a stable foundation for economic growth.\u201cEnhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, thereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen extended an olive branch to the Trump administration, saying the Fed wanted to improve regulations, including easing the burden on smaller banks and reviewing restrictions on investment activity by larger banks. But she emphasized that she was not proposing the kind of major overhaul favored by Mr. Trump. \u201cAny adjustments to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks associated with the reforms put in place in recent years,\u201d she said.One specific difference concerns the Fed\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests\u201d of large financial institutions. Randal Quarles, nominated by Mr. Trump to serve as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman of supervision, has described the tests as too rigorous and too complicated. Ms. Yellen said testing \u201chas contributed to significant improvements in risk management.\u201dShe noted that large banks have shifted to a more stable mix of financing. Funding from equity investors, or capital, has doubled, while the least stable funding, short-term wholesale borrowing, has been cut roughly in half. \u201cBanks are safer,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

Japanese are the single biggest group, and South Koreans aren\u2019t far behind \u2014 and to them, bluster from North Korea may seem like old news.Flights to Guam from South Korea and Japan take about half the time it would take to get to Hawaii, another popular destination for tourists from East Asia.Visitors have continued to pack the hotels, beaches and shopping malls of Guam in recent days, showing little concern about recent threats.Lee Hyun-soo from Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital, was visiting while on leave from his compulsory military service. The island felt calm despite recent events, he said as he stood outside the UnderWater World aquarium.\u201cIt\u2019s so much safer than South Korea, maybe five times safer,\u201d said Mr. Lee, 21.At the Eggs \u2019n Things restaurant, the line for a table wraps around the building most mornings. At Tumon Beach, home to the island\u2019s main tourist hotels, crowds flow onto the sand to take pictures of the sun setting over the Pacific. And at a mall filled with luxury stores, shoppers stop to take photos as dancers in grass skirts perform in front of a Burberry outlet.\u201cEveryone here is very relaxed,\u201d said Vivian Chan, 28, from Taipei, Taiwan, as she finished a bowl of cold udon noodles from a Japanese food stand.She had feared that North Korea might launch missiles on Aug. 15, a national holiday. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s Liberation Day passed without a problem, so we aren\u2019t worried,\u201d she said.The Dusit Thani Guam Resort had \u201ca handful\u201d of cancellations, but the impact was minimal, said Marissa Borja, public relations and marketing manager for the Thai-owned hotel.\u201cWe still see a strong surge of Korean guests,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir overall sentiment was, like everyone else, they were saying, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re kind of used to this sort of thing.\u2019 To have them tell us that is quite reassuring.\u201dLast year a record 144,758 people came to Guam in August, the peak month for travel here, said Josh Tyquiengco, a spokesman for the Guam Visitors Bureau. As of Aug. 15, visitors are up 3 percent over last year, he said.\u201cWhile the short-term effect of the North Korea threat appears to not have affected our industry, we need to continue to monitor what that means in the long term,\u201d he said.The United States took over Guam from Spain in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. The United States Navy governed the island until the Japanese captured it during World War II and held it for two and a half years. Hundreds of Chamorro, the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands, were killed during the Japanese occupation.Guam residents are United States citizens by birth but cannot vote in presidential elections, and the island\u2019s delegate to Congress cannot vote.In many ways, life here looks much like rural and suburban America, with ubiquitous fast food outlets, pickup trucks and pee wee football games.In Tamuning, tourist hotels line the placid Tumon Bay. Visitors paddle in the warm, shallow water and lie on the sand near concrete pillbox fortifications erected by the Japanese. Outside a mall with Givenchy, Gucci and Louis Vuitton outlets, well-fed island dogs sleep on the sidewalk.Reminders of Asia are everywhere, too. Many workers in restaurants and retail shops can handle conversations in several Asian languages. Store countertops display Korean, Japanese and Chinese language guides to United States coins and bills. Strip malls have businesses like Convenience Store Osaka, Gangnam Korean Restaurant and many gun ranges for visitors from countries where firearms are tightly restricted.\u201cThe Asian tourists like it here because they can get a little bit of America,\u201d said Josh Melliza, manager of the Kicks/HI Guam shoe and clothing shop. \u201cThey can get huge hamburgers, not little tiny ones.\u201dMr. Melliza said he\u2019d seen no noticeable decline in business recently.\u201cThe South Koreans all say they feel safe here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for us, it\u2019s nothing new. We\u2019re used to it. And we do feel safe with the military presence. It\u2019s 2017, there should be technology to shoot down a missile.\u201dAs the westernmost United States territory, Guam is a key to the American military presence in the Pacific. Armed forces here could be called on in conflicts over the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, the South China Sea or other regional hot spots. The island is home to a naval station, an air base and about 7,000 military personnel.Increases in military spending for Guam, including plans to shift Marines here from Okinawa, have lifted growth, and it is still the most important sector of the island\u2019s economy. On Thursday, the Department of Defense awarded a $164 million contract for utilities and site improvements for the future Marine base.With tourism as the other pillar of the economy, the balancing act can be awkward.\u201cMilitary spending and tourism is the basis for our economy and the forces that drive those are not always compatible,\u201d said Robert Underwood, the president of the University of Guam and former delegate for the island to the United States House of Representatives.\u201cThe island, half of it is rooting for instability so you get more military spending, the other half is rooting for more stability so you get more tourism,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a duality, our existence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Democrats Seek to Outdo Trump on Trade", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats on Wednesday began an effort to outdo President Trump on a signature issue: protecting American workers from foreign competition.Democrats, outflanked by Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign, are seeking to recapture the loyalty of voters convinced that globalization is eroding their fortunes and prospects.They introduced a set of proposals built around two ideas: preventing unfair foreign competition and providing government support for domestic industries.The highlights include a new agency to prevent foreign investments that would harm the domestic economy, and tax incentives for \u201creshoring\u201d jobs, or bringing jobs back to the United States, from overseas.The political challenge for Democrats is that the proposals echo Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas on trade. Even the rhetoric Wednesday had a distinctly Trumpian flavor.\u201cThey\u2019re rapacious, the Chinese,\u201d declared Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the minority leader and moving spirit behind the proposals. \u201cThey do not play by the rules. And we sit there.\u201dBut Mr. Schumer sought to draw a distinction between Democrats and Mr. Trump. \u201cThe problem is President Trump has talked a good game and done virtually nothing on trade but study it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need action. If President Trump wants to work with us to get things done, good.\u201dThe proposals reflect the sharp change in the political debate about trade since the 2016 election. The Republican Party strongly supported increased trade in recent decades while Democrats made an uneasy peace with globalization. Now Mr. Trump has upended Republican dogma, and Democrats are embracing their own protectionist heritage.The turn toward protectionism in the United States and other developed nations, notably Britain, has alarmed proponents of trade who argue that globalization has made the world wealthier, healthier and happier in recent decades. While acknowledging trade has disrupted the lives of many workers, experts caution that protectionist policies will not reverse the damage.\u201cI\u2019m both saddened and furious that the Senate Dems have jumped on the protectionist bandwagon so fully, with all the rhetorical flourish\u201d said Robert Howse, a law professor at New York University who specializes in international trade. \u201cAs a matter of policy, none of these measures, on any plausible economic theory, would result in improving the circumstances of U.S. workers, addressing inequality, or the socioeconomic challenges specific to the U.S. heartland.\u201dBut politicians have taken Mr. Trump\u2019s success as evidence that the political wind is blowing in a different direction.\u201cAnyone that believes that free trade is fair trade, come to West Virginia,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from the state.The first set of proposals was presented by a group of liberal congressional Democrats. On Wednesday, Mr. Schumer was joined by the more conservative members of his caucus, including Mr. Manchin and Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana.One recurring theme: new agencies. On Wednesday, for example, Democrats proposed the creation of a trade prosecutor to pursue complaints about unfair trade practices. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, and the Commerce Department, have similar responsibilities.Other proposals break new ground, like an American Jobs Security Council to review foreign investments in American companies. It is modeled on an existing body that prevents investments that undermine national security; the new body would be responsible for preventing \u201cdetrimental economic impacts.\u201dAs an example, the plan says the council could have blocked the proposed purchase of the Chicago Stock Exchange by Chinese investors. The deal is under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Democrats also cited the proposed sale of Aleris, an Ohio aluminum company, to a Chinese rival.Democrats also called for changes in the tax code to penalize companies that move jobs out of the country, and to reward companies that return jobs to the United States \u2014 particularly to rural and economically disadvantaged areas.The Democratic proposals closely track Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric in other areas. It backs the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. It calls for a crackdown on currency manipulation by foreign nations. It also would strengthen laws requiring taxpayer-funded projects to use American materials and services, just like Mr. Trump\u2019s staple \u201cBuy American\u201d theme.\u201cTaxpayer money should not be spent on foreign products like iron and steel from China and Russia,\u201d said Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin.The proposal highlights the odd politics of the current moment. Ms. Baldwin has introduced \u201cBuy American\u201d legislation, and Mr. Trump has endorsed it, but it does not have the support of the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s party.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grandpa Had a Pension. This Generation Has Cryptocurrency.", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuture TenseCryptocurrency has understandable appeal to millennials who came of age during the 2008 financial crisis and are now watching the rise of antiglobalist populism threaten the stability of the international economy.\u201cThere\u2019s a low cost for entry, you don\u2019t pay a lot of fees and millennials are the most tech-savvy,\u201d said John Guarco, 22, a recent Duke graduate living on Staten Island who, like most of the people interviewed for this article, asked that names of the coins in which he has invested not be published for fear of being targeted by hackers.Unlike previous generations, many of these greenhorn investors don\u2019t have pensions or 401(k)\u2019s, are mistrustful of socking money away in mutual funds and are fully accustomed to owning digital assets that have no concrete properties. As traditional paths to upper-middle-class stability are being blocked by debt, exorbitant housing costs and a shaky job market, these investors view cryptocurrency not only as a hedge against another Dow Jones crash, but also as the most rational \u2014 and even utopian \u2014 means of investing their money.Sebastian Dinges, 33, the director of operations for Cheeky, a company that makes mealtime products, started his first job after college in 2007. Once he had enough money to invest in the stock market, he said, he \u201cwanted to be risky and get a big return.\u201d Within six months, the market crashed.\u201cSo there\u2019s definitely disillusionment,\u201d he said.The majority of Mr. Dinges\u2019s holdings are now in cryptocurrency. His skepticism of traditional markets is shared by a number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts in his age bracket who have observed the recent political and economic upheavals.Mr. Wax was still in high school when the 2008 crisis unfolded, but he was paying attention to the headlines. So was Mr. Guarco, who said cryptocurrency was a \u201csafeguard against the volatility in the rest of the world.\u201d\u201cInvesting in cryptocurrencies is a hedge,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a period of long-term deregulation and tax cuts to the wealthiest. It\u2019s not the best recipe for stability.\u201dMr. Wax also invests in cryptocurrency to shore up his finances as a freelancer in the precarious music industry.\u201cI constantly feel like I\u2019m looking over the edge of a cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of money just sitting in a savings account \u2014 with the way inflation works and how low interest rates are, you\u2019re losing money. There\u2019s less money than there\u2019s ever been in the history of recorded music, so that gives me anxiety. It\u2019s weird to say that owning cryptocurrency soothes that anxiety, because it\u2019s counterintuitive, but it does.\u201dNevertheless, it\u2019s not just twentysomethings in the gig economy who are losing faith in traditional investment tools. Mr. Ginn quit working at Fidelity Investments the day before the market crash in 2008.\u201cIt\u2019s not investing,\u201d he said of his old job. \u201cIt\u2019s just sticking money somewhere. The investment advisory industry has to give out watered-down, averaged-out advice. When you get into mutual funds, you lose a lot of the ability to beat the markets.\u201dTom Berg, 44, a founder of BloKtek Capital in Northbrook, Ill., which invests in digital currencies and assets, said: \u201cI got out of the stock market years ago. \u201cMy personal opinion was I\u2019m not going to fight for 2 or 3 percent. It\u2019s a conservative place.\u201d By contrast, digital currencies \u2014 his preferred term to cryptocurrency, which he says carries the stigma of black-market money laundering \u2014 have disrupted the internet and created a major opportunity for those willing to jump in early, Mr. Berg believes. \u201cAt first it was an internet of information,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it evolved to an internet of things \u2014 social media, I can buy this, I can sell stuff. Now it\u2019s the internet of value.\u201dIn his view, cryptocurrency left the \u201cdark ages\u201d six months ago, when it was still the domain of \u201ca lot of people who believed in anarchy.\u201d He thinks that cryptocurrency is a good five years from going mainstream and that the bubble will burst some time after that, at which point he will sell his assets.\u201cIf my landscaper ever asks me about crypto, that\u2019s the day I get out,\u201d he said.Assuming one\u2019s money is protected, there are, of course, the standard risks of investing, amplified by the volatility of cryptocurrency. It\u2019s common for a coin to fluctuate double-digit percentages within a day, often because of \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d techniques from coordinated users trying to manipulate prices in completely unregulated free markets.\u201cThis is a great opportunity to pull it out and put it toward fixing the house,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the future potential is not worth it.\u201dMr. Berg would agree, advising BloKtek Capital clients to \u201cset it and forget it\u201d and not fall prey to the temptation to make short-term transactions.\u201cMy wife and I use it as our bank account,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery paycheck, we put a percentage into long-term holdings. We do not expect to become rich overnight. That\u2019s a way to become very poor in one hour.\u201d (Though his wife works at his company, it bears mentioning here that the vast majority of cryptocurrency investors seem to be male, and their Twitter discourse tends to be less than refined, with insults often lodged at devotees of rival currencies.)Even those in it for the long haul, however, admit to monitoring the prices compulsively, scratching the gambler\u2019s itch.\u201cIf I have a moment where the price has left my mind, I\u2019ll want to reinsert it,\u201d Mr. Wax, the record producer, said. \u201cI check it as much as any social media. It\u2019s become as distracting as anything else on my phone.\u201dAs he works in the cryptocurrency world, Mr. Berg maintains an even more observant \u2014 and most likely exhausting \u2014 regimen.\u201cI\u2019m always watching the markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe saying is, \u2018Crypto never sleeps.\u2019 It\u2019s 24/7, it\u2019s global, it doesn\u2019t have a stock market, it doesn\u2019t have a bell.\u201cI sleep about four hours a day.\u201d\u201cThe financial gain is fun, but it\u2019s really about improving the world, improving the financial system, transparency, cost, increased speed,\u201d Mr. Ginn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the double-sided tape for society. When financial markets collapse, the tape rips people apart and you have a system collapse. Finance got away with it in \u201908; it almost took the world down, and nothing changed.\u201d In lieu of more stringent government oversight, he believes that Ripple can help \u201creduce systemic risk.\u201dThat safety-net altruism drives Yoni Saltzman, 24, who designs robotic mechanisms for aerospace and medical applications. Mr. Saltzman has holdings in four different cryptocurrencies and is working with a small team in New York to develop a digital coin it hopes to introduce within a year. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like the idea of not only changing the world, but saving the world.\u201dThis is, of course, the same vaguely idealistic rationale Silicon Valley executives routinely trot out to justify their ventures, not all of which seem especially concerned with the greater good. In the meantime, those who have boarded the crypto-train frequently proselytize to friends and family. Unsurprisingly, they have more luck with their younger peers. Mr. Guarco, the Duke graduate, has persuaded a few friends to take the plunge.His older relatives, however, unaccustomed to coins that one can\u2019t pluck out of a lint-filled pocket, are a harder sell.\u201cThey usually respond, \u2018Crypto-what?\u2019\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article omitted an explanation of the online term \u201chodl,\u201d which has come to mean \u201chold on for dear life.\u201d It was originally a misspelling of \u201chold,\u201d not an acronym.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oil Companies at Last See Path to Profits After Painful Spell", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABERDEEN, Scotland \u2014 This port city built of granite on the North Sea has taken a battering in recent years. Plunging oil prices hit the petroleum industry, which dominates the economy. Tens of thousands of jobs were slashed. Projects worth billions of dollars were sent back to the drawing board.Oil executives here now speak with a relief similar to survivors of a fierce storm.\u201cI feel good about the North Sea, to tell you the truth,\u201d Mark J. Thomas, North Sea regional president for the oil giant BP, said in an interview at the company\u2019s offices near Aberdeen\u2019s airport. \u201cIt is remarkably different than where we were even just a few years ago.\u201dThe brighter mood masks what had been a difficult path for the energy sector around the world.When oil prices fell, the industry scrambled to adjust. It initially relied on tried-and-true tactics: cutting jobs and investment. But then companies realized they had to go further, starting a far-reaching reworking of their businesses to embrace new technologies and construction methods to stretch each dollar just a little more.Companies now reckon that current price levels will most likely persist, and that the $100 oil of a few years ago was \u201ca great aberration,\u201d Daniel Yergin, the oil historian, said in an interview. Indeed, BP\u2019s chief executive, Robert Dudley, said on Tuesday he was planning on the basis that oil prices would remain around their current levels for the next five years.\u201cNobody is standing around, waiting for prices to go up substantially,\u201d said Mr. Yergin, vice chairman of the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThe industry is in the middle of re-engineering its processes and its technologies to be a $50 industry, not a $100 industry.\u201dMany companies have moved to simplify the construction of rigs and platforms, big-ticket items that cut into profit.In an era of higher oil prices, companies loaded up oil exploration sites with expensive custom-made extras. But they are moving forward now with stripped-down projects featuring standardized designs aimed at cutting costs.BP, for example, sent a $20 billion Gulf of Mexico project called Mad Dog Phase 2 back for a rework. Instead of a giant specially built platform nicknamed Big Dog, the engineers used a smaller apparatus resembling one they were using on another field and reduced the number of wells by a third. When Mad Dog received the green light last year, the price tag had been cut to $9 billion.Innovations by suppliers are also reducing costs. Aker Solutions, a Norwegian company that supplies the industry with undersea equipment like pipes and processing centers, is working on powering much of this underwater gear with electricity instead of traditional hydraulic fluid, a shift that could cut the costs of undersea projects by 30 percent.Companies are also looking to data and technology to help extract more oil from the ground, and relying more on video conferences and streaming rather than sending staff members offshore.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cIt is difficult when prices are really high, because you are really scrambling,\u201d said Greta Lydecker, Chevron\u2019s managing director for exploration and production in the region. \u201cYou are almost getting to a point where you are chasing things, and that is not a good place to be.\u201dWhen the price of oil dropped, the poor financial performance of many North Sea fields became impossible to ignore. Then, the cuts came.Major investments were put on the back burner or scrapped entirely. That, in turn, sent rates plummeting for activities and services like drilling. Between 2014 and 2016, about a quarter of Britain\u2019s oil-related jobs disappeared, according to the trade body Oil & Gas UK; in all, 120,000 people lost work.More still needed to be done.Companies began embracing data analysis not just to locate pockets of oil and gas deep beneath the sea floor, but also to improve production efficiency. When a problem crops up in an oil field, for instance, BP engineers can now pull up data on any of the company\u2019s vast network of wells around the world to find solutions that have worked in the past.\u201cBefore, what we would have had to do is scrabble through piles of papers and reports,\u201d said Dave Lynch, BP\u2019s vice president for reservoir development in the North Sea.The company also began using that data to shut down some wells to gain more production from others, or to fine-tune the volumes of natural gas it injected into its fields to maintain pressure and pump oil to the surface. Mr. Lynch estimates that computer modeling has helped BP boost overall production by 3 to 5 percent in the region.Operators are using technology to save on staff costs, as well. BP and Chevron are gingerly experimenting with taking some employees from offshore production platforms and having them do their jobs remotely on the mainland, a change that would cut the hefty costs of flying them on helicopters and providing them with food and other necessities.They have also built centers in key parts of the world, including Aberdeen, that are linked by video to installations that are sometimes far at sea. Initially, staff members were skeptical and workers said they were effectively being spied on.

That figure is now around $55, a drastic cut, albeit one that still leaves costs higher than world oil prices. Major companies are well insulated from day-to-day moves in oil prices, not just by hedging against prices but also because they sell a wide variety of other energy products.Despite the progress, plenty of challenges remain.In the short term, traditional oil companies must face off against the shale energy industry in the United States. Not only is shale plentiful, but operators have also lowered costs by improving drilling routines and finding other economies of scale.But in the North Sea, the change has nevertheless been marked.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been in a profitable position for years,\u201d Mr. Thomas of BP said.

{"Headline": "Teamsters Union Tries to Slow Self-Driving Truck Push", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe Teamsters are throwing a wrench into the works of the self-driving movement.The union has persuaded United States lawmakers to exempt commercial trucks from a bill allowing more autonomous vehicles on the roads. Granted, 3.5 million jobs are at stake. But as Tesla Motors joins Daimler A.G. and others in the big-rig tech race, it\u2019d be smarter to prepare haulers for a career shift.Congress is expected to tackle the first federal legislation on self-driving vehicles in September after it returns from summer recess. The bipartisan plan raises the cap on permitted vehicles that don\u2019t have common features such as a steering wheel, or meet certain safety requirements, to 100,000 a year from the current limit of 2,500.The Teamsters successfully lobbied to exclude vehicles over 10,000 pounds. Yet the technology is rapidly advancing. Daimler was testing a self-driving rig on Nevada\u2019s roads in 2015. Last year, Otto, a start-up now owned by Uber, made one of the first known deliveries by an autonomous truck \u2014 50,000 cans of beer. This week, Reuters reported that Tesla was developing an electric, driverless semi-truck. Alphabet\u2019s Waymo is making similar moves.The union has opposed other policy pushes, such as states wanting to allow companies to use what is known as platooning technology. This would digitally connect a group of trucks so they drive in a gas-saving formation. It is seen as a precursor to autonomous trucks, and Arkansas, Tennessee and South Carolina are among the states considering such a move.Fast adoption of such technology is in the industry\u2019s and economy\u2019s interest, too. Commercial trucking plays a key role in the American economy, delivering about 70 percent of goods. The industry generates more than $700 billion a year in revenue. Yet the average age of truckers is 49, and a worker shortage is projected to rise to 240,000 drivers by 2022, according to the American Trucking Associations.Perhaps the Teamsters are trying to ensure these older workers can reach retirement age without fear of being dumped by the side of the road. But the advent of masses of autonomous vehicles of any stripe is at least a decade away. Even then, human drivers may still be in demand for short-haul trips. And younger truckers will need retraining before autonomy fully kicks in.Gearing workers up for this inevitability is a better labor strategy than obstructionism.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Coding Boot Camps Close, the Field Faces a Reality Check", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "Successful schools, analysts say, will increasingly be the ones that expand their programs to suit the changing needs of employers.Supported byIn the last five years, dozens of schools have popped up offering an unusual promise: Even humanities graduates can learn how to code in a few months and join the high-paying digital economy. Students and their hopeful parents shelled out as much as $26,000 seeking to jump-start a career.But the coding boot-camp field now faces a sobering moment, as two large schools have announced plans to shut down this year \u2014 despite backing by major for-profit education companies, Kaplan and the Apollo Education Group, the parent of the University of Phoenix.The closings are a sign that years of heady growth led to a boot-camp glut, and that the field could be in the early stages of a shakeout.The demand from employers is shifting and the schools must adapt. Many boot camps have not evolved beyond courses in basic web development, but companies are now often looking for more advanced coding skills.It is now closing at the end of the year.Tarlin Ray, who became president of Dev Bootcamp in April, said in an email that the school offered \u201ca high-quality program\u201d that helped thousands of people join the high-tech economy. \u201cBut we were simply unable to find a sustainable business model,\u201d he wrote.Iron Yard echoed that theme. In an email, Lelia King, a spokeswoman, said that while students benefited, the company was \u201cultimately unable to sustain our current business model.\u201dBoot camp courses, aimed at adults, vary in length and cost. Some can take 26 weeks or more, and tuition can reach $26,000. The average course length is just over 14 weeks, and the average cost is $11,400, according to Course Report.The successful schools, analysts say, will increasingly be ones that expand their programs to suit the changing needs of employers. Some have already added courses like data science, artificial intelligence, digital marketing and project management. Other steps include tailoring courses for corporations, which need to update the skills of their workers, or develop online courses.The promise of boot camps is that they are on-ramps to good jobs. But rapid expansion into new cities can leave little time to forge ties with nearby companies, the hiring market for boot camp graduates, said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.That message was underlined by Mr. Ray of Dev Bootcamp. While he would not discuss specifics about what happened to his school, he wrote: \u201cWe do think that as the boot camp industry continues on, it will be important to create stronger alignment with employers.\u201d\u201cEmployer-paid programs are now a big slice of the pie\u201d for General Assembly, about half of its business, said Jake Schwartz, its chief executive.Kaplan is not closing Metis, a data science boot camp, which has corporate training programs.Several boot camps are deploying \u201cblended\u201d models with both in-person and online teaching. Entirely online courses, in theory, could deliver rapid, profitable growth. But that is a different model from the immersive, face-to-face learning that has been the hallmark of the boot camp experience.\u201cOnline boot camp is an oxymoron,\u201d said Mr. Craig of University Ventures. \u201cNo one has figured out how to do that yet.\u201dIn late 2015, the co-founders, Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum, decided to try an online-only offering, Learn.co. The tuition is $1,500 a month. Students go at their own pace, and on average complete the course in seven months, putting in about 800 hours. Tuition charges stop after eight months \u2014 and there are instructors online 16 hours a day for help and advice.Kailee Gray, 29, a math instructor in Fargo, N.D., seeking a career change, said she had communicated daily with instructors and participated in online study groups. On the night before a job interview, she recalled \u201cgetting panicked\u201d and sent a message to an instructor. Soon, Rebekah Rombom, vice president for career services at Flatiron, was on the phone for a reassuring pep talk.It seems a particularly high rate for an online course, especially when compared with free online courses, which only a small proportion of students complete.But just how much is uncertain. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that they can do it at the scale they have,\u201d said Thomas Eisenmann, a professor and lead author of the study. \u201cWhat\u2019s not clear is whether it can go from a hundred or a few hundred to thousands and thousands.\u201dFollow Steve Lohr @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Whaling Way of Life Under Threat", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLamalera JournalLAMALERA, Indonesia \u2014 The pilot whales glided through the crystalline waters in neat formation, blue-gray backs glinting in the sun, on their migration through Indonesia\u2019s Savu Sea. Suddenly a small motorboat revved its engine and charged at them, and a man on board launched a harpoon at one of the largest.There was a splash of blood \u2014 and then a slow death, as the harpooned whale bobbed in the water, unable to free itself. The sailors plunged more harpoons into it, and about 30 minutes later a crew member slipped into the water and finished off the struggling creature with a knife to the spine.Fishermen from the small whaling village of Lamalera, on a sunbaked island in remote eastern Indonesia, have been hunting whales for centuries. They still do, now with permission from the Indonesian government, as long as it is for their own consumption and not for commercial sale. They may also hunt dolphins and mantas for their own use.But as the government cuts down on illegal fishing in the Savu Sea, trying to conserve a critical migratory route for whale and dolphin species, conservationists are calling for a strict regulation of Lamaleran hunting practices, too.\u201cThis is not basic needs. This is really beyond that,\u201d said Glaudy Perdanahardja, an official with The Nature Conservancy, which is based in the United States but has an office in Indonesia that focuses on the Savu Sea. He suggested that islanders were no longer hunting merely for subsistence, but also for commercial purposes.Although the group acknowledges the importance of whaling to the community, it worries that the introduction of motorboats to Lamalera more than a decade ago has led to the killing of more marine life. Nowadays, Lamalerans use motorboats to hunt dolphins, mantas and pilot whales, rather than traditional sailboats. While they still use sailboats to harpoon sperm whales, they sometimes use motorboats to tow the sailboats to the whales to speed up the chase.\u201cNow they can go farther and catch things they could not originally catch,\u201d said Yusuf Fajariyanto of the conservancy, who visited Lamalera in 2015 to observe the hunting practices.But Lamalerans bristle at efforts by outsiders to regulate their fishing practices. \u201cThe sea is our mother,\u201d said Aloisius Gnneser Tapoona, 63, a grizzled harpooner who said he had killed around 80 sperm whales in four decades of hunting. \u201cThose who would restrict our access to the sea are those who would kill our mother.\u201d\u201cVillagers of Lamalera are born from the whale,\u201d continued Mr. Tapoona, whose house is decorated with trophies from the whales he has harpooned. Their bones are displayed in a sculpture garden at the front of his yard. \u201cI always tell my child, \u2018Your bones are from the whale. Your blood is from the whale. Your flesh is from the whale.\u2019\u201dMr. Tapoona estimated that Lamalerans catch around 20 sperm whales a year along with uncountable numbers of smaller pilot whales, dolphins and mantas. The village\u2019s hard and rocky soil makes growing crops impossible, so villagers have no choice but to take full advantage of what the sea provides, he said.Still, there are signs that Lamalera\u2019s fishermen are trafficking in wildlife parts, which villagers say is related to changing economic times.Over the last decade, cash has become an inescapable part of village life, as the barter economy fades. A local credit union opened in town a few years ago, offering loans for villagers to pay for modern needs like motor oil and their children\u2019s education.Over cigarettes and tuak, a foamy alcoholic drink made from palm fruit, fishermen confessed that loans had become a problem. A few bad catches, they said, and they could fall behind on their payments and slide deeper into debt.He was released after Lamalera elders raced to the police station, a day\u2019s journey away, to demand his return, arguing that he did not know any better.Sitting outside his ramshackle brick home, Mr. Krova said selling his catch, without regard to the species\u2019 protected status, had allowed him, a man with a fourth-grade education, to pay for his children\u2019s university attendance.He said he had no intention of violating the law. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm in us selling fish?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t stolen and it isn\u2019t illegal drugs.\u201dLeonardo Lowokrore, the village priest, said that the law was clear, but that many villagers don\u2019t understand. He added that Japanese and Chinese buyers frequently visited Lamalera to purchase delicacies like shark fins, but said he has counseled Lamalerans that selling protected species was no way to earn a living.\u201cThere are many other ways to get your kid through school,\u201d like catching unprotected fish species, or catering to occasional international tourists, he said.Brahmantya Poerwadi, a director general at Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries in Jakarta, said he planned to meet with conservation groups and villagers to develop alternative methods of fishing to reduce the killing of protected species. \u201cI honor the tribe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the thing is we need to do something.\u201dThe villagers say they are fine as they are.Each Friday, on market day, villagers from a fertile hill region nearby descend on Lamalera to trade produce that Lamalera\u2019s thin soil cannot support, a practice considered legal. As a small red dust kicks up in the wind, Lamaleran women try to barter whole fish and slabs of whale meat for corn, vegetables and tobacco.\u201cWhale meat is the most delicious,\u201d said Yustina Prami, an older Lamalera woman with a hunched back and a mouth stained red by betel juice. Although she barters her flying fish for corn, she will accept only cash for her dried sperm whale meat, a sign of its value.\u201cThe whale is different from other fish,\u201d said Aloysius Enga Beding, a middle-aged fisherman who, like many Lamalerans, believes sperm whales are a gift from the village\u2019s ancestors. \u201cSharks and mantas are for whoever catches them. But whales are big. They\u2019re for the entire community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Educator Makes the Case That Higher Learning Needs to Grow Up", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.American higher education still operates on a model of academic disciplines, lecture-driven teaching and ubiquitous testing that was put in place in the 19th century. Society, economy, technology and careers have all changed dramatically. But though academics pride themselves on their intellectual creativity, universities have changed less than business, the military or the practice of religion. Mostly, they\u2019ve grown. Professional schools and \u201cbig science\u201d are largely new developments. But the core model for undergraduate education is pretty much the same.In \u201cThe New Education,\u201d Cathy N. Davidson argues that college could be so much better. She takes her title from an essay by Charles Eliot, the 19th-century Harvard president who largely pioneered the old model. Of course, Eliot worked when universities were few and small, and his ideas shaped their growth. Higher education is now a \u201cmature industry.\u201dDavidson argues persuasively that student-centered, active learning can transform classrooms and even online courses. Technology itself is neither the enemy nor the solution (recent fantasies about massive open online courses, or MOOCs, notwithstanding). She rightly rails against both rising costs and a public defunding of higher education that together mean students graduate with huge debt burdens and accordingly make educational choices based on guesses at how they can best pay them off rather than what they want to learn or how they can best contribute to the world. She criticizes disciplinary departments as too dominant and points out that neither the world\u2019s problems nor its jobs are organized entirely by academic disciplines. She complains that ubiquitous grading and ranking of both students and schools have produced not only an obsession with hierarchical standing but also an approach focused more on exclusivity and weeding out than on helping everyone learn.Happily, Davidson also presents some heroes. She praises LaGuardia Community College and community colleges generally for showing that creativity and active learning are compatible with open admission. She is enthusiastic about Arizona State University\u2019s experiments in replacing the academic department structure with integrative fields of study oriented to solving real-world problems. She likes Georgetown\u2019s effort to empower students in its own efforts to innovate. She praises Hampshire College for ending reliance on standardized tests. Yet the Hampshire example is also poignant. It opened its doors in 1970, at the tail end of the last wave of optimistic creation of new institutions.Davidson also praises individual faculty members who teach in ways that really engage students. She even offers tips both for teachers who want to run better classes and for students who want to get more out of college. And Davidson is herself a creative teacher as well as an accomplished researcher, an innovator in the \u201cdigital humanities\u201d and an administrator who belies that label by not just running things but helping others transcend academic disciplines and the simple perpetuation of old teaching models. But part of her message is that she is an exception: The existing system dominates and discourages teachers who want to do better.Davidson\u2019s enthusiasm and her examples should inspire creativity from a lot more college teachers. And in fact there is a lot of good teaching in American higher education. But the puzzle left by Davidson\u2019s book is why the overall model has been so impervious to change. It\u2019s not just that institutions are conservative but also that they are embedded in an enormous, complex system serving many masters. Good teachers by themselves can\u2019t fix this \u2014 and part of the problem is that good teachers and a better educational experience for students aren\u2019t valued enough. To explain why would require more attention to the political economy of universities, to the contradictory demands placed on them, to the reasons public funding has been curtailed and to the transformations remaking the whole societal context for the new education. But inspiration is a fair starting point.Craig Calhoun, a sociologist and the former director of the London School of Economics, is the president of the Berggruen Institute.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chastised by E.U., a Resentful Greece Embraces China\u2019s Cash and Interests", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 After years of struggling under austerity imposed by European partners and a chilly shoulder from the United States, Greece has embraced the advances of China, its most ardent and geopolitically ambitious suitor.While Europe was busy squeezing Greece, the Chinese swooped in with bucket-loads of investments that have begun to pay off, not only economically but also by apparently giving China a political foothold in Greece, and by extension, in Europe.Last summer, Greece helped stop the European Union from issuing a unified statement against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. This June, Athens prevented the bloc from condemning China\u2019s human rights record. Days later it opposed tougher screening of Chinese investments in Europe.Greece\u2019s diplomatic stance hardly went unnoticed by its European partners or by the United States, all of which had previously worried that the country\u2019s economic vulnerability might make it a ripe target for Russia, always eager to divide the bloc.Instead, it is the Chinese who have become an increasingly powerful foreign player in Greece after years of assiduous courtship and checkbook diplomacy.Among those initiatives, China plans to make the Greek port of Piraeus the \u201cdragon head\u201d of its vast \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d project, a new Silk Road into Europe.When Germany treated Greece as the eurozone\u2019s delinquent, China designated a recovery-hungry Greece its \u201cmost reliable friend\u201d in Europe.\u201cWhile the Europeans are acting towards Greece like medieval leeches, the Chinese keep bringing money,\u201d said Costas Douzinas, the head of the Greek Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs and defense committee and a member of the governing Syriza party.China has already used its economic muscle to stamp a major geopolitical footprint in Africa and South America as it scours the globe for natural resources to fuel its economy. If China was initially welcomed as a deep-pocketed investor \u2014 and an alternative to America \u2014 it has faced growing criticism that it is less an economic partner than a 21st-century incarnation of a colonialist power.If not looking for natural resources in Europe, China has for years invested heavily across the bloc, its largest trading partner. Yet now concerns are rising that Beijing is using its economic clout for political leverage.Mr. Douzinas said China had never explicitly asked Greece for support on the human rights vote or on other sensitive issues, though he and other Greek officials acknowledge that explicit requests are not necessary.\u201cIf you\u2019re down and someone slaps you and someone else gives you an alm,\u201d Mr. Douzinas said, \u201cwhen you can do something in return, who will you help, the one who helped you or the one who slapped you?\u201dThe Trump administration, recognizing it has a geopolitical and economic challenger, recently intervened to help lift an American deal over a Chinese competitor \u2014 and the Greeks seemed happy to play one power off the other.E.U. officials are concerned that China is buying silence on human rights issues and undermining the bloc\u2019s ability to speak with one voice. Analysts say China targets smaller countries in need of cash, among them Spain, Portugal and others that suffered in the financial crisis. Hungary, where China is pledging to spend billions on a railway, also blocked the E.U. statement on the South China Sea.Many analysts have noted that Greece\u2019s human rights veto came as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras returned from a summit meeting in Beijing in May, where he signed billions of euros\u2019 worth of new investment memorandums with Chinese companies.Greek officials insisted that, despite all the Chinese investments, the country identified with, and was loyal to, the E.U. and did not do China\u2019s bidding. Some European officials are not so sure.\u201cThe Greek government needs to choose where its alliances lie and realize the E.U. is not only a market, but first and foremost a community of values,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a prominent member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands.Over the summer, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany tightened rules to limit takeovers of German strategic assets, a move aimed at Chinese state-backed firms. As Ms. Merkel put it to a German newspaper after Greece\u2019s vote blocking the condemnation of Chinese human rights violations, Europe \u201chas to speak with China in one voice.\u201dShe added that China\u2019s economic might allowed it to pressure weaker European nations. \u201cSeen from Beijing,\u201d she added, \u201cEurope is an Asian peninsula.\u201dIn January 2015, Greek voters shook Europe by electing the radical leftist Syriza party and its leader, Mr. Tsipras. He had campaigned to end the austerity measures of the E.U. and halt privatizations like the port of Piraeus. Boisterous protesters spilled into Athens, waving Syriza flags and denouncing the European power centers, Brussels and Berlin.But it was Beijing that became quietly nervous. China\u2019s years of laborious and expensive spadework in Greece suddenly seemed imperiled, especially its investments in Piraeus.Immediately after Mr. Tsipras took office, the Chinese ambassador, Zou Xiaoli, became the first foreign official to pay him a visit. Mr. Zou pressed Mr. Tsipras to honor the previous Greek government\u2019s commitments to privatize Piraeus, according to several people with knowledge of the meeting.Back in Beijing, Chinese officials expressed displeasure, and the state-run news media ran articles questioning Greece\u2019s friendship with China. Less than a week later, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, telephoned Mr. Tsipras to make sure there were no more misunderstandings.In response, Mr. Tsipras and his deputies announced an \u201cupgrading of relations between Greece and China.\u201d Within weeks, three Chinese frigates arrived in Piraeus port. At a ceremony, Mr. Tsipras affirmed Greece\u2019s intent to \u201cserve as China\u2019s gateway into Europe.\u201dEven as Berlin and Brussels grow wary of Chinese investment, Greece may not care, after suffering under German-enforced austerity attached to the international bailouts that have kept the country afloat since the 2010 debt crisis.In 2010, as creditors demanded the gutting of pensions and sharp tax increases, the Chinese offered to buy toxic Greek government bonds. In 2013, as Greece became increasingly subject to creditor budget restrictions, the Chinese spent freely on Greek assets.In turn, Greece has sometimes been a voice in the room at the E.U. for China on sensitive issues \u2014 although government officials insist Greece remains loyal to the bloc and to NATO, and is only seeking to strike a balance in a shifting world.As for scuttling the E.U. statement on China\u2019s human rights violations \u2014 the first time in a decade the bloc was silenced \u2014 government officials said Greece viewed the E.U. approach as \u201cunproductive.\u201d After the vote, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry applauded \u201cthe relevant E.U. country for sticking to the right position.\u201dAlong more than 20 miles of coastline outside Athens, a forest of cranes at the Piraeus port load and unload thousands of containers from China and around the world. An ultramodern floating dock is scheduled for arrival in November from China. A planned new Chinese-financed passenger hub is also in the works.China has transformed Piraeus into the Mediterranean\u2019s busiest port, investing nearly half a billion euros through the state-backed shipping conglomerate Cosco. It hopes to make Piraeus the entry point to Europe under its One Belt, One Road project.Chinese goods would travel along a new network of railways and roads radiating up through Central European nations, with the prized destination being Germany, where China invested $12 billion last year alone.In the middle of the port, Chinese, Greek and E.U. flags flutter in front of the headquarters of Cosco, which now controls the entire waterfront through its 67 percent stake in the port.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of neocolonialism without the gunboats,\u201d said Mr. Douzinas with a chuckle.Greek officials note that, unlike democratic nations that change politicians every few years, the Chinese have a long and steady strategic view.\u201cThey know what they want,\u201d said Stergios Pitsiorlas, the Greek deputy economics minister and one of the government\u2019s point men dealing with China.Cosco has brought around 1,000 jobs to the area, but it has outfitted cargo docks with cranes made in China, not in Greece, and expanded the docks with building materials from China. And as Greece struggles through record joblessness, the company has used subcontractors to hire around 1,500 workers mostly on short-term contracts at wages far below what unionized Greek dockworkers are paid.\u201cThere are more workers, but they earn less income,\u201d said Giorgos Gogos, the general secretary of the Piraeus dockworkers union.Yet Greece needs any jobs, and leaders are counting on more Chinese investment. Fosun International Holdings, a Chinese conglomerate run by Guo Guangchang, often referred to as China\u2019s Warren Buffett, is spending billions of euros with a consortium with Greek and Arab investors to convert an abandoned former airport on the seaside outside Athens into a posh playground three times the size of Monaco for moneyed tourists. The project, Hellenikon, is part of a bigger plan to bring over 1.5 million Chinese tourists to Greece during the next five years.Mr. Tsipras has swept aside regulatory hurdles, clearing two large refugee camps installed in the former airport, and quashing attempts by members of his own party to delay construction because of concerns the project might pave over ancient archaeological sites.\u201cThat also has been unstuck,\u201d said Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, the Greek economy minister.After World War II, the benefactor showering millions on Greece was the United States, courtesy of the Marshall Plan. America\u2019s role in Greece wasn\u2019t always popular \u2014 especially its support for the country\u2019s military dictatorship during the Cold War \u2014 but the United States was regarded as the gold standard for economic opportunity. Not so much anymore.When former President Obama visited Greece last November on his final foreign trip, some Syriza officials, bitter that his administration had not intervened more forcefully during the financial crisis, mocked his speech as a funeral oration for his own legacy, worthy of Pericles.Privately, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers said the trip also served to demonstrate, somewhat belatedly, American engagement in Greece in the face of Russian meddling in the region.But it was China that was most deeply entrenched. Eliot Engel, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described a \u201cfree-for-all for rogue countries\u201d in Greece.\u201cWe see it with Russia and we see it with China,\u201d he said as he attended a July 4 party at the United States ambassador\u2019s residence in Athens, part of a congressional delegation that had come to drum up business for American companies. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for America to be engaged in the world.\u201dMr. Tsipras is trying to play both sides. Having traveled twice in a year to Beijing to meet the Chinese president and attend One Belt, One Road forums to draw investment, he has recently welcomed American businessmen and promoted Greece\u2019s recovery to American lawmakers.In May, when Fosun and two other Chinese companies bid to take over a major Greek insurer, the United States commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross, intervened to help push the deal into the hands of Calamos Investments, a Greek-American consortium whose chief executive is a backer of President Trump. The Exin Group, a Dutch partnership with Calamos, eventually won the bid.\u201cHe sent us a letter asking us to look at Calamos,\u201d said Mr. Papadimitriou, the economy minister. Any deal, Mr. Ross implied in the letter, \u201ccould be the beginning of more investments in Greece,\u201d Mr. Papadimitriou recalled.Some Greek government officials cited Fosun\u2019s defeat as evidence that Athens wasn\u2019t under China\u2019s sway.\u201cWe are sensitive to being viewed as someone else\u2019s colony,\u201d said Panagiotis Kouroumblis, Greece\u2019s maritime minister. \u201cNothing can move forward without the agreement of the Greek state.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the Chinese ambassador, Zou Xiaoli. He is Mr. Zou, not Mr. Xiaoli.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Forerunner of Trump\u2019s Plan for Afghanistan: Joe Biden\u2019s", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A few thousand American troops to train the Afghan Army. A single-minded focus on counterterrorism, with C.I.A. drones and Special Operations units hunting down terrorists. A healthy skepticism of Pakistan as an abettor of Islamic extremism. And an explicit repudiation of grand plans to nurture a Jeffersonian democracy in Central Asia.The parallels between Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Biden\u2019s plans provided a sense of irony \u2014 even comfort \u2014 for the Washington foreign policy establishment, which has felt deeply alienated during this presidency, watching Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox statecraft with a mix of horror and dismay.But the similarities are more than a historical footnote: Mr. Biden has talked about running for president in 2020, and he would start off as a front-runner in a splintered Democratic field. If Mr. Biden were to run, he would no doubt make his foreign policy credentials, and Mr. Trump\u2019s haphazard debut on the global stage, a major theme of his campaign.Now that Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Biden\u2019s plan for Afghanistan, he has blurred a line between him and Mr. Obama\u2019s No. 2, as well as with the foreign policy establishment Mr. Trump ran against in 2016.\u201cI had a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu listening to Trump\u2019s speech,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if our national security institutions and foreign policy elite are only capable of recycling different versions of some of the same ideas discussed for more than a decade and a half on Afghanistan.\u201dMr. Biden was viewed as an outlier during the Obama administration\u2019s first troop debate on Afghanistan. Other officials favored a more ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that required large numbers of troops, with a broader mission to help the Afghans not only secure their cities, but also develop durable public institutions.In warning against that approach, Mr. Biden essentially played devil\u2019s advocate to a united front of Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary; David H. Petraeus, then the commander of Central Command; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr. Biden\u2019s points appealed to Mr. Obama, who had his own doubts about the odds of transforming Afghanistan.But ultimately, he sided with his military commanders in authorizing a broader mission, though he insisted on a time limit for starting to withdraw the troops \u2014 a proviso Mr. Trump fiercely criticized on Monday, saying it allowed the Taliban simply to wait out the Americans.The setbacks of the past eight years have largely vindicated Mr. Biden. The Obama administration quickly gave up its grandest dreams for Afghanistan, with some rebranding the policy as \u201cAfghan good enough.\u201d By the end of his presidency, Mr. Obama reluctantly agreed to leave close to 10,000 troops in the country to conduct missions not unlike what Mr. Trump described.On Monday night, Mr. Trump made arguments that Mr. Biden could have made in the Situation Room in October 2009. Afghanistan was not about to become a laboratory for American-style democracy.Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe are not nation-building again; we are killing terrorists.\u201d He used far more bellicose language than Mr. Biden. \u201cThese killers need to know they have nowhere to hide,\u201d he said. And he clothed the strategy in an ideology of total victory that Mr. Biden, who defined the mission as protecting the American homeland from terrorist attacks originating in Afghanistan, avoided.Mr. Trump shares Mr. Biden\u2019s skepticism about the reliability of Pakistan as an ally in fighting extremism. But where the former vice president invested heavily in diplomacy, Mr. Trump issued a blunt warning to Pakistan that it faced penalties \u2014 not least in terms of lost American aid \u2014 if it did not do better in eliminating sanctuaries for extremists.There are more than differences in tone between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden. The president spoke of giving Afghans tools to develop their economy, something Mr. Biden did not. He even suggested that this could defray the cost of the American mission there \u2014 a reference, officials said, to his hope that the United States could profit from extracting the country\u2019s valuable minerals.But by offering no details, Mr. Katulis said, he \u201cdidn\u2019t square it with his \u2018no nation-building\u2019 theme.\u201d\u201cBiden really knew what he was talking about,\u201d Mr. Katulis added. \u201cHe spent a lot of time on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and he knew all of the key leaders personally very well. It\u2019s pretty clear Trump doesn\u2019t suffer from so much knowledge and expertise.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about similarities between President Trump\u2019s strategy on Afghanistan and proposals made by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. quoted incorrectly from Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Monday night about Afghanistan. In a reference to terrorists, he said, \u201cThese killers need to know they have nowhere to hide,\u201d not \u201cno place\u201d to hide.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Conrad on the Congo River", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "OpinionWhat counts as progress? I traveled to Africa to see what has, and hasn\u2019t, changed since the author\u2019s visit over a century ago.Supported byThe smoked monkeys brought the point home. During my first day on a boat on the Congo River, I\u2019d embraced the unfamiliar: how to bend under the rail to fill my wash bucket from the river, where to step around the tethered goat in the dark and the best way to prepare a pot of grubs. But when I saw the monkeys impaled on stakes, skulls picked clean of brains and teeth thrusting out, I looked otherness in the face \u2014 and saw myself mirrored back.I was the real exotica: the only tourist to take this boat in nearly a decade, and the only white woman, as far as the crew knew, ever. Expect to be kidnapped, people had warned me. Expect to have everything stolen and expect every arrangement to go awry. Bring your own mosquito net, waterproof everything twice and strap your cash around your ankle.The Democratic Republic of Congo, I read in my guidebook, was \u201ca huge area of dark corners, both geographically and mentally,\u201d where \u201cman has fought continuously against his own demons and the elements of nature at large.\u201d This, in other words, was the heart of darkness, which was why I had wanted to come.More than 100 years ago, a Polish sailor named Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski traveled to Congo to take a job as a steamboat captain on the river. The Congo Free State, as it was then called, had been founded in 1885 under the supervision of King Leopold II of Belgium with the self-declared mission of promoting progress and civilization, free trade and the abolition of slavery. Korzeniowski was supposed to stay for three years, but after just one round-trip on the river, from Kinshasa to Kisangani and back, he quit.Behind all the high-minded ideals, he saw a colonial regime of appalling greed, violence and hypocrisy, and he left in despair. He kept a diary of his journey and almost a decade later, in 1899, when he\u2019d settled in England and Anglicized his pen name to Joseph Conrad, he transformed those notes into a novel called \u201cHeart of Darkness.\u201dThe book describes a voyage up and down a river in Africa by a British sea captain named Charles Marlow, who is commissioned to fetch a renegade ivory collector called Kurtz. Marlow travels up the river enveloped by a sense of increasing mystery and encroaching danger. Kurtz, Marlow discovers, has become a tyrant in the jungle, his idealistic hopes for spreading European civilization in Africa perverted into a brutal injunction: \u201cExterminate all the brutes!\u201dSo what counts as progress? To try to answer that question, I went to Congo last December, to see the places Conrad had seen and take the measure of what has and hasn\u2019t changed since his time.More than a century later, with hardly any roads or rails linking most of Congo\u2019s cities and with flights too expensive for nearly all Congolese, boats \u2014 belching tugs that push open barges with no facilities \u2014 are still the primary way people use to travel between Kinshasa and Kisangani, a commercial hub a thousand miles upstream. If you\u2019re lucky, you can make the upriver journey in four weeks and the downriver journey in two, the same amount of time it took Conrad.I began my trip in Kisangani, the river\u2019s uppermost navigable point and once a crossroads between eastern and central Africa, for the trade in ivory and slaves. In the city center were faded colonial bungalows and crumbling brick factories, interspersed with advertisements for diamond brokers. Not many boats venture so far these days: Fuel costs too much, and there aren\u2019t enough goods to transport. The handful of vessels that were moored along the waterfront when I arrived weren\u2019t leaving for another two weeks at best.Officially, Bralima doesn\u2019t allow passengers \u2014 a dinged-up metal sign disavows company responsibility for any \u201cunauthorized\u201d travelers \u2014 so it took a day of negotiation (and a payment) to persuade the captain to take me and my guides, a white expat and a native Congolese. But the next morning at dawn, I scurried on board with at least 80 other people toting stools, sacks, sleeping mats, tarpaulins, buckets and stoves. The first mate showed me to a cabin on the boat proper, whose two tiny decks housed just five cabins, the engine room and the bridge.We were underway for only a couple of hours when the pirogues started to come, poled frantically by people trying to catch our boat. They tied up alongside and clambered aboard with wares to sell: deck furniture woven from cane, heavy wooden mortars for pounding manioc, baskets of charcoal for cooking and ngola boards to pass the time.There\u2019s a famous scene in \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d where Marlow looks through his binoculars and sees what he thinks are \u201cornamental knobs\u201d on a palisade around Kurtz\u2019s house. Drawing closer he realizes they are human heads, barbarous trophies of Kurtz\u2019s power. Some historians have suggested that Conrad based this detail on a real-life Belgian colonial official. I think Conrad had closer interactions with the African villages on the river than he ever let on: From what I saw of smoked monkeys, they make a pretty good model.The Congo River is always changing, as sandbanks morph and shift. Conrad kept a detailed journal of the river as he traveled up, noting landmarks and turns and obstructions, sometimes sketching the profile of a stretch of bank to help him remember. But how to sail the Congo River has barely changed since Conrad\u2019s day.The first order of business for me there \u2014 as for any foreigner in any Congolese city \u2014 was clearing my presence with the infamous Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Migration, charged with monitoring the internal movement of people and goods. That means showing your papers (passport, visa, yellow-fever certificate), which generally means officials finding problems with them, which means finding a solution, which means giving someone \u201cmoney for beer,\u201d as the local euphemism goes.On a makeshift bulletin board on the wall were pasted dozens of passport pictures of foreigners who\u2019d passed through Bumba over the decades. From one quadrant stared a succession of strong-browed European nuns frozen in black and white; from another peered the spit and image of Sigmund Freud and the browned 1970s Polaroid of a tow-haired little boy.After an hour of hard haggling, my guide bargained the Bumba authorities down from $40 to $20 to let me walk freely through the town. The place felt like the set of a western, the road red dust and every facade like a false front. Small traders set up what passed for shops in the unlit hollows of concrete buildings. There were scarcely any mopeds, let alone cars; just squeaky bicycle taxis with red and yellow crocheted cushions for seats.As we left Bumba, I sat on my stool on the prow, drinking instant coffee mixed into ginger broth, and watched the forest rise again around us. Since Kisangani, the riverbank had been a ceaseless curtain of green, tall and taller, with canopies so majestic they seemed like forests in themselves.Here and there a small village appeared in a clearing, a few thatched huts on stilts \u2014 to the eye, no different from the ones I\u2019d seen in 19th-century photos. However basic they looked, though, they were on the vanguard: the one part of the forest linked to the mechanized, urban world, thanks to boats like ours. In front of the Primus sign, Jeanne, the strong-looking woman who served me my tea, had set up a stall of shiny packets of biscuits, AA batteries and small bags of salt \u2014 urban luxuries unavailable in the forest \u2014 which she sold, at a premium, to the river dwellers in pirogues.What seemed like a way to get from here to there was also, I was coming to realize, a way to get by. Most of the people I spoke to had been educated to do one thing, but in an economy without viable wages and jobs, ended up doing whatever else they could find.Jeanne used to study law; now she did washing and cooking on the boat, tended her onboard shop and bought sacks of rice en route to sell in Kinshasa. Nadine, a generous woman with gold-edged teeth, used to work for the central bank but couldn\u2019t live on the pay. On the boat she got up before dawn every day to mix a batter for beignets, which she fried up and sold for breakfast at five cents each.Such a rich country, such poor people: That was the universal refrain. One evening I watched the sunset on the prow with members of the crew. The fundamental problem in the country was bad governance, they all agreed. But how to fix it? Some championed radical protests to unseat Mr. Kabila. One person said the problem was lack of infrastructure; another said that even if you built hospitals and roads, nobody had money for a doctor or a car. One said he wanted the Belgians to come back because they actually invested in the country. Another reminded him that the Belgians pillaged, too.On the 10th day we reached Mbandaka, the biggest town between Kisangani and Kinshasa. It would take at least a day and a half to unload the beer, so I checked into a hotel for a night, hoping for a brief reunion with tap water. The Nina River Hotel, Mbandaka\u2019s best, was well situated on the river bank and had a swimming pool and a dining room with red upholstered chairs and chandeliers. Posted rate: $350 a night. But there was no water in the hotel, and electricity only between 6 p.m. and midnight.I took a walk down the riverfront road, past a market of thatched stalls tumbling down the muddy slope and street vendors in the shadow of colonial bungalows, when I spotted something startling. Behind a whitewashed wall stretched a shipyard for Onatra, the national transport agency, and on the grassy bank sat the rusted-out hulls of four or five old steamers. I approached a group of men sitting in the shade outside the office and asked to have a closer look.Conrad was rightly skeptical about imperial promises of progress. I left the shipyard sickened by a hideous realization: Measured in relative terms, most people in Congo were probably better off 100 years ago.We left Mbandaka the next day for the last leg of the journey. I sat outside Nadine\u2019s place while she cooked dinner and talked to her mother, a jowly lady who never smiled. Nadine\u2019s mother had been traveling up and down the river since she was 18.What are the biggest differences between boats then and boats now? I asked. \u201cThese aren\u2019t boats,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, there were boats, with cabins, restaurants. This\u201d \u2014 she paused \u2014 \u201cthis isn\u2019t a boat, where everyone sleeps under the stars.\u201dI asked her if the river had changed. \u201cThe river hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d I asked her if the forest had changed. \u201cThe forest hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d But, I hazarded, it was a lot taller closer to Kisangani than it is here. Has it always been like that? \u201cThe forest hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dEarly the following morning we entered the deep, narrow stretch of the river that runs straight down to Kinshasa. There were no more pirogues; villages now had huts with walls and solid roofs. The forest had thinned out, and I could see how, if you traveled upriver, as Conrad had, you might imagine it closing in around you.Yet the river itself would widen, I now knew, and the more time you spent on it, the more you might feel the deepening warmth of familiarity, and human contact, in place of Conrad\u2019s alienation. That, to me, was progress.An opinion essay last week on Joseph Conrad in Africa misstated the period that Kinshasa, formerly known as Leopoldville, has been the capital of the country known today as the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has been the capital since the 1920s, not since the 1880s.Maya Jasanoff is a professor of history at Harvard and the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu\u2019s Fate Doesn\u2019t Determine Israel\u2019s Future", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross Israel\u2019s political spectrum, the stakes in the scandal feel high. Mr. Netanyahu is a strong prime minister and a cunning politician, so members of his Likud Party can be forgiven for being fooled into believing that the future of Israel depends on his survival in office. And his political rivals seem to have similarly melodramatic beliefs. They are emotionally invested in the ousting of the prime minister, as if this will make all of Israel\u2019s problems go away and pave their way to power.In fact, the last few weeks have provided Israel with a rare agreement between the prime minister\u2019s most avid supporters and his most relentless opponents: Both seem to think that whether Mr. Netanyahu survives his legal troubles or is forced out is a matter of great consequence for Israel\u2019s future.It is not.Mr. Netanyahu, who is 67, is a wise, experienced, moderate leader. He also has deficiencies, like a tendency to pit Israelis against one another for his political gain. His long tenure \u2014 he\u2019s been prime minister for most of the last nine years \u2014 has provided Israel with much-needed political stability.To many Israelis, especially his opponents, his term seems endless. That may be because of the intensity of Israeli politics, or the tendency of a constant news cycle to make every day seem like a year. But the truth is, Mr. Netanyahu has held office only a little longer than Barack Obama or George W. Bush served as president, a little less time than Tony Blair was Britain\u2019s prime minister and quite a bit less than Angela Merkel has been the chancellor of Germany.I won\u2019t try to resolve the question of to what extent a leader determines or reflects historical trends, but Mr. Netanyahu is clearly more a creature of his era than he is a revolutionary. He was not the one to move Israel\u2019s political landscape rightward \u2014 circumstances, especially waves of terrorism, did that. He had little control over the Middle East\u2019s recent turmoil, like the Arab Spring or the war in Syria, and those issues dictate Israel\u2019s policies much more than the prime minister does. He was elected after Mr. Obama became America\u2019s president and thus had to face an administration that left him with little room for maneuver.Under such circumstances, Mr. Netanyahu reached the responsible conclusion that Israel\u2019s best option is to build its economic and military strength while avoiding risks. That\u2019s not exactly an electrifying dream, but it\u2019s one that most Israelis thought was grounded in reality when they put him in the prime minister\u2019s office in 2009 (he had already served three years in the job in the late 1990s).He won\u2019t be around forever, and the current barrage of investigations is a reminder of that. If it\u2019s not this latest accusation, maybe it will be the next. Or, more likely, at some point other politicians around him will become convinced that he is finally vulnerable and jump on the opportunity to advance their own ambitions.What happens when Mr. Netanyahu goes? Maybe, in the end, not that much.Why it would be beneficial for the prime minister if all Israelis believe that his departure will be a seminal event is clear. It is both a matter of ego and of political survival. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to just take me down, they want to take us all down,\u201d he told the crowd of supporters at the rally near my house.Of course, for Mr. Netanyahu, the end of his time in office will be a seismic moment in his long and distinguished career. That his loyal voters \u2014 or fierce opponents \u2014 would fall for such a narrative is puzzling, though. He has authority and charisma, and he casts a long shadow over Israel\u2019s politics. But his departure will bring about neither devastation nor salvation.Shmuel Rosner is the political editor at The Jewish Journal, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
