{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: A Quiet Investor in Public Fight at Uber", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that relationship has changed amid questions about Uber\u2019s culture, including allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Now, the companies are in a very public fight.The lawsuit came as a surprise to Uber\u2019s directors, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.The battle has caused other technology investors to question Benchmark\u2019s tactics.The new Silicon Valley may be in China.Alibaba and Tencent are among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, with market capitalizations twice as big as the longtime tech leaders Intel, Cisco and IBM.They have joined an elite club of tech companies worth $400 billion and up that has been dominated by American businesses: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where China has finally caught up with the U.S. in the internet space,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at the venture capital firm GGV Capital.Alibaba and Tencent have grown to prominence by dominating e-commerce and online life in China, the world\u2019s largest internet market. Their growth has come as Western companies, such as Facebook, have been blocked by the country\u2019s tight internet controls.This week, Alibaba and Tencent reported financial results that were well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations and point to the growing influence of technology on the Chinese economy.Tencent is expected to soon become the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than a billion users, while Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. The Chinese companies\u2019 revenue also grew at a faster pace in the past three months than at Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These included Jack Welch, the retired leader of General Electric, and W. James McNerney Jr., the former head of Boeing, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak about it.Their reasoning was a combination of patriotism and the hopes of salvaging a pro-business agenda.They did not succeed in persuading their peers, and the council disbanded in protest over comments by President Trump equating the actions of far-right hate groups with protesters opposing them, after a violent confrontation in Charlottesville, Va.The episode has highlighted the varied approach companies have taken in response, and the outside pressures leaders of public companies face.\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his. I proposed that I escort him in the game. Soon after that, we had the contract signed.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong. Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: A Snap and Google Tie-Up?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo be fair, Reddit is also highly entertaining, despite \u2014 and occasionally because of \u2014 its murkier parts.And it sounds like the company understands that. The new money will go to redesigning the site and creating a better mobile version, in the mold of more modern services \u2014 it will look like Facebook or Twitter, per Recode, the technology site. This sounds smart, but entrenched communities tend to hate change, so we\u2019ll see what Reddit\u2019s hordes have to say about this.I can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do with a virtual assistant, though perhaps it would help me remember to pay rent on time, which I am constitutionally incapable of doing. In any case, I\u2019m curious to see how Facebook decides to use the tech. Perhaps they\u2019ll incorporate it into Messenger, the chat app that was playing around with its own virtual assistant ideas.I thought it was crazy and something I\u2019d never use, but a lot of folks on Twitter told me it\u2019s absolutely perfect for older people like their grandparents, who love to use video chat to keep in touch with family. Maybe I\u2019m wrong? Maybe I\u2019m just too young and cool to understand? Help me, Farhad.That\u2019s not good! But I can stomach it as long as they don\u2019t start leaking \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spoilers all over the place.Do you have any Bitcoin, Farhad? Or perhaps now some Bitcoin Cash?The caveats: This all happened last year, and Snap said the rumors were false (though there may have been \u201cinformal\u201d talks, according to B.I.). It may not have been a real serious possibility, and often when rumors like these get floated, it stems from folks who have quite a vested interest in making an acquisition actually happen.Advertisers are noticing. I keep hearing chatter about ad budgets being moved from Snapchat over to Instagram, which offers a nearly identical product but with better advertising technology and a much larger base of users. If you\u2019re an ad exec looking to spend dollars on digital ads aimed at youngsters, it seems like kind of an easy choice.So perhaps a bailout acquisition by Google would actually make a modicum of sense. Think back to when Facebook bought Instagram. Mark Zuckerberg basically said, \u201ckeep doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d to Instagram, and acted to help supplement Instagram\u2019s growth only by providing some of Facebook\u2019s strongest assets. Facebook is sitting on a mountain of sophisticated ad technology, not to mention hundreds of thousands of eager advertisers looking for more space to buy ads.I could see Google and Snap in a similar situation, especially since Snap is actively in the market to improve its advertising technology through a potential acquisition or two, as we\u2019ve heard rumors of over the past few months. Selling out seems like a no-brainer to me, even if it\u2019s a tacit admission that the company couldn\u2019t make it alone on the public markets.Also, it\u2019s expensive. Even for Google, tens of billions of dollars on a second-place social networking company might be too much to swallow. Also, aren\u2019t we holding out for Google to buy Twitter? How many social networks can we expect Google to save?Anyway, I\u2019m going to Disneyland, Mike! See you in a couple of weeks.Advertisement"}
