{"Headline": "Wall Street\u2019s Patience With Retailers\u2019 Turnaround Efforts Runs Thin", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time Macy\u2019s increased its sales, Donald J. Trump had not started running for president and the Chicago Cubs still had not won a World Series in more than a century.Traditional department stores like Macy\u2019s have been trying to reinvent themselves, shedding stores and expanding their e-commerce operations to try to compete with Amazon and other online retailers. But this week, Wall Street\u2019s patience with such turnaround efforts wore thin, amid a string of unsettling earning reports by brick-and-mortar retailers.After Macy\u2019s reported another sales decline in the second quarter on Thursday, its share price fell more than 10 percent.On Friday, J. C. Penney shares hit their lowest price in a decade, falling 16 percent after the company said its profit margins had softened more than analysts had expected. Kohl\u2019s also fell on Friday after it reported earnings. And some analysts expect Sears to report a third consecutive double-digit decline in same-store sales for the second quarter.Before releasing second-quarter earnings this week, the retailers had raised Wall Street\u2019s hopes that the industry was showing signs of a comeback.\u201cThe expectations were getting higher that maybe things were starting to improve,\u201d said Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst at Citigroup. \u201cBut the results didn\u2019t meet those expectations.\u201dWhen J. C. Penney announced on July 10 that its chief financial officer was leaving, the company said that it expected to report \u201csignificantly improved top line results this quarter versus the first quarter.\u201dOther glimmers of improvement appeared across the department store industry. Foot traffic in malls was still down, but not as much as in previous quarters. Credit card data, which investors scour for clues about the retail sector, showed more people shopping in big department stores.That brightening outlook put pressure on a group of investors \u2014 mostly hedge funds \u2014 that have been shorting retail stocks, or betting that the share prices will fall.The retail sector is the second most actively shorted industry in the stock market behind the software and internet sector, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. And short bets on retailers have increased 18 percent since Jan. 1.Other investors and industry specialists have dismissed such apocalyptic warnings as overblown. While some of the weaker companies with large debt loads may collapse, stronger brick-and-mortar retailers \u2014 not just Amazon \u2014 will take market share, these people say.\u201cThis is going to be the best of times for retailers that are well capitalized,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm.Then came the actual second-quarter results this week. J. C. Penney said its sales rose in the quarter, but its gross profit margins were far lower than what analysts had predicted.The company was hit particularly hard because it is more indebted than many retailers and has been losing money.Like Macy\u2019s, J. C. Penney has been selling many of its stores. But analysts say the quality of its real estate is not as high as that of Macy\u2019s, which has prime locations in New York and San Francisco.The results announced by Macy\u2019s were slightly better than expected, but analysts noted that challenges in the company\u2019s fundamental retail business of selling clothing and home goods were being masked by profits it was generating through the sale of stores and from the income it collects on Macy\u2019s credit cards.Morgan Stanley\u2019s retail analyst described the Macy\u2019s results in a research note Friday as \u201cless bad, but not enough.\u201dNordstrom\u2019s, which also reported results this week, has been able to win over more investors to its strategies for integrating its stores and e-commerce sites.Nordstrom\u2019s, which is based in Seattle, said on Thursday that it was expanding the number of cities where shoppers can reserve clothing item online and try it on in a store \u2014 a service that few other retailers offer.On Wall Street, the reality is setting in that reinventing a business model that dates back generations will be time-consuming and expensive at best, and may not work.Retailers are gaining from finding new uses for unprofitable stores. But the costs of creating a network of e-commerce warehouses and top-flight digital capabilities are eating into precious profit margins.\u201cA big challenge changing from one channel to another,\u201d said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, \u201cis the expense.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When I see a headline toting Jane Austen\u2019s name, I click on it faster than an Amazon shopper on Black Friday, eager to learn about the author\u2019s life. While Jacobson calls for readers to stop personalizing Austen, I believe we can connect to the author and respect her legacy. Unlike other writers, Austen strayed from the pattern of swashbuckling knights and heroes to write about normal life. Readers dig into her past because her writing subject invites inquiry. We ask, why did she choose naturalism over fantasy? Did the pressure of gender stereotypes catapult her literary career?Austen\u2019s writing is memorable due to its shrewd word choice and signature wit. When we laugh at her humor, we acknowledge the writer\u2019s humanity. Recognizing this, we seek to understand her life, just as the characters in her novels try to relate to one another.Nevertheless, I agree with Jacobson\u2019s criticism of those who refer to Jane Austen as \u201cJane.\u201d We\u2019re not calling the author over for a cup of tea. We should honor her memory with her last name, even in casual conversations.On the 200th anniversary of Austen\u2019s death, we must recognize her enduring impact on readers. Jane Austen is not a historical figure meant to be boxed away in a museum and admired from a distance. Living on as a writer, she still connects with her readers, even after her passing.Advertisement"}

He was in high school when he first drew the character, and he\u2019s gone on to be a writer and producer of all three TV shows (each named \u201cThe Tick\u201d).Given yet another shot, he hasn\u2019t written a sequel. He\u2019s given us a refurbished version of the basic \u201cTick\u201d story, a deserved do-over after the truncated 2001 series, which made its debut on Fox two months after Sept. 11 and lasted just nine episodes.The new \u201cTick,\u201d based on six of its 10 episodes, is bigger in just about every way than the old. It has more back story, more exposition, more special effects, more (and more graphic) violence. It\u2019s more knowing, more layered, more self-conscious.Where the 2001 show was a quirky, low-fi, episodic lark, the new show is an up-to-date serialized dramedy that feels an awful lot like all the other 10-episode streaming series out there \u2014 take away the laughs and it could be a Netflix-Marvel production.Is that an improvement? It\u2019s a matter of taste. You may appreciate having more information about why cartoonish superheroes and villains \u2014 parodies of the serious crime fighters and criminals at Marvel and DC \u2014 walk the earth. You may be drawn in by the continuing story, in which the relationship of the Tick (Peter Serafinowicz) and his sidekick, Arthur (Griffin Newman), develops in a more linear and coherent fashion than it did before, with a more well-defined nemesis (the Terror, played by Jackie Earle Haley).Or you may feel that the addition of all that plot slows things down, and that less actually happens. You may feel that \u2014 as in so many other peak-TV series \u2014 \u201cnuance\u201d brings with it an unwelcome sentimentality. You may miss the 2001 show\u2019s charm and innocence, and feel that the Tick\u2019s bombastic dialogue isn\u2019t as funny this time around. (There\u2019s nothing in the new show so far to match, \u201cI am the sterling-silver ladle of justice, pouring its foamy cream over the just-picked strawberries of crime.\u201d)And despite Mr. Serafinowicz\u2019s quite capable performance, you may miss Patrick Warburton\u2019s Tick \u2014 less perceptive, more like a giant, earnest puppy, and funnier. To find out, of course, you\u2019ll need to watch both shows, so you\u2019d better get started.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Agrees to Privacy Audits in Settlement With F.T.C.", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Uber has agreed to two decades of privacy and security audits to settle federal accusations that it did not keep promises to protect customer data.\u201cThis case shows that, even if you\u2019re a fast growing company, you can\u2019t leave consumers behind: you must honor your privacy and security promises,\u201d said Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the acting chairwoman of the F.T.C.The federal scrutiny has added to the pressures on Uber, a company that has undergone several public business crises in recent months, including the ouster of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, an employee exodus and lawsuits from a competitor and an investor.In the privacy case, the F.T.C. accused Uber of two violations. The first stemmed from the company\u2019s announcement in 2014 that it had developed an automated system to monitor employee access to consumer personal information.The extra privacy measures were announced in response to news reports that some Uber employees were using a tool known as \u201cGod View\u201d to track trips taken by users. On its website and in a statement, Uber announced that it had \u201ca strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver\u2019s data.\u201d It said, \u201cThe only exception to this policy is for a limited set of legitimate business purposes.\u201dBut the commission said it found that the company did not live up to that promise. In its complaint, the commission said that Uber stopped using its automated system of monitoring employee access to information less than a year after it was announced and that when it was in place, the company rarely monitored it.\u201cThe system was not designed or staffed to effectively handle ongoing review of access to data,\u201d the commission said.The F.T.C. also said that Uber had not done enough to protect consumer data stored with a third-party cloud vendor, Amazon Web Services. Uber\u2019s lax practices led an intruder to access the personal information, including names, drivers licenses and some banking and social security numbers of 100,000 Uber drivers.Uber said it strengthened its privacy and security measures in recent years.\u201cWe\u2019ve significantly strengthened our privacy and data security practices since then and will continue to invest heavily in these programs,\u201d the company said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rebranding of the Bronx", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "A cadre of homegrown artists, designers and entrepreneurs are giving the South Bronx an image transplant.Supported byIn the late 1980s, Bruckner Boulevard was a forbidding stretch of asphalt strung with disused factories, dim tattoo parlors and fast-food depots. The thoroughfare, blisteringly sketched by Tom Wolfe in his satirical novel \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities,\u201d was part of the wasteland that was the South Bronx \u2014 \u201centire blocks of the city,\u201d as he wrote, \u201cwithout a building left standing.\u201dFlash-forward three decades, and this once-shattered swath of New York\u2019s northernmost borough has undergone an image transplant. Neighborhoods like Mott Haven, Port Morris and Melrose are still poor and plagued by various urban ills. But no mistake: The South Bronx, the area that gave rise to hip-hop, is being celebrated \u2014 some would say appropriated \u2014 by a clutch of entrepreneurs, real estate developers and, inevitably, the fashion tribes.Earlier this year, Gucci, wise to the borough\u2019s rich cultural heritage, cast its prefall 2017 ad campaign with black models vamping and break dancing at a 1970s-style \u201cSoul Train\u201d party.\u201cWe\u2019ve felt a little like outcasts,\u201d said Henry Obispo, an entrepreneur who is set to open a cold-pressed juice bar and green rooftop for yoga and meditation.That has changed. Mr. Obispo ascribes the area\u2019s newfound self-respect in part to a spate of new building and speculation by outsiders \u2014 the South Bronx had the fastest rate of business growth in the borough from 2000 to 2011, according to the office of the state comptroller \u2014 a factor that has spurred locals to wrest back their community and reclaim it as a seat of urban cool.11 PhotosStill, the prospect of gentrification rattles. Alarming to some is the seven-tower, $400 million residential and retail complex rising along the former industrial waterfront in the Port Morris section. Keith Rubenstein, a founder of the real estate investment company Somerset Partners, which is developing the property with the Chetrit Group, is predicting strong demand for some 1,300 units, mostly by young professionals in search of upscale amenities and sweeping waterfront views.Further stoking the controversy was a Somerset billboard touting the area as \u201cthe Piano District.\u201d Other speculators were quick to chime in, proclaiming the Bronx as the new Brooklyn.\u201cWe don\u2019t need another Brooklyn,\u201d said Roselyn Grullon, a partner in Bronx Native, an apparel company. \u201cWe don\u2019t want developers to push out the locals and flatten our beautiful, diverse culture.\u201dThese businesses and others are ambassadors of Bronx culture at large, said Jerome LaMaar, 9J\u2019s dapper owner. \u201cAnd what\u2019s a brand without the right ambassador to push it?\u201dHere, a look at some of those South Bronx ambassadors and their pioneering efforts in this new frontier.The Wiz of Bruckner Boulevard\u201cI want to be the Jeffrey Kalinsky of Bruckner Boulevard,\u201d Jerome LaMaar said, referring to the merchant whose luxury fashion emporium was vital in transforming the once gritty meatpacking district into a high-style fashion destination.At 32, Mr. LaMaar, a Bronx-bred former designer, has a similarly lofty goal: to turn his boutique 9J into a fashionable anchor on Bruckner Boulevard. Today the shop attracts locals and high-profile outsiders like Tina Knowles and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s lively entourage, their implicit endorsement fueling Mr. LaMaar\u2019s ambition.\u201cAt first, I wanted to tap into the local culture \u2014 that\u2019s home,\u201d he said. Now he envisions his store as a club, one that draws a heady amalgam of local artists and borough bigwigs along with deep-pocketed sightseers and businesspeople.Not that he would neglect his assorted friends. \u201cThey\u2019re skaters, drag queens and young professionals of all ages and colors,\u201d Mr. LaMaar said. \u201cThis is a place where they can feel like themselves and not be judged or ostracized.\u201dOn a practical level, it\u2019s a place where they can shop. The store is a tidy bazaar stocked with kimonos and embroidered peasant smocks, jewelry, T-shirts and pastel-tone sneakers, the prices varying from about $3 for an adult-friendly toy, say, to $3,000 or more for substantial, and colorful, home furnishings. He hopes to take his vision, loosely modeled on the fabled Parisian concept store Colette, global.Yet his roots remain in the Bronx. A production of the \u201cThe Wiz\u201d that he saw as a boy, formed his aesthetic and is still informing his fantasies.\u201cThe movie wasn\u2019t about fashion per se,\u201d Mr. LaMaar said. \u201cIt was about the Wiz, how he was dictating things, how the look of those things should shift and change. That\u2019s the way I see my store, my career, my life.\u201dShe Rules the RunwaysFashion enthralled this Bronx-born single mother of two from the time she saw her first runway show in Manhattan, in 2014. \u201cThat was a Saturday,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand on Sunday I started to get the legal paperwork together and reach out to my small network of supporters. I thought, \u2018The other boroughs have their fashion week, and now it\u2019s time for the Bronx to step up.\u2019\u201dHer first event, stretched over three nights in September of that year, drew close to 1,000 visitors who watched models of diverse races, ages and body types strut the work of local designers and others. Some designers were short on cash. \u201cBut I don\u2019t turn my back on anyone,\u201d Ms. Montes said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the heart to say, \u2018No, you can\u2019t show because you can\u2019t pay a fee.\u2019\u201dFor Ms. Montes, a poet and chef, the show\u2019s success seemed surreal. \u201cI had no connection to the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m no fashionista. My daughter used to tease me: \u2018Mom, you used to walk around the house in sweats and a ponytail. When did you become a fashion thing?\u2019\u201dFor her next event, on Aug. 26 at the Mall at Bay Plaza, Ms. Montes hopes to lure a few Manhattan dignitaries, among them Mayor Bill de Blasio.Media Mavericks With CheekMarco Shalma, a founder, with Gillian Todd, thinks big. \u201cWe try to represent our borough\u2019s people with things that matter,\u201d he said.

It\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way, from Lincoln Beach, Ore., to Charleston,\u201d Mr. Dutton said of the eclipse\u2019s path across the country.\u201cMarriage grows out of loving, caring and sharing ourselves with another,\u201d the bride\u2019s younger sister, Katie Turek, said at 1:32 p.m., a minute after the bride had been walked down the aisle by their father, Dr. James Turek, as the 37 guests watched.Katie, a notary public from South Carolina who served as the wedding officiant, went on to tell the couple that \u201cmarriage is not magic.\u201d\u201cIt will not create a relationship that does not already exist and has not already been celebrated in all the commitments Chris and Kelly have made to each other, both large and small, in the days since they first met and recognized their connection to one another,\u201d she said.At 1:40 p.m., the bride\u2019s older sister and maid of honor, Christina O\u2019Brien, spoke to the couple and their guests, some of them already sporting their safety glasses. \u201cAs you hold the hands of your best friend, these are the hands that will hold you, comfort you, wipe your tears away, hold your children, give you strength when you need it,\u201d she said. \u201cLastly, these hands even when they are old and wrinkled, will continue to hold you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be part of this,\u201d said Trish Fenderbosch, a longtime friend of the couple who, like everyone else, was now keeping one eye on the newly married couple and another on the slowly vanishing sun. \u201cThis is epic.\u201dAt 2:32 the groom sneaked his bride a kiss, and they began sun-gazing along with their guests. At 2:37, with the moment of totality ever so close, voices began shouting, \u201cWhooo!\u201d and \u201cThere it is!\u201d\u201cLook, there\u2019s Jupiter,\u201d someone said.At 2:46 the totality had finally arrived, and day became night.\u201cAll right, America!\u201d Mr. Dutton shouted above thunderous applause. \u201cAll right!\u201dThat was the moment that Mr. Dutton envisioned back in June, when he decided to boldly go where no man had likely gone before by booking the wedding date and venue before proposing to his future wife.\u201cHe gave me six weeks to plan a wedding,\u201d said Ms. Turek, who took it in stride.\u201cI knew this was something that the two of us, who are both science fiction nerds, could fully appreciate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201dThey met in December 2013 at a get-together arranged by a young-professionals club at a bar in Murrells Inlet, S.C.\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone there that I knew,\u201d Ms. Turek recalled. \u201cThen I saw this sexy man sitting all alone in a corner, who was way too cute to be sitting by himself, so I went over and started talking to him.\u201dThey quickly bonded over a shared interest in space-related phenomena, including the solar system and \u201cStar Trek,\u201d and fell in love at warp speed.He promised her the moon and the stars and delivered on that promise night after night beneath the twinkling skies on Pawleys Island \u2014 about 10 miles from Murrells Inlet \u2014 where they lay wrapped in a beach quilt, getting acquainted and marveling at meteor showers, shooting stars and majestic sunrises above the Atlantic.He proposed in June during a helicopter ride above Murrells Inlet, where Ms. Turek was born and raised, and Pawleys Island, home to Mr. Dutton\u2019s mother and stepfather, Victoria Castle and Wallace Castle, a home builder and contractor.They also flew over Huntington Beach State Park, where they had spent some days kayaking and some evenings gathering shells and stargazing some more.Ms. Turek, one of three daughters of Patricia Turek and Dr. Turek, a family practitioner in Garden City Beach, S.C., graduated from Wofford College in Spartanburg and received a law degree from the Charleston School of Law. She later earned a master of laws from the University of Washington in Seattle.Mr. Dutton, an only child who joined the Air Force as a contractor in 2000 when he was 22, was born in Akron, Ohio, and moved around Florida a bit before his mother planted roots on Pawleys Island. He has two bachelor\u2019s degrees, one in criminal justice from the University of Akron and the other in international business from Coastal Carolina University, from which he also received an M.B.A.When he met Ms. Turek, Mr. Dutton, who was working for Air Force Central Command at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, had just returned from an 11-month assignment in Saudi Arabia.\u201cFor me it was just like coming home and relaxing after that long deployment,\u201d he said. \u201cThen Kelly walked into my life.\u201dMr. Dutton will soon begin a new assignment \u2014 and a new life with Ms. Turek \u2014 when he reports next month to Eglin Air Force Base in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., which is largely considered one of the best stargazing destinations in the country.\u201cWhen it comes to watching the moon and the stars and the sun, well, it\u2019s just out of this world,\u201d Mr. Dutton said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get there.\u201dTommy Howard contributed reporting from Georgetown, S.C.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "She Just Won 3 Gold Medals for Her Swimming. She\u2019s Only 73.", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringDaniela Barnea, who is 73, typically swims for up to an hour and a half, seven days a week. At her age, that kind of workout, during which she covers nearly two miles, is noteworthy.Even more so is the fact that Ms. Barnea, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., is a record-breaking swimmer and senior athlete who competes in sanctioned races for her age group in events around the world.At the 2017 United States Masters Swimming Spring Nationals, in Riverside, Calif., she won three gold medals in the women\u2019s 70-to-74-year-old age group. These included the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke finals and the 200-yard individual medley finals.Ms. Barnea is among the youngest featured in the movie. Donald Cheek, known as Doc, a resident of Clovis, Calif., is an international gold medal Masters sprinter at 87. Mr. Cheek repeatedly wins in the 85-to-89 division, competing in the 50-, 100-, 200- and 400-meter events. Last October, in the Huntsman World Senior Games in St. George, Utah, he set the games\u2019 record for 100 meters at 17.38.Gary Player, the 81-year-old retired professional golfer, also appears in the movie, to offer fitness tips in a 20-minute boot camp workout that is included in the documentary. That instruction is geared toward amateur athletes of all ages who yearn to stay active and, perhaps, to compete.She schedules her workouts around the time she spends with her three grandchildren and her part-time job as a foreign language tutor for the Palo Alto Unified School District.It\u2019s \u201ckind of boring swimming back and forth, back and forth, but when you have a goal, it\u2019s not,\u201d Ms. Barnea said. \u201cIt\u2019s like meditation to me. It\u2019s very peaceful. There is something very soothing about being surrounded by water.\u201dFor many older people, though, exercising can be a challenge. That\u2019s why the producers of \u201cImpossible Dreamers\u201d decided to give viewers workout tips.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want viewers to feel inspired by the film and then go back to their regular habits the next day,\u201d said Eric Goldfarb, the filmmaker. \u201cWe caught up with several of the athletes after the film\u2019s production to get their demonstrations on safe exercises for older adults; different movements that are simple, maximizing bodily benefits and fun.\u201dThe message, Mr. Goldfarb said, is that \u201cno matter where you are in your life, you do what you can\u201d with regard to fitness.\u201cYou exercise as much as you can without going beyond what your body is able to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe athletes in this film are not superheroes. They are all plagued with injury and real-life circumstance that happens to everybody, and they get through it.\u201dA few years ago, Ms. Barnea had abdominal surgery and needed to rebuild her swimming regimen slowly. \u201cI could barely swim across the width of pool, but every day I added a few laps, and got stronger and stronger,\u201d she said.A rotator cuff injury sustained in a dog-walking mishap, when she was pulled abruptly toward a neighbor\u2019s cat, still makes her wince and prevents her from competing in the butterfly, one of her signature events.But she keeps on stroking. This year, she will enter an estimated 20 competitions. \u201cYou need to trust yourself, trust the hopes and not the fears, and keep going around the obstacles,\u201d Ms. Barnea said.\u201cOur bodies are made for being used,\u201d she said. \u201cPhysical fitness and activity improves brain function. Anyone who is keeping up physical activity \u2014 both the aerobic part, which is really important, and the strength and balance and flexibility \u2014 is reducing the risks and buffering the decline that is going on.\u201dFor Mr. Cheek, the nation\u2019s fastest 100-meter sprinter in his age group, there is \u201ca pride and a mental discipline that carries over into your whole lifestyle,\u201d he said. Consistent exercise, said Mr. Cheek, who is a part-time professor of social psychology at California State University, Fresno, allows you to have \u201ca body that can perform for you any time you want.\u201dMr. Cheek, who grew up in Harlem and earned a Ph.D. from Temple University, has been running track since his days at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx. \u201cThe track represents freedom to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very clear measurement of what I am. It tells me I have guts, character, that I have what it takes.\u201dIn the \u201cImpossible Dreamers\u201d boot camp video, these senior athletes provide their best advice on how to keep athletes with less lofty ambitions fit.Mr. Cheek, for example, starts his routine with a variety of relaxed stretches. He and his wife, Patti, are shown lying in bed wearing workout clothes; they lift their legs in the air, curl their toes and spin their ankles in each direction.Mr. Cheek is also shown skipping with his grandchildren; he recommends two minutes of skipping. \u201cThis develops a certain rhythm for your body,\u201d he said. \u201cSkipping is what children do, and it\u2019s fun. It makes you smile.\u201dThen Mr. Cheek moves on to high-step skipping, with the emphasis on lifting his knees. He also recommends standing in place and moving your feet as fast as you can. \u201cDo it rhythmically, and move your arms as fast as you can,\u201d he said.In the documentary, Mr. Player is shown pacing on a treadmill, lifting light weights, doing situps and running rapidly in small steps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep the body moving like a piece of elastic,\u201d he says in the film.These exercises help keep him performing well on the golf course. \u201cAll you need is 10 minutes on the treadmill every day,\u201d he says.For these seasoned athletes, there\u2019s seemingly no fear of getting older. \u201cPeople usually don\u2019t want to tell their age, but not me,\u201d Ms. Barnea said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell them I am moving up to my next age group for competing. I can break new records when I\u2019m the youngest one in the race.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Instagram Posts May Hold Clues to Your Mental Health", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cPeople in our sample who were depressed tended to post photos that, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, were bluer, darker and grayer on average than healthy people,\u201d said Andrew Reece, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University and co-author of the study with Christopher Danforth, a professor at the University of Vermont.The pair identified participants as \u201cdepressed\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d based on whether they reported having received a clinical diagnosis of depression in the past. They then used machine-learning tools to find patterns in the photos and to create a model predicting depression by the posts.They found that depressed participants used fewer Instagram filters, those which allow users to digitally alter a photo\u2019s brightness and coloring before it is posted. When these users did add a filter, they tended to choose \u201cInkwell,\u201d which drains a photo of its color, making it black-and-white. The healthier users tended to prefer \u201cValencia,\u201d which lightens a photo\u2019s tint.Depressed participants were more likely to post photos containing a face. But when healthier participants did post photos with faces, theirs tended to feature more of them, on average.As revealing as the findings are about Instagram posts specifically, both Mr. Reece and Mr. Danforth said the results speak more to the promise of their techniques.\u201cThis is only a few hundred people, and they\u2019re pretty special,\u201d Mr. Danforth said of the study participants. \u201cThere\u2019s a sieve we sent them through.\u201dTo be included in the study, participants had to meet several criteria. They had to be active and highly rated on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk platform, a paid crowdsourcing platform that researchers often use to find participants. They also had to be active on Instagram and willing to share their entire posting history with the researchers. Finally, they had to share whether or not they had received a clinical diagnosis of depression.Out of the hundreds of responses they received, Mr. Reece and Mr. Danforth recruited a total of 166 people, 71 of whom had a history of depression. They collected nearly 44,000 photos in all.The researchers then used software to analyze each photo\u2019s hue, color saturation and brightness, as well as the number of faces it contained. They also collected information about the number of posts per user and the number of comments and likes on each post.Using machine-learning tools, Mr. Reece and Mr. Danforth found that the more comments a post received, the more likely it was to have been posted by a depressed participant. The opposite was true for likes. And depressed users tended to post more frequently, they found.Though they warned that their findings may not apply to all Instagram users, Mr. Reece and Mr. Danforth argued that the results suggest that a similar machine-learning model could someday prove useful in conducting or augmenting mental health screenings.\u201cWe reveal a great deal about our behavior with our activities,\u201d Mr. Danforth said, \u201cand we\u2019re a lot more predictable than we\u2019d like to think.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Transgender Bathroom Bill Falters Amid Mounting Opposition", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe effort is now focused on the House version, but State Representative Jonathan Stickland, one of the bill\u2019s 46 co-authors and a member of the Tea Party-backed Freedom Caucus, said he was pessimistic about its chances of being allowed to advance to a vote.\u201cI think the Straus team has already decided that they are not going to let it out,\u201d said Mr. Stickland, who, like other members of the staunchly conservative caucus, persistently defies the speaker\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis is clearly part of a national agenda that is being pushed by the progressive left, and I think that that is just all coming to a head here.\u201dThe Senate bill would require transgender people to use bathrooms in schools and local government buildings corresponding to the gender listed on their birth certificates or state-issued identification cards. The House bill would prevent school districts and county or local governments from adopting or enforcing nondiscrimination ordinances that would allow transgender people to use bathrooms of their choice. The ordinance override provision is also an element in the Senate bill.Although law enforcement, religious groups and transgender advocates have all been part of the opposing coalition, big business has been a dominant force throughout the debate.\u201cCorporate America is stepping forward, speaking loudly about the fact that this will have a chilling effect on business opportunity in this state,\u201d said State Representative Byron Cook, a Republican and the chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, who has thus far refused to call a hearing on the bill. \u201cI\u2019m hearing from many major corporations about this bill and the effect it will have.\u201dCorporations active in Texas that have opposed the measure include IBM, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Intel, Capital One, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Facebook, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.The association is the most powerful business lobby in the state, representing companies with more than two million employees and $8 billion in business. The group\u2019s president, Chris Wallace, said the association moved quickly to form a coalition, Keep Texas Open for Business, against legislation when it became apparent that the bathroom battle was heading to Texas.\u201cWe do not want to do anything to tarnish Texas\u2019 brand,\u201d he said.The strategy has included a seven-figure radio ad buy, strategically targeted letters signed by prominent chief executives, lobbying blitzes throughout the Capitol and rallies on the Capitol grounds.Several dozen women, predominately business owners and executives, many accompanied by their children, gathered on the south steps of the state Capitol on Tuesday as 15 speakers attacked the legislation as the work of \u201cextremist\u201d politicians that will blunt the economy and foster discrimination and hate crimes.\u201cI don\u2019t want my child to be a statistic of the 2017 special session,\u201d said Kimberly Shappley, a registered nurse and ordained minister from the Houston suburbs who was accompanied by her 6-year-old transgender daughter, Kai.Mr. Patrick and other supporters of the legislation say the projections in Texas and the impact in North Carolina have been vastly exaggerated.Business\u2019s involvement has increasingly become a target for proponents as they accelerate their efforts in the remaining days of the session.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has seen corporations engage on an issue like this outside the framework of taxes and regulations in our memory,\u201d said Dave Welch of the Texas Pastor Council, which is a leading supporter of the legislation. \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of a rising moral bankruptcy in corporate America, in which the only thing they support is their image and their bottom line.\u201dIf the session goes all 30 days \u2014 and it could end earlier \u2014 lawmakers would adjourn on Aug 16. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, has given no hints on whether he would call another session, although he has been particularly insistent that lawmakers give Texans new safeguards against rising property taxes.As for the bathroom legislation, the governor told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper on Friday that it was \u201cway premature\u201d to conclude that the House bill wouldn\u2019t come up for a vote.The intensity of the debate has raised questions about the future relationship between business groups and the state\u2019s Republican leadership, which have shared a decades-long bond. Mr. Wallace, president of the Texas business association, said the bond would remain unbroken despite the differences in the current showdown.\u201cNinety-plus percent of the time we are in agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just happen to disagree on this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Jobs Fair Sends Clear Message: Now Hiring Thousands", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROMEOVILLE, Ill. \u2014 Brandon Williams arrived at an Amazon fulfillment center here, about an hour outside of Chicago, around 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, one of thousands across the country who turned up for the company\u2019s first Jobs Day. While he appeared to wilt slightly during the five hours he waited before an M.C. summoned him for a tour, his enthusiasm did not wane.\u201cWhat\u2019s not great about a company that keeps building?\u201d he said, seated in a huge tent the company erected in the parking lot as a kind of makeshift waiting room.The event was a vivid illustration of the ascendance of Amazon, the online retail company that, to a far greater extent than others in the tech industry, has a seemingly insatiable need for human labor to fuel its explosive growth.Like other tech giants, Amazon is recruiting thousands of people with engineering and business degrees for high-paying jobs. But the vast majority of Amazon\u2019s hiring is for what the company calls its \u201cfulfillment network\u201d \u2014 the armies of people who pick and pack orders in warehouses and unload and drive delivery trucks, and who take home considerably smaller incomes.The event on Wednesday, held at a dozen locations including Romeoville, Ill., was intended to help fill 50,000 of those lower-paying positions, 40,000 of them full-time jobs.Those high-low distinctions did not seem to bother the attendees of the jobs fair, many of them united in the conviction that Amazon represented untapped opportunity \u2014 that a foot in the door could lead to a career of better-compensated, more satisfying work, whether in fulfillment, I.T., marketing or even fashion.Mr. Williams, a military veteran studying computer network security at a nearby community college, said he hoped to eventually work his way up to an I.T. job with Amazon. But even those whose ambitions were more in line with the vast majority of available jobs could not hide their excitement.Victor Salgado, who makes $9 per hour with no benefits doing maintenance at an aerosol company and spent three years before that grouting floors, said he was attracted by the promise of an upgrade in pay and benefits. He said he would be willing to \u201cdo anything\u201d at Amazon.\u201cA record-breaking 20,000 applications were received on this day alone,\u201d said John Olsen, an Amazon human resources vice president, \u201cwith thousands of job offers extended to candidates and more to come in the next few days.\u201dAmazon has said its wages and benefits are attractive. Five years ago, it introduced a program called Career Choice that pays tuition costs for employees seeking training to join higher-paid professions, like airline mechanics, medical lab workers and computer-aided design technicians.Jack Chasteen, who recently finished high school and is still living at home, said he had been planning to seek a job as a pizza deliveryman but that his parents urged him to turn up at Jobs Day instead.\u201cThey said it would be a good building block for stuff in the future,\u201d he said, citing Amazon\u2019s tuition assistance program, which he hoped might help him pursue a nursing degree.Arun Sundararajan, a professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Amazon\u2019s employment needs are unique among tech companies.\u201cTheir business has always been a meld of the digital and physical,\u201d he said. \u201cRetail is very different from digital products or music or social networking. The other tech platforms are, at their core, selling tech products.\u201dBut there are questions about how long Amazon\u2019s fulfillment jobs will exist, as robots and other forms of automation become more capable at doing the jobs that now require humans.Amazon is more aggressively using robots to help make the operations inside its warehouses more efficient. For now, the company said machines are not replacing people. Instead, they mostly move large shelves of merchandise to stations where orders are manually picked.When those technologies are perfected, the employment picture inside Amazon\u2019s warehouses could look very different. That day could be a decade or more away, though.\u201cWhile the digital disruption is destroying the traditional retail business model,\u201d Dr. Sundararajan said, \u201cthe Amazon model that replaces it will continue to live in the physical world and require human labor for the foreseeable future.\u201dAs for Mr. Williams, he later sent a text message to say that he was not hired on the spot on Wednesday, a possibility that Amazon had dangled before workers. On the plus side: he was told there was still a chance to get a job at the center through a temporary staffing company.An article on Thursday about Amazon\u2019s Job Fair misstated the hourly pay that one of the event\u2019s attendees, Victor Salgado, makes at an aerosol company. It is $9 per hour, not $10.75.Noam Scheiber reported from Romeoville, Ill., and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "20 Years After Diana\u2019s Death, a Happier Ending Imagined", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultural StudiesIn a new novel called \u201cImagining Diana,\u201d readers find Princess Diana having lunch in Midtown Manhattan at Michael\u2019s, nodding hello to Barbara Walters on her way in, dressed in an Oscar de la Renta suit, sitting at Table 1, ordering the gravlax.But back to our fairy tale: Diana, by then the stateside \u201cPeople\u2019s Princess,\u201d travels abroad often for the Princess Diana Foundation, and to London often to see her sons. She presents the best documentary award at the Academy Awards to a film about land mines in Cambodia and Laos, and harmlessly flirts with a star-struck movie star at the Vanity Fair after-party.When in Los Angeles, she stays at the Hotel Bel-Air. But mostly she lives with Teddy Forstmann at his Fifth Avenue apartment and Southampton estate. She has a diamond engagement ring (a tasteful nine carats), and the $100 million prenup is signed, sealed and delivered. Diana is ours, again, if only for 208 pages.Diana was famous before the internet, famous before millions of iPhones began to capture every sneeze of every celebrity pushing her cart in a Whole Foods parking lot. To observe her, the public relied on paparazzi, magazines and newspapers of varying quality, and television. Biographers, including the longtime editor Tina Brown, have documented how Diana tried to shape all this coverage by making herself selectively available and self-revelatory.\u201cShe was the first global celebrity because she was authentic,\u201d said Hilary Black, the editor of National Geographic\u2019s new book \u201cRemembering Diana: a Life in Photographs\u201d (whose foreword was written by Ms. Brown). \u201cOnce she realized she could master the media, she took a feminist stance and told her story the way she wanted to tell it.\u201dBack in her day, that sometimes was called manipulating the press. Today it\u2019s called branding.Ms. Sittenfeld is getting more practice at considering the conjoining of fact and fiction, ego and alter. Last year, Esquire commissioned her to write a short story from the voice and perspective of Hillary Clinton. In it, a fictional Mrs. Clinton reflects on her relationship with a fictional journalist who has covered her for years, at The San Francisco Chronicle, The Washington Post and finally The New York Times.\u201cI expect to be burned by the journalist,\u201d the Clinton character tells the reader. \u201cNo matter how friendly our encounter, how personal, even, I will at best be irritated by what she writes.\u201dOnce Ms. Sittenfeld got Hillary in her head, she couldn\u2019t easily dispense with her. Now she is at work on a novel that will portray the life of Hillary Rodham after she decides to reject Bill Clinton\u2019s final proposal of marriage.Ms. Sittenfeld said she would not be interested in writing a novel that imagined that Mrs. Clinton was elected the 45th president of the United States. Despite the amount of press coverage devoted to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s career, Ms. Sittenfeld believes, what most Americans know about her relates to her marriage. Wiping that slate clear is what she finds compelling as a novelist. (She asked her social media audience to suggest titles for this book. Her favorite response came on Facebook: \u201cSliding Pantsuits.\u201d)\u201cNovels aren\u2019t \u2018fake,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ali wrote in the email. \u201cThey\u2019re fictional. Their purpose is not to deceive by making stuff up, it\u2019s to illuminate by reaching for truths (about human nature) that aren\u2019t about facts, but about the way we see the world and our place in it.\u201dPerhaps there is an element of wish fulfillment as well, at least for Ms. Clehane. \u201cIt was cathartic,\u201d she said of writing \u201cImagining Diana,\u201d a process that led her to surround herself in homemade \u201cDiana mood boards\u201d and to watch every piece of Diana footage she could find. (Ms. Clehane also published a nonfiction book about the princess, in 1998, called \u201cDiana: The Secrets of her Style.\u201d)With the new book, Ms. Clehane wanted to show that Diana would have found happiness and overcome her insecurities. \u201cI believe the love she felt for her sons would have pulled her back from whatever precipice she felt she was on,\u201d she said as her eyes welled with tears.Ms. Clehane won\u2019t be denied her happy ending for Diana, even if Diana was.Follow Katherine Rosman on Twitter: @katierosman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Stocks Reach New Heights, What\u2019s Trump Got to Do With It?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dIt was, all things considered, a factually accurate statement. Business is looking better. The stock market is at a high. And, yes, it did not happen by itself.The question, however, is this: Has anything that has happened at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had anything to do with it?Putting aside the administration\u2019s inability to successfully pass any meaningful legislation thus far \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot to put aside \u2014 can Mr. Trump fairly take any credit for the market\u2019s trajectory? After all, when I and others talk to C.E.O.s and investors, one constant refrain we hear is that they actually expect little to get done on the legislative front.Where they repeatedly said they were expecting big changes \u2014 that will translate into higher profits \u2014 was in Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to lower regulatory burdens and costs, something that he could accomplish, in part, through executive orders and the appointment of regulators who are less inclined to enforce the rules aggressively.But that\u2019s not right. Listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks \u2014 which are the real reason the stock market has soared \u2014 and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations.The only time the word \u201cregulation\u201d was even used on Apple\u2019s earnings call \u2014 during which the company described how it beat analysts\u2019 estimates by a wide margin \u2014 was in reference to China. The word did not get a mention on Amazon\u2019s earnings call, nor was there any reference to Washington at all, despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth.Even on Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings call, which included several questions and answers related to regulations, not once did any official suggest that the firm\u2019s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens. Indeed, the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses.\u201cThe administration is, at a minimum, telling a one-sided story \u2014 it\u2019s a bit disingenuous,\u201d Charles Campbell, managing director at MKM Partners, said about Mr. Trump and his team\u2019s taking credit for the rising stock market. \u201cFor the average American who is uninformed, it probably passes\u201d as sounding correct, he lamented.But Mr. Campbell said it was \u201ca little early\u201d for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts. \u201cThis is the first full reporting period, quite honestly,\u201d since Mr. Trump took office, he noted.In industries like finance, Mr. Campbell said, stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be business-friendly changes in the regulatory environment. \u201cIt is the anticipation that there will be an effect,\u201d he said.It is very true that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of United States companies, but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch.The larger issue is, when it does happen, how much can deregulation really help juice the economy?The answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy.According to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume.But here\u2019s the rub: It isn\u2019t that simple, in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like $225 billion.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Going Nomad to Avoid Summer Rent Spikes", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-five years old, employed and engaged, Elana Rosman had not envisioned moving back to her childhood home in Great Neck, N.Y., on Long Island.She is not in a quarter-life crisis, seeking a safe haven to figure out her next step. It\u2019s much simpler than that. To avoid taking on a new lease this summer, Ms. Rosman is \u201cgoing nomad\u201d and has moved home with her parents.The summer rental season is notorious for being the priciest time of year in New York, because demand shoots up as recent graduates flock to the city looking for a place to live, and prices naturally follow suit. As a result, some people do whatever they can to put off signing a lease until fall.Temporary strategies include couch-surfing, house-sitting, finding a short-term rental or a boardinghouse, or moving in with relatives \u2014 as Ms. Rosman did. She figures that by waiting out the summer\u2019s high rental season, she may find rents as much as a few hundred dollars a month lower when she starts apartment-hunting in the fall.Sharon Leonor, who just completed graduate school, and Max Scharf, who just graduated from law school, chose to delay their move to Manhattan until September, when Mr. Scharf starts a new job as a first-year associate in the city. Their nomadic solution: moving into an Airbnb basement apartment in a house in Paramus, N.J., for a month and a half.Ms. Leonor and Mr. Scharf, both 25, started an apartment search in New York in May. \u201cAlmost everything was over $2,000 a month for places that didn\u2019t have a good living space or even a complete kitchen,\u201d Ms. Leonor said. \u201cWe knew it wouldn\u2019t meet our needs.\u201dWith Ms. Leonor studying for her social worker licensing exam, and Mr. Scharf for the New York state bar exam, they needed an apartment with enough room for each of them to hit the books.Since finding a suitable rental seemed out of the question, the couple changed tactics and started looking for a short-term Airbnb rental. Their search in Manhattan was brief. Ms. Leonor realized \u201cthis is silly \u2014 we\u2019re not even working and it feels like with rent and cost of living, we would just be throwing money away.\u201dThey eventually found the Paramus Airbnb, which is just a few towns over from where her parents live in Teaneck. \u201cWe got more bang for our buck,\u201d Ms. Leonor said.Although Ms. Leonor and Mr. Scharf have enjoyed the perks of living in New Jersey for the summer (cheaper grocery stores and restaurants, more space), Mr. Scharf has not wavered on their plan to relocate to Manhattan come fall, especially as he anticipates some long workdays. \u201cI lived in Teaneck and interned in Midtown last summer, and it takes at least an hour each way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lincoln Tunnel during rush hour is the stuff of nightmares.\u201dTheir time in the Airbnb ran out late last month and they have moved in temporarily with Ms. Leonor\u2019s parents. They have started their online search for Sept. 1 rentals and estimate that the number available within their budget is almost double what they found previously.Summer is the most common time of year to move for three reasons, according to Grant Long, the senior economist at StreetEasy: graduation, the weather and employment cycles.\u201cA big factor is school turnover,\u201d he said. New graduates moving to the city for a job or college provide a steady flow of new residents through the summer.People generally don\u2019t want to move in the slushy, frigid New York winter weather, he said. Job turnover \u2014 specifically in the finance and insurance industries \u2014 is another factor. \u201cBonus season in finance comes from January to March, depending on the company,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s typical for people to wait until they get their bonus, give it a couple of months, and then find a new job over the summer.\u201dBut then begins the vicious cycle. A year or two later, those same people have decided to move when their leases run out and are once again on the hunt for a new place.Daniel Reisner, 25, and his two roommates were presented with a rent increase of several hundred dollars a month when the lease on their Upper West Side apartment expired this spring. Unable to take on more rent, Mr. Reisner, a third-year law student, decided to move into a two-month sublet with his girlfriend, a college senior, who was in New York for the summer.\u201cWe found it on Craigslist,\u201d Mr. Reisner said. \u201cIt was around the corner from my apartment. We needed a place to live for a few months and this was perfect.\u201dMr. Reisner\u2019s next housing solution as he enters his final fall semester of law school will be a bunk under the parental roof in Merrick, N.Y., on Long Island. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sharing a room with my brother, who just graduated from college and moved home, which will be interesting.\u201dDespite the extra burden of the commute to the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Greenwich Village and a hit to his social life, Mr. Reisner said the move home is a necessity. \u201cI\u2019ve had other people ask me to move into their apartments this summer, but it was too expensive.\u201cMy plan is to move back into the city in January, when rent is a little bit lower,\u201d he said.The rental cycle is deliberate, said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. \u201cOwners can try to stagger leases to have them expire during the May and June months, knowing full well it\u2019s the highest demand for apartments.\u201d Savvy renters try to negotiate a summertime lease beyond the typical 12 months to push their tenancy into the fall, when demand and prices drop.\u201cAs a D.I.Y. landlord myself, I\u2019ve experienced that first hand,\u201d said Mr. Coon, who is based in Chicago. \u201cIf I have units that are being rented during the summer, I am able to charge 10 to 20 percent more in rent. So in big cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, 10 to 20 percent is a very meaningful dollar amount.\u201dDaniel Gallant, 41, has considerable experience in short stays. Over the years, \u201cthere have been several times when I was nomadic,\u201d he said. In the summer of 2000, Mr. Gallant and his two roommates were preparing to re-sign the lease for their Turtle Bay apartment, only to learn that the rent had doubled.He had a college buddy who let him stay at his place while he was out of town. And when he ran out of places to crash, Mr. Gallant convinced New Dramatists, a playwrights organization where he had once interned, to let him sleep in rooms reserved for members \u2014 when they were empty, of course. He also spent some time at Penington Friends House near Union Square, a Quaker boardinghouse, and at Menno House, a Mennonite boardinghouse also near Union Square. He is neither Quaker nor Mennonite.\u201cThere are a lot of places like this, but each has its own rules,\u201d Mr. Gallant said. \u201cThere\u2019s a yoga place in the West Village that was a combo yoga studio and a residence. These places were not incredibly luxurious, but they are all clean and safe places to stay.\u201dFor Mr. Gallant, this uncertain lifestyle was thrilling at times. \u201cI was constantly trying to figure out the next place that I would be staying, he said. \u201cIt was exciting, it was nomadic, it was a little bit frightening. But I had the luxury of knowing I was in this situation by choice.\u201d He was comforted by the thought that \u201cif I didn\u2019t need to keep pursuing this directing project, I could have gone home to my family\u201d in Maryland.Going nomad is an attempt at beating a system that can seem to peg the renter as the loser.\u201cThe fact that we really got a look at the market and what was out there was really helpful,\u201d Ms. Feierman said. \u201cI was on the summer cycle, having moved here after graduation, but my boyfriend, Dan, was on a different cycle.\u201dEven though she had just re-upped on her lease, it quickly became clear to Ms. Feierman that they should go with Mr. Feinberg\u2019s cycle because his lease would expire in the fall. Hunting for a Nov. 1 vacancy, \u201cwe found out a lot more was out there,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there was not as much inventory, but the apartments were more affordable.\u201dWhen the couple found a reasonably priced one-bedroom in Chelsea in mid-September last year with a Nov. 1 lease, she moved out of her apartment early, having found someone to take her place there. She and Mr. Feinberg now have high ceilings, exposed brick, a nice bathroom and a renovated kitchen with a dishwasher and washer/dryer.\u201cWe kind of thought we would give up on those amenities,\u201d Ms. Feierman said.Mr. Long said listings lately include anywhere from one to three months of free rent. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a Netflix subscription, Amazon Prime subscription, or Uber credits and other crazy things they offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the concessions go overall, we did see a peak over the winter.\u201dReal estate brokers warn, though, that trying to outfox the system doesn\u2019t always work out. \u201cJust because you want to wait out the market doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will win,\u201d said Mr. Malin of Citi Habitats. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off \u2014 there\u2019s a risk and reward on both ends,\u201d he said.A renter who puts off a hunt in hopes of cheaper apartments in a few months could miss out on an ideal place. \u201cSometimes the reality is when you go see something you love and want, and if you can afford it, it\u2019s hard to turn it away,\u201d Mr. Malin said. The strategy could also backfire if the market shifts and rents go up across the board, even when the weather cools.Mr. Long said that being open to compromise will serve you well while apartment hunting. \u201cOne of the things to keep in mind is that renting and finding a good deal can favor those who are flexible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have the flexibility to stay on a friend\u2019s couch for a while, and it gives you a better chance to get what you want, do it.\u201dMs. Feierman believes her willingness to be flexible with moving dates made it easier to find a decent apartment. \u201cWe realized whatever we needed to do, we could make it work \u2014 like we could move out of our places a month early if we needed to,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving the time and money to do that made our process better. We didn\u2019t feel like we needed to settle or jump on the first thing we found.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Rosman spent part of the summer commuting from Great Neck to her job as a physician assistant at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She plans to move into an apartment with her fianc\u00e9 in November, around the time of their wedding. \u201cIt started out as a joke,\u201d Ms. Rosman said, referring to a conversation the couple had about her moving in with her parents on Long Island.But the concept turned serious when they realized they couldn\u2019t afford the summer leases they were finding online. \u201cWhen I go on StreetEasy and put in my specifications and my budget, there are fewer options available for this time of year than in the spring and fall,\u201d she said.Ms. Rosman says going nomad has been a good move. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely stressful moving home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s worth it.\u201dLooking ahead, she knows she won\u2019t have to be stingy when moving day arrives. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stress about nickel and diming my move,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saving in rent and I can move out in style.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Corporate leaders aren\u2019t given their power, prestige, responsibility and nine-figure pay packages to use the corner office as their personal soapbox.With President Trump\u2019s comments on white supremacists and other right-wing extremists ringing in the ears of America\u2019s chief executives, that high bar appears to have been passed.Such a public schism between a president and a business leadership long considered the backbone of the Republican establishment left corporate historians at a loss for precedent. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything to compare to this,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management and the author of \u201cFiring Back: How Great Leaders Rebound From Career Disasters.\u201dCharles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said he knew of no other examples, not even involving Richard Nixon at the height of the Vietnam War protests and during Watergate.Referring to a tweet by Mr. Trump criticizing Kenneth C. Frazier, the Merck executive who led this week\u2019s corporate retreat from the White House councils, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, \u201cNever in history has a president attacked and threatened the chief executive of a major U.S. corporation like that.\u201dAfter provoking a furor with his initial failure to condemn the white supremacists behind last weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump might have staved off a full-scale exodus with his somewhat stilted but conciliatory comments on Monday. But then he reignited the flames at a news conference on Tuesday at which he said there was \u201cblame on both sides,\u201d including club-wielding members of what he called the \u201calt-left,\u201d for the Charlottesville violence. The white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke were quick to embrace his remarks.As pressure mounted on prominent council members like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Ginni Rometty of IBM and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, as well as other chief executives who remained silent or issued platitudes, corporate boards were hastily meeting to map strategy. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from 24 chief executives in the past two days,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said on Wednesday. \u201cBoards are having ad hoc conference calls. People are very worried and concerned.\u201dThose conversations have been far more complicated than one might expect. It\u2019s safe to say that no chief executive wants to be identified with white supremacy, racism or domestic terrorism. At the same time the president wields enormous influence over their shareholders, employees and customers.\u201cChief executives don\u2019t have the luxury of ventilating their personal political opinions, whatever they might be,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t let their personal views influence their business decisions. If they really feel strongly about something, they can always resign and then say whatever they want.\u201dBack then, Mr. Sonnenfeld, too, praised Mr. Trump\u2019s openness to business views as a welcome change from an Obama administration perceived as anti-business. \u201cHe\u2019s very charming and open to new ideas,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said then of Mr. Trump.This week was a different story. After the Charlottesville events and Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, \u201cchief executives have a moral duty to use their position as a bully pulpit and to speak out,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said, adding that George Weyerhaeuser, a former chairman of the giant timber and wood products company bearing his name, had once told him, \u201cWe have a license to operate from society, and if we violate that license it can be revoked.\u201dOr as Mr. Elson told me, \u201cAt some point, if identification with the administration becomes so polarizing that it impairs your ability to run the company, then you may have to do something.\u201dWeighing the benefits of advising a president steeped in controversy versus the risks to shareholders and other constituents from potential consumer boycotts is a calculus that varies widely from company to company.That new action appears to have arrived.\u201cThe risk of consumer blowback is especially acute for companies like Under Armour, and you\u2019ve seen this elsewhere in the retail space,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. But he noted that speaking out against a social scourge like racism can also enhance a brand. \u201cTaking a public stand doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a misalignment with shareholder interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be the right thing to do. Howard Schultz has done this very effectively at Starbucks.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Schultz publicly criticized the president\u2019s response to the Charlottesville events, and on Wednesday he spoke at an emotional companywide meeting. \u201cI come to you as an American, as a Jew, as a parent, as a grandparent, as an almost 40-year partner of a company I love so dearly,\u201d he said. \u201cI come to you with profound, profound concern about the lack of character, morality, humanity and what this might mean for young children and young generations.\u201dIn such circumstances, collective action by business leaders is often the most effective course, as members of the president\u2019s advisory councils appear to have decided this week. That way no one company bears the brunt of the president\u2019s wrath.After Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Charlottesville, Mr. Sonnenfeld has been among those calling for collective opposition. \u201cFomenting racial unrest is not in the nation\u2019s interest and it\u2019s not in businesses\u2019 interest,\u201d he said. \u201cDivide and conquer has always been Trump\u2019s strategy, and somehow it has worked until now. The way to take a bully down is through collective action.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Thursday, about the calculus of chief executives in deciding whether to take on the president, referred incompletely to President Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday about the instigators of last weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va. He said there was \u201cblame on both sides,\u201d including club-wielding members of what he called the \u201calt-left\u201d; he did not say that group was solely responsible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Internet Censors Play a Tougher Game of Cat and Mouse", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The shutdown was unusual, and came without warning.One Beijing online video company watched as its app and website went offline for about 20 minutes without warning. The way it was disconnected \u2014 the digital tether that connected its service to the rest of the internet was severed \u2014 suggested more than a mere technical outage, according to the leader of the firm\u2019s technology team, who requested anonymity for himself and the company for fear of reprisals.Chinese officials did not comment on the test, and there was no indication that they would use the system again. But if they do, it may not be a total surprise.The shift \u2014 which could affect a swath of users from researchers to businesses \u2014 suggests that China is increasingly worried about the power of the internet, experts said.\u201cIt does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense, but the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been,\u201d said Emily Parker, author of \u201cNow I Know Who My Comrades Are,\u201d a book about the power of the internet in China, Cuba, and Russia. \u201cBeijing\u2019s crackdown on the internet is commensurate with the power of the internet in China.\u201dChina still has not clamped down to its full ability, the experts said, and in many cases the cat-and-mouse game continues. One day after Apple\u2019s move last week, people on Chinese social media began circulating a way to gain access to those tools that was so easy that even a non-techie could use it. (It involved registering a person\u2019s app store to another country where VPN apps were still available.)Still, Thursday\u2019s test demonstrates that China wants the ability to change the game in favor of the cat.A number of Chinese internet service providers said on their social media accounts, websites, or in emails on Thursday that Chinese security officials would test a new way to find the internet addresses of services hosting or using illegal content. Once found, these companies said, the authorities would ask internet service providers to tell their clients to stop. If the clients persisted, they said, the service providers and Chinese officials would cut their connection in a matter of minutes.The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment.China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has presided over years of new internet controls, but he has also singled out technology and the internet as critical to China\u2019s future economic development. As cyberspace has become more central to everything that happens in China, government controls have evolved.It is difficult to figure out the extent of the new efforts, since many users and businesses will not discuss them publicly for fear of getting on the bad side with the Chinese government. But some frequent users said that getting around the restrictions had become increasingly difficult.One student, who has been studying in the United States and was back in China for summer vacation, said that her local VPN was blocked. She said she had taken the period as a sort of meditation away from social media and left a note on Facebook to warn her friends why she was a \u201cgone girl.\u201dA doctoral student in environmental engineering in at a university in China said it had become harder to do research without Google, though his university had found alternative publications so that students did not always need the internet. He has since found a new way to get around the Great Firewall, the student said, without disclosing what it was.Close observers of the Chinese internet said some VPNs still work \u2014 and that China could still do a lot more to intensify its crackdown.\u201cWe do think that if the government has decided to do so, it could have shut down much more VPN usage right now,\u201d said a spokesman for VPNDada, a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs that work.\u201cIf the government had sent more cats, the mice would have a tougher time,\u201d said the spokesman, who declined to be named because of sensitivities around the group\u2019s work in China. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t do so because they need to give some air for people or businesses to breathe.\u201dMuch like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complicated and often imperfect political process. Government ministries feel pressure ahead of the party congress to show they are effective or can step in if a problem appears, analysts said.\u201cSo it\u2019s definitely not an apocalypse for VPNs,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cJust a more complex environment for users to navigate, and new capabilities and approaches give China better ability to shut off some delta of VPN use at a time and place of Beijing\u2019s choosing,\u201d he said.China\u2019s population is learning to deal with those difficulties at a younger age. Earlier this summer, China\u2019s internet giant Tencent began limiting the time that people under 18 were allowed to play the popular online game Honor of Kings to an hour a day for those under 12, and two hours for those age 12 to 18.So Chinese youths have taken to an age-old solution: getting a fake ID.\u201cYour Honor of Kings being limited? Interested in getting an over-18 identification?\u201d read a recent advertisement on Chinese social media. \u201cNo problem. Get in touch for a low-price ID.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai. Adam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market\u2019s Surge Meets Dollar\u2019s Swoon", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix months into the Trump presidency, two symbols of American financial might \u2014 the Dow and the dollar \u2014 have taken divergent paths, highlighting the complexities that investors face as the global economy hums, while Washington is enmeshed in political turmoil.Over this same period, the United States dollar has lost about 10 percent of its value against a basket of six major currencies.The near-mirror image fall in the dollar has been especially pronounced in recent weeks, stemming in part from concerns that President Trump\u2019s political problems will hamper his ability to pass a major tax reduction or an infrastructure bill.Yet those concerns have yet to halt the stock market\u2019s seemingly unstoppable advance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to record highs in the Dow as a validation of his administration, posting on Twitter on Tuesday morning:\u201cStock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d\u201cWhether you like the administration, the people, the rhetoric or not, there is no overstating just how powerful the animal spirits have been,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer for Deltec International Group, an investment firm based in Nassau, Bahamas. \u201cYou are seeing it in the data and it is evident in the financial markets as well.\u201dWhile there is no doubt that the animal spirits have done their work, just as important to the market\u2019s recent rally has been the significant fall in the dollar \u2014 not just against the euro and the yen, but against more volatile currencies like the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.Even the Chinese renminbi, once criticized by Mr. Trump as artificially low, has gained value against the dollar, climbing more than 3 percent for the year.A dollar in retreat means that trillions more dollars are sloshing around the global economy, ending up in 100-year Argentine bonds, Turkish airline stocks, junk bonds with stripped down investor protections and, of course, Dow stalwarts like Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\u201cDollar weakness means that there is increased liquidity all around the world,\u201d said Mr. Lele, the investment officer. \u201cAnd all that is flowing into carry trades.\u201dThe carry trade is financial jargon that describes the flow of money from low return assets to those with a higher return \u2014 not least when investors use a cheaper asset (dollars) to pay for riskier assets that promise better performance.When central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, intervened aggressively in global markets after the financial crisis, the immediate effect was rock bottom interest rates, a weak dollar and a search for \u201ccarry\u201d by global investors.Yet this trade lost some of its urgency in recent years as investors bet that the Fed would raise rates and that Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive fiscal policies would give a boost to the United States economy and the dollar.Instead, Trump administration officials have veered from the standard practice of talking up the dollar by pretty much doing the opposite. This approach was spurred largely by the administration\u2019s tough talk on trade and support for American manufacturers whose exports benefit from a less robust dollar.But it is also true that Mr. Trump, both from within his cabinet and his outside panel of economic advisers, has heard the view from Wall Street that an overly strong dollar would not help American financial markets.Edward Yardeni, an independent investment strategist, refers to the recent run-up in stocks, after what has already been one of the longest bull markets in financial history, as a \u201cmarket melt-up.\u201dThink of it as a rush of perhaps less discerning money into stocks, propelling stock market indexes past one historical milestone after another.For example, as of Monday, the Dow had reached 30 record highs this year, according to research by Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm.In a recent strategy note, Mr. Yardeni highlighted the effect of investor money pouring into exchange traded funds, which are easily traded, low-cost funds that track all varieties of indexes and investment themes.Over the last year, $232 billion has flowed into E.T.F.s that invest in domestic equities. In recent months, as the dollar has softened, global E.T.F.s that invest in Europe and emerging markets have been deluged with money and have taken in $121 billion for the year.Leading the way have been E.T.F.s that invest in higher-yielding, harder-to-trade securities like emerging market bonds, leveraged loans and bonds issued by low-rated corporations.Institutional and retail investors use the funds to make quick and longer term investment bets. But much of the flows, of late, seem to be coming from retail investors, many of whom were sitting on the sidelines in the last few years, analysts say.\u201cRight now, the market thinks the future looks good,\u201d said Peter Mallouk, the founder of Creative Planning, an independent investment adviser managing more than $26 billion out of Leawood, Kan. \u201cCorporate earnings are up, corporate taxes are expected to drop and most importantly, unemployment continues to trend lower.\u201dBeyond the stimulative effect that a struggling dollar has on global investment flows, some analysts point to another, more specific reason that might explain the near perfect correlation between the dollar\u2019s fall and the Dow\u2019s rise.The Dow, much more so than the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, has a weightier concentration in multinationals that rely on exporting their goods overseas, like Caterpillar, Boeing and Coca-Cola, to name a few.The weak dollar and strong growth in Asia, Europe and many emerging markets will be a boon for these companies, a number of which suffered in past years when the dollar was ascendant and worries about Europe and developing nations abounded.\u201cThere is no doubt that the big news \u2014 a drop in the dollar \u2014 is benefiting the Dow more than other indices,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis.\u201cIt has multinationals, and it benefits from improved trade flows. So dollar weakness may propel the Dow to 22,000 and beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Damaging Myth of the Loner Genius Nerd", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmotional IntelligenceMany scientists have said he got the biology wrong. But the job requirements of today\u2019s programmers show he was also wrong about working in tech.In fact, interpersonal skills like collaboration, communication, empathy and emotional intelligence are essential to the job. The myth that programming is done by loner men who think only rationally and communicate only with their computers harms the tech industry in ways that cut straight to the bottom line.The loner stereotype can deter talented people from the industry \u2014 not just women, but anyone who thinks that sounds like an unattractive job description. It can also result in dysfunctional teams and poorly performing products. Empathy, after all, is crucial to understanding consumers\u2019 desires, and its absence leads to product mistakes.She added, \u201cBut not everyone is the same, and that\u2019s where empathy and broader diversity really help.\u201dIt\u2019s true that programming can be a solitary activity in college computer science classes or entry-level positions. But soon after, it\u2019s impossible to avoid teamwork \u2014 with the business or legal departments, but also with other engineers.Yet that was never an accurate description of the job. It was social from the beginning, in university computer labs and, later, Silicon Valley garages, he said. The social circle just didn\u2019t include women.\u201cFor a lot of these young men, a certain computer culture becomes an expression of masculinity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who aren\u2019t doing physical labor, aren\u2019t playing professional sports. But they can express their masculinity by intense competition, playing pranks on one another, demonstrating their technical prowess, in ways that don\u2019t translate well to mixed-gender environments.\u201dEarly on, children who are less comfortable with social interaction \u2014 particularly boys, who are more likely to be socialized that way \u2014 are channeled toward science and engineering, he said. Teachers generally focus on the technical aspects and not the interpersonal ones. The result is a field filled with people who dislike social interactions and have been rewarded for it.In the tech industry, the lack of interpersonal skills has become a weakness and a liability.\u201cYou might have ideas in your head, but unless you communicate them, no one\u2019s going to understand,\u201d he said.Technical skills without empathy have resulted in products that have bombed in the market, because a vital step to building a product is the ability to imagine how someone else might think and feel. \u201cThe failure rate in software development is enormous, but it almost never means the code doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem that actually exists, or it imagines a user completely different from actual users.\u201dWith Google Glass, for example, it was a technical feat to make a tiny computer you could wear as a pair of glasses. But the product wasn\u2019t one that typical people needed, or wanted.When Apple introduced its Health app, it tracked sleep, exercise, food, medications and heart rate, but not menstrual cycle. Yet period trackers are one of the most used health tools for women. (The app now includes it.)Google Plus, the company\u2019s social network, initially required that users make public their name, photo and gender. There was a technical argument for including gender \u2014 to construct sentences like \u201cShe shared a photo with you\u201d \u2014 but it also exposed women to online harassment.\u201cThe team that made this decision was entirely male,\u201d said Mr. Zunger, who was the chief architect of social networking at Google at the time. \u201cIt was a really clear case of getting things wrong, for the simple reason that the people in the room weren\u2019t diverse enough to notice an obvious problem.\u201dEmpathy also affects which products are built in the first place \u2014 why, for example, Silicon Valley has spent more time building apps for expensive food delivery than for decreasing hunger.When engineers build products with empathy, it can seem like magic: Technology seems to predict what people want before they know they want it. That was part of Steve Jobs\u2019s genius. Just look at the number of people connected to their phones, or a child using an iPhone for the first time.One way to develop empathy at companies is by hiring diverse teams, because people bring different perspectives and life experiences. But the more widespread the stereotypes like those in the Google memo, the harder it becomes.\u201cThat nerd identity is really damaging to women,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also damaging to minorities and to a lot of men who don\u2019t want to subsume their identity in that.\u201dThat\u2019s why the consequences of the Google memo could reach far beyond the particular case, influencing which young people choose to go into technology, and which products they make that affect every aspect of our lives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Losing It in the Anti-Dieting Age", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "FeatureThe agonies of being overweight \u2014 or running a diet company \u2014 in a culture that likes to pretend it only cares about health, not size.Supported byChambers called Deb Benovitz, the company\u2019s senior vice president and global head of consumer insights. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re having one of the worst Januaries that anyone could have imagined,\u2019\u2019 she remembers him telling her. In the dieting business, January will tell you everything you need to know about the rest of the year. \u2018\u2018Nothing like we had anticipated.\u2019\u2019 Chambers and Benovitz knew that people had developed a kind of diet fatigue. Weight Watchers had recently tried the new marketing campaign, called \u2018\u2018Help With the Hard Part,\u2019\u2019 an attempt at radical honesty. No one wanted radical honesty. Chambers told Benovitz that they needed to figure out what was going on and how to fix it before the February board meeting.Benovitz got to work. She traveled the country, interviewing members, former members and people they thought should be members about their attitudes toward dieting. She heard that they no longer wanted to talk about \u2018\u2018dieting\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018weight loss.\u2019\u2019 They wanted to become \u2018\u2018healthy\u2019\u2019 so they could be \u2018\u2018fit.\u2019\u2019 They wanted to \u2018\u2018eat clean\u2019\u2019 so they could be \u2018\u2018strong.\u2019\u2019If you had been watching closely, you could see that the change had come slowly. \u2018\u2018Dieting\u2019\u2019 was now considered tacky. It was anti-feminist. It was arcane. In the new millennium, all bodies should be accepted, and any inclination to change a body was proof of a lack of acceptance of it. \u2018\u2018Weight loss\u2019\u2019 was a pursuit that had, somehow, landed on the wrong side of political correctness. People wanted nothing to do with it. Except that many of them did: They wanted to be thinner. They wanted to be not quite so fat. Not that there was anything wrong with being fat! They just wanted to call dieting something else entirely.The change had been spurred not just by dieting fatigue but also by real questions about dieting\u2019s long-term efficacy. In Weight Watchers\u2019 own research, the average weight loss in any behavior-modification program is about a 5 percent reduction of body weight after six months, with a return of a third of the weight lost at two years. There were studies that appeared to indicate that the cycle of weight loss and weight gain could cause long-term damage to the metabolism. Those studies led to more studies, which suggested that once your body reaches a certain weight, it is nearly impossible to exist at a much lower weight for an extended period of time. Even more studies began to question whether or not it\u2019s so bad to be fat in the first place; one notably suggested that fatter people lived longer than thin ones.Diet companies suffered for being associated with dieting. Lean Cuisine repositioned itself as a \u2018\u2018modern eating\u2019\u2019 company, not a diet company. In fact, Lean Cuisine went so far in their pivot that in 2016 they introduced a Google Chrome extension that would filter mentions of the word \u2018\u2018diet\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018dieting\u2019\u2019; it apparently did this to show that just because it was called Lean Cuisine, that didn\u2019t mean it was a diet company. You can\u2019t be held responsible for what your parents named you!Weight Watchers saw all this happening and concluded that people didn\u2019t have faith in diets. The company decided that what it offered was not a diet program but a lifestyle program. It was a behavior-modification program. (For the sake of expediency here, I will call its program a diet because it prescribes amounts of food.) When Deb Benovitz returned from her travels with news of dieting\u2019s new language changes, the company realized that something had to change more than its marketing approach.Weight Watchers\u2019 chief science officer is Gary Foster, a psychologist \u2014 the first in that position, which previously had been held by dietitians. What he and his team realized from Benovitz\u2019s research was that dieters wanted a holistic approach to eating, one that helped really change their bodies, yes, but in a way that was sustainable and positive. He got to work creating a new approach that would become known as Beyond the Scale: He used all available mind-body research to try to figure out a way for members to appreciate benefits of the program besides weight loss. This would help them stay on the program during setbacks and beyond their weight-loss period and allow the program to infiltrate their lives beyond mealtime and beyond plain old eating suggestions.The company would move away from giving its members goal weights. It expanded its cognitive-behavioral strategies, which taught members to challenge unhelpful thinking and to respond to their emotions with reason, as opposed to with food or despair. It developed workshops that used meditation and qigong and didn\u2019t once mention food or weight. It updated its apps and introduced a social-media program, Connect. It became as holistic-minded as the people told Benovitz they wanted a program to be.But Weight Watchers was still a company called Weight Watchers, and it had to figure out a way to communicate all of this change to the public. People had too many associations with the brand. It needed someone other than the usual celebrity spokesdieter, a fat famous person who could be paid somewhere between $250,000 and $2 million to do the talk show circuit and People covers for a year. It needed someone who could fast-track the message that it was worth taking a new look at Weight Watchers.When the company called Oprah Winfrey in July 2015, she was standing on the lawn of her home in Maui with a sprained ankle, an injury she sustained while hiking in the mountains. In the month since her convalescence began, she had gained 17 pounds. Her struggles with weight were, at this point, a cultural meme. How could you explain the failure of someone so goal-oriented and successful \u2014 someone so successful that her name was invoked as a symbol of success as often as it was ever used to summon her? Weight Watchers had reached out to her in the past, but she politely declined. This time she bought a 10 percent stake in the company for $43 million, and Weight Watchers stockholders rejoiced.But the verbal changes around dieting had indicated something deeper than just a marketing issue; they pointed straight back to the fatigue that was hurting Weight Watchers in the first place. So, yes, many people celebrated the new partnership. But others \u2014 meaning, anyone who for a majority of their lives had been watching Oprah cycle up and down through different sizes \u2014 felt a little confused by the move. What was Oprah, a person whose very brand meant enlightenment and progress, doing on another diet? It was hard not to suspect that she was trapped, like so many of us are, in a culture that says one thing about fatness and means something very different.Its frankness seems like an anachronism now, but you have to consider that at the time, this kind of straight talk was a glass of cold water in the desert for many fat people, who privately wondered why it was so hard for them to reduce the size of their bodies when it seemed so effortless for the people who walked around thin. Nidetch lost her weight in her late 30s, after a lifetime of self-loathing and embarrassment; the last indignity was the time someone asked when her baby was due when she was definitively not pregnant. She went to a city-run obesity clinic, and when she left the program, she kept the diet it gave her. She mimeographed it and handed it out to people whom she had gathered to spread the word about how weight loss could provide freedom and hope. (The diet would evolve from an eating plan to a more democratic system of balanced exchanges to an absolute laissez-faire system of points, as the company realized that the more autonomy and the less deprivation people experienced in their dieting \u2014 limitless choices, if not limitless amounts \u2014 the more likely they\u2019d be to stay on the diet.) But Nidetch knew that it wasn\u2019t just the food that was the problem; it was the problem that was the problem. What fat people needed was one another. They needed a space in which they could talk openly about the physical struggles and daily humiliations of walking around in a fat body, and just how much that sucked.These same ideas were articulated more starkly a few years later, but with a different prescription. In 1967, a fat man named Lew Louderback unleashed an essay in The Saturday Evening Post arguing that the wisdom around thinness could be applied only to thin people \u2014 that fat people suffered physically and psychologically when trying to maintain thin-person weights, and that this maintenance seemed to be temporary at best and largely destructive emotionally.He went on to write a book called \u2018\u2018Fat Power,\u2019\u2019 which helped give birth to what would become known as the fat-acceptance movement. That movement has varying degrees of militancy, but generally asks the public to put aside its bias and learn something new \u2014 to not think of fat people as lazy; to not deny them medical care; to not exclude them from their basic rights. It suggests that we re-examine what we think we know about fatness, that we consider trying to love and care for our bodies at whatever size they are now.There were more books and more essays and more challenges to the status quo in the decades to come. In 2008, Linda Bacon, a researcher who holds graduate degrees in physiology, psychology and exercise science with a specialty in nutrition, wrote a seminal fat-acceptance book, \u2018\u2018Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,\u2019\u2019 which used peer-reviewed research to bolster these ideas. She gave seminars to doctors on fat phobia and weight bias in an effort to help them understand how their views on obesi\u00adty were hurting their patients and not allowing them to examine fatness neutrally. For example, there is evidence that stress and discrimination play a strong role in the insulin resistance and diabetes and heart disease for which weight typi\u00adcally takes the blame.With the rise of social media, the movement began to infiltrate the culture in other ways, too. Fat-acceptance and body-positivity activists began posting pictures of themselves on Instagram \u2014 just regular pictures, defiant for their lack of apology. There were intuitive-eating workshops and body-positivity training camps. There were bloggers and authors asking exactly how much of your life you were willing to put off in pursuit of a diet, or until you got to a certain weight, even temporarily. Normal, nonmilitant, nonactivist people began asking themselves if it was that bad to be fat \u2014 if it was that unhealthy, or that ugly, to be fat. And yet the most telling thing about the way the fat-acceptance movement is received in our society may be that its Wikipedia entry contains two quotes from people criticizing it before it mentions even one person who espouses it. In this world, we are witness to a moment when the word \u201coptimal\u201d is used in conjunction with the word \u201cbody,\u201d when people are trying to mold themselves into high-performance, precision machines. The idea of a fat machine makes no sense when you are easily fueled and refueled on Whole Foods and Soylent.In other words, all this activism didn\u2019t make the world more comfortable with fat people or dieting. Society doesn\u2019t normally change the words for things unless we\u2019re fundamentally uncomfortable with the concepts beneath them. Consider the verbal game of chicken we\u2019ve played with the people all this affects: Fat people went from being called fat (which is mean) to being called overweight (a polite-seeming euphemism that either accidentally or not accidentally implies that there is a standard weight) to being called zaftig/chubby/pleasingly plump (just don\u2019t) to curvy (which seems to imbue size with a sexuality and optimism where it should just be sexually and emotionally neutral) and back to fat (because it\u2019s only your judgment of fat people that made it a bad word in the first place, and maybe being fat isn\u2019t as bad as we\u2019ve been made to believe). It bears mentioning that Weight Watchers doesn\u2019t have a standardized word for its demographic, but Foster uses the term \u2018\u2018people with overweight.\u2019\u2019As the ideas that sprang from the fat-acceptance movement began to trickle into the mainstream, fat people began to wonder what it might be like to put all this aside and just live their lives. Some asked themselves if they thought they could figure out a way to not want to be thin; some began to ask themselves if they actually liked the way they looked. They began to wonder if there was even a proven and effective way to become and stay thin anyway. They began to ask themselves if they should be dieting at all.Maybe that\u2019s true. Most mainstream sources agree on this, but there are definitely some researchers who don\u2019t; there are some who think that people who end up fat have different physiologies, and that fatness is just one component of them. Consider the \u2018\u2018uptick,\u2019\u2019 as Foster calls it, that comes after two years on a diet when, say, the person who lost 5 percent of her weight has gained a third of it back. Think about those numbers. If you weigh 300 pounds, you will lose 15 pounds in six months. You\u2019ll keep it off for a year or two, maybe. Five pounds is likely to return. Of course, these are people who don\u2019t stay on a diet-maintenance plan; but the average dieter certainly doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s worth it to ask why a person wouldn\u2019t stay on a program that offered such rewards. Is it because they couldn\u2019t? It\u2019s worth it to ask if the programs are right and all these humans trying very hard at them are wrong. And also, where are the 300-pound people who want to lose just 15 pounds in the first place? I haven\u2019t met those people. But mainly, what it comes down to is this: Weight Watchers is designed to be successful only if you can stay on Weight Watchers forever.And there were also questions about dieting\u2019s long-term effects on the body. A study done by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The study followed contestants who had appeared on the eighth season of \u2018\u2018The Biggest Loser,\u2019\u2019 all of whom had normal resting metabolisms for their size when the season began. As the contestants experienced radical, sweeps-week weight loss, their metabolisms slowed, and stayed slow afterward. To maintain his weight loss, one contestant\u2019s resting metabolism now required 800 calories fewer per day than a man of his size. It might be that when you have been fat, your body doesn\u2019t behave the way a thin body does, even when you become thinner.Foster shook his head at that one. He hears about the \u2018\u2018Biggest Loser\u2019\u2019 study a lot, but he doesn\u2019t think it conveys accurate information. It uses a very small sample under extreme conditions. He cited his own and others\u2019 studies examining the metabolic rate, fat distribution and psychological state of people before they lose weight, after they lose weight and after they regain the weight. \u2018\u2018Nothing is changed,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good outcome or something we should celebrate \u2014 but this idea that the act of managing your weight and losing weight has somehow set you up to be in a worse spot just isn\u2019t borne out by the science.\u2019\u2019Here is the thing about this particular debate at this particular moment: Everyone has much the same data, but there are plenty of people who would interpret the data differently from the way Foster does. I\u2019ve spoken to countless (I literally stopped keeping count) obesity researchers and dietitians and biologists and doctors. The answer becomes one of point of view: Is fat inherently bad, or can it be neutral?We can\u2019t answer that yet. There is still too much debate. So in the meantime, a fat person has to consider the data she has access to \u2014 meaning studies, yes, but also her own experience and the experience of her fat peers \u2014 and ask: Do you believe that you, a fat person, can ever be meaningfully thinner for a meaningful amount of time? Is a diet successful if it stops being successful once you\u2019re done with it? I\u2019ve interviewed Foster before. Back in 2011, when he was at Temple, he published a study about the efficacy of different kinds of diets. They all led to similar losses, and they all led to similar rates of recidivism. When I spoke with him back then, I asked him why we should continue dieting if the outcomes were so bad. He was concerned that I would suggest to my readers that dieting wasn\u2019t worth it. He told me that people didn\u2019t need that kind of discouragement. This attitude is what makes him so credible to me \u2014 his message was the same long before he worked for a corporation \u2014 but it\u2019s also what makes this so depressing.I do not recommend being a fat person at Obesity Week. Over the years, the event has become a week long, and it contains a robust trade show. After Foster left me to go to a meeting, I walked the trade-show floor and saw all the products being shown to the obesity specialists in attendance. I watched a video of a new kind of retractor that will more easily hold open belly skin while part of a stomach is cut out and sewn up, because you can\u2019t eat as much if your stomach is made smaller. I watched a person showing a model of a balloon you\u2019d insert into the stomach of a patient that would take up volume so that she wouldn\u2019t be so hungry, to be removed later once her behavior had been modified. I drank a smoothie with a superfood ingredient I can\u2019t pronounce or remember while someone told me that my readers would really be interested in their something-metrics plan for hydration and portion control. I narrowed my eyes thoughtfully because it felt rude to be drinking this guy\u2019s smoothie without taking him seriously. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no such thing as magic, Taffy,\u2019\u2019 the smoothie man was saying. I nodded in solemn agreement.Before he left me, I told Foster that Obesity Week made me sad. First, it was the profusion of educated people in the room studying me and my people as if we were problems to solve. But second, it was because if you have this many hundreds of smart and educated people trying to figure this out, and nobody has anything for me but superfood and behavior modification and an insertable balloon and the removal of an organ, it must be that there is no way to solve fatness.Foster doesn\u2019t see it that way, he told me. \u2018\u2018I look around this room,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018and I see hope.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018In Brooklyn?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, when I was in high school.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018In Los Angeles?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, right before I was married.\u2019\u2019 I stopped her before she could go on. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re all me.\u2019\u2019By then I was all in, as if I ever hadn\u2019t been. When I arrived at the Union, N.J., meeting at 8 a.m. on a Saturday, it was a few weeks before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is marketed as a fun, festive holiday of family gathering, but everyone at that meeting knew the truth: Thanksgiving is an existential threat. Thanksgiving is a killer.The year leading up to Thanksgiving hadn\u2019t been much better for this group. There had been family deaths and illness. There had been foreclosures and unemployments and high-school reunions, and someone\u2019s daughter was always baking sticky buns; someone\u2019s husband wanted to know where his steak was; someone\u2019s son wanted to know why the meatloaf tasted different; someone\u2019s co-worker was always leaving doughnuts and bagels on the communal table at the office. The people, mostly women, in the folding chairs had one rule, though: No matter what happened during the week, you showed up. \u2018\u2018This is my church,\u2019\u2019 a woman named Donna told me. A few months before, she buried her mother on a Friday; on Saturday she came to the meeting.Dayna, the group leader, stood at the head of the room. How could you not love Dayna? She took such care with her appearance \u2014 she wore tall boots and wrap dresses and makeup, even on Saturday mornings when everyone else wore sweatpants at best (or leggings; leggings weigh less). She gave them star-shaped stickers off a large roll when they lost weight or when they had acted in their best interests over the week. She remembered their names, even the ones who hadn\u2019t shown up in months; she gave them hugs.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m so frickin\u2019 aggravated,\u2019\u2019 she said. She asked me how I did. I shrugged and told her I had lost three pounds. \u2018\u2018But I just started, so, .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019\u2019 I said. I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad. Another woman, Amy, whispered to me, \u2018\u2018You never want to say \u2018I only lost, .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019 because then everyone will go, \u2018Oh, jeez.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019I asked the women there, most of whom were repeat joiners as well: Shouldn\u2019t we be moving toward acceptance? Here we all were \u2014 smart, accomplished, successful women (and one man) \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t maintain what was proved to be the most effective diet you could ever try. If we couldn\u2019t stay on this, could we stay on anything? What if the flaw wasn\u2019t in us but in the system?They furrowed their brows and shook their heads and gave me funny looks. What was I talking about? How could a fat person not want to be thin? Donna\u2019s sisters were all on diabetes medication, and she wasn\u2019t. Her back had hurt until about 20 pounds ago, and now she could crawl on the floor with her grandson as if it were nothing.I couldn\u2019t counter very hard. Each time I came to a meeting, I was seduced by the possibility, by the clean, Calvinist logic, that if you ate less you would weigh less, that your body would feed on itself and its fat reserves until you became smaller and smaller and more pleasing to the world and its standards \u2014 until you practically disappeared (we are a culture that fetishizes something called Size 0). I looked forward to these meetings, feeling as if these people were the only ones who seemed to truly understand my predicament. But my optimism and motivation didn\u2019t survive my walk out the door. By the time I got to my car, I had no idea what to do. I knew that if this could be done, I would have done it, and yet I didn\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t do it. Just eat less, right? It\u2019s so simple!I went to an intuitive-eating class \u2014 intuitive eating is where you learn to feed yourself based only on internal signals and not external ones like mealtimes or diet plans. Meaning it\u2019s just eating what you want when you\u2019re hungry and stopping when you\u2019re full. There were six of us in there, educated, desperate fat women, doing mindful-eating exercises and discussing their pitfalls and challenges. We were given food. We would smell the food, put the food on our lips, think about the food, taste the food, roll the food around in our mouths, swallow the food. Are you still hungry? Are you sure? The first week it was a raisin. It progressed to cheese and crackers, then to cake, then to Easter candy. We sat there silently, as if we were aliens who had just arrived on Earth and were learning what this thing called food was and why and how you would eat it. Each time we did the eating exercise, I would cry. \u2018\u2018What is going on for you?\u2019\u2019 the leader would ask. But it was the same answer every time: I am 41, I would say. I am 41 and accomplished and a beloved wife and a good mother and a hard worker and a contributor to society and I am learning how to eat a goddamned raisin. How did this all go so wrong for me?They tried to soothe me. They told me that hatred of fat was a societal construct, but I never understood why that should comfort me. I live in society. I hurt my ankle playing tennis, activating an old injury, and an internist I was seeing for the first time, without taking any medical history or vital signs \u2014 my blood pressure is pristine, just so you know \u2014 told me he couldn\u2019t do anything for me until I lost weight and gave me a rusty photocopy about food exchanges. (Another doctor prescribed three months of physical therapy, and now my ankle is fine.) I was in Iceland, for a story assignment, and the man who owned my hotel took me fishing and said, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not going to insist you wear a life jacket, since I think you\u2019d float, if you know what I mean.\u2019\u2019 I ignored him, and then afterward, back on land, after I fished cod like a Viking, he said, \u2018\u2018I call that survival of the fattest.\u2019\u2019 A woman getting into a seat next to me on a plane said, \u2018\u2018Looks like this will be a cozy ride,\u2019\u2019 and a Manhattan taxi driver told me he liked to watch my \u2018\u2018jelly\u2019\u2019 shake, by which I can only presume he meant a part of my body. I have been asked if it was my first time taking Pilates at a studio where I\u2019m on my fifth 10-pack. I have been told at a yoga class that I have \u2018\u2018a really great spirit\u2019\u2019 and it\u2019s important that I \u2018\u2018just keep coming.\u2019\u2019 (I\u2019ve been taking yoga for 12 years.) I was told by a seamstress that she had never seen a bride not lose weight for her wedding until she met me. A crazy man tried to give me candy outside the Met, and when I politely declined he screamed at me that of course I didn\u2019t want it, I was fat enough, and my sister asked me why I was so upset, clearly that guy was crazy, and I said, \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re skinny,\u2019\u2019 and on and on forever. (By the way, I am writing this despite the myriad degradations that I know will appear in my inbox and in the comments section when it is published. I am someone who once wrote a body-image essay for a women\u2019s magazine in which a comment in the margins from an editor read, \u2018\u2018Why doesn\u2019t she stop eating so much?\u2019\u2019)Back in Union, Dayna stood at the front of the room. The conversation had shifted to Thanksgiving foods, how sons home from college depend on the stuffin\u2019 muffins, how husbands will know if there\u2019s no butter in the mashed potatoes. Donna makes an Easter pie with more kinds of pork than there are pigs roaming the Earth. Really, the group members were worried that despite their weight loss, they would forget that they were really fat people on the inside. Thanksgiving is a killer.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s just one day,\u2019\u2019 Dayna said. And all those around her heaved heavy sighs.When Oprah called me, she was on the same mountain in Hawaii where she sprained her ankle two years ago. After a monthslong search, Weight Watchers had hired a new C.E.O., Mindy Grossman, formerly of the Home Shopping Network. In her office, Grossman had talked to me about personalizing the company\u2019s mobile app and creating greater moments for connection. She is tan and very blond, with pink lipstick; she looks like the second coming of Jean Nidetch. Weight Watchers had found its business leader. She was joining the company after its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth because it had finally found its spiritual one.On the release day of the commercial in which Oprah told the world she loved bread and was excited to be able to eat it every day and still lose weight, the graph line shot up tall and straight at Weight Watchers. But a lot of us wondered if maybe Oprah had finally fallen out of touch. She said in one commercial, \u2018\u2018Inside every overweight woman is a woman she knows she can be,\u2019\u2019 saying she\u2019d been buried in her weight to the point where she couldn\u2019t recognize herself, and the internet did not love this sentiment, asking exactly why Oprah thought that women were worthless if they weren\u2019t thin. They asked if she was \u2018\u2018disempowering women.\u2019\u2019 They said her investment in Weight Watchers was \u2018\u2018bad news for women everywhere.\u2019\u2019 One blogger wrote that she was \u2018\u2018disappointed that she is choosing to participate in and endorse a company whose sole purpose is to tell women that they are not enough.\u2019\u2019 The journalist Melissa Harris-Perry gave a five-minute \u2018\u2018Letter of the Week\u2019\u2019 on MSNBC saying: \u2018\u2018But, O! You are already precisely the woman so many are striving to be,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018there is not one thing that you have done that would have been more extraordinary if you\u2019d done it with a 25-inch waist.\u2019\u2019 Oprah\u2019s $43 million investment was now worth $110 million. Maybe that\u2019s what this was all about in the first place.Oprah sounds like Oprah when you talk with her \u2014 she sings your name, \u2018\u2018Taffy!\u2019\u2019 and her voice registers in you in a way that is as familiar to your body as your mother\u2019s voice. She told me she doesn\u2019t care if she\u2019s never skinny again. She cares that she feels as if she has control. For her whole life, she said, her only goal has been to find a higher level of consciousness, to remain more in the moment than she has ever been in any other moment. She had never felt stress, even during all those years when she was doing three shows a day. She just ate instead. She had bags of potato chips, and people would say, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you get stressed?\u2019\u2019 and she\u2019d think, What\u2019s stress? She had seen the cultural changes for years. She knew that you were no longer supposed to say that you wanted to diet or be thinner. You had to want \u2018\u2018fitness\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018strength\u2019\u2019 and just general health. But this thinking was a prison. So was the one where you just accept yourself and move on. \u201cThis whole P.C. about accepting yourself as you are \u2014 you should, 100 percent,\u201d she said. But it was that thinking that made her say yes to Weight Watchers. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a mechanism to keep myself on track that brings a level of consciousness and awareness to my eating. It actually is, for me, mindful eating, because the points are so ingrained now.\u2019\u2019 Meaning, Oprah wasn\u2019t interested in ceding to a movement. She was wondering how to finally make this work.\u2018\u2018In the particular moment in time that I got the call,\u2019\u2019 she told me, \u2018\u2018I was desperate: What\u2019s going to work? I\u2019ve tried all of the green juices and protein shakes, and let\u2019s do a cleanse, and all that stuff. That doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t last. What is going to be consistent, keep me conscious and mindful?\u2019\u2019But this thing about acceptance? Why couldn\u2019t accepting herself mean not accepting her weight? Why wasn\u2019t it an act of love to use any available means to avoid her genetic predisposition to diabetes? Sure, she could have abandoned her efforts. She could have gone hard on acceptance. A million people would have bought \u2018\u2018Oprah\u2019s Guide to Body Acceptance.\u2019\u2019 But she couldn\u2019t get there. \u2018\u2018For your heart to pump, pump, pump, pump, it needs the least amount of weight possible to do that,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSo all of the people who are saying, \u2018Oh, I need to accept myself as I am\u2019 \u2014 I can\u2019t accept myself if I\u2019m over 200 pounds, because it\u2019s too much work on my heart. It causes high blood pressure for me. It puts me at risk for diabetes, because I have diabetes in my family.\u2019\u2019I nodded into the phone because I didn\u2019t want Oprah to hear me crying. I wanted to quit dieting, but had come to realize that dieting was all I had. I was completely perplexed by food \u2014 food! Stupid food! That\u2019s what this was about! I dieted because I wanted to maintain hope that I could one day manage my food intake, because my bewilderment around the stuff was untenable. When I didn\u2019t have that hope, I was left with too much worry about pain, about how much my knees hurt now and how much more they would in just a few years. I could be enlightened about my body. I could have acceptance. But nobody would tell that to the people who saw me as a target; nobody would tell that to my knees.And yet, I told Oprah, in admitting this, I couldn\u2019t stop feeling as if I were betraying everyone I knew who was out there trying to find peace with herself. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking that nothing would change in the world until there was a kind of uprising.\u2018\u2018Oh, my God, Taffy,\u2019\u2019 Oprah said. \u2018\u2018I have to have a talk with you. I used to say this to my producers all the time. We are never going to win with this show looking back to see what other people are doing on their shows. The only way you win is to keep looking forward for yourself. What\u2019s best for you?\u2019\u2019The \u2018\u2018you\u2019\u2019 threw me. I didn\u2019t know if she meant \u2018\u2018you\u2019\u2019 as in my body or \u2018\u2018you\u2019\u2019 as in me, and it occurred to me that she could mean both, that some people think of those two things as the same thing. I treated my body with such contempt, but my body wasn\u2019t different from me. There were no two of me to put on a magazine cover, just the one of me.Weight isn\u2019t neutral. A woman\u2019s body isn\u2019t neutral. A woman\u2019s body is everyone\u2019s business but her own. Even in our attempts to free one another, we were still trying to tell one another what to want and what to do. It is terrible to tell people to try to be thinner; it is also terrible to tell them that wanting to lose weight is hopeless and wrong.I don\u2019t know if diets can work in the short term or the long term. For the first time, I began to think that this was something worth being made crazy over. Our bodies deserve our thoughts and our kindness, our acceptance and our striving. Our bodies are what carry our thoughts and our kindness and our acceptance and striving.Eileen, a lifetime member who sat next to Donna at every meeting, had bought her a plastic tiara. Donna wore leggings this time, not sweatpants as usual, with her traditional Uggs and a fleece, and someone pointed out that you could finally see her shape. She passed around some old pictures; she was unrecognizable in them, if you could find her behind all the other people in the picture.\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel like a thin person,\u2019\u2019 Donna said. Her hope is that she\u2019ll continue to at least look like one.Dayna, near sobbing, gave her a bunch of star stickers off her roll. \u2018\u2018My heart just feels so happy today,\u2019\u2019 she said.We all cheered for Donna, and when I left, I walked around outside. A skinny woman was eating a cupcake and talking on her phone, tonguing the icing as if she were on ecstasy. Another skinny woman drank a regular Dr Pepper as if it were nothing, as if it were just a drink. I continued walking and stopped in front of a diner and watched through the window people eating cheeseburgers and French fries and talking gigantically. All these people, I looked at them as if they were speaking Mandarin or discussing string theory, with their ease around their food and their ease around their bodies and their ability to live their lives without the doubt and self-loathing that brings me to my arthritic knees still.

{"Headline": "America Is Struggling to Sort Out Where \u2018Violence\u2019 Begins and Ends", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsWhen did our national discourse become so consumed with the state of our national discourse? Rarely has so much public dialogue been dedicated to arguing over what can\u2019t be said, who can\u2019t say it and just how they shouldn\u2019t put it. It has always been politically profitable to frame your opponents\u2019 rhetoric as irrational, cruel, even dangerous. But our now-\u00adconstant public skirmishes over speech have moved to another level entirely: These days, the closer you can situate your opponents\u2019 words to actual violence, the better.A movement to redraw the lines between speech and violence is taking shape on the right, too. Last year, the conservative lawyer Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, accusing them of \u2018\u2018inciting and causing serious bodily injury or death\u2019\u2019 to police officers. (The case was dismissed; Klayman has appealed it.) And last month, the political cartoonist Ben Garrison published a panel showing screeching liberals like Madonna (\u2018\u2018BLOW IT UP!\u2019\u2019), Kathy Griffin (\u2018\u2018DECAPITATE TRUMP!\u2019\u2019) and Rachel Maddow (\u2018\u2018TRUMP IS HITLER!\u2019\u2019) with their fiery rhetoric lighting the fuse of a bomb labeled \u2018\u2018FAR LEFT TERROR.\u2019\u2019In addition to accusing one another of actual violence, we are now, more and more easily, counting the tenor of speech as violence enough in itself. The accusation has become so familiar that in certain circles, it\u2019s curdled into a punch line \u2014 as when people post a picture of a bad outfit or a new celebrity couple and say, in mock outrage, \u2018\u2018This is violence!\u2019\u2019One temptation of making accusations of violence is that it seems capable of cutting through all the political noise, making an issue feel visceral and urgent. But with everyone redefining violence based on their existing political sympathies, it just as easily works to mislead and confuse \u2014 conflating structural inequality with political name-\u00adcalling, or equating the impact of artistic expression with the effects of a policy vote. What\u2019s often lost in the mainstream discussion of symbolic violence is that this is a power struggle as much as a rhetorical one. It\u2019s not just a fight over how we speak, but over who is speaking and what we will allow them to say \u2014 from those who express extreme positions in polite tones all the way over to those who express reasonable positions in impolite ones. A fight over politics is mixed up with a battle over tone, squabbles over whose rhetoric is out of line and who started it. It makes the political discourse louder, but not any clearer.Advertisement"}

In the latest example, the Republican leader of the State Assembly, Chad Mayes, persuaded some Republicans to join with Democrats in voting to extend cap-and-trade, California\u2019s signature emission reduction program.Make that the former Republican leader of the State Assembly.Mr. Mayes announced Thursday that he was stepping down in the face of criticism from conservatives over his vote. Some of them assailed Mr. Mayes for helping to pass a Democratic agenda item that they described as economically damaging and against party orthodoxy.Given the overwhelming number of Democrats in Sacramento, the ouster is unlikely to have much effect on the way California is governed. But by any measure, it is a setback for party leaders trying to reposition the on-the-outs California Republican Party in the age of President Trump.Mr. Mayes said his party needed to change \u201cor we are going to continue down a death spiral.\u201d He said his ouster reflected the views of a small wing.\u201cThese are not your normal California Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are party activists. We\u2019ve got to figure out how to bring them along because we need to. But for the life of the party \u2014 for the future growth of the party \u2014 we have to begin to do things differently.\u201dThe 25-member caucus voted unanimously on Thursday to replace him with Brian Dahle, a member of the Assembly since 2012, who voted against the cap-and-trade bill.\u201cI am going to continue to keep working toward changing the image that people in California have about California Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia Republicans are different than national Republicans. We care about the environment. A huge number of California Republicans believe that climate change is real and state government has an obligation to address it. We shouldn\u2019t be running away from it.\u201dThe New York Times is building up its reporting efforts in California.So we\u2019re soliciting feedback from people in the state on what matters to you, what coverage has been lacking, where California is headed, and other questions.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Roughly 70,000 people are expected to transform a seven-square-mile area into a carnival of art installations, dreamlike costumes and all-night dance parties.

In 1990, they moved it to a remote outpost in the Black Rock Desert, about three hours north of Reno.Since then it\u2019s grown each year into what is now a cultural phenomenon.Another is \u201cradical inclusion,\u201d which might help explain the presence of a large contingent of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite amid a sea of artists, ravers and dreadlocked hippies.The California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

Snap\u2019s shares went down as much as 5 percent before whipsawing throughout the day, and closed at $13.67.The next moment of potential drama is likely to be at the end of August, after Snap reports its latest quarterly earnings \u2014 and the second phase of the lockup expires.Snap\u2019s stock price is now down nearly 20 percent from its initial offer price.Advertisement"}

We are going from \u201clater\u201d to \u201cnow.\u201d In the past you could fix any climate/environmental problem later or now. But today later is officially over. Later will be too late. At some point, the deforestation of the Amazon is not reversible.We are the middle of a change in the \u201cclimate\u201d of globalization. We are going from an interconnected world to an interdependent one, and in such a world your friends can hurt you faster than your enemies: Think what happens if Mexico\u2019s economy fails. And your rivals\u2019 falling becomes more dangerous than your rivals\u2019 rising: We will be hurt a lot more by China\u2019s economy tanking than its putting tanks on islands in the South China Sea.Governing today is all about how you prepare your society to get the most out of these three climate changes and cushion the worst. Sadly, that\u2019s not our society\u2019s priority right now. In the age of Trump we are treating governing as entertainment.Some conservatives argue that\u2019s fine. The less D.C. does, the better. Let the market rule. I disagree. What actually made America great was a government that prepared the right soil in education, regulation, immigration, research and infrastructure, and a dynamic private sector that grew all kinds of flowers in that soil.Which brings me to China. China takes governing seriously \u2014 in a cruel way and in an impressive way. Its leaders wake up every morning and ask themselves two questions. First, how do we stay in power? Their answer, which I find reprehensible, is: We\u2019ll use technology to repress our people. I think in the long run depriving China\u2019s people of freedom, a basic human right, will undermine their ability to realize their full potential.But it has worked better than expected, up to now, because China\u2019s leaders are just as focused on asking a second question: What world are we living in? Which leads to: What are the biggest forces shaping this world? And what kind of national strategy do we need so our people can get the most out of these forces and cushion the worst?They know we\u2019re in the midst of these three climate changes and have formulated a strategy \u2014 \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 to thrive within it. It\u2019s a plan for building the infrastructure, investments, education and regulations that will enable Chinese companies to lead in supercomputing, new materials, computer-controlled machine tools, industrial robotics, space and aviation equipment \u2014 including drones \u2014 clean cars, clean energy, biomedicine and next-gen medical devices.Only time will tell how much what China has wrong about governing will undermine what it has right.He\u2019s spending the money instead on a wall against Mexico. Is there anything more stupid?And then you watch the health care debate. And then you realize that in addition to the executive branch, one of our two parties has gone nuts. For seven years the G.O.P. made replacing Obamacare, which needs improving, its top goal, and when it finally controlled all the levers of power, it was clear that it had done no homework on a better plan or built any intraparty consensus for it. It was all a fraud.And then you look at all the knife fights between rival Trump aides and you realize that none of these fights were over how to thrive in a world challenged by these three climate changes. They were all about who could get closest to and flatter our Dear Leader most. But our Dear Leader \u2014 as we saw in the health care debate \u2014 has done no homework on the future, either. He\u2019s been too busy promising to restore the past.This is so dangerous. When the pace of change accelerates in climate, technology and globalization all at once, small errors in leadership navigation can have huge consequences. It\u2019s like a 747 pilot who enters the wrong navigational coordinates. You can find yourself so far off course that the pain of getting back will be staggering.We have such a pilot. It is time for the adult Republicans and Democrats in Congress to come together and take the helm.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}

While you wait, the last order of the duck you wanted passes by. Tonight, you\u2019ll be eating something else \u2014 without a second bottle of wine, because you can\u2019t find your server in the busy dining room. This is not your favorite night out.The right data could have fixed it, according to the tech wizards who are determined to jolt the restaurant industry out of its current slump. Information culled and crunched from a wide array of sources can identify customers who like to linger, based on data about their dining histories, so the manager can anticipate your wait, buy you a drink and make the delay less painful.It can track the restaurant\u2019s duck sales by day, week and season, and flag you as a regular who likes duck. It can identify a server whose customers have spent a less-than-average amount on alcohol, to see if he needs to sharpen his second-round skills.So Big Data is staging an intervention.Both start-ups and established companies are scrambling to deliver up-to-the-minute data on sales, customers, staff performance or competitors by merging the information that restaurants already have with all sorts of data from outside sources: social media, tracking apps, reservation systems, review sites, even weather reports.They have an eager audience. The NPD Group, a market research company, is predicting \u201cflat\u201d growth in 2017 restaurant traffic, with a 2 percent decline among full-service restaurants and no growth for quick-service restaurants. A 2016 National Restaurant Association survey reported that four out of five restaurateurs believed that business would improve if they embraced technology, and a third worried that they were lagging in those efforts.In the old days, restaurateurs used ledgers to track sales, and scribbled notes about their customers\u2019 preferences or idiosyncrasies. Then along came point-of-sale software and reservation services that provided more sophisticated records and analysis, but created a tech tower of Babel, with most systems speaking their own dialect.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.These new tools make a paradoxical promise: that they can take restaurants back to the good old days, before the business grew so big.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201cis to leverage the technology to do what we would do if we had one little restaurant and we were there all the time and knew every customer by name.\u201dMr. Oberholtzer and his two partners opened the first of two dozen cafeteria-style restaurants in Culver City, Calif., in 2006, and plan to open an equal number in the Northeast by 2020. Every new Tender Greens will rely on what he calls \u201ca whole rebuild of technology,\u201d because the 11-year-old system it uses is about as up-to-date as a beeper.\u201cIt gives us ways to recognize people who\u2019ve been in regularly, or haven\u2019t been in for a while or have specific preferences,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said.A regular diner who always orders the ni\u00e7oise salad will get a message on the app about the halibut special. A diner who always orders vegetarian options will not get the message about the summer hog roast. \u201cWe want to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201csometimes before they even mention them.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t know that someone\u2019s going to become a regular, so you don\u2019t necessarily keep track of those people,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cBut the system does.\u201d It also tracks the top 100\u2019s dining companions when they split the check. Upserve sends a list of credit card numbers, dates of visits and items bought; the restaurant matches each number to a name, and a search on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn provides a face to go with it.\u201cWe\u2019re sure to recognize them\u201d the next time they come in, so the staff can welcome them back by name, Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn\u2019t make the reservation themselves.\u201dEven the type of credit card contributes to the dossier. If a customer pays with an airline card, a server might mention travel. If a customer is a sports fan, he will most likely get a server who is as well.Customers who find the mining of personal data invasive can opt out, up to a point, but it requires effort: To avoid detection, they have to pay cash and not make reservations. Those who participate actively in the process get more information in return.In June 2015, the online reservation service OpenTable, which represents 43,000 restaurants worldwide, started to provide customized recommendations, just as Netflix and Amazon suggest programs or products based on a customer\u2019s history.If users sign up for the company\u2019s app and allow OpenTable access to their GPS, they receive recommendations for restaurants in the United States and several foreign countries, said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing.And if data can help a customer find a restaurant, it can also help a restaurant find its customers. To pinpoint potential locations in the Northeast that best reach what Mr. Oberholtzer calls Tender Greens\u2019s \u201cpsychographic\u201d \u2014 the college-educated diner who cares about health and locally produced food \u2014 he starts with data from a customer analytics firm that specializes in site selection.He refines that list with Google searches like \u201cplant-forward lifestyle,\u201d he said, and looks at where delivery systems like Uber and DoorDash do a lot of business.\u201cYou overlay and look for redundancy,\u201d he said, \u201cand that begins to tell the story of where you want to be.\u201dThe scorecard ranks servers on multiple criteria, which makes it easier for Ms. Williamson to identify the right waiter, for example, for a large party with children. She might not pick the server who sells the most. The more appropriate match could be a server who ranks higher in tip percentage than in sales, thanks to grateful families who tend to order less alcohol.Start-ups aspire to create even more streamlined software, but it isn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe\u2019re making a moon shot here,\u201d said Mr. Chowdhury of Salido, which originally set an August deadline for \u201ca fully operational stack\u201d of features but is only about three-quarters of the way there. The company has extended its deadline to early 2018, as development work continues with 64 existing clients.Still, some early adopters approach the new systems warily. Mr. Guidara, who also uses Avero at Eleven Madison Park, thinks technology is great for a fast-casual operation that emphasizes volume and delivery, and for the business side at a fine-dining operation. It has no place, he said, when it comes to service at Eleven Madison Park or the NoMad, where he and Mr. Humm rely on traditional methods of high-end hospitality: expertise, eye contact and a hair-trigger response to a diner\u2019s every need.\u201cWhen I worked as a controller, in accounting capacities, we used it quite often,\u201d Mr. Guidara said. \u201cBut from an experiential, guest-facing point of view, we don\u2019t use it. That\u2019s never been how we approach things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pushed constantly about these new systems,\u201d Mr. Kinch said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s all about the guest? I think that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I place a tremendous value on direct eye contact and a genuine smile.\u201dAt Oriole, the Sandovals have left sake on the menu despite data showing that it doesn\u2019t sell well. \u201cWe go by our gut,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt pairs well with a lot of the courses, it\u2019s very versatile, and it speaks to how we\u2019re willing not to go the traditional route.\u201dThe sheer glut of new restaurant data systems can be overwhelming, even to those who embrace them.\u201cAt least once a week, I get something about a new start-up with a new gadget that\u2019s going to make our lives so much better,\u201d said Sisha Ortuzar, Mr. Colicchio\u2019s partner at \u2018Wichcraft. \u201cThey\u2019re distractions. We just want to get back to making sandwiches.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power Plants That May Save a Park, and Aid a Country", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIRUNGA NATIONAL PARK, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 On the verdant savanna of Virunga National Park, a herd of elephants clustered near an umbrella-shaped acacia tree to seek shelter from the blazing morning sun. From a Cessna far above, the giant animals looked like brown-gray miniatures.Emmanuel de Merode, the director of Virunga National Park, piloted the plane. He wore a Virunga park ranger uniform and had his green beret tucked into the shoulder of his khaki shirt. Mr. de Merode flew over the dazzling 50-mile-long Lake Edward, then descended to a grassy airfield flanked by palm trees.On this day, the flight was his commute. \u201cIt\u2019s the best job in the world,\u201d he said.Mr. de Merode was visiting a small hydroelectric power plant \u2014 built more than four years ago with an investment from the European Union \u2014 that has lofty goals. It powers a soap factory, providing jobs and a market for local palm oil. It supplies electricity to homes, reducing the need to illegally chop down Virunga\u2019s trees to make charcoal. Ideally, it will spark entrepreneurship among carpenters, tailors and others whose businesses struggle to exist without electricity.In short, the tiny power plant is crucial to an ambitious attempt not only to protect Virunga \u2014 Africa\u2019s oldest national park \u2014 from threats including armed rebels, deforestation and oil prospectors, but to jump-start the local economy and potentially help stabilize one of the world\u2019s worst conflict zones.Mr. de Merode, who is a Belgian national (and a Belgian prince), became the director of Virunga in 2008, the first non-Congolese to hold such a position. He was born in Africa and has spent most of his life here.Work conditions are treacherous. In 2014, he was ambushed near Virunga and shot in the stomach and legs. The attackers were never found, and their motive was unclear, although many groups oppose Mr. de Merode\u2019s conservation efforts, which disrupt the status quo.The assassination attempt didn\u2019t deter him. \u201cPeople who wear a uniform get injured all the time,\u201d Mr. de Merode said. \u201cThis is part of my job. I would regret it terribly if I gave up.\u201dBut the region is under intense pressure from a growing human population, and Virunga could provide land, food and fuel that those people desperately need. That puts its mission to preserve habitat for gorillas and other creatures, however noble, on a collision course with practicality.However, deforestation is one of Virunga\u2019s biggest threats. For cooking fuel, 97 percent of people living near the park rely on charcoal made by chopping down the park\u2019s trees and slowly roasting them into carbonized chunks.The practice is illegal. Yet Congo\u2019s charcoal industry is worth an estimated $35 million and helps fund deadly insurgents who hide in Virunga\u2019s forests, according to the Enough Project, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on Africa. In theory, hydropower could reduce reliance on charcoal cooking fuel, although this is easier said than done.Virunga plays an important role in offsetting carbon emissions. The park and plantations in the province are second only to the Amazon in terms of total forest area, according to the W.W.F.After the country gained independence from colonial Belgian rule in 1960, corruption, political instability and bloody conflict wracked the country, which is one of the poorest in the world. It was ranked 176 out of 187 countries on the United Nations\u2019 Human Development Index in 2015.Roads, electricity and running water are scant. Without this basic infrastructure, economic growth is severely stunted. Electricity is necessary to run grain and lumber mills, to process palm oil or fruit juice, to operate cement plants and brick factories \u2014 to build pretty much anything modern.In the past, hydroelectric power plants funded by Catholic charities or other nonprofits weren\u2019t properly maintained. And there were some scams in which businesspeople collected money from villagers, then ran off with the funds.But eastern Congo has enormous agricultural potential. The country has one of the world\u2019s largest areas of arable land. It \u201chas the potential to become the breadbasket of the entire African continent,\u201d according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.However, farmers have a hard time eking out a living because they lack modern agricultural resources such as quality seeds and fertilizer, not to mention roads, cold storage and other infrastructure to get goods to market. And agribusinesses cannot run without electricity.The country is so ill-equipped to deal with its farming potential that most of its agricultural goods are processed outside the country. All its cooking oil, for instance, is imported. And palm oil from Congolese farmers is exported to neighboring Uganda, turned into soap, and then imported back to Congo at higher prices.Tourism is another way Congo could create jobs and boost its economy. Mountain gorillas reside in only three countries: Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 and tourists pay good money to see them. To see Virunga\u2019s gorillas, park permits and transportation alone cost about $600.But violence has limited the potential here. During a burst of war in Congo between 2004 and 2009, insurgents invaded and occupied Virunga.Tensions eased, and tourism surged in 2010 and 2011, when Virunga\u2019s new luxury lodge opened. That year, Virunga hosted 5,000 tourists and earned more than $1 million. But then, in November 2012, the rebel group M23 took over Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, where the lucrative gorilla and volcano tourism is based. For more than a year, Virunga was closed to visitors.The park reopened in January 2014 amid fragile stability. An alphabet soup of a dozen rebel groups and militias still plague Virunga, which they use as a hide-out along the country\u2019s porous, unpatrolled borders with Rwanda and Uganda.Most international governments have issued travel warnings for eastern Congo. Tourists must travel to, from and within the park with armed rangers.The five-hour trek is exhausting, but with his earnings, Mr. Boscon bought some goats. A $50 tip from one generous tourist allowed him to buy a small piece of rocky land.Other than farming and tourism, \u201cthere\u2019s no hope of other jobs,\u201d Mr. Boscon said. He wanted an education, but there was no school in his area when he was growing up during Congo\u2019s civil wars.Isaac Sadiki, 24, was the only volcano porter with a university degree. He admitted some might find his work humiliating because he\u2019s a college graduate. But, he explained, \u201cIt helps me earn some money. I cannot be part of militia.\u201d Like most rural people here, he has been a victim of violence. Mr. Sadiki was 8 years old when rebels attacked his family at their home near the Ugandan border and brutally beat his mother.Mr. de Merode argues that jobs would prevent idle, poor young men from joining militias. Economic development is \u201cthe only way of overcoming conflict,\u201d he said.However, that is an idealistic vision that doesn\u2019t always work.And of course, there are the day-to-day challenges of running power plants in an unstable, poor and corrupt country. The two existing plants offer lessons in trial and error.Mr. de Merode was flying to Mutwanga, a small town outside Virunga\u2019s northern border. There, a modest concrete building houses one German-made turbine spun by the coursing waters of the Butau River.Outside, where the distant white glaciers of the Rwenzori Mountains loomed in ghostly silhouette, Mr. de Merode strode along a narrow channel that diverts water into the powerhouse. This $2 million pilot plant is a run-of-the-river design, which means it does not use dams and minimizes the impact on the environment.A couple miles away, at the other end of town, is Sicovir, a soap factory that opened in April 2016. It is the first and only factory in the area \u2014 and the only source of formal employment here.Leonard Maliona is Sicovir\u2019s managing director, and his family has invested in the factory. A young Congolese man in his early 30s, Mr. Maliona walked across the floor of the gleaming facility and pointed out boilers and pressing machines that squeeze oil from palm kernels. The waxy smell of soap permeated the air. Sicovir has the potential to produce tons of soap in one day. A hundred people work here.For all its promise, though, Sicovir is hampered by a lack of electricity. The water levels of the Butau River have been lower than projected, in part because of unexpectedly lower rainfall. So the power plant generates less than one-quarter of its promised 380-kilowatt capacity. It\u2019s enough to give electricity to more than 500 households in town (more than 2,500 people), the local hospital, streetlights and 40 small businesses, such as hair salons and phone-charging kiosks. The power it generates is a boon to an area where the hospital once used flashlights.But it is not enough to run Sicovir\u2019s heavy machinery \u2014 boilers, steamers, presses. As a result, the factory relies on diesel generators.Selling Sicovir\u2019s soap is also a challenge. Bad roads make it difficult to collect palm oil from local farmers. Businesspeople are targets for extortion and robbery. Running the factory is \u201cvery stressful,\u201d Mr. Maliona said.He believes that more and stronger businesses could harness political power to get things done. \u201cIf more businesses are created, we can create a lobby group,\u201d Mr. Maliona said. \u201cIf you have 20 companies paying taxes, we can say, \u2018We want the road done.\u2019\u201dMr. Maliona sobered as he described that unproven theory. But when asked why he started the factory, he brightened: \u201cThe joy of producing. When you see the first soap come out, you think, \u2018Now we can do it.\u2019\u201dHundreds of miles away in a town called Matebe, outside Virunga\u2019s southeast corner, sits the park\u2019s second run-of-the-river plant, which began operating in December 2015. It can generate more than 13 megawatts of electricity from the much larger Rutshuru River. The hilly landscape means a taller vertical drop and more energy when the river water is funneled through three turbines.One morning, Matebe\u2019s power plant bustled with activity. Hammers pounded and saws shrieked. The plant employs more than 600 people.Engineers built the plant with about $20 million from Howard Buffett. Mr. Buffett, who has long been interested in wildlife conservation, approached Virunga out of the blue. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know who he was,\u201d Mr. de Merode said.Mr. Buffett first came to the region in the mid-1990s to see mountain gorillas in Uganda. Wildlife brought him here, \u201cbut the everyday challenges the people faced \u2014 and the conflict \u2014 captured my attention,\u201d he wrote in an email. Also, he added, \u201cI like to work in the places that everyone else thinks are too risky.\u201dJobs are precious in this area, where there are few schools. \u201cEvery day people are queued up outside for work,\u201d said Sandrine Eeman, the engineer in charge of networks for Virunga Energy, the park\u2019s private utility division. Human resources were a challenge, but engineers and technicians were hired from different parts of Congo, and locals were trained and hired for jobs requiring less expertise.Jackson Bakinahe Ndemeye, 25, started as a casual-wage construction worker in 2014 and worked his way up. Today he helps maintain the valves that control water flow from the river.Ndemeye has a 12th-grade education, far higher than most people in the area. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many job opportunities,\u201d he said. Since he started working at the power plant, he has learned to handle machinery and pour concrete. And with his steady income, Mr. Ndemeye helps send his younger siblings to school. He added, \u201cNow I can buy pants if I want.\u201dAlthough this power plant was built under budget and ahead of schedule in less than two years, it has its share of challenges. Transmission and distribution lines are still being built, so only 2.5 megawatts of Matebe\u2019s 13-megawatt capacity are being used. Its electricity primarily powers the plant\u2019s offices and facilities, Virunga\u2019s tourist lodge and grounds, as well as rural streetlights and homes in some nearby villages.That\u2019s due partly to funding. Virunga needed money to build 20 miles of power lines to the city of Goma. A year ago, CDC, the private sector arm of Britain\u2019s Department for International Development, pledged $2.5 million for that next phase.Transmission and distribution, and getting customers to pay, are some of the biggest challenges for energy companies in developing countries. So far, some 3,000 households have paid to connect to Matebe\u2019s power plant, which will deliver electric service for more than 15,000 people. At least thirteen villages have streetlights, and more were scheduled for connection this spring. Virunga aims to eventually connect 4,000 households to hydroelectricity.It costs a relatively hefty $292 to connect to the electrical supply and then $5 to $10 each month for 3 to 10 amps of electricity \u2014 enough to power a few light bulbs and charge mobile phones. It\u2019s pricey for a rural family, but in the long run, the electricity is cheaper than conventional fuel.\u201cPeople are poor, but energy is not as expensive as you imagine,\u201d said Ephrem Balole, the chief executive of Virunga Energy. For cooking, the average low-income rural household each month uses two sacks of charcoal, which cost $15 each. Families spend at least $5 each month for kerosene used for lighting.Michael Karonkario, 39, lives in a small house in the village of Ruchiro, where he is a caretaker of the area\u2019s mobile-phone antenna. He was one of the first in the village to connect to the new electrical service. His six children can now study at night, he said.There are some concerns that people are too accustomed to cooking with charcoal and will be reluctant to switch to electricity. So Virunga plans to give free electric hot plates to people who connect to the supply. Mr. Karonkario, for one, didn\u2019t want to wait, so he got his own hot plate. It \u201cheats up faster than charcoal and doesn\u2019t make the kitchen as hot,\u201d he said.Giving rural people access to electricity is part of Virunga\u2019s mission, but only a small part of its business plan. The medium and large businesses are crucial to making Matebe\u2019s hydropower financially sustainable.\u201cBuilding the plant is the easy part,\u201d said Ms. Eeman, the Belgian engineer who helped oversee Matebe\u2019s construction. \u201cEntrepreneurship is the bigger challenge.\u201dVirunga Energy has received about 100 applications from local businesses who want electricity to run corn, cassava and sugar mills, juice and confectionary factories, garages and welding services, beauty salons, bakeries, carpentry workshops, brick works and more, said Mr. Balole of Virunga Energy.Some applications are from existing small businesses that want to expand, while others are just starting. Entrepreneurship is a fledgling concept in this conflict zone, which is accustomed to receiving aid money, but Mr. Balole isn\u2019t worried about that. \u201cBusinessmen are skilled,\u201d he said. Some nuns have already started a sugar cane plant, he pointed out.Harnessing mass demand in the city of Goma is a bigger task. Its people now use just 5 megawatts of electricity \u2014 not enough for this city of one million. Power outages are common.Goma needs 40 to 50 megawatts, Mr. Balole reckoned. But the city\u2019s electricity is controlled by the government utility company, and Virunga Energy could not get a distribution agreement for the city.To get around that hurdle, Virunga Energy organized a consortium of large businesses in Goma to prepurchase $2 million of electricity. They include cement, coffee and mattress factories, cold-storage facilities, hotels and others. These businesses want a steadier, more reliable supply than the shaky government one, whose irregular currents destroy machinery and equipment, Mr. Balole said.That money is helping to build power lines to Goma along an inhospitable dirt road, which is rutted with volcanic rock. Virunga Energy received another boost for that project with CDC\u2019s investment last year. The 10-year loan is the province\u2019s only development investment since the mid-1980s.If the rollout goes well, CDC will loan another $6.5 million for construction of two new run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants just outside the park that would generate 35 megawatts. For these plants, Howard Buffett is funding approximately $39 million and the Belgian government $4 million.Mr. Buffett increased his funding after other donors fell through. When that happened \u201cit basically underscored the point that it was going to be either us or no one,\u201d said Mr. Buffett. \u201cI believe that is the role of philanthropy \u2014 if philanthropists can\u2019t be the risk takers, who can?\u201dVirunga\u2019s unusual management team was also a positive factor. \u201cA company that\u2019s running a national park founded an electricity company \u2014 it\u2019s incredible. Hats off to them,\u201d said Martin Illner, an investment director at CDC.There is a delicate balance between pulling in big customers who make the hydroelectric power plants financially sustainable and connecting rural households whose demand for electricity and ability to pay is often overestimated. \u201cWe want the households to benefit, but power companies typically make a loss connecting them,\u201d said Richard Charlton, an investment manager at CDC. \u201cHow you get that mix is really important.\u201dThen there are the daily challenges of running a business in Congo: dealing with government officials who demand bribes, getting bureaucratic land concessions and licenses, working with everyone from local chiefs and villagers to investors and donors.\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how heavy it can be,\u201d said Mr. Balole about the stresses of his job. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how government structures can kill initiatives with a lot of taxes, unclear procedures and harassment. Someone who\u2019s not strong can flee away. This is not an enabling environment.\u201dAs Mr. de Merode piloted the Cessna south to return to the park\u2019s headquarters, he recounted some of the lessons he learned as a park director who unwittingly spearheaded energy and business development. \u201cIf you spread yourself thin, you do it quite badly,\u201d he said. Before the current business plan, Virunga also built health centers and schools. It now leaves that work to the European Union, nonprofits and other groups.Yet despite challenges like these, Mr. de Merode remains understated. \u201cWe learned from trial and error,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. We\u2019re just building a utility company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Chooses Expedia\u2019s Chief as C.E.O., Ending Contentious Search", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber chose Dara Khosrowshahi, who leads the online travel company Expedia, to be its chief executive on Sunday, two people with knowledge of the decision said. The selection capped a contentious search process as the ride-hailing company seeks to move past a turbulent period.Mr. Khosrowshahi emerged as the leading candidate from a field of three finalists over a weekend of Uber board meetings, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential.The board of directors and executives inside of Uber had instead been leaning toward Meg Whitman, the chief of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the people said. But matters changed quickly over the course of Sunday afternoon, as directors and Ms. Whitman could not agree on terms in which she would take over as chief executive, the people said. Ultimately, the board decided on the third candidate, Mr. Khosrowshahi.Uber, the company\u2019s board and Expedia did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Khosrowshahi, who has been president and chief executive of Expedia since 2005, has experience in a digital industry that, like Uber, affects offline life and the logistics and movement of people. Based in Bellevue, Wash., Expedia has travel brands including Hotels.com and Orbitz. The publicly traded company is smaller than the privately held Uber, with a market capitalization of around $23 billion compared with Uber\u2019s private valuation of nearly $70 billion.Mr. Khosrowshahi also joined the board of The New York Times Company in 2015, and previously worked at IAC/InterActive Corp.At Expedia, Mr. Khosrowshahi has been an outspoken chief executive. His family emigrated to the United States from Iran because of the revolution in that country in the late 1970s, so Mr. Khosrowshahi had a personal perspective on the executive order that President Trump signed restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries this year.Expedia, along with Amazon, became one of two technology companies to contribute early declarations to a lawsuit filed by Washington State\u2019s attorney general objecting to the travel ban. Mr. Khosrowshahi described his early experience as an immigrant to the United States in an email to employees at that time.\u201cWe sure didn\u2019t feel like refugees, but in hindsight I guess we were \u2014 my father and mother left everything behind to come here \u2014 to be safe and give their boys a chance to re-build a life,\u201d he wrote.He expressed other pointed concerns in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s coming to office. In February, he raised eyebrows when he concluded a conference call with Wall Street analysts by saying, \u201cHopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Kalanick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Benchmark declined to comment.But in reality, Ms. Whitman was in touch with members of Uber\u2019s board in recent days about the chief executive role, said the people with knowledge of the process. Mr. Immelt, who recently left his job as chief executive of G.E., also had emerged as a candidate in recent weeks. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s candidacy was kept under wraps.As recently as late last week, Uber\u2019s board was deadlocked on candidates, the people said. On Friday, the board met in San Francisco, with Mr. Immelt and Mr. Khosrowshahi talking to the directors. Ms. Whitman spoke with directors on Friday and Saturday.G.E. declined to comment on behalf of Mr. Immelt. A spokesman for Ms. Whitman also declined to comment.At that point, the board was leaning toward Ms. Whitman, said two people with knowledge of the process. Ms. Whitman, who had previously also led eBay, had a wealth of management experience. As a female leader, she also offered the opportunity for Uber to improve its workplace image.Ms. Whitman asked Uber\u2019s board about some issues, including what role Mr. Kalanick would play in Uber\u2019s future, the people said. Another point of discussion was the current legal battle over board control between Mr. Kalanick and Benchmark.By late Sunday, Ms. Whitman and the board could not agree on some of those matters, the people said. Soon, Uber\u2019s board had settled on Mr. Khosrowshahi.Nick Wingfield and Steve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Culture Wars Have Come to Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe culture wars that have consumed politics in the United States have now landed on Silicon Valley\u2019s doorstep.Silicon Valley\u2019s politics have long skewed left, with a free-market\u2019s philosophy and a dash of libertarianism. But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore\u2019s firing has now plunged the nation\u2019s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country.Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Mr. Damore\u2019s comments carried additional weight to people on either side of the political spectrum because he was an engineer at Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.Alongside other giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Apple, these companies \u201care seen as pillars of our society,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cControversy and statements that emanate from these employees take on a different heft.\u201dThe technology industry has long marched in lock step on issues such as supporting immigration and diversity, even though their companies remained largely male, white and Asian. But last year\u2019s election of Mr. Trump \u2014 with his broadsides against political correctness, his coarse language toward women and his actions to restrict immigration and deny climate change \u2014 seemed to threaten many of those ideals.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s words may have made dissenters in the tech industry more comfortable about speaking out.\u201cTrump, in a sense, licensed people to express what some people would call politically incorrect thoughts,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Business School. \u201cThen there\u2019s the other force that a lot of Trump\u2019s policies go against the inclusive ideals these companies espouse.\u201dMr. Damore\u2019s memo and dismissal transformed him into a hero on right-wing news sites like Breitbart, which has long criticized the political leanings of the tech industry.\u201cGoogle drives a big sector of tech into the arms of Trump: fires employee who wrote memo about women in tech jobs,\u201d Dr. Pinker wrote.One of the most outspoken supporters of Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley has been Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who has since faced derision from other people working in tech for his political stance. In a sign of how deep that ill feeling runs, Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings warned Mr. Thiel last August, a few weeks after Mr. Trump had accepted the Republican nomination for president, that he would face consequences for backing Mr. Trump.\u201cI see our board being about great judgment, particularly in unlikely disaster where we have to pick new leaders,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote in the email to Mr. Thiel, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \"I\u2019m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from \u2018different judgment\u2019 to \u2018bad judgment.\u2019 Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Hastings declined to comment through their spokesmen; neither challenged the authenticity of the email. Both of the men remain on Facebook\u2019s board.Mr. Luckey, through mutual agreement with his employer, stayed away from the Oculus offices to let the controversy die down, according to three people with knowledge of the episode who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. In December, before returning briefly to the office, he told colleagues he was committed to staying at the company, according to a copy of a message he posted on an internal discussion board, which was reviewed by The Times.But by the end of March, Oculus said he was no longer working there.A Facebook spokeswoman reiterated an earlier company statement saying that Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure was unrelated to his political views. Mr. Luckey declined to comment on his departure from Facebook.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Cohn and Mnuchin Tackle Taxes", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has largely left management of his administration\u2019s tax overhaul to the former Goldman Sachs executives Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin. That is making some conservatives nervous.There is also the question of whether their experience in finance is enough to succeed in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\u2022 Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that he has Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and is speaking for him. He is also more careful and more reserved than Mr. Cohn \u2014 and more deferential to lawmakers.The advisers have tried to avoid the mistakes that plagued the effort to repeal and replace the health care law, placing a premium on communicating with key members of Congress.Still, they have yet to produce the kind of comprehensive plan Mr. Trump has promised. And some worry that the men have made little progress.That might seem surprising as Houston is the fourth-largest American city and the center of a metropolitan area with economic output of half a trillion dollars a year. And indeed, the area does face years of rebuilding.And, while it is a macabre form of accounting, the need to repair buildings could create a surge in output.Still, the storm continues to wallop the Gulf Coast and it is too early to say that the economy is in the clear. But so far, the human damage is the greatest.Worth noting: Day traders have been pouring into the most arcane corners of markets, betting on whether the VIX, or the so-called fear gauge, will rise or fall.These wagers on expected volatility have traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors. But since the financial crisis, investment banks have offered VIX-linked products for purchase on the stock exchange, much like buying shares in IBM or Microsoft.But are all the investors aware of what they are getting into?\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d said Robert E. Whaley, a financial professor at Vanderbilt University known as the father of the VIX for his work on developing it. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was. And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201d\u2022 His past at Expedia does shed some light on his temperament.

{"Headline": "Business Trip or Vacation? Travel Start-Ups Try to Blur the Line", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesPlanning a vacation? Chances are you\u2019ll think about it differently than you do that business trip you\u2019re also arranging.For the vacation, you may scroll through hotel reviews before deciding where to stay, not just to compare prices but also to consider the amenities offered.For the business trip, on the other hand, you may be inclined to book a hotel that offers rewards for frequent guests instead of the one with the lowest nightly rate. It is company money you\u2019re spending, after all.Leisure travelers are naturally more selective and cost conscious than business travelers. But a new breed of start-ups that caters to corporate travelers and focuses on user behavior may be making those distinctions obsolete.\u201cI came up with the concept in 2012, but it wasn\u2019t really my idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stumbled onto Google\u2019s approach,\u201d which has been in place at least a decade. The Google method includes drawing up a budget for airfare and hotels before every trip. If employees come in under budget, they earn credits that can be redeemed for travel upgrades in the future. The approach is different from \u201cgamified\u201d booking tools that encourage certain behavior, like using a preferred carrier, but generally do not let employees share in the savings.Mr. Ruch calls the system \u201cincentivized behavioral change,\u201d and he said it was either the most radical concept in corporate travel, or the most obvious.\u201cThere\u2019s such an enormous amount of inefficiency in business travel,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your company\u2019s policy allows business class on flights over six hours, it is not expected behavior to fly coach. If your policy allows five-star hotels, it is not expected behavior to stay at a three-star hotel or to stay with a friend.\u201dPeople are naturally drawn to comfort, Mr. Ruch said, meaning that unless they know they will be rewarded for cutting corners, they will indulge their inclination to make business travel as cushy, and as expensive, as possible.\u201cThere was really no incentive to save,\u201d he said. Once Rocketrip and its \u201cBudget to Beat\u201d formulas were adopted, Mr. Mintman said, AAF employees started to save the company 15 to 20 percent, or roughly $133, per trip. Travelers see how much they can earn for each cost-saving option \u2014 staying with a friend instead of staying at a hotel, for example \u2014 through Rocketrip\u2019s online booking tool.Rocketrip, like other start-ups applying a carrot-and-stick approach to travel, also gives reports to company managers about how much was saved and which action \u2014 settling, say, for a cheaper hotel or a coach seat \u2014 caused the savings on each trip, Mr. Ruch said. If an employee goes over the \u201cbudget to beat\u201d figure, management sees that, too.Mr. Mintman said that working with Rocketrip had helped AAF determine what was reasonable for a travel budget. \u201cNow, we can go back to someone\u2019s proposed spending on a trip and see how well it lines up with what Rocketrip has come up with,\u201d he said.TripActions, which gives users who save their companies money \u201cTripBucks\u201d redeemable for gift cards, upgrades and vacations, claims it can cut travel costs as much as 30 percent per trip. (Mr. Ruch said the average Rocketrip user saves the company 24 percent.)The TripActions app lets users specify airplane seat preferences, loyalty club memberships and other personal details before booking. It also allows for last-minute itinerary changes and features a chat line, should complications arise.\u201cI\u2019m leaving for a trip on Monday, so I know I\u2019ll get a call from them on Sunday afternoon letting me know my flights are still on schedule,\u201d he said. He also likes the TripBucks, which accrue the more you travel and the more you save. Mr. Rowley said he had earned $1,700 in rewards and had saved Jive $7,500 since the company started using TripActions at the end of last year. He cashes in his TripBucks for Amazon gift cards.\u201cMy daughter is getting married, so I\u2019m using TripBucks to buy things for her wedding,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve learned from using TripActions that travel really is a behavioral thing. I used to wait until the last minute if I needed to go somewhere. Like, I\u2019d book my tickets late so I could get into a certain hotel. But now I book months in advance because I\u2019m looking to save some money and earn some rewards.\u201dUpside, a third venture developed with the goal of getting business travelers to think like consumers, bypasses travel managers and works directly with employees.Kurt Hosna, global communications director at a Boston human resources management company, said he had used Upside since it started. So far, he has redeemed roughly $1,000 in rewards, much of it for gear for his cycling hobby.Before he and his colleagues started using Upside, Mr. Hosna said, they tried to be good sports about not overspending on travel. His company\u2019s pat-on-the-back approach to acknowledging their conscientiousness was nice, he said. But Upside\u2019s gift cards have been nicer. \u201cGiving people real rewards just makes sense,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heart and Asthma Monitors? There\u2019s an App for That", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 He could have been surfing in Cabo. Instead, Tyler Crouch, then a 21-year-old mechanical-engineering student, spent spring break of 2013 building a digitized stethoscope and thinking, \u201cThis better be worth it.\u201dNow they have built something with a potentially larger market: It is the Duo, a digital stethoscope for home use, which could change how heart patients are monitored, the entrepreneurs say. It is scheduled to become available by prescription in the fall.The product, which fits in your hand, combines electrocardiogram, or E.K.G., readings and heart sounds into a device that allows patients to monitor their health at home and send data to their physicians.But from the start, physicians have guided them. The Eko team relies on cardiologists at the Mayo Clinic, Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine.The Duo gives at-home heart patients \u201ca cardiology-level exam\u201d said Dr. Ami B. Bhatt, director of outpatient cardiology at MGH and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University.Dr. Bhatt, who is a scientific adviser to Eko and will be compensated with a small stock option for her work, said that tracking patients, wherever they live, will allow cardiologists to intervene \u201cbefore a crisis.\u201dOther doctors say that it is too soon to tell how helpful telemedicine devices \u2014 which include home monitoring devices for diabetes, asthma and sleep disorders \u2014 will be, given the many obstacles. For one, patients can\u2019t always be relied on to use them consistently or correctly.\u201cMedicine is experiencing a potentially tectonic shift,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, professor and chief of cardiology at the U.C. San Francisco School of Medicine, who conducts research into mobile and digital health. \u201cThere is a huge amount of venture investment in these kinds of things. People are betting this is going to happen \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201dTelemedicine is a $9.2 billion business, said Bruce Carlson, publisher of Kalorama Information, a health care market-research firm in New York. The field is growing at 8 percent annually, nearly three times as fast as other medical devices.The Duo enters a competitive field. The more established Kardia Mobile, which is the size of a stick of gum and attaches to the back of a smartphone, takes an E.K.G. reading in 30 seconds. It sells on Amazon for $99. This spring, AliveCor, the maker of the device, received over $30 million in funding, including an undisclosed amount from the Mayo Clinic, which is collaborating with the company on development of its devices.The competition does not deter Eko\u2019s founders.Mr. Bellet said the Duo could become \u201cShazam for the heartbeat,\u201d referring to the hugely popular song-identification app. \u201cIf you can walk into a Walmart and find out what someone is playing on the radio, why can\u2019t a doctor identify unusual heart sounds?\u201d Mr. Bellet said.\u201cFun fact,\u201d he added: The founders of Shazam are early investors.If Eko\u2019s devices reach even 10 percent of its target market, Mr. Bellet said, \u201cIt turns it into a $1.2 billion company.\u201d But there are plenty of ifs.The $350 Duo (which does not include a $45 monthly charge) is not for Fitbit aficionados. It is a prescription-only device for heart patients.From Eko\u2019s airy Berkeley offices, Mr. Landgraf demonstrated the Duo. \u201cl\u2019ll just slip it under my shirt,\u201d he said, scooping up the one-button device, which resembles a cellphone for preschoolers. He held it to his chest for 15 seconds as he watched the Duo\u2019s iPhone app display a graph of his heart sounds and electrocardiogram, which tests the heart\u2019s electrical activity.\u201cI can also analyze it,\u201d he said, clicking to another screen. \u201cThis is one of the features we\u2019re working on.\u201d That next step, an algorithm, will send data to the cloud, where it will be analyzed for heart abnormalities.The Eko team has discovered that medicine is not like other industries. \u201cIt\u2019s a five-to-10 year cycle to get a product to market, because it\u2019s so highly regulated and a slow-moving industry,\u201d Mr. Bellet said.The Duo and other telemedicine devices address a common medical problem. \u201cThere is a black space,\u201d said Dr. Robert Pearl, a lecturer on health care policy at Stanford University\u2019s medical and business schools and, until recently, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, which represents 10,000 physicians.Many small companies are developing devices for home monitoring, he said, \u201cbut doctors do not want continuous information.\u201d They only want to know when there\u2019s a problem, Dr. Pearl said.Physicians tend to want more time talking to patients and less time scanning screens \u2014 and some of them are tech averse. \u201cSome doctors are still faxing prescriptions,\u201d Mr. Bellet said. Telemedicine data must seamlessly reach patients\u2019 records, which is something he and his partners are working on, he said. And insurance companies must agree to reimbursement, another work-in-progress.Dr. Olgin, the U.C. San Francisco cardiologist, said he believed \u201cvery strongly that it\u2019s not enough to do consumer-grade evaluations of telemedicine devices.\u201d\u201cThey should be held up to the same level as drugs, because there are always unintended consequences,\u201d he said.The market potential for products that address heart failure is great. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 610,000 people die of heart failure in the United States every year, making it the leading cause of death. Half of heart-failure patients who leave a hospital return within six months. They keep tabs on themselves by weighing themselves daily, looking for sudden weight gain that can mean water retention \u2014 a sign the heart is not functioning properly.The Duo received clearance in May from the Food and Drug Administration, and the new device will ship in the fall. Over the next two years, the company will participate in two studies at U.C. San Francisco.\u201cIf you compare Eko to Uber, it looks like we\u2019re moving at a snail\u2019s pace,\u201d Mr. Bellet said. \u201cBut if you look at health care as a whole, we\u2019re actually making quite a splash.\u201dShe said her device, called the Aeris, replaces the commonly used peak flow meter, which she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t show what\u2019s fully going on in children\u2019s lungs.\u201d Her product is undergoing testing at the U.C. San Francisco School of Medicine, where the pediatric pulmonology department is helping with development and funding.Ms. Shetty\u2019s device is a portable spirometer that measures airway obstructions and the severity of inflammation in a child\u2019s lungs and, she said, alerts a parent before a child has an asthma attack.More than 8 percent of children in the United States have asthma, according to the C.D.C. While they are a fourth of all asthma patients in the nation, a study conducted in 2010 found that children make up nearly a third of asthma patients who are hospitalized annually.After testing her device with asthmatic children, Ms. Shetty added a video game to the app, to encourage young patients to use the device effectively while keeping them engaged. \u201cSome 6-year-olds are able to understand better what\u2019s going on with the app than the adults,\u201d she said.In November, the Aeris will become available for research purposes, she said, for $99 plus a $10 monthly subscription for the mobile application. She expects to seek clearance from the Food and Drug Administration later this year.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article mixed up the identification of the founders of Eko Devices.

It\u2019s Google\u2019s world; we just live in it. So it matters how this company works \u2014 who it hires, who it fires and why.When a company is dominant enough, it sets the tone for an entire era. In the fall of 1985, I was working as a vice president in the media mergers and acquisitions group at Merrill Lynch in Los Angeles. I would occasionally have to show up for a meeting at 5 a.m. in the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert. I would do this because Mike Milken, the king of junk bonds at Drexel, would demand it \u2014 once the trading day started at 6:30 a.m., he was unavailable.Executives were terrified that Drexel would start a raid on their companies. Politicians would seek Mr. Milken\u2019s counsel and his money. His \u201cwho\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d attitude was the perfect libertarian credo for the Reagan era of deregulation.

And the rules set by Google are the rules we all abide by.\u201cPortions of the memo violate our code of conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote in a companywide email.It\u2019s impossible to believe that Google or other large tech companies a few years ago would have reacted like this to such a memo. In 2011 when CNN filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the workplace diversity data on big tech companies, Google, among others, asked the Department of Labor for its data to be excluded. The company said that releasing that information would cause \u201ccompetitive harm.\u201d It was not until 2014 that Google began to disclose statistics showing that only 17 percent of its technical work force was female.If women should not even have the vote, why should we worry about gender diversity in the engineering ranks?Today Google is under growing scrutiny, and the cognitive dissonance between the outward-facing \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d stance and the internal misogynistic \u201cbrogrammer\u201d rhetoric was too extreme.Google had to fire the offending engineer, James Damore, but anyone who spends time on the message boards frequented by Valley engineers will know that the \u201cbro\u201d culture that gave us Gamergate \u2014 an online movement that targeted women in the video game industry \u2014 is much more prevalent than Mr. Pichai wants to acknowledge.The company canceled a planned all-hands meeting on Thursday, citing concern about harassment.The effects of the darker side of tech culture reach well beyond the Valley. It starts with an unwillingness to control fake news and pervasive sexism that no doubt contributes to the gender pay gap. But it will soon involve the heart of Google\u2019s business: surveillance capitalism. The trope that \u201cif you are not paying for it, you aren\u2019t the customer \u2014 you\u2019re the product\u201d has been around for a while. But now the European Union has passed the General Data Protection Regulation, which will go into effect next May. This regulation aims to give people more control over their data, so search engines can\u2019t follow them everywhere they roam online. It will be an arrow to the heart of Google\u2019s business.We have an obligation to care about the values of the people who run Google, because we\u2019ve given Google enormous control over our lives and the lives of our children. As the former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris points out, \u201cWithout realizing the implications, a handful of tech leaders at Google and Facebook have built the most pervasive, centralized systems for steering human attention that has ever existed, while enabling skilled actors (addictive apps, bots, foreign governments) to hijack our attention for manipulative ends.\u201dThe future implications of a couple of companies\u2019 having such deep influence on our attention and our behavior are only beginning to be felt. The rise of artificial intelligence combined with Google\u2019s omnipresence in our lives is an issue that is not well understood by politicians or regulators.America is slowly waking up both culturally and politically to the takeover of our economy by a few tech monopolies. We know we are being driven by men like Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos toward a future that will be better for them. We are not sure that it will be better for us.As George Packer, writing in The New Yorker in 2011, put it, \u201cIn Thiel\u2019s techno-utopia, a few thousand Americans might own robot-driven cars and live to 150, while millions of others lose their jobs to computers that are far smarter than they are, then perish at 60.\u201dSomehow the citizens of the world have been left out of this discussion of our future. Because tools like Google and Facebook have become so essential and because we have almost no choice in whether to use them, we need to consider the role they play in our lives.By giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the present, we cede our freedom to choose our future.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fiction From Japan, for the Old World and the New", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistTranslating a novel is a bold act: a willingness, despite all the ways we can misunderstand one another, to string a bridge of words from author to reader and trust that meaning will somehow make it across. Translating a Japanese novel is particularly bold, since the cultural chasm between Japanese author and American reader is unusually deep. But translating a Japanese novel about lexicography \u2014 a story in which language itself is a character \u2014 is boldness of an entirely different order. Miura\u2019s book owes some of its charm to the skill of her translator, the veteran Juliet Winters Carpenter.Like the chefs in the film \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi,\u201d the characters in \u201cThe Great Passage\u201d devote every waking breath to a project as detailed as it is abstract: the production of a new and \u201creally human\u201d dictionary, comprehensive and yet modern, \u201ca ship that crosses the sea of words.\u201d Mitsuya Majime, an endearingly disheveled and stork-thin word nerd, is the editor at the center of this endeavor, his very surname a homophone in Japanese for \u201cseriousness of purpose.\u201d When recruited to the project by the high priests of a publisher\u2019s dictionary department, he wins their trust when he describes the beauty of commuters riding an escalator: a chaotic swarm arranging itself magically into parallel lines \u201cwhisked neatly upward\u201d like the sprawl of words made systematic in the pages of a dictionary.Kawakami\u2019s latest translated work is less a novel than a series of hyper-real pictures at an exhibition, bursts of closely observed detail leaving out much of the why and wherefore that link one to the next. In a suburb of Tokyo, the unpredictable and faintly lecherous Mr. Nakano runs a shop selling secondhand goods, from T-shirts and air-conditioners to vintage Glico plastic toys from the 1930s. Two young people have drifted into his employment: the novel\u2019s narrator, Hitomi, both a free spirit and a self-conscious perseverator, and Takeo, a gruff boy with an artistic bent. Also present is Mr. Nakano\u2019s bohemian sister, Masayo, who looks on benevolently as Hitomi and Takeo circle each other, mutually attracted but struggling to connect.These lives and others intersect at the thrift shop, their pasts mostly unmentioned, their futures unplanned. Incidents occur, as randomly assorted as the merchandise: a freak stabbing, a visit to a yakuza mobster with a suit of samurai armor to sell, the death of an Afghan hound, the appearance of a celadon bowl that may or may not be cursed. Awkward date nights end in anticlimax: \u201cWe had sex, briefly.\u201d Kawakami lavishes attention on quotidian minutiae and exquisitely awkward pauses, ending scenes on maddeningly unresolved but vibrant images. The result is a queasy myopia of uncomfortably intimate moments and blurry context. It feels a lot like daily life in Tokyo, but odder.On the fourth page of this 60-year-old novel \u2014 now available in English \u2014 Abe\u2019s teenage protagonist, an orphan named Kyuzo, breaks bread with four Russian soldiers in a Manchurian city not long after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II. The fare is plain and the situation fraught as Kyuzo waits anxiously for his chance to flee the city of his birth and begin a journey toward a homeland he has never seen. Even in the moment of departure, though, he recognizes the preciousness of the \u201cthick, solid walls\u201d he is leaving behind; for years he will remember the cheese and sausages, the soup boiling on the stove, \u201cas his last meal that was humane and satisfying.\u201dWhat follows is an extended and grisly nightmare of cold, hunger, pain, isolation and fear. Japan\u2019s surrender stranded millions of Japanese citizens abroad in a political wilderness, erasing the colonial past and offering nothing in its place; as Abe puts it, \u201cyesterday and tomorrow were no longer linked together.\u201d As the border between friend and enemy shifts constantly, the beasts of the title are both literal and figurative \u2014 and as Kyuzo descends farther into desperation and terror they are increasingly inside his own mind. Survival is an act of unimaginable improvisation, with rational thought ceding to \u201cfear, phantoms and a beastlike visceral impulse.\u201d In one memorable scene, when Kyuzo confronts a feral dog neither of these starving creatures is sure who is the prey.With its historical setting and named characters, \u201cBeasts Head for Home\u201d diverges from the surreal landscape of Abe\u2019s best-known work, \u201cThe Woman in the Dunes,\u201d but alienation is at the Kafkaesque heart of both novels. Though Kyuzo somehow manages to complete his physical journey, he remains an exile, unable even to define the home he seeks. \u201cPerhaps Japan doesn\u2019t exist anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cWith every step I take, the wasteland walks together with me.\u201d The howling misery of his displacement circa 1947 resonates powerfully with the headlines of 2017: a grim story of the past for our grim present.Janice P.

{"Headline": "In a Thriving City, SoHo\u2019s Soaring Rents Keep Storefronts Empty", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of the recession, as most of the country struggled, SoHo thrived. Between 2010 and 2014, rents for stores in the former industrial district in Lower Manhattan soared by 75 percent, to an annual $860 a square foot, or $4.3 million a year for a 5,000-square-foot storefront, as national chains pushed into the neighborhood, willing to pay seemingly any price to get a piece of the action.Those were the good old days.Now, with the city\u2019s unemployment at near historic lows and the economy humming along, empty storefronts dot SoHo\u2019s streets, with 16 in the six-block stretch of Broadway between Houston and Canal Streets, the area\u2019s retail spine. More stud the Belgian-blocked side streets, dark gaps between boutiques selling high fashion and designer furniture and the occasional remaining art gallery.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing no velocity in leasing,\u201d said C. Bradley Mendelson, vice chairman of Colliers, a real estate brokerage, and a longtime retail broker. \u201cNo one\u2019s taking space.\u201dAcross the country, retailers have been wounded by competition from Amazon and other internet sales sites, prompting caution in opening new stores, be it in the suburbs, in SoHo or on Fifth Avenue. But the problems in New York City, and in particular SoHo, go beyond that, brokers and retail experts say.\u201cRight now, it feels like retail is on pause,\u201d said David LaPierre, a retail specialist and a vice chairman at CBRE, a real estate services company. \u201cRents need to get to a much more realistic level.\u201dSoHo was once home to small factories, wholesalers and workshops. In the 1960s, artists in search of low rents and big spaces moved into the lofts, often illegally. Over time, art galleries, small boutiques and furniture designers followed, giving the neighborhood cultural cachet. Starting in the 1990s, though, more stores moved in, the galleries decamped for Chelsea and other neighborhoods, and the streets filled with tourists from around the world, often laden with shopping bags.But rents escalated far faster than retail sales throughout Manhattan. Between 2010 and 2014, retail sales in Manhattan climbed 31.9 percent, while rents soared by 90 percent, according to CBRE.In SoHo, big commercial real estate firms like Thor Equities, 60 Guilders and Premier Equities bought out longtime small-scale landlords, pushing rents there even higher.The area also became a hub of flagship stores, for which chains pay top dollar to expand their brand identity and don\u2019t mind breaking even, or even losing money. Typical is the five-story, 55,000-square-foot Nike behemoth at Broadway and Spring Street that opened last winter.\u201cEverything became a flagship,\u201d said Mr. Mendelson of Colliers. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have one on Fifth, one in Times Square and one in SoHo. Flagships don\u2019t make money. They\u2019re ad vehicles to promote the retailer.\u201dOnly the biggest brands can afford that kind of promotion. \u201cAt those levels, many retailers simply can\u2019t afford their store,\u201d said Mr. LaPierre of CBRE. \u201cI don\u2019t know any retailer who can survive while paying 50 percent of their revenue in rent.\u201dAfter rents peaked in 2014, vacancies began opening up and rents slipped. By the spring of 2017, the average asking rent for shop space on Broadway had fallen 21 percent, to $678 a square foot per year, according to CBRE.And still, there are plenty of locations to choose from.Some landlords have started finding ways to generate income. Pop-up stores \u2014 which take over a space temporarily, with a predetermined end date \u2014 offer landlords what Beth Rosen, a retail broker at RKF, a national firm, calls a \u201ckind of a band-aid for the space,\u201d bringing in revenue but not foreclosing the possibility of a permanent rental paying the higher asking rate. Ms. Rosen said that SoHo landlords are more willing than ever to permit the short-term stores, \u201cif they can\u2019t get the rents they want, and it\u2019s a way for the tenant to get comfortable.\u201dSome landlords are offering short term leases while they hunt for higher-paying long-term tenants, giving store owners months free for a limited period, or offering money or a discount on the rent to be used toward building a store.Cases like Milady\u2019s, where an older business closes and then the storefront sits fallow for months or even years, can seem puzzling.But building owners who purchased their properties in recent years with the expectation that rents could only continue to rise may be in a bind. To secure financing, they would have to project a certain level of income, and if they accept less than that, they run the risk of being in default, or having their lender require them to put more equity into the building. At some point, Mr. LaPierre said, those owners will lose their buildings or have to find a partner willing to invest money in the property.\u201cWe\u2019d been asking ourselves, when is this bubble going to burst?\u201d said Sean Sweeney, a SoHo resident since the 1980s and a leader of the SoHo Alliance, a group of residents and longtime shop owners who want to preserve their vision of SoHo, with its narrow streets, low-scale buildings, artists\u2019 lofts and independent retailers.The Alliance, along with the Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer, have pushed the city to enforce the special zoning restrictions in SoHo, like the one that limits the size of stores to no more than 10,000 square feet, which would rule out many of the big national chains. Mr. Sweeney bemoaned the fact that Broadway now looks more like an open-air mall than the home to cutting edge designers and boutiques.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing creative about sneaker stores,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said, a crack at the Nike store. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be known as Herald Square South.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the Untuckit store, it is on Prince Street, not Spring Street, and the storefront identified in a photo caption was occupied by an Old Navy, not a New York Sports Club.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Producers of \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Sue AMC Over Share of Profits", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a legal action that will be watched closely in Hollywood, several producers of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d on Monday sued AMC \u2014 the cable network that presents the hit TV series \u2014 seeking a greater share of profits.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that AMC has been holding back a significant amount of money that traditionally would have been handed over to top producers once a show has been as successful and on the air as long as \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d has been.The suit lays the groundwork for what should become a remarkably strained relationship between the show\u2019s principal producers and AMC executives as \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d approaches its eighth-season premiere this year. The suit also involves spinoff series like \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d and \u201cTalking Dead.\u201dThe move also follows a similar lawsuit filed by Frank Darabont, one of the show\u2019s creators, who was fired during the second season of the show. Mr. Darabont is seeking more than $200 million in damages.With flagging ratings and more TV shows than ever, networks in recent years have been building out and buying more shows from sister studios, rather than going to outside studios like Sony or Lionsgate.The suit claims that AMC set up a sweetheart deal with its own studio, AMC Studios, denying producers of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d a greater share of profit participation that has traditionally been showered on producers and actors of successful, long-running series.In a statement, AMC said: \u201cThese kinds of lawsuits are fairly common in entertainment, and they all have one thing in common \u2014 they follow success. Virtually every studio that has had a successful show has been the target of litigation like this, and \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 has been the No. 1 show on television for five years in a row, so this is no surprise.

{"Headline": "Australian Friendliness, Shopping, Faith in Government ... and Angst?", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 21______I\u2019ll also be heading back to the United States soon for a holiday, and when I return, I\u2019ll share some impressions about that experience as well. A lot seems to be changing and not changing since I left.What\u2019s below is, of course, just a selection of what\u2019s front of mind at the moment, so don\u2019t expect comprehensiveness and feel free to disagree with or expand on my impressions. My goal, as always to some degree, is to open up the journalism process.So consider this, perhaps, my rolling answer to the question I hear all the time: So what do you think of Australia?Forever FriendlyThere are lots of countries with friendly reputations, certainly, but what I\u2019ve come to appreciate about Australia is that for most people I meet, the first instinct seems to be \u201chow can I help.\u201dIt\u2019s pretty different from New York City, my last home, where people are locked in their own bubbles of work, or Mexico, my home before that, where people were simply scared when strangers approached. Australia often feels to me (as a white English-speaking male) like a backyard party where it\u2019s assumed that I have a good reason to be sharing the food and drink.Buy, and Buy MoreThink of the neighborhood butchers. And the chemists. And, well, all the small storefront business, and the crowded shopping centers \u2014 this, my friends, is not the way Americans shop.Ordering online and waiting is the reality in cities across the United States, but here in this remarkably wealthy country, brick-and-mortar retail is still king. And it\u2019s all a bit stunning for someone who has had to set up a bureau, and a new home, after years of avoiding the routine of park, choose, wait in line, purchase, carry out, carry home.In the meantime, you can find me in line at Coles, scratching my head, asking the friendly guy next to me what\u2019s taking so long.Government, Good?Australians gasp in horror when they look at American gun culture, but many Australians tell me it\u2019s not just because of the violence. It\u2019s also about government.Americans often discuss government in pure binary terms: It\u2019s good or bad. In Iraq, in Haiti and in many other countries where I\u2019ve worked, government is seen, instead, either as an annoyance or a path to wealth.Politically, this is perhaps the clearest difference between how Washington and Canberra are viewed and judged. As Julia Gillard, the former prime minister, told me when we met recently for coffee:\u201cFaith in government is stronger here than in the U.S. Australians believe government can work and should work, and to the extent it doesn\u2019t that is the fault of politicians, and you get to vote them in and out.\u201dBanter Never EndsIf Australians\u2019 first instinct is friendliness and the second is curiosity, then could the third be humor, insecurity or a mix of the two? I\u2019m thinking of the jokes and sharp comments, which especially when directed at outsiders, often seem aimed at diverting attention from (or reflecting) some underexplored sense of angst.This is an aspect of Australia that I\u2019m still trying to figure out, with help from others. Two recent conversations with \u201cnew Australians\u201d \u2014 the children of immigrants \u2014 come to mind. Both are journalists, both have lived outside the country and returned with their own set of questions about what it is that keeps conversations in Australia from going as deep as they could.One works for a major broadcaster, and he argued that Australia is anti-intellectual. The other, Isabella Kwai, works for us, and she tied it more to the Australian penchant for prioritizing a laugh.\u201cThe banter here is never-ending,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked joking around in conversations, sometimes probably in situations where I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant, but here, people can take a joke very, very far. I wonder if it makes it difficult to have serious, deep conversations about tough things happening in the world.\u201dThis is not universal throughout Australia. I\u2019ve had many deep and probing discussions about uncomfortable subjects like race, gender and violence since I arrived. And other countries have their own issues when it comes to self-examination (Cuba, te veo).But you tell me: Is there not something to this? How would you describe what I\u2019m getting at?And with that, here are my New York Times picks of the week, plus a recommendation._____________________________See you in two weeks.Advertisement"}

And that\u2019s saying a lot. She\u2019s 101.\u201cMy life has always been organizing,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m not afraid to tell people how I feel.\u201dAs a child, she and her father would join rallies in Union Square to support unions. After high school, she worked in a Manhattan sweatshop to better understand the working conditions and help laborers organize protests and go on strike. She volunteered with the Red Cross during World War II, among other social service work.So we asked Ms. Sansone for advice on how young New Yorkers can be more engaged in the city and world around them \u2014 in big and small ways.Civic Engagement\u2022 Figure out what your neighbors\u2019 needs are and then decide how you can best help, Ms. Sansone said. For example, if that need is housing, the focus could be as broad as improving safety at nearby homeless shelters, or as specific as finding lodging and resources for a local family whose home has burned down, which Ms. Sansone did recently.\u201cGo to the church and ask, \u2018Do you think people in this community need help, and what kind of help do they need?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cGo into the schools and ask the principal, \u2018Do you have kids that need help, and how can we help them?\u2019\u201d\u2022 Become familiar with your local community board, she advised. The meetings are open to the public and they are an effective place to offer and find help, she said.Political EngagementThose who are politically engaged (which is not entirely separate from being civically involved) hold those in power accountable, especially in today\u2019s divisive political climate.\u201cPoliticians will talk about, \u2018I\u2019m going to do this or I\u2019m going to do that,\u2019 but it\u2019s up to you to see if they\u2019re going to do it or not,\u201d Ms. Sansone said.\u2022 Attend a city meeting, like one of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s town hall events.\u2022 Contact your state senator or a City Council member with questions or to voice your concerns about an issue. \u201cTell them that you need help or ask them where to go to get help,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep calling until you get results. If that doesn\u2019t work, send a letter of complaint.\u201d\u2022 Use Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms as tools to start conversations, organize and \u201cthen publicize so others can come with you,\u201d she said.Most importantly, get involved, whether the issue \u201chits home or not,\u201d Ms. Sansone said, because if we \u201cdon\u2019t get involved, then it starts all over again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been in demonstrations where people came with Seeing Eye dogs and walkers,\u201d she added. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see, they couldn\u2019t walk, but they came.\u201dThink of them \u2014 or Ms. Sansone \u2014 as inspiration.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re looking at a cloudy commute, with a chance of showers, particularly in the evening.But as long as Mother Nature gets it out of her system before the long holiday weekend, we\u2019re O.K. with it.But what else can we do to help?

They were not particularly welcomed in America, and were broke.\u201cEvery one of us cousins had a chip on our shoulders, having lost everything to the new Iranian government,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, a cousin of Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s. \u201cWe had a desire to build anew as entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi, 48, is on the threshold of becoming one of the world\u2019s most prominent entrepreneurs. On Sunday night, he was selected to be chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing company that is the world\u2019s most valuable start-up. The deal is almost official, according to the travel reservations site Expedia, which Mr. Khosrowshahi currently runs.His task will be to repair the internal culture, which had moved beyond gung-ho start-up to a company known for its divisiveness and tolerance for harassment. He will have to build Uber\u2019s business while preparing it for a self-driving future that competitors hope to dominate themselves. Sooner or later he will likely take Uber public.There is also the wild card of Mr. Kalanick, who might seize on any trouble to mount a comeback. And finally, he will have to manage all this under a much brighter spotlight than he has worked under before.Mr. Khosrowshahi was a long-shot candidate whose name did not become public until he had the job. Expedia is based in Bellevue, Wash., which makes him a Silicon Valley outsider. He had not commented on his new job as of Monday afternoon.His parents, Lili and Gary (short for Asghar) Khosrowshahi, were prosperous members of the Iranian elite in the 1960s and 1970s. Gary was an executive at an industrial conglomerate, where he worked with relatives. They fled as the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed.Four years later, Gary went back to Iran to take care of his ailing father, and he was detained for six years before he could return. Lili raised three children alone.\u201cHis mom raised him to be direct with people,\u201d said Mr. Partovi, the cousin. \u201cBy far the biggest challenge he faced, which is what all of us faced, was having to come to a new country and assimilate. Being an Iranian in America in the 1980s was not pleasant. People were singing \u2018Bomb bomb bomb Iran.\u2019 \u201dBut the tense environment also pushed them to succeed.Mr. Partovi and his twin brother Ali were early investors in Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb and, as it happens, Uber; Dara\u2019s brother, Kaveh Khosrowshahi, is a managing director at the investment firm Allen & Company; another cousin, Farzad \u201cFuzzy\u201d Khosrowshahi, played a major role in the creation of Google Docs; yet another cousin, Amir Khosrowshahi, is an executive at Intel; and Avid Larizadeh Duggan, also a cousin, is a general partner at Google Ventures.Mr. Khosrowshahi, in addition to running Expedia since 2005, joined the board of The New York Times Company in 2015.His route to success took him to the investment firm of Allen & Company, where he spent most of the 1990s as an analyst. Barry Diller was a client, and Mr. Khosrowshahi eventually went to work for the media mogul.In 2001, Mr. Diller acquired Expedia, a travel booking site founded by Microsoft. Four years later, Mr. Khosrowshahi became Expedia\u2019s chief executive. The site has flourished, acquiring three major competitors in 2015 alone. Shares in the company, which is now publicly traded, have risen 35 percent over the last year, despite competition from Priceline on one flank and Airbnb on another.\u201cIf Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing \u2014 he\u2019s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a note to Expedia employees on Monday.Uber, like Expedia a decade ago, has enormous promise but also faces enormous challenges. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s supporters believe he can fix the problems.\u201cHe\u2019s a global travel executive \u2014 he understands competitive dynamics, geopolitical challenges, and the operating challenges of running a sprawling global travel company,\u201d said Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, an investor in Uber as well as Expedia.Under Mr. Kalanick, some Uber executives were considered untouchable, which contributed to a poisonous atmosphere. Shana Fisher, who worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi at Mr. Diller\u2019s IAC and is now a venture capitalist, said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t get an excuse with Dara. They have to be good and good. Good and good. He doesn\u2019t have tolerance for less than that.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s experiences as an immigrant gave him a personal perspective on the executive order that President Trump signed restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries this year.Expedia, along with Amazon, gave early support to a lawsuit filed by Washington State\u2019s attorney general objecting to the travel ban. Around the same time, Mr. Khosrowshahi described his early experience as an immigrant in an email to employees.\u201cWe sure didn\u2019t feel like refugees, but in hindsight I guess we were \u2014 my father and mother left everything behind to come here \u2014 to be safe and give their boys a chance to rebuild a life,\u201d he wrote.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting from Berwyn, Pa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Countering West Coast Pull, by Helping Finance Start-Ups Sell in New York", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jeff Bezos, then a New York hedge fund employee, decided to start Amazon in 1994, he quickly moved to the West Coast. So did Mark Zuckerberg, who moved from Harvard to California in 2004 to find the technology talent and financing needed to build up Facebook.Today, the West Coast exerts a similar tidal pull for start-up companies in finance. Nine of the 15 United States financial technology \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 companies worth $1 billion or more, as tracked by CB Insights \u2014 are in the San Francisco area. These Bay Area companies, which are not public, include the online payments processor Stripe, the online lender Social Finance and the finance website Credit Karma.For the last seven years, a New York business-backed program \u2014 the FinTech Innovation Lab \u2014 has been working to stem that West Coast tide by helping financial services start-ups sell their services in New York in an industry where the city clearly dominates: big banks and other finance companies.The program\u2019s backers include Henry Kravis, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Fred Wilson, a co-founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures; and James D. Robinson III, a former chief executive of American Express.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason New York should not be the fintech capital of the world,\u201d said another program backer, the internet entrepreneur Kevin Ryan. He is a former chief executive of the online advertising pioneer DoubleClick and a founder of the flash-sale platform Gilt Groupe and the business news website Business Insider.The term \u201cfintech\u201d covers a group of start-ups, often funded by venture capital investors, that aim to apply new technology in areas like online lending, investing and payments. These start-ups have surged in popularity among investors as banks have had to focus on complying with regulations and rebuilding capital.The FinTech Innovation Lab is a so-called accelerator that annually gives a half-dozen start-ups the chance to interact with top financial firms, hone their products and learn how they can fit into what Accenture, a management consultant, estimated was a $270 billion technology budget for banks worldwide.Tim Estes, the president of Digital Reasoning in Nashville, which uses artificial intelligence to spot compliance and reputational risks for banks in routine employee emails, said that going through the lab program in 2012 was \u201ctransformative for the company, opening up doors across Wall Street as advertised.\u201dAs Digital Reasoning won business from Wall Street, it opened a New York office near Union Square, which now has about 30 employees and is the firm\u2019s second-largest office. Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse Group have become investors.Mr. Estes said Goldman was an early customer, two years after the investment bank\u2019s chief executive was attacked in televised congressional hearings over a subprime debt sale that one Goldman staff member had described in an email as a bad deal. As firms like Goldman realized other such \u201ctime bombs\u201d might be in their email files, \u201ceveryone wanted a better bomb detector,\u201d Mr. Estes said.Another start-up that won business through the lab, in 2012, was True Office, which turns compliance training into a game experience for employees. Adam Sodowick, the chief executive of True Office, had first met Maria Gotsch, a lab co-founder, at a dinner event at a Flatiron district loft. Morgan Stanley signed as a client and invested in True Office, which eventually moved its headquarters from Boston to New York and was acquired in 2014 by the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange resold it this year.The best-known firm to go through the program, in 2015, was the blockchain start-up Digital Asset, shortly after it recruited Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase derivatives pioneer, as its chief executive. Accenture soon invested in the company, which aims to improve Wall Street trade processing.The New York lab is one of hundreds of incubators and accelerators that have sprung up throughout the country to help start-ups, such as Y Combinator in Mountain View, Calif; Techstars in Boulder, Colo.; and Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, Calif. Though many programs require start-ups to give them an equity stake of 5 percent or more, the New York lab gets only 0.5 percent.The lab began in 2010 as a way to bolster the New York City economy after the 2008 financial crisis. It is co-sponsored by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City, an arm of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City \u2014 a business-backed civic group formed in 1979 by David Rockefeller.The lab is designed for companies that want to become partners with big financial institutions, rather than compete with them. One goal, said Mr. Robinson, an investor at RRE Ventures since 1994, is to \u201cexpose the big banks and insurers to early-stage companies doing interesting things in this area.\u201dJean Donnelly, the executive director of the Boston accelerator FinTech Sandbox, said, \u201cNew York has come up pretty quickly as No. 2\u201d behind Silicon Valley in fintech venture investments.Accenture says data from CB Insights indicates that Silicon Valley\u2019s lead in fintech debt and equity financing has narrowed. In 2012, the gap was 4.5 to 1, as valley fintechs raised $1 billion against $225 million for New York fintechs. In 2016, the gap was just 1.1 to 1, with $2.65 billion for Silicon Valley and $2.41 billion for New York.Some West Coast venture investors acknowledged the city\u2019s progress. The gap between Silicon Valley and New York has narrowed, said Pat Grady, a partner who focuses on fintech at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif.But he added: \u201cIf you want to build the next Apple or Airbnb, you come to Silicon Valley. The unmatched talent, risk-taking culture and relentless optimism mean that you have a better chance of outsized success here than anywhere else in the world.\u201dNew York can be fertile ground for \u201cbusiness to business\u201d start-ups selling to banks, Mr. Grady said. But some of the largest United States fintechs, like Social Finance and Credit Karma, cater directly to consumers and have potentially larger markets, he said.So how does the FinTech Innovation Lab work?Every year, the staff and a sponsor committee choose 20 to 25 start-ups from more than 100 applicants to meet with about 35 banks and other sponsoring institutions. The sponsors, in turn, collectively choose six to eight winners for the three-month program.Banks that once had to be \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d to participate in the lab are now waiting in line to check out the start-ups, said Matt Harris, a partner in Bain Capital Ventures. Lately, out-of-town banks like KeyBank in Cleveland and U.S. Bank in Minneapolis have joined.Companies selected to participate this year included Cutting Edge, Nova Credit and BehavioSec. Cutting Edge, a cybersecurity firm, helps protect customers\u2019 locations and identities on the internet. Nova Credit processes and provides credit data from foreign institutions on individuals so banks can lend more readily to immigrants. BehavioSec helps confirm customer identities by analyzing how they type, click and swipe on their devices.The lab featured 19 events over three months, including meetings with Mr. Kravis and James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Kravis stressed the importance of company culture, and Mr. Gorman fielded questions about Wall Street\u2019s use of artificial intelligence and how investment banks do business with start-ups. There was also a practice pitch session at the office of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.This year\u2019s lab culminated with a Demo Day on June 22 at a packed 215-seat auditorium at Bank of America\u2019s New York office. Each entrepreneur was introduced by a Wall Street mentor and then gave a brief pitch for his business.Mr. Robinson and other venture investors strolled a hall with exhibit tables for each start-up. David Reilly, a senior technology executive at Bank of America, said the program was useful because big banks \u201ccan be exceptionally difficult to sell to.\u201dStill, none of the three New York fintechs that raised the most financing in 2016 were alumni of the FinTech Innovation Lab, according to the Accenture data.In one of last year\u2019s largest New York financings, Oscar Health Insurance, the lone New York fintech unicorn on the CB Insights list, raised $400 million. Oscar was co-founded by Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and backed by the younger Mr. Kushner\u2019s Thrive Capital.Other New York fintechs that raised the most money in 2016 included the online student lender CommonBond, which raised $612.5 million, and Payoneer, a global payments platform, which raised $180 million.Advertisement"}

Now, the companies are in a very public fight.The lawsuit came as a surprise to Uber\u2019s directors, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.The battle has caused other technology investors to question Benchmark\u2019s tactics.The new Silicon Valley may be in China.Alibaba and Tencent are among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, with market capitalizations twice as big as the longtime tech leaders Intel, Cisco and IBM.They have joined an elite club of tech companies worth $400 billion and up that has been dominated by American businesses: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where China has finally caught up with the U.S. in the internet space,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at the venture capital firm GGV Capital.Alibaba and Tencent have grown to prominence by dominating e-commerce and online life in China, the world\u2019s largest internet market. Their growth has come as Western companies, such as Facebook, have been blocked by the country\u2019s tight internet controls.This week, Alibaba and Tencent reported financial results that were well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations and point to the growing influence of technology on the Chinese economy.Tencent is expected to soon become the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than a billion users, while Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. The Chinese companies\u2019 revenue also grew at a faster pace in the past three months than at Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These included Jack Welch, the retired leader of General Electric, and W. James McNerney Jr., the former head of Boeing, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak about it.Their reasoning was a combination of patriotism and the hopes of salvaging a pro-business agenda.They did not succeed in persuading their peers, and the council disbanded in protest over comments by President Trump equating the actions of far-right hate groups with protesters opposing them, after a violent confrontation in Charlottesville, Va.The episode has highlighted the varied approach companies have taken in response, and the outside pressures leaders of public companies face.\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}

And the persistence of this music \u2014 a genre sometimes called hatecore \u2014 points to the difficulties that online media platforms have in policing their content, and to the frustrations of activists and the mainstream music industry in trying to bar hate speech from the most popular online channels.In a statement, Spotify said that it did not tolerate content that \u201cfavors hatred\u201d or incites violence on the basis of race, religion or sexuality, and added that it \u201ctakes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention.\u201dThe problem is more complex when it comes to YouTube, which lets users upload material themselves and relies on users to flag offensive content for removal.

{"Headline": "Nostalgia Goes Niche in \u2018Wet Hot American Summer\u2019 and \u2018Comrade Detective\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe needn\u2019t have worried. Nostalgia is not merely a renewable resource. Like the atom, it can also be split, into ever-narrower, more time- and place-specific reveries. Two specimens of this niche-stalgia come to streaming TV this Friday.Now, the eight-episode sequel to the prequel returns for a reunion set in 1991, meaning the actors now play characters roughly the age they were when they made the original movie.So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters\u2019 \u201980s glory days; for the \u201990s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy \u201cThe State\u201d for MTV); and for itself \u2014 that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.As a cultural artifact, it\u2019s both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence. But as a franchise, it feels like it\u2019s running out of time.\u201cTen Years Later,\u201d with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on \u201990s stalker flicks like \u201cThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\u201d At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and \u201ca bunch of other things from 1991.\u201dMany of the core stories are the same. Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn\u2019t gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn\u2019t lost his virginity. And there\u2019s another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way. The lead roles \u2014 hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef \u2014 are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.It\u2019s a brilliant idea. But it\u2019s not much more than an idea.There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football). And the roster of famous voice-over actors \u2014 among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny \u2014 makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.But \u201cComrade Detective\u201d is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama \u2014 a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved \u2014 that it often plays like one. At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn\u2019t fast or frequent enough. Edited to a tighter length, \u201cComrade Detective\u201d might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge. The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Critic Ousted From Think Tank Funded by the Tech Giant", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New America Foundation has received more than $21 million from Google; its parent company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt; and his family\u2019s foundation since the think tank\u2019s founding in 1999. That money helped to establish New America as an elite voice in policy debates on the American left and helped Google shape those debates.The statement disappeared from New America\u2019s website, only to be reposted without explanation a few hours later. But word of Mr. Schmidt\u2019s displeasure rippled through New America, which employs more than 200 people, including dozens of researchers, writers and scholars, most of whom work in sleek Washington offices where the main conference room is called the \u201cEric Schmidt Ideas Lab.\u201d The episode left some people concerned that Google intended to discontinue funding, while others worried whether the think tank could truly be independent if it had to worry about offending its donors.Ms. Slaughter told Mr. Lynn that \u201cthe time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways,\u201d according to an email from Ms. Slaughter to Mr. Lynn. The email suggested that the entire Open Markets team \u2014 nearly 10 full-time employees and unpaid fellows \u2014 would be exiled from New America.While she asserted in the email, which was reviewed by The New York Times, that the decision was \u201cin no way based on the content of your work,\u201d Ms. Slaughter accused Mr. Lynn of \u201cimperiling the institution as a whole.\u201dMr. Lynn, in an interview, charged that Ms. Slaughter caved to pressure from Mr. Schmidt and Google, and, in so doing, set the desires of a donor over the think tank\u2019s intellectual integrity.\u201cGoogle is very aggressive in throwing its money around Washington and Brussels, and then pulling the strings,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cPeople are so afraid of Google now.\u201dGoogle rejected any suggestion that it played a role in New America\u2019s split with Open Markets. Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, pointed out that the company supports a wide range of think tanks and other nonprofits focused on information access and internet regulation. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with every group 100 percent of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group\u2019s independence, personnel decisions and policy perspectives.\u201dNew America\u2019s executive vice president, Tyra Mariani, said it was \u201ca mutual decision for Barry to spin out his Open Markets program,\u201d and that the move was not in any way influenced by Google or Mr. Schmidt.\u201cNew America financial supporters have no influence or control over the research design, methodology, analysis or findings of New America research projects, nor do they have influence or control over the content of educational programs and communications efforts,\u201d Ms. Mariani said. She added that Mr. Lynn\u2019s statement praising the European Union\u2019s sanctions against Google had been temporarily removed from New America\u2019s website because of \u201can unintentional internal issue\u201d unrelated to Google or Mr. Schmidt.Ms. Mariani and Ms. Sciuto said Google is continuing to fund New America.Hours after this article was published online Wednesday morning, Ms. Slaughter announced that the think tank had fired Mr. Lynn on Wednesday for \u201chis repeated refusal to adhere to New America\u2019s standards of openness and institutional collegiality.\u201dIn the run-up to that conference, Ms. Slaughter and New America\u2019s lead fund-raiser in emails to Mr. Lynn indicated that Google was concerned that its positions were not going to be represented, and that it was not given advanced notice of the event.\u201cWe are in the process of trying to expand our relationship with Google on some absolutely key points,\u201d Ms. Slaughter wrote in an email to Mr. Lynn, urging him to \u201cjust THINK about how you are imperiling funding for others.\u201dSome tech lobbyists, think tank officials and scholars argue that the efforts help explain why Google has mostly avoided damaging regulatory and enforcement decisions in the United States of the sort levied by the European Union in late June.The Open Markets\u2019 statement that drew Mr. Schmidt\u2019s ire praised the fine, and called on United States regulators to more aggressively enforce antitrust rules against Google, Amazon and \u201cother dominant platform monopolists.\u201dGoogle\u2019s willingness to spread cash around the think tanks and advocacy groups focused on internet and telecommunications policy has effectively muted, if not silenced, criticism of the company over the past several years, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. His group, which does not accept corporate funding, has played a leading role in calling out Google and other tech companies for alleged privacy violations. But Mr. Rotenberg said it is become increasingly difficult to find partners in that effort as more groups accept Google funding.\u201cThere are simply fewer groups that are available to speak up about Google\u2019s activities that threaten online privacy,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said. \u201cThe groups that should be speaking up aren\u2019t.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Get Shorty\u2019: You Know the Name, but Not This Story", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST HOLLYWOOD \u2014 Sitting on a sunny patio here in shorts and a T-shirt, friendly but frazzled after his days-old baby kept him up for much of the night, Chris O\u2019Dowd is not an intimidating man. And he knows it.\u201cI don\u2019t have the enjoyment of a gym that you need to play those kinds of roles,\u201d he said.For one thing, Chili Palmer isn\u2019t part of it. The series abandons the original\u2019s characters and narrative, replacing Palmer with an Irish hood named Miles Daly, played by Mr. O\u2019Dowd.And for Epix, a channel even the show\u2019s stars have a hard time finding, the hope is that \u201cGet Shorty\u201d will help transform it from an afterthought to a player in the crowded premium TV landscape.\u201cThis show has the opportunity to tell the rest of the world, \u2018This is what an Epix show looks like,\u2019\u201d said Mark Greenberg, its president and chief executive.What \u201cGet Shorty\u201d looks like might surprise fans of the book or, especially, the Barry Sonnenfeld film. A stylish crime flick in the 1990s mold, it combined violence and wisecracks into a confection that was glibly fun and self-consciously cool. (Its sequel, which introduced Chili to the music business, was even called \u201cBe Cool.\u201d)By contrast the series is a slower, grimmer tale that originates not in glitzy Miami but in the bleak sandscape of Pahrump, Nev.Miles is cool, certainly, but he cares less about that than about repairing his broken family by finding legitimate \u2014 or legal, at least \u2014 work in Hollywood. His way in is a potent visual symbol: A bloodstained script, taken from a murdered screenwriter, that Miles convinces Rick to help him turn into a film.But unlike \u201cFargo,\u201d which introduces a new story and cast each year, any future seasons of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d will continue the narrative and feature the same characters (those that survive the first season, anyway).The unconventional choice of Mr. O\u2019Dowd to play the heavy began with Allen Coulter, a former \u201cSopranos\u201d director who helmed the \u201cGet Shorty\u201d pilot, and who early in the series\u2019s development reviewed a casting list that included photos of potential actors. \u201cHe goes, \u2018I want someone menacing, like that guy.\u2019 And he pointed to Chris,\u201d Davey Holmes, the creator of the series, recalled. \u201cWe said, \u2018You\u2019re not familiar with Chris\u2019s work, are you?\u2019\u201dBut with his normally tousled hair shorn close to the scalp and some tattoos added in makeup, the six-foot-three actor transformed into a believable tough guy.Mr. O\u2019Dowd hadn\u2019t read \u201cGet Shorty\u201d or seen the movie. But he was intrigued by the opportunity to play a \u201chard man,\u201d especially one that was the focal point of the show. \u201cTo be the person in the room who can hurt people is kind of fun,\u201d he said.The actor, married with two young sons, was on a dad break, having walked the few blocks from his house to a cafe on Melrose Avenue. Born and raised in western Ireland, Mr. O\u2019Dowd has lived in Los Angeles for several years and remains a fan of the city, even as he agreed that the central joke of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d \u2014 that criminal talents translate nicely to Hollywood \u2014 is well founded.\u201cThe brutality that people can treat each other with in this business is undoubted,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get rid of actors, get rid of jobs, lose people\u2019s money, and then they go for granola somewhere.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily do consequences in the way the rest of humanity does,\u201d he added.\u201cI think it\u2019s genuine,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dowd said, laughing. \u201cRay finding his place in the world is a constant battle that he fights with himself, which is kind of gorgeous to watch.\u201dMr. Romano\u2019s latest challenge: Finding his show. \u201cI\u2019ve still got to figure out a way to get Epix,\u201d he said.\u201cAt the time we were kind of like, \u2018Does Netflix even do TV?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverything ends up wherever it ends up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And though the Soderbergh style has evolved and transformed, all of his work is bound by a common intelligence and unfailing craftsmanship. These are some of the highlights of his vast filmography.Soderbergh\u2019s feature debut not only announced the arrival of a major new talent; it gave birth the fruitful 1990s United States independent film scene. Many of its practitioners followed the blueprint he established here: low budget, minimal locations, small cast and a script emphasizing nuanced characters and garrulous dialogue. But within those confines, Soderbergh worked wonders, creating an intelligent, delicate, and downright riveting study of sexual dysfunction, marital infidelity and fleeting intimacy. And he immediately displayed his unerring nose for new talent, providing breakout roles for James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo.Soderbergh\u2019s feature debut not only announced the arrival of a major new talent; it gave birth the fruitful 1990s United States independent film scene.

And he immediately displayed his unerring nose for new talent, providing breakout roles for James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo.Soderbergh stumbled a bit with his post-\u2018sex, lies, and videotape\u2019 efforts. But the filmmaker brought the experiments in structure and style of those films to this 1998 adaptation of Elmore Leonard\u2019s crime novel, a frisky, funny and sexy story of an escaped con (George Clooney) aiming for one last score, and the federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) who can\u2019t decide whether to hunt him down or seduce him. The picture\u2019s playful scrambling of chronology and colorful supporting characters betray its \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d influence, but this is no rip-off; it has an energy and electricity all its own. And it not only returned Soderbergh to the mainstream, but it also began his fruitful partnership with Clooney, who would star in five more films for the director over the next nine years.Soderbergh stumbled a bit with his post-\u2018sex, lies, and videotape\u2019 efforts.

The film combines fractured timelines, stream-of-consciousness editing and even clips from an earlier Stamp performance (in Ken Loach\u2019s \u201cPoor Cow\u201d). In doing so, Soderbergh turns what could\u2019ve been a \u201cDeath Wish\u201d remake into a thoughtful, mournful, elegiac meditation \u2014 on family, on forgiveness, on the past in general and the \u201960s in particular.On the heels of \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d Soderbergh further fused art-house experimentation and genre storytelling in this tale of a revenge-seeking ex-con (Terence Stamp, in a career-best performance).

But he eschewed the traditional narration-and-talking-heads approach, choosing instead to let Gray posthumously tell his own story, via archival clips from interviews and videotapes of several stage performances. This refreshingly unorthodox approach proved spot on for Gray, who was not only an unconventional performer, but one who so often (and so bracingly) merged his life and his art.Soderbergh\u2019s 1996 film adaptation of the storyteller Spalding Gray\u2019s monologue \u201cGray\u2019s Anatomy\u201d was one of the key experiments that got him to \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d so after Gray committed suicide in 2004, Soderbergh was compelled to make a documentary about him.

Some filmmakers might have trouble balancing the movie\u2019s large cast and wide scope; Soderbergh somehow does the opposite, marshaling the film\u2019s large canvas to propel the narrative with an urgency and overwhelming dread. The result is one of his most efficient pictures \u2014 and his scariest.This 2011 hit found the director bringing his multi-thread \u201cTraffic\u201d approach to the \u201970s-style disaster movie, telling the story of a deadly pandemic, the researchers and doctors who attempt to stifle it and the cynics who try to profit from it.

That said, this is no typical action movie: He uses wide shots and long takes for his action sequences, forgoing the incoherent compositions and rapid-fire edits of too many bone-crunching blockbusters, to better showcase the skills and athleticism of the star Gina Carano. And the script, by Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cThe Limey\u201d collaborator Lem Dobbs, is a crisp, lean piece of work, in which a black-ops soldier (Carano) takes the fall for a mission that goes sideways, only to meticulously track down and take out the men who set her up. Brisk, witty and just plain fun, it\u2019s the female James Bond movie you\u2019ve always wanted.Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t exactly the first person you\u2019d think of to helm a globe-trotting action movie featuring a mixed martial arts champ, but he\u2019s never really been one for easy categorization.

It\u2019s a winking, double-edged sword of a movie, a timely examination of economic anxiety in the wake of the financial crisis, and a good-time ogle-fest featuring a jaw-dropping array of actors in various states of undress (including Tatum, Matthew McConaughey, Alex Pettyfer, and Matt Bomer). Soderbergh works both angles with ease. \u201cMagic Mike\u201d may not be his most intellectually challenging work, but it\u2019s one of his most enjoyable.With George Clooney otherwise occupied, Soderbergh\u2019s most frequent late-period leading man is Channing Tatum, whose on-set stories of his early years as a male exotic dancer inspired this 2012 comedy/drama.

However, he spent the bulk of that period making this Cinemax television series, directing all 20 episodes of its two-season run \u2014 a considerable accomplishment for any series, but especially for one as challenging as this complex hourlong drama, set at New York\u2019s Knickerbocker Hospital at the turn of the 20th century. Yet the immediacy of Soderbergh\u2019s direction keeps it from feeling like a musty period piece; this is a hard-edge, fast-moving show, and one whose preoccupations with race, class, and gender have proven anything but antique.Soderbergh took a four-year sabbatical from feature directing between 2013\u2019s \u201cBehind the Candelabra\u201d and \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d but he kept himself busy by producing several projects, helping out with the 2015 \u201cMagic Mike\u201d sequel and writing.

Asked by his bosses at Paramount to crank out a quickie release for the summer of 1960, Lewis delivered the Tati-esque \u201cThe Bellboy,\u201d playing a mostly mute Miami hotel employee named Stanley (in a homage to comedian Stan Laurel) who fumbles through a series of densely packed slapstick scenarios with his wealthy guests. Anyone who wonders why Lewis is hailed as a genius should start here, a movie filled with skilled pantomime, fluid camerawork and unexpectedly sophisticated humor.As a director, Lewis took inspiration from silent-era gods like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, as well as whimsical foreign filmmakers like Jacques Tati.

Anyone who wonders why Lewis is hailed as a genius should start here, a movie filled with skilled pantomime, fluid camerawork and unexpectedly sophisticated humor.Lewis, a showbiz lifer, went on stage in vaudeville with his folks as a boy, and quickly developed a comic persona based on jumping around and making funny faces. He joined up with the laid-back Italian-American crooner Dean Martin in the mid-40s, and constructed an act in which his reckless anarchy would ruffle his partner\u2019s cool. The team became even bigger stars in movies, and with the help of director Norman Taurog they told a version of their own story in 1952\u2019s \u201cThe Stooge.\u201d Martin plays a failing nightclub singer who starts drawing a crowd when he hires a bumbler as comic relief. The emphasis on irresolvable personality conflicts predicts the duo\u2019s own eventual breakup; but the movie also features healthy helpings of the original Martin/Lewis show, which is still sidesplittingly wild.Lewis, a showbiz lifer, went on stage in vaudeville with his folks as a boy, and quickly developed a comic persona based on jumping around and making funny faces.

But he learned a lot from director Frank Tashlin, a former Warner Bros. animator, about constructing perfectly timed, visually precise gags onscreen. The eye-popping 1955 musical \u201cArtists and Models\u201d is the peak of their collaboration, following a juvenile dope and his struggling painter buddy.

When Lewis went solo, he donned the uniform a couple of times \u2014 most notably in 1959\u2019s entertaining \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up the Ship,\u201d where he plays a sailor explaining in flashback how he lost a destroyer. This is one of Lewis\u2019s more mature films, and an example of how he tried to tone down the wackiness as he got older.Martin and Lewis found success early on in military comedies, because both of them looked and acted like unlikely soldiers.

The 1960 favorite \u201cCinderfella\u201d flips a well-known fairy tale, with Lewis playing a stressed stepson enchanting a princess. Often, Lewis\u2019s films coast by thanks to a couple of sharp set pieces or an amazing background gag, but here there\u2019s a full-bodied plot with an emotional payoff.After he became a director, Lewis continued working occasionally with Tashlin, who helped him understand how to work wild comic sequences into solidly constructed stories, laced with satisfying sentimentality.

In 1964\u2019s \u201cThe Disorderly Orderly,\u201d Lewis gives one of his most nuanced performances as a med school hypochondriac, who picks up shifts at a sanitarium to help his depressed sweetheart. There\u2019s more pathos and romance here than usual for Lewis, though the director Tashlin still inserts some wonderfully absurdist visual gags, including a montage of wind chimes that ends with a shot of a noisy skeleton hanging outside an anatomy class.Lewis worked so fast and furious during the early \u201860s that his best films are often simply a collection of indelible moments.

In Martin Scorsese\u2019s pungent 1983 film, Lewis plays a talk-show host who gets kidnapped by a creepy fan (Robert De Niro), and the subtle shifts between surface cool and deep anxiety carry with them a startling self-awareness.The heyday of Lewis as a comedian ended around 1965, although he made a few passable pictures later on.

{"Headline": "Rift Widens Between Trump and Business Leaders", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chief executive of Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, criticized President Trump in front of his 1.5 million American employees, widening a rift between the White House and the business community that has been growing since the weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va.The rebuke from Mr. McMillon came as six other business leaders stepped down from presidential advisory councils \u2014 including two late on Monday, the C.E.O.s of Intel and Under Armour \u2014 citing their own values as the primary motivation for distancing themselves from Mr. Trump.The president hit back at his critics in the business world during a news conference at Trump Tower Tuesday. He spent several minutes lashing out at some of the most prominent executives in the country, saying that those who left his councils were \u201cnot taking their jobs seriously\u201d and were \u201cleaving out of embarrassment.\u201dThe departures represent a rare spectacle in which prominent executives are looking for ways to pull back from an American president who campaigned, and won, partly on the strength of his pro-business stance. This has created an unusual calculus: Whether or not to stay on as advisers to a president, a role that traditionally is a coveted position with little to no attendant risk.The exodus began Monday, when Merck\u2019s chief executive said he was resigning from Mr. Trump\u2019s manufacturing council, citing the president\u2019s tepid early statement on the violence in Charlottesville, where white nationalists staged a weekend march that turned violent. On Tuesday, the leaders of a labor group and a nonprofit business alliance resigned from the same panel. Mr. McMillon of Walmart has chosen to remain on the president\u2019s economic advisory council, despite his criticisms.Having come into office boasting of his business bona fides, Mr. Trump was quick to forge ties with the corporate world. Central to these efforts was the formation of the business advisory groups made up of executives who would help shape policy discussions.Dozens of prominent business leaders joined the panels, and in the first weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, numerous meetings were held at the White House. Yet the early momentum dissipated and few meetings of the advisory groups have been held since.For the chief executive of Intel, who stepped down from the manufacturing council on Monday, the journey from engagement with the new president to a public breakup played out over the course of months.Brian Krzanich, the Intel chief, was curious about the Trump movement and, during the campaign, planned to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his home to hear his views \u2014 only to cancel it after an outcry in Silicon Valley. Nevertheless, when Intel decided to expand a plant in Arizona in February, Mr. Krzanich called Mr. Trump and joined the president to announce it at the White House, even though the long-planned project was initially announced with President Obama.Yet Mr. Krzanich has publicly disagreed with Mr. Trump on key issues, like the president\u2019s proposed immigration ban in January and the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.The president\u2019s response to the weekend\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Va., was the final straw. In a thinly veiled reference to Mr. Trump, Mr. Krzanich wrote that he was disturbed by people in Washington who \u201cseem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them.\u201d In a nod to the protesters who challenged the white supremacists as well as to Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, who quit the council early on Monday in protest of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, Mr. Krzanich added, \u201cWe should honor \u2013 not attack \u2013 those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values.\u201dAfter deliberating over the weekend and on Monday with senior executives and other advisers, Mr. Krzanich notified the council of his decision in writing on Monday night and published a blog post explaining it.There was a mass exodus of executives from presidential advisory councils as they opposed stances taken by President Trump.The willingness of Mr. Krzanich and other C.E.O.s to walk away from the advisory panels highlights an uncomfortable reality for Mr. Trump: He billed himself as the businessman-president, but some executives no longer want to work with him.\u201cThis should be his strong suit: courting C.E.O.s,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cInstead, Trump finds himself with C.E.O.s not wanting to be in a photo op with the president. What should have been an honor has become an albatross.\u201dMany executives remain on the various councils, including the leaders of Boeing, Amazon and Oracle. And since taking office, Mr. Trump has met with hundreds of business leaders.Several people involved in the panels also say that they can have a real impact on policy. Earlier this year, members of one of the advisory groups urged the president not regard China as a currency manipulator. That input, from a group led by the Blackstone chief executive Steve Schwarzman, seemed to inspire a change of stance on Mr. Trump\u2019s part that may have smoothed relations with that country.Even those companies that decided to remain on the panels have debated about how to proceed. General Electric, which on Monday said its chairman, Jeffrey Immelt, would continue to advise the president, did so after careful deliberation.A handful of top G.E. executives worked on a statement that \u201cacknowledged what the company\u2019s values are,\u201d condemning bigotry and racism. They did not check with the board, but did consult with G.E. diversity groups, including the one representing African-Americans in the company, to ensure that the statement was in sync with \u201cthe pulse of the company,\u201d before releasing the statement, according to a person with knowledge of G.E.\u2019s thinking.The president\u2019s business advisers are in a quandary, said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford\u2019s business school. Among the considerations C.E.O.s must weigh when contemplating whether to step down from the advisory groups: the benefits of having a seat at the table, the political preferences of employees and customers, and the potential consequences of slighting the president.\u201cIt\u2019s easier, and it\u2019s less offensive, to not take the position in the first place, than to take it and to, relatively quickly \u2014 six months later \u2014 say, \u2018Whoops, I\u2019m out of here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pfeffer said. \u201cNow you\u2019re offending him. So I\u2019m sure the calculus changes.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Frazier of Merck, Kevin Plank of Under Armour and Mr. Krzanich of Intel stepped down from the manufacturing council. And Tuesday morning, Scott Paul, the president of the American Alliance for Manufacturing, a nonprofit group, said on Twitter that he, too, was stepping down from the manufacturing council \u201cbecause it\u2019s the right thing for me to do.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump on Tuesday equivocated in his criticism of far-right hate groups, Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Thea Lee, the deputy chief of staff, also stepped down.\u201cWe cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis. We must resign on behalf of America\u2019s working people, who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups.\u201dCrossing a famously sensitive president has its risks.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump\u2019s claim that the company was moving jobs abroad.Some companies on the council, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, do substantial business with the government, adding another complex dynamic to their calculations. But the consensus among business leaders was that the risks of crossing Mr. Trump had diminished in recent months.\u201cThe risk calculus has changed dramatically,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University Business School, who sits on several corporate boards. \u201cYes, you may risk a tweet from Trump. But his tweets are increasingly flaccid.\u201dVindu Goel, Steve Lohr, Katie Thomas and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Play to Rattle Whole Foods Rivals: Cheaper Kale and Avocado", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The era of Whole Paycheck, the derisive nickname for Whole Foods, may be drawing to a close. Amazon, which takes control of the upscale grocer on Monday, intends to slash prices the same day.The significance of the move goes well beyond the price of organic avocados, baby kale and rotisserie chickens, all of which will cost less on Monday than on Sunday. Rather, it is an outsize way for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, to announce his plan to shake up the grocery industry and take on competitors like Walmart and Kroger.\u201cThis is how Amazon operates,\u201d said Michelle Grant, head of retailing at Euromonitor, a market research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s all about speed, speed, speed.\u201dMr. Bezos has always been willing to lose money, disappoint shareholders and start discount wars in his efforts to challenge and inflict pain on competitors. In the 23 years that Amazon has been in business, he has done it again and again \u2014 with books, diapers and now groceries \u2014 fundamentally changing entire retail categories.\u201cI absolutely think it\u2019s putting the rest of the market on notice,\u201d Bob Hetu, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm, said of Amazon\u2019s announcement on pricing.Investors drove Kroger shares down more than 8 percent on Thursday; shares of Walmart, the nation\u2019s biggest grocer, fell about 2 percent. Both companies\u2019 shares also fell sharply when the deal was announced in June.Amazon plans to weave together its online business and physical stores by turning its Prime membership program into a Whole Foods rewards program, providing additional savings to customers. Amazon Prime is a $99-a-year service that gives customers faster free shipping, video streaming and other benefits.Whole Foods\u2019 private-label products will be available through Amazon\u2019s online services and Amazon lockers that will be installed in some Whole Foods markets. Customers will also be able to return online orders to Amazon through the lockers.\u201cWe\u2019re determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone,\u201d Jeff Wilke, the executive who runs Amazon\u2019s consumer businesses, said on Thursday in an announcement about the changes. \u201cEverybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality.\u201dDiscounts are not the only reason shoppers use Amazon \u2014 selection and convenience are others \u2014 but Mr. Bezos has never been shy about starting price wars that inflict pain on rivals. In the 1990s, the company tussled with Barnes & Noble to see which could discount books the most. Amazon and Walmart have been in an on-and-off price war in a variety of categories for years.In its battle with Quidsi, a start-up that owned Diapers.com, Amazon put so much pressure on the company that it eventually agreed to be acquired by Amazon rather than by Walmart.Ever since Amazon made the surprise announcement in June that it was acquiring Whole Foods for more than $13 billion, competitors have expected it to shake things up at the grocer, which has struggled in the face of competition from Costco, Walmart and others that have wooed customers with a growing selection of organic produce and kitchen staples. (Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, is the chairwoman of Whole Foods.)Still, the speed with which Amazon completed the acquisition and embarked on a price-cutting campaign is stunning. Amazon completed the purchase in under three months \u2014 unusual for a multibillion-dollar transaction. The Federal Trade Commission approved the deal on Wednesday.Amazon did not say how much it would cut prices in Whole Foods stores, 460 of which are spread across the United States, Canada and Britain. It promised that there would be further cuts in the future. People who have studied Whole Foods\u2019 struggles in the marketplace said the reductions would have to be substantial to compete with other stores.\u201cI believe what we will see is Amazon and Whole Foods becoming aggressive on price,\u201d said Brittain Ladd, a strategy consultant who previously worked for Amazon on its grocery business. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if some prices are lowered 15 percent to as high as 25 percent in some categories.\u201dMr. Wilke of Amazon said in his statement that lowering prices would not compromise the quality of products at Whole Foods, the brand\u2019s main selling point. The items the company said it would drop prices on include bananas, butter, crunchy almond butter, organic large brown eggs, responsibly farmed salmon and tilapia and organic Fuji apples.A number of groups, including members of Congress and representatives of organized labor, have raised concerns about how the acquisition may affect competition in the grocery business, but the Federal Trade Commission had no trouble with it.Antitrust lawyers noted that Amazon and Whole Foods were relatively small players in the grocery business and in different corners of the market \u2014 Amazon in online grocery delivery and Whole Foods in physical retailing.Those arguments will probably not assuage a growing chorus of Amazon critics who believe it is developing too powerful a grip on retail spending, at least on the internet. Yet Amazon\u2019s announcement of immediate price reductions on groceries underscores how the company has managed, so far, to stay on the right side of regulators.\u201cAt the end of the day, the F.T.C. is in the business of watching out for the consumer,\u201d said Brendan Witcher, a retail analyst at Forrester Research.It remains to be seen whether the deal will revive Whole Foods\u2019 fortunes or become a costly move into an industry that Amazon has so far failed to master. Amazon has offered its own internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but has had little impact on the habits of consumers, who overwhelmingly prefer buying their groceries in stores.Amazon is experimenting with automation technologies that could save costs in physical stores by eliminating cashiers, but it has vowed not to use those technologies at Whole Foods to lay off workers. But sharp price cuts on items in stores will put pressure on Amazon to find cost savings elsewhere at Whole Foods, analysts said \u2014 for example, by making the logistics network that delivers goods to stores more efficient.After the companies combine, Amazon\u2019s competitors in the grocery business will still be vastly larger. Walmart has more than 4,600 stores and last year started making a multibillion-dollar investment in lowering grocery prices. Walmart has also significantly increased its investment in online shopping through acquisitions to better compete with Amazon on its main turf.\u201cWe feel great about our position with our network of stores around the country and fast growing e-commerce and online grocery businesses,\u201d said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart.Local grocers expressed some trepidation about Amazon\u2019s aggressive entry into their business, but said it was part of a long history of upheavals and competition.Stew Leonard Jr. is the chief executive of Stew Leonard\u2019s, a chain of six grocery stores in New York and Connecticut that focuses on fresh produce. There are several Whole Foods close to his stores, and Mr. Leonard said he had been watching the Amazon deal closely.\u201cI\u2019ve been in retail since I was a kid, and I\u2019m always nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cCostcos were opening, then Walmarts, then Whole Foods. But at the end of the day, you just have to try and get the freshest corn out there on the sidewalk.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and David Gelles from New York.

{"Headline": "\u2018Cortana, Open Alexa,\u2019 Amazon Says. And Microsoft Agrees.", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "In an unusual partnership, Amazon and Microsoft are working together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants.Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The crowded pack of voice-controlled digital assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana \u2014 are good at numerous things. They can help people play music, set up calendar appointments and check the weather.They can even get two rival tech executives, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to join hands in a rare partnership.For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year.It is unusual for big tech companies to cooperate on important new technologies that they want to stand out from the competition. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and nearly every other big tech company is pouring huge amounts of money into making digital assistants that are smarter and can do more, seeing them as a new way for people to interact naturally with devices and online services.But Mr. Bezos and Mr. Nadella are concerned that keeping assistants from working together could hold them back. The way they see it, each assistant has unique strengths that could benefit the other assistants.In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon\u2019s Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants \u2014 also called \u201cA.I.s,\u201d for artificial intelligence \u2014 the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.\u201cI want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible.\u201d Mr. Bezos said.As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer \u2014 for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss?Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say \u201cAlexa, Open Cortana\u201d followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say \u201cCortana, Open Alexa.\u201dThe Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft\u2019s CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said.It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company\u2019s \u201cworking backward process.\u201d Through that exercise, Amazon\u2019s teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code.In a phone interview, Mr. Nadella compared digital assistants like Cortana and Alexa to competing web browsers that provide access to the same pools of online information. \u201cThe personality and expertise of each one will be such that if they interoperated, the user will get more out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat resonated for me and for him, and then that\u2019s what led to the teams working.\u201dMr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to.\u201cI\u2019d welcome it,\u201d he said.\u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll be inspired by it,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cAt least that would be my hope.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people\u2019s experiences with its iPhones and iPads.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason Google or Apple would offer it because they\u2019re trying to drive their own ecosystems,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, a technology research firm.By contrast, Alexa is mostly used on Echo speakers that sit around a home, and Cortana is largely used on PCs. Amazon says it has sold millions of Echo devices, accounting for around 70 percent of the market for smart speakers, according eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft says there are 145 million active monthly users of Cortana through Windows 10.The two companies have struggled in the smartphone business, which makes it hard to get people using Alexa and Cortana outside homes and offices. Amazon and Microsoft are cutting deals with carmakers to integrate their assistants directly into vehicles. While Amazon and Microsoft have released digital assistant apps for mobile devices running Google and Apple software, the apps are not as widespread and using them is usually not as effortless as the ones Apple and Google build into their devices.Eventually, Mr. Bezos predicted, the primary assistant on a device will be smart enough to automatically route a person\u2019s request to whichever assistant is best equipped to answer, without needing a verbal introduction between the two.\u201cIn my view of the world, because that would be best for the customer, that\u2019s probably what eventually happens,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alaska Warily Eyes Change Bringing Suburbs and Amazon Boxes", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALMER, Alaska \u2014 For years, pet owners in this Anchorage suburb of big homes and lawns have fretted over snares set in the local parks by fur-trappers going after fox, lynx and rabbits. But in a quiet revolution this spring, dog lovers got the upper hand, and after a series of public meetings where few trappers showed up to fight back, trapping was banned by the borough council. The suburbs had won.\u201cThat part of old Alaska is moving further out into the bush,\u201d said Mike Albright, 44, a business owner who was lounging at a park with his three dogs on a recent afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201dAlaska will always be different, if only by its size, climate and the grandeur of its open spaces. Senator Lisa Murkowski\u2019s recent votes against repeal of the Affordable Care Act in Congress also reinforced the perception that people here are go-it-alone independent thinkers, shaped by their far remove from the more settled, politically divided lower 48.But many longtime residents, writers and businesspeople here said that the sense of \u201conly in Alaska\u201d exceptionalism underlying this place and its identity for generations is fading. Improvements in communications and transport are shrinking the sense of physical distance. High-speed internet is reaching tiny villages, opening communities and families to greater connection with the outside world for everything including social media and commerce.\u201cAnchorage doesn\u2019t look that much different than Seattle,\u201d said Chad R. Farrell, a sociology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, referring to the new demographic tide. But, he added, not all Alaskans are comfortable with that idea.Dan Fischer, an artist in the fishing and tourism town of Homer, a five-hour drive south of here, saw a more ambivalent culture change in his corner of the state with the arrival of Amazon Prime and free shipping.\u201cWe gained access, but lost some of our uniqueness,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.Charles Wohlforth, an author and columnist who has written about the state for decades, said the old oil economy propped up the sense by many Alaskans that life was inherently different here, through the blue-collar jobs it created by the thousands and the taxes that oil companies paid. The State Legislature has now been considering new taxes to replace lost revenue from the oil decline, and those taxes look a lot like the ones that people pay in the rest of the country.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be kind of a regular place,\u201d Mr. Wohlforth said. And it won\u2019t, he said, look like the hip, thriving cities of the East and West Coasts. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to look like the middle of the country, which is kind of a declining blue-collar area that has lost its main economic reason to exist and bounces along with whatever we can manage.\u201dVictor Fischer, who came here in 1950 and helped lead the drive for Alaskan statehood in 1959, says the gloomy talk of lost distinctions and decline is wrong. The next chapter of Alaska will be unquestionably different, said Mr. Fischer, who is 93. With fewer oil jobs, there might even be something like a return to the old smaller, tougher state where great jobs didn\u2019t grow on trees, he said. But young people looking for a place with fewer boundaries will still come, he said, and in that there is hope.\u201cThere are young people still coming to Alaska with a gleam in their eye,\u201d said Mr. Fischer, who is no relation to Dan Fischer, the artist. \u201cThey come because Alaska is still a frontier, because they care about the environment, climate change and polar bears,\u201d he said. \u201cSmaller would not necessarily be worse \u2014 in some ways it might be better.\u201dPeople in both parties have said they intend in coming elections to strongly go after native Alaskan voters in rural areas, who have supported both Republicans and Democrats in the past.Out-of-the-way places that once were more likely to fight over the idea of whether or not to have a traffic light have also been pulled into the fray.\u201c \u2018We\u2019re giving to the A.C.L.U. instead,\u2019 \u201d said Sallie Rediske, the group\u2019s president and chairwoman, quoting one donor.Mr. Albright, the park visitor who was sitting with his three dogs (a Yorkie, a Westie and a Pomeranian-poodle crossbreed), said new Alaska and old might not quite have settled their differences, either. For many Alaskans, rules are meant to be broken, he said, and despite the ban on trapping, you still see some traps.\u201cSome people are probably just going to keep doing it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s still Alaska.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Are you Mr. Office Dweller now?As The Journal noted, Apple is starting way behind Netflix and Amazon, which have huge stables of original movies and TV shows they\u2019ve been producing for some time.

Isn\u2019t Apple sitting on a zillion dollars in cash somewhere?Anyway, I think Apple needs a real breakout hit, just like Facebook and its big video push. I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.Then, one of Uber\u2019s largest shareholders sent an open letter to all of Uber\u2019s employees. The shareholder is Benchmark, which last week sued Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former C.E.O., to get him off the board. The letter included an intimation that there was more damning information that could leak if Kalanick didn\u2019t back down from a fight.In sum, it\u2019s like watching a slow-motion car wreck, where no one seems to have escaped unscathed.Some went even beyond that. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.There was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.I understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.To me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.What do you think?Let me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201dIsn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?Maybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon.

{"Headline": "Houston Loves Big Business. How Much Should Big Business Now Love It Back?", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftEven before the damage from Hurricane Harvey is tallied, big corporations are breaking out their checkbooks.The help Houston has given businesses over the years raises an important question: What is the moral obligation of big companies \u2014 especially those that have benefited from a region\u2019s largess \u2014 after such a major disaster?Bob Mitchell, the president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, an organization that represents local businesses, told me that Houston\u2019s big businesses are generally \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the local community. But he said the hurricane\u2019s aftermath would offer the true test.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in the weeks and months to come?\u201d Mr. Mitchell asked. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s more important than what\u2019s happening right this minute.\u201dThe donations announced for Harvey relief are generous by the standards of corporate philanthropy. Some of the donations are smaller, though, than the amounts many companies have gotten from the region\u2019s generous economic development programs.A Chevron spokeswoman said that the company \u201cis proud to have created jobs that added millions of dollars in economic benefit to Houston and the State of Texas.\u201dBut the incentives also help corporate bottom lines. And after a major disaster like Harvey, it seems worth reminding companies that they have flourished, in part, thanks to the Houston area\u2019s generosity.\u201cThose corporations ought to feel some additional obligations, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d said Ben Means, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies corporate governance. \u201cIt\u2019s not because there\u2019s a quid pro quo. They\u2019ve been part of the community, and they have the capacity to help, and they ought to use their resources in socially constructive ways.\u201dExxon Mobil, in an email, said: \u201cIn 2016, together with employees and retirees, the ExxonMobil Foundation and Exxon Mobil Corporation contributed more than $25 million in charitable donations to organizations in the greater Houston area.\u201dDisaster relief isn\u2019t limited to the private sector, of course. Billions of dollars in federal, state and local government money will also be needed to help the area recover from the flooding and other damage. Big businesses, which often have valuable supplies and resources, can still play a useful role. Corporations with offices in and around Houston can provide temporary housing to displaced residents, help transport supplies to flooded areas and offer support to small and medium-size local businesses. Some could also chip in on big infrastructure projects, such as fortified levees, that would help protect the region from future storms.\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility for industry to provide leadership and resources for recovery,\u201d said Sam Brody, a flood expert and professor at Texas A&M University at Galveston. \u201cIt\u2019s not just their facilities. It\u2019s their communities they need to look out for.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to be cynical about the idea of corporate philanthropy, especially in a time of disaster, when companies stand to burnish their images by giving back. But corporations helping Houston recover from the storm\u2019s effects aren\u2019t just acting altruistically or buffing their reputations. They are holding up their end of the deals they made, in which they got financial breaks in exchange for investing in local communities.That investment has never been more vital than now, as companies weigh the responsibility of staying to help Houston versus the benefits of moving to less-waterlogged areas.\u201cIf those corporations stick around more than they would have otherwise,\u201d Mr. Means said, \u201cthat will tell us that these investments in attracting businesses are worthwhile.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Vacation: Printed, Framed and Delivered to Your Door", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayAnd so this year, I explored a few companies (including one that had just been founded when I was testing all those printing services) that allow you to upload a digital photo, have it matted, framed and delivered to your door in a matter of days. After the first framed photo arrived in the mail, I knew I\u2019d never go back to just plain old prints.Below, a look at a few companies that offer printing and framing. And for those who just want a few prints to pin to a cubicle wall or post on a refrigerator, I\u2019ve included some apps and websites that will print your photos for less than a dime and, in some cases, free (though you pay for shipping).The process is easy. I began by clicking the \u201cstart framing\u201d button. Then it was time to upload a photo and crop it. The photo sizes you\u2019re offered are based on your photo\u2019s resolution. (If you already have a print and want it framed, Framebridge will send you prepaid packaging so you can ship it to them.)Now it\u2019s time to choose a frame. If you want some advice, one of the site\u2019s designers will suggest some mat-and-framing combinations (a free service), or you can choose your own frame and mat. Then you\u2019ll see a preview of your framed art, along with the price. If you want to make changes to the mat and the photo size, you can do so from this page. Once you\u2019re happy, you simply add the project to your shopping cart.Shipping is where a lot of photo websites dent your wallet, but I was delighted to find that shipping through Framebridge was included in the price. It also makes you feel like you\u2019re not being nickeled and dimed.My gallery frame arrived at my doorstep nine days after I ordered it, faster than the delivery times of certain companies that only print photos. (If you want expedited shipping, it\u2019s $15 to $40, depending on the size of your art.) I opened the package, which was well-padded, to find the image just as I had hoped it would be: in a crisp, white mat and a white wood frame, ready to be hung on the wall. My printed photo, a 14x18 frame, mat and shipping was $79, and worth every penny.There is shipping and handling, which varies depending on the price of your order and how fast you want it. Shipping a 14x11, deep-set, $99 frame to New York ranged from $18.99 for the least expensive option to $41.99 for the most expensive.But let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want a frame. On the other end of the photo-printing spectrum are small, cheap prints you don\u2019t think twice about putting pushpins through. And there are plenty of places to get them.The app requires access to the photos on your phone, which may be a deal breaker for some. The desktop version allows you to drag an image onto the page so that Printage doesn\u2019t have access to all your photos. You\u2019ll have to sign up with an email address or through Facebook if you want to continue after that. A dozen 4x6 prints were $2.83 and 14 cents tax for a total of $2.97.Bottom line: Cheap, though not necessarily fast, prints are but a few taps away if you\u2019re not a stickler for professional-quality images. If you want your vacation photos framed on your wall, give a printing and framing site a try. My framed photos take me right back to those special trips. Now I just need to get around to hammering some nails.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s a Pizza Delivery in Ford\u2019s Future, by Driverless Car", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe think there\u2019s a very good business,\u201d said Sherif Marakby, Ford\u2019s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification. And for Ford, it starts with pizza.The Domino\u2019s pizza chain this week plans to start testing deliveries using a self-driving Ford Fusion sedan outfitted with enough sensors, electronics and software to find its way to customers\u2019 homes or offices in a section of this city 40 miles west of Detroit.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real learning experience,\u201d said Dennis Maloney, chief digital officer at Domino\u2019s, which is based here. \u201cNo one really knows what\u2019s going to happen when customers walk out to the car. They\u2019re faced with a car. There\u2019s no human interaction. What happens if they approach the car from the wrong direction? Will people mind coming out of their house? We want to understand all that.\u201dIf answers begin to emerge, the possibilities are not hard to imagine. Americans already take delivery of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of products sold by Amazon and other online retailers. In the future, a retailer like Home Depot could deliver building materials directly to job sites.\u201cWe know that some of the early applications of self-driving cars will be in very specific kinds of commercial fleets,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cDelivery is a perfect example.\u201dFord has been seen as lagging in the development of driverless vehicles, and the Domino\u2019s experiment offers a chance to showcase its technology. As far as using such cars as a mode of delivery, Mr. Marakby said, \u201cwe think it will take off in 2021\u201d \u2013 which is when Ford expects to begin producing a fully autonomous vehicle that will have no steering wheel and no pedals.For the Domino\u2019s trial, Ford is providing a self-driving Fusion that scans the road with radar and cameras. It also uses lidar \u2013 a kind of radar based on laser beams \u2013 that can be found in a rooftop unit featuring distinctive spinning canisters. The images collected are compared instantaneously with highly detailed digital maps to ensure that the car knows precisely where it is on the road and how to reach its destination.The vehicle is one of several dozen that Ford has built for various tests and trials. It is painted white, with large black lettering noting the car is \u201cself-driving\u201d and \u201cexperimental.\u201dThe first driverless Domino\u2019s delivery was expected to take place on Monday evening, weather permitting. For now, the car\u2019s expensive electronics are too delicate to operate in heavy rain.The car will actually have a safety driver at the wheel to take over in case of a malfunction, a Ford engineer in the passenger seat to monitor the electronics and computers and a Domino\u2019s employee in the back to observe the customer.When placing orders with a Domino\u2019s store in northeast Ann Arbor, customers will be given the opportunity to take their delivery from the self-driving car. Because there is no delivery person to bring pizzas to the door, customers will have to walk outside the retrieve their order. They will be alerted by text when the car is nearing their home and when it arrives.A red arrow on the car\u2019s rear, passenger-side window tells customers to \u201cstart here\u201d and directs them to a touch screen. Keying in the last four digits of the customer\u2019s phone number causes the window to open, revealing an insulated compartment large enough to hold five pizzas and four side orders.One customer advantage of taking delivery from a self-driving car: If there\u2019s no driver, there\u2019s no tip.Kelly Garcia, Domino\u2019s senior vice president for e-commerce development, said the company expected to use the vehicle for three to six deliveries a day and would continue the trial through September.Mr. Garcia added that the trial was aimed at understanding how customers would interact with a driverless vehicle, not eliminating drivers. Domino\u2019s employs about 100,000 drivers nationwide, he said, and has openings for 10,000 more.\u201cWe could use autonomous cars to fill in where we have a shortage of drivers, or add capacity during surges in business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have drivers for a long time.

But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201dFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.In the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.The iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.In a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201dMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.Even Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.Apple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201dBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.Still, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.The risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said.Advertisement"}

Google, Mr. Schmidt and his family\u2019s foundation are the principal funders of that think tank.But as the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog discovered in February 2009 when it investigated Google\u2019s handling of consumer privacy, the funding from Google comes with strings attached. As the group noted on its website, Google\u2019s director of policy communications, Bob Boorstin, emailed the Rose Foundation (a major funder of Consumer Watchdog) complaining about Consumer Watchdog and asking the charity to consider \u201cwhether there might be better groups in which to place your trust and resources.\u201d Mr. Boorstin later apologized for his attempts to cripple a Google critic, but there is no evidence that the use of this kind of tactic has ended.So when these supposedly neutral organizations weigh in on issues that involve Google, you should take their advocacy with a grain of salt. In the coming months, privacy legislation put forward by Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, and modifications to the Safe Harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act advocated by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, will come before Congress. Google does not want either of these laws to pass, and you can be sure that papers from major think tanks will be part of the policy discussion.Perhaps more important, the discussion that is beginning to take place on both sides of the political aisle on whether companies like Google and Amazon are too big will continue.

{"Headline": "In the Berkshires, Musicals With Ambitions Not Always Realized", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookGentlemen don\u2019t wear straw hats anymore. Even if they did, there\u2019s no straw-hat circuit to wear them to.That ecosystem of semiprofessional summer theaters, where a star might drop by for a week to perform his or her latest hit on simple sets in a converted barn, has long since gone the way of Ma Bell and three-network TV.A few survivors, though, have evolved into the modern summer theaters that dot the Berkshires and its foothills today. If the work these theaters produce is often more ambitious, the quality is still erratic, from strictly amateur to Broadway-ready. That is especially evident in musicals, which demand greater resources than did old-fashioned stock productions of \u201cArsenic and Old Lace.\u201d\u201cCompany,\u201d which runs through Sept. 10, is in some ways the least ambitious of the three, and also the most successful. By least ambitious, I don\u2019t mean the material itself, with its Stephen Sondheim score and George Furth book; the original production in 1970 was a musical theater game-changer that remains, with its impenetrable main character and abstract action, a difficult piece to pull off.I mean that despite a skilled New York cast led by the glossy Aaron Tveit, Barrington\u2019s \u201cCompany,\u201d directed by Julianne Boyd, is neither a Broadway tryout nor an attempt to reinvent the wheel. From the \u201970s satire inherent in its pungent costumes to the gorgeous singing of the entire cast, it has evidently been packaged as pure entertainment.How well that approach represents the ambivalence at the show\u2019s core is another matter. Bobby (Mr. Tveit) is a 35-year-old singleton at the height of the sexual revolution; he insists he is enjoying his freedom but his \u201cgood and crazy\u201d friends \u2014 five married couples \u2014 think he is just afraid of commitment. The action consists mostly of Bobby\u2019s watching those couples bicker, and drawing what conclusions he can from the way they make up.Time has not made the plot less problematic. A 35-year-old in 1970 apparently was more middle-aged than he is today; as played by Mr. Tveit, who is 33, there is no sense that Bobby is late to the marriage gate. And later revisions made by Mr. Furth to foreclose on the possibility that Bobby is gay now seem counterproductive. His denial comes across as more of a devious dodge than his silence ever did.The good news is that Mr. Sondheim\u2019s score remains thrillingly incisive, dramatizing every issue in its path. Problems of interpretation tend to dissolve when the songs are sung and played as well as they are here, not only by Mr. Tveit but also by Nora Schell as an earthy Marta (\u201cAnother Hundred People\u201d) and by Ellen Harvey as a furious Joanne (\u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch\u201d). If the result feels like a highlights reel, there are far worse things a musical can be.One of those is \u201cA Legendary Romance,\u201d which ended its run at Williamstown on Sunday. Timothy Prager\u2019s tortuous book tries to tell the story of a 1950s movie director (Jeff McCarthy) whose affair with his leading lady (Lora Lee Gayer) becomes the subject of a film noir in 1984. The two time periods, as well as complications involving contracts, false identities and the Communist blacklist, defeat the director Lonny Price\u2019s efforts at making the story coherent.Not that coherence would be a boon; there\u2019s no reason for this show. Still, the small cast \u2014 also including Roe Hartrampf as, well, I can\u2019t really explain it \u2014 sings Geoff Morrow\u2019s turgid Andrew Lloyd Webber-like songs at thrilling throttle. And Ms. Gayer\u2019s many costumes, designed by Tracy Christensen, are spectacular, telling a million little stories that the actual story fails to.Until recently the playhouse followed a modified straw-hat formula. (Last season included a couple of weeks of Karen Ziemba in \u201cGypsy.\u201d) In January, though, its board hired a young New York producer named Johnson Henshaw to shake things up as artistic director. Mr. Henshaw wanted to create \u201ca downtown theater in the country,\u201d he told me recently. He also wanted to provide the opportunity for promising early-career directors to get their hands dirty with real productions of material they loved.But it wasn\u2019t the familiar product. Setting out to see how far the 1957 war horse could go toward examining hucksterism and otherness in an America we might recognize today, Ms. Green eliminated the straw hats, parasols and other signifiers of 1912. A unit set in the form of wooden bleachers, painted to resemble a faded United States flag in the style of Jasper Johns, replaced the quaint Iowa locales; the blue field in the upper left became a screen for video content commenting on or illustrating the action. Wells Fargo packages now bore the familiar Amazon logo. Women played some roles written for men and, perhaps most significantly, the librarian, Marian Paroo, was played by Elizabeth Thomas, a black actor. Naturally, her mother and brother were cast with black actors as well.Last Tuesday, Music Theater International contacted the playhouse, threatening to shut down the production if it did not perform the show as the license specifically requires. The theater maintains that this was not only a reference to the period and setting but also to the race of the Paroos, an interpretation that Matt Boethin, director of North American professional licensing for the company, denied. \u201cM.T.I.\u2019s correspondence with the Sharon Playhouse,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cnever included any reference to the gender or race of the characters in their production.\u201dIndeed, when I saw the show on Thursday, the cut songs were shakily sung and the Paroos were still black. But the Amazon boxes and the flag set remained. There was nothing salacious anywhere \u2014 nor, Mr. Henshaw asserts, had there ever been.To my eye, the experimentation was worth it. This was the most amusing and thought-provoking version of \u201cThe Music Man\u201d I had seen in ages, often unpretentious despite its pretensions, cleverly costumed and full of new ideas. Some of those ideas made no sense with the story; others, like the color-conscious casting, enhanced it. The book already touches, albeit lightly, on the questions of class and ethnicity that a black Marian underlines.Which is not to say this unpolished \u201cMusic Man\u201d would work in New York; it wasn\u2019t meant to. Only three performers, all in supporting roles, were members of Actors\u2019 Equity. The singing and orchestral playing were patchy, the pacing lurchy. In that sense it was a throwback to the straw-hat ideal, which opened the door for all sorts of audiences \u2014 and all sorts of ideas. Playwrights and their estates would do well to keep that in mind when bearing down on the respectful rethinking of works they control. Even war horses die if they\u2019re not exercised. And we\u2019re not in 1957, let alone 1912, anymore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OpenTable Began a Revolution. Now It\u2019s a Power Under Siege.", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost 20 years ago, a new company came on the scene promising to revolutionize the tedious and often frustrating chore of securing a restaurant reservation.No more waiting on the phone and pleading with snooty receptionists. With just a few clicks of a mouse, a diner could secure a table at prime times in the hottest dining spots. Who you were or knew would no longer matter. Restaurants would benefit, too, handing off the job of juggling tables and recording reservations in a bulky book.The company was called OpenTable, and, since its genesis in 1998, it has come to dominate the field it created. Today, it says it seats more than 23 million diners a month in 43,000 restaurants across the globe.And for all the diners they do seat, neither OpenTable nor its competitors have yet loosened the telephone\u2019s grip on reservations, roughly two-thirds of which are still made by phone, according to Yelp, which once partnered with OpenTable and is now a rival.\u201cEveryone is fighting to win over the handful of top restaurants in each market \u2014 and then what?\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a former chief executive of OpenTable who is now a venture capitalist. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the endgame.\u201dConsumers continue to have fundamental gripes about these services: chiefly, that they offer few or no tables during the peak dining hours. They make it difficult to book tables for large or odd-numbered parties, which is why diners like Jeff Day, a marketing executive in Austin, Tex., keeps no reservation apps on his phone.\u201cMy default way to make reservations is still to call,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess because my desire to speak to a human transcends the need to just make a reservation.\u201dReserve has managed to attract those restaurants because, like many of other new reservation services, it is paying more attention to meeting their needs. After all, the restaurants are paying monthly fees for the service.But winning over restaurateurs, many of whom have accumulated a long list of gripes against what they perceive as cookie-cutter approach to their reservation woes, is still a challenge.\u201cThese kinds of technologies have been a boon for the diner,\u201d said David Barber, an owner of Blue Hill in New York City and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s delivered this great efficiency to the restaurant business is kind of a myth, especially for fine-dining restaurants.\u201dOpenTable is not just standing by as others invade its turf. While it has been slow to move in the past, last spring it upgraded its flagship GuestCenter package for restaurant managers, improving its ability to handle large parties and better juggle servers\u2019 shifts, among other things.Restaurateurs can now see what\u2019s happening with their reservations in real time and even on their Apple Watch. And OpenTable offers consumers points that can earn benefits like access to special wine tastings or menus at various OpenTable restaurants.\u201cCompetition for our business is not new,\u201d said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing. \u201cIt makes us faster and more innovative.\u201dLeslie Cafferty, a Priceline spokeswoman, said OpenTable is profitable and bigger than it was then. She said Priceline had bought the company based on a strategic plan that was in place at the time but has since changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some changes in leadership in OpenTable and in the Priceline Group,\u201d Ms. Cafferty said. \u201cWhen we got caught up and looked at where OpenTable was, it was basically different than when we bought it.\u201dHighly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.Resy, now used by roughly 1,000 restaurants in 80 cities across the country, has seated more than 25 million diners since its inception, and the number of meals served to those using its system quadrupled in the year that ended in May, Mr. Leventhal said.\u201cIn fine dining, you have the cost of business going up, the notion of fine dining evolving rapidly, a lot of restaurants being forced to rethink their formats and business models,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to make sure every table is working for you, and restaurants are finally embracing technology that can help them do that.\u201dMany restaurants that use Resy, for instance, require diners making a reservation to enter a credit-card number, in an effort to discourage no-shows and cancellations; about 1 percent require a down payment. Resy follows up to remind diners when a reservation they made is imminent.Users can also put themselves on a waiting list at some restaurants, which makes it much easier to ensure that all tables will be filled, since most cancellations happen within 24 hours before the reservation time. As a result, Resy says, it has brought no-shows down to under 4 percent on average; the usual rate is as much as 15 percent, the company said.Perhaps the company\u2019s biggest coup, though, was winning over Union Square Cafe when that perennially popular New York restaurant reopened in December. Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, was on the OpenTable board for almost two decades and one of its best ambassadors.In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Meyer was working to open his second restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, he tried starting a similar system himself. He didn\u2019t even think about using it to allow customers to make reservations online; rather, it was to be an answer to a perennial problem.\u201cI was tired of this recurring problem we had in the restaurant, where people would always be yelling up and down the stairs, saying, \u2018Who\u2019s got the reservation book?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cOne time a fraternity brother of mine pulled a prank and took the book out of the restaurant entirely \u2014 it was not a nice prank.\u201dSo when he opened Eleven Madison Park in 1998, OpenTable was taking the reservations. When Blue Smoke opened in 2002, the only way to make a reservation was via OpenTable; a phone line was discontinued. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAn online blog called Daily Candy announced that step and within hours, we had filled the entire restaurant for a month.\u201dBut OpenTable had its limitations. Until recently, for instance, it would not link the reservation systems at the Union Square group\u2019s restaurants. A free-spending diner who patronized Union Square Cafe for years could show up at Gramercy Tavern for the first time, and the host would not know him.Mr. Meyer said that, to some extent, OpenTable had been criticized unfairly. After all, it still seats far more diners in restaurants like his than any other service, and serves all the Union Square group restaurants except Union Square Cafe and the new Martina, which doesn\u2019t take reservations. Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthe latest round of assaults from start-ups looking to eat their lunch is more than they\u2019ve ever faced before.\u201dThe rivals have easily identified OpenTable\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: the fees it charges restaurants every time someone books a table using its system. For reservations made on OpenTable, the restaurant pays $1 for each diner. Even if reservations are made on the restaurant\u2019s website, OpenTable charges 25 cents a diner. And if they don\u2019t show up, the restaurant recoups none of those fees, several restaurateurs said. (OpenTable, however, says it charges fees only for guests who do show up.)That galled Anjan Mitra, proprietor of Dosa, a popular Indian restaurant with locations in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif. Many of his diners are repeat customers, he said, coming two or three times a month and using OpenTable to make reservations.\u201cI don\u2019t mind paying OpenTable for new customers, but OpenTable was charging me for customers I already had and knew well,\u201d Mr. Mitra said.He said he paid as much as $50,000 to OpenTable in fees on top of the $295 a month for use of its technology. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t know this,\u201d Mr. Mitra said. \u201cThey just love the convenience, and I understand that.\u201dYelp says more than 4,000 restaurants now use its service for reservations. The company doesn\u2019t need to attract marquee dining spots to entice users, who are already coming to it for reviews, giving it a major advantage.Yelp Reservations charges a restaurant $249 a month, and, in exchange, a reservations option is added to the top of its page on the Yelp app and website. \u201cMany people planning to make a reservation for dinner are already opening Yelp to figure out where they want to go, and now they can see whether there\u2019s a table waiting for them or not,\u201d said Vishwas Prabhakara, the general manager of Yelp Reservations.He said the flat-monthly-fee model used by most of the new reservation services helped discourage a restaurant practice that infuriates customers: holding back tables during prime hours. Some restaurants do that because they know they can fill the tables on their own at those times, and they like to seat valuable guests who show up at the last minute.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to hold tables back because you\u2019re not having to pay for each reservation,\u201d Mr. Prabhakara said.\u201cPeople in the restaurant business have moved from fear of change to a recognition that OpenTable was built in 1998,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really kept up innovation-wise, and part of that is because of the architecture of their technology.\u201dHe said that, until this summer, OpenTable gave restaurants only \u201cone blank box on the screen\u201d to enter a wide range of information on a diner \u2014 such as dietary restrictions, preferred nights of the week and wines ordered \u2014 instead of separate fields that made it easy to see if a customer, say, has lactose intolerance.\u201cNot to be creepy, but instantaneous and easy-to-read customer data is the best way we have to give the customer the best service,\u201d Mr. Kokonas said. \u201cIt lets us know that the last time you were here, you finished with a special spiced tea that you liked, and we can make that happen again and easily.\u201dMr. Jampol of OpenTable said that his company also compiles piles of similar data on customers that restaurants could use \u2014 but that they rarely want it. \u201cRestaurateurs have a lot of things to keep track of every day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as much as they say they want data, they\u2019re often too busy to dive into it.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Kokonas and others see an opportunity to do it better. Tock, which was co-founded by Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google engineer, spent roughly two years building its system, testing different components with restaurants and getting feedback. It is web-based rather than app-based, because that makes it easier for restaurants to log in and configure Tock to their needs.Other new reservation services are also looking to please restaurants. Reserve has adopted an \u201copen data model\u201d that allows its restaurants to see what diners are looking for, and, since it tweaked it service in May, it is adding more than 100 restaurants a month (for a total of 850), said Peter Esmond, its vice president for customer success.Say a potential customer is seeking a table for four at 7:30 p.m., and a restaurant is showing nothing available at that time. If it has a table available then that it has held back, it can quickly add it to its Reserve page in an effort to attract the booking.Thus, more control over how reservations are made is put in the hands of restaurants, rather than the reservation app.At Blue Hill, Reserve worked with Mr. Barber to tailor its product to his needs. And that, Mr. Barber said, is why a monolithic reservation titan like OpenTable may be a thing of the past.\u201cTrying to build ubiquitous software that will meet all the needs of high-, middle- and low-priced restaurants and make consumers happy, that\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a baseline product that comes close to what OpenTable does and then allows some customization, that\u2019s what the restaurant business wants \u2014 and then customers will really start to see the benefit of these things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Messy, Confusing Future of TV? It\u2019s Here", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf you\u2019re like me and the millions of other Americans who have canceled a cable television subscription over the past few years, you\u2019re probably familiar with the phenomenon I\u2019ve started calling \u201cthe hunt.\u201dIt goes like this: First, you decide to watch one of your favorite shows \u2014 HGTV\u2019s \u201cFixer Upper,\u201d in my case. You plop down on your couch, turn on your TV and boot up your streaming device. Then you shuffle from app to app, trying to remember which of your half-dozen streaming services has the program. Was it Netflix? Hmm, no. HBO Go? Nope. Hulu Plus? It has the first three seasons, which you\u2019ve already seen, but not the fourth.You finally find the fourth season on Amazon, but it\u2019s not included free with Prime Video. It costs $2.99 per episode. The hunt ends with a whimper: You sigh, suck it up (those kitchens aren\u2019t going to renovate themselves), and fork over $19.99 for the entire season.What happened to the glorious, consumer-friendly future of TV? We were told that the internet would usher in a golden era of streaming video, and that incredible shows and movies would be a click away through low-cost, easy-to-use services. The $100-a-month Time Warner cable packages that required navigating a byzantine menu of third-rate channels would be a distant nightmare.Instead, we\u2019ve rushed headlong into a hyper-fragmented mess, with a jumble of on-demand services that, added up, cost more and often offer less than the old cable bundle. There are lots of great shows and movies being made, but finding them has become harder than ever.I felt another twinge of cable nostalgia last week, when both Disney and Facebook \u2014 very different companies, but united in their desire for your attention \u2014 announced big steps in their next-generation video strategies.A day later, Facebook announced Watch, a tab inside the main Facebook app that will soon host a slate of professionally produced video series. The company says people will be able to enjoy premium fare like \u201cReturning the Favor,\u201d starring the \u201cDirty Jobs\u201d host Mike Rowe; a reality show about tiny houses; and \u201cBae or Bail,\u201d which Facebook describes thusly: \u201cUnsuspecting couples put their relationship and wits to the test as they\u2019re thrown into terrifying scenarios.\u201dDisney, which has built an enormously profitable business that includes movie ticket sales and cable revenue from ESPN, is betting that a significant number of customers will pay $10 or $20 a month to watch \u201cFrozen\u201d and keep up with their NBA teams, above and beyond what they\u2019re already shelling out for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime subscriptions.On the other hand, Facebook \u2014 which makes its money from advertising \u2014 is giving its shows away free. Their theory is that the more time Facebook users spend watching video, the more ads they\u2019ll see. Facebook doesn\u2019t have a huge library of popular content like Disney, but it does have a treasure trove of data about the personal tastes and preferences of its more than two billion registered users, and presumably plans to use that data to target ads at exactly the people companies want to reach.More than $70 billion per year is spent on traditional television advertisements, and as that pile of money shifts to digital video, Facebook presumably wants to make sure a hefty chunk ends up in its own pockets. It also very likely wants to replace YouTube as the home for amateur creators who might not produce professional-quality shows, but still have large and loyal audiences.On the surface, these seem like very different strategies \u2014 selling premium video to an existing audience of fans, versus giving away premium video in an effort to sell hyper-targeted ads and attract a network of amateurs. But they\u2019re both part of the same seismic change. As the decline of traditional TV creates a gold rush for ad dollars and consumer attention, every tech and media company seems to be heading to the mine, pickax in hand.Consumers, meanwhile, are forced to contend with (and often pay for) an ever-expanding group of services. There are already Netflix and Hulu, single-company services like CBS All Access, and \u201cskinny bundles\u201d such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV, not to mention the endless amateur video available from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\u201cOne of the barriers to entry for the consumer right now is simply confusion,\u201d said Paul Verna, the principal video analyst at eMarketer, a media research firm. \u201cThe more of these services that are out there, the harder it\u2019s going to get for people to make rational, informed decisions about what to subscribe to.\u201dNumbers like these have created an industrywide panic and set off dozens of efforts to replace the revenue seeping out of the old cable model. Disney\u2019s streaming service won\u2019t be the last of its kind; pretty soon, you\u2019ll be forced to choose from an overwhelming menu of streaming apps and services, each of which will have its own price tag, interface and ever-changing libraries of shows and movies.An enterprising entrepreneur might someday be tempted to package some of these new services and sell them for a single price, essentially remaking the old cable bundle for the internet. But industry experts say that such cooperation between the industry\u2019s giants is unlikely, given the enormous sums at stake.\u201cThere\u2019s no chance of that happening,\u201d said Dan Rayburn, who analyzes streaming media for Frost & Sullivan. \u201cCompanies will do what\u2019s best for their bottom line.\u201dThe post-TV world \u201cwill not be orderly or neat,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, a marketing technology company. \u201cNo one is sitting back and saying, \u2018What\u2019s the perfect way the consumer wants to come at this?\u2019 Everyone is arming up.\u201dIn other words, the hunt will only get harder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fidget Spinner and the Fall of the Well-Managed Fad", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyA fad changed Osborne\u2019s life, much for the better, shortly after she opened her original toy store, named Wonder Works, in the 1990s. In those early days, Osborne tried selling board games and science kits, but she was struggling to find customers. Then, in 1994, a family visiting from Chicago walked through her doors and asked if she had any Beanie Babies.Osborne had never even heard of them. But almost immediately, she started hearing about nothing else. Later that week, someone called asking if she had Quackers the Duck. The next day someone inquired about Happy the Hippo. Osborne quickly learned that Beanie Babies were stuffed animals that, truth be told, weren\u2019t all that distinguishable from other stuffed animals. But for some reason, they had become playground must-haves. \u2018\u2018And that\u2019s when I knew,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me, \u2018\u2018if we could just get our hands on Beanies, it would be our ticket.\u2019\u2019Talking to her suppliers, Osborne eventually figured out that Beanie Babies were made by Ty, a company in Westmont, Ill. Ty didn\u2019t actually manufacture Beanie Babies \u2014 that was outsourced to China \u2014 but it did everything else. The previous year, Ty\u2019s executives began an extensive campaign to identify the nation\u2019s most influential specialty gift and toy stores. Then, rather than advertise Beanie Babies to the public, executives quietly distributed small numbers of them to these retailers, often extracting a promise they would not sell more than a few Beanies to any single customer.Ty fiercely controlled retailers\u2019 inventory of Beanies based on a complicated formula that was updated with each day\u2019s sales and trends. If a store degraded the Beanie brand by discounting the toy or employing unfriendly salespeople, Ty would cut them off. As particular animals \u2014 like Peanut the Elephant \u2014 became popular, Ty ceased manufacturing them altogether. When Wal-Mart and Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us asked to carry Beanie Babies, Ty refused.Osborne was accustomed to toy manufacturers begging her to carry their products in her store. With Beanie Babies, everything was reversed. Osborne tracked down a Ty sales rep named Joyce and pleaded with her. \u2018\u2018I started in with the charm,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me. \u2018\u2018I would telephone nearly every afternoon and tell her we would do anything to get some stock.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, Joyce relented, and Wonder Works began earning thousands of dollars a week from Beanie Baby sales.But as the months passed and the women continued talking, Joyce began asking for favors of her own. Ty\u2019s executives wanted to know Osborne\u2019s opinion on her customers\u2019 tastes. Did they respond to primary colors? To sparkly bows? Why was Manny the Manatee so popular, but Darling the Dog a bust? Based on such conversations with Osborne and countless other toy-store owners, Ty\u2019s executives made hundreds of tiny shifts in their manufacturing, marketing and distribution over the years, turning what began as a fad into a perennial best-seller, one that earned hundreds of millions of dollars each year and helped Ty employ thousands of people. As for Osborne, she used her Beanie profits to expand Wonder Works to four locations. Today, more than two decades later, Beanie Boos, one of Ty\u2019s latest iterations, are still among her top-grossing items.For fidget spinners, as Osborne well knew, no one was going to manage the buzz, strategize about inventory and plan marketing the way Ty had for Beanie Babies. \u2018\u2018Now, in less than half a year, spinners are done,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m moving on to squishies\u2019\u2019 \u2014 squishable toys that are also (questionably) marketed as attention aids. \u2018\u2018I think they\u2019ll last at least a few months.\u2019\u2019Within economics, this transition to direct selling \u2014 of cutting out sales reps like Joyce in lieu of websites like DHgate.com \u2014 is known as disintermediation, and it\u2019s one of the defining characteristics of the internet age. Companies like Uber, Amazon and Priceline have succeeded by disintermediating enormous industries (taxi dispatchers, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel agents). The logic of disintermediation seems self-evident: By putting factories directly in contact with stores, by helping customers order directly from manufacturers, by letting riders coordinate with drivers, you cut out a needless source of waste and inefficiency. Middlemen (and middlewomen), so this theory goes, have simply been gobbling a slice of the pie they never really deserved.In reality, though, all these middlemen were often crucial to ensuring that the pie was baked at all. As Osborne learned when she started selling Beanie Babies, middlemen like Joyce are often the ones who turn a fad into a sustainable business that creates jobs. You might think a company\u2019s main function is to make stuff. But that\u2019s usually wrong. Making stuff is often the easiest part of what a company does. It\u2019s everything else \u2014 marketing and defending intellectual property, coming up with distribution strategies and knowing when to stop manufacturing Peanut the Elephant \u2014 that\u2019s the hard part. That\u2019s what middlemen do.Or, at least, it\u2019s what they did, before the digital economy made their jobs disappear. Take, for instance, the travel industry: As Youcheng Wang of the University of Central Florida notes, the industry as we know it was built, over decades, by hundreds of thousands of middlemen at travel agencies, tour operators, hotels and airline bucket shops. \u2018\u2018There were layers of jobs and experts,\u2019\u2019 Wang says. \u2018\u2018They convinced people to visit new places and helped resorts find new customers.\u2019\u2019 Today, however, many of those jobs and experts are gone, replaced by disintermediators like Trip\u00adAdvisor (3,000 employees) and Priceline (18,500 employees), which are built on what middlemen created, but which employ far fewer people. And the impact of losing all those jobs will have ripple effects that we can\u2019t even predict. Who, in the absence of those middlemen, is today persuading travelers to dream bigger about their vacations, to open their wallets to support off-the-beaten-track destinations, to help new hotels find their clienteles? \u2018\u2018Without intermediaries,\u2019\u2019 Wang points out, \u2018\u2018it can be difficult to get discovered.\u2019\u2019It was a fun idea, retailers said. It could probably help fidget spinners make the transition from a fad into a sustainable product. If it worked, it would create jobs and help toy stores prosper. But Osborne and others cautioned Zing against making the investment. It would take at least six months to design and manufacture the new item, and by then, the fidget spinner craze would most likely be over. So Zing shelved the idea \u2014 and the new hiring it would have triggered.\u2018\u2018Now a fad is just a fad,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018And that makes things harder for all of us.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anna Netrebko Storms Salzburg, Classical Music\u2019s Summit", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALZBURG, Austria \u2014 The curtain had just come down on Anna Netrebko\u2019s highly anticipated debut as Verdi\u2019s Aida here earlier this month. But her next performance was already beginning.As the elegant Salzburg Festival audience filed out of the theater \u2014 the men in black tie and traditional Austrian jackets, the women in long gowns and dirndls \u2014 Ms. Netrebko was upstairs in her dressing room, changing out of her black wig, costume and makeup. When she emerged, she was blond and in a gala-ready black dress, and she made her way through a narrow hallway packed with well-wishers, managers, record company executives and fellow singers.Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was waiting by the stage door to praise her performance as \u201cperfection.\u201d Ms. Netrebko paused to sign some autographs and pose for a few pictures and then left for the opening-night party in a nearby Baroque palace where Mozart, born just a few blocks away, once performed.It was perhaps the grandest night of the summer at the grand Salzburg Festival, the Davos of classical music, which is known for attracting not just leading artists but also impresarios, managers, agents, recording-industry honchos, television and streaming executives, and journalists (more than 600 this year) to this small, picturesque city on the edge of the Alps. The hometown that Mozart once left behind to seek out the broader musical world becomes the epicenter of the classical music world each summer. But it is a world that is going through major changes.Impresarios still throng the festival, but these days they are checking out stars and also stagings \u2014 which are increasingly co-productions, shared among several opera companies. That is why Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, could be found here at what he calls his \u201cSalzburg office\u201d \u2014 a corner table at the Goldener Hirsch hotel \u2014 having lunch with the artist William Kentridge, whose haunting production of Berg\u2019s \u201cWozzeck\u201d will come to the Met in a couple of years. Co-productions allow companies to pool costs; Mr. Gelb said that they also allow stagings to be fine-tuned before they reach New York. (Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s \u201cThe Exterminating Angel,\u201d which had its premiere here last summer, arrives at the Met this fall.)The recording industry is still a presence, but not like it used to be, when Salzburg was synonymous with thriving classical labels. Mr. Muti recalled that when he first came here in the early 1970s, posters of stars \u2014 especially those of the conductor Herbert von Karajan, a native son who reigned over the festival for decades \u2014 looked out from shop windows all over town.\u201cThe first year I was here, I felt almost naked, because there was no picture of me,\u201d Mr. Muti said. \u201cThen there were many pictures, and I felt I had made a career.\u201dThings began to change when the iconoclast Gerard Mortier succeeded Karajan in the early 1990s and battled the recording industry, concerned that its commercial goals were polluting the festival\u2019s artistic aims. Now the industry is back, but much weaker, buffeted by waves of disruptions: the move from CDs to downloads, and from downloads to streaming.The disc is not entirely dead, though. The next day, when the piano virtuoso Daniil Trifonov played an intimate concert at the same gallery to promote his new release, \u201cChopin Evocations,\u201d a representative of Ludwig Beck, a Munich department store with a large, well-stocked CD section, was in the audience. But so was Jonathan Gruber, the head of classical for Apple Music.The delivery systems keep changing, but there continues to be an appetite for new recordings, broadcasts and streams. While he was here, Mr. Gelb met with label executives, but also with Herbert Kloiber, the chairman of the media company Tele M\u00fcnchen, which distributes the Met\u2019s Live in HD cinema simulcasts in Germany and Austria, its biggest market outside the United States.\u201cThey\u2019ve already sold 120,000 tickets in advance for the coming season,\u201d Mr. Gelb said. And festival officials said that their telecast of \u201cAida\u201d \u2014 \u201cPrima Anna\u201d was the headline on the cover of the local newspaper\u2019s television supplement \u2014 was on track to reach over a million European homes.\u201cWe were brainstorming,\u201d Mr. Nelsons said afterward. He recalled his first trip to Salzburg as a teenager \u2014 on a long bus trip from his native Latvia while singing in an early-music group founded by his mother. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to see the concerts,\u201d he recalled, saying they had visited museums and the homes of composers instead. \u201cWe brought sandwiches from Riga.\u201dMs. Netrebko has also come a long way since her first time here, when she was a Flower Maiden in a 1998 production of \u201cParsifal,\u201d starring Mr. Domingo. Her breakthrough came in 2002, as Donna Anna in Mozart\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni,\u201d and she has been a major draw ever since. (According to festival lore, some of her sold-out performances were in such demand that desperate opera buffs were known to send blank checks to the box office.)Then it was time to film promotional videos for the album \u2014 one for Amazon and one for Apple Music, in Russian. Ms. Netrebko cast a practiced eye at the video setup and offered a suggestion. \u201cRule number one: for opera singers the camera has to be higher,\u201d she told the cameraman with the assurance of a cinematographer. \u201cI\u2019m very experienced.\u201dWhen it was done, Mr. Eyvazov prepared to leave for Vienna to sort out some visa issues ahead of his coming international engagements, and Ms. Netrebko took a stroll through Salzburg, where some surprised tourists stopped photographing \u201cSound of Music\u201d locales and others dropped their bosnas \u2014 popular local curried-sausage sandwiches \u2014 and began snapping pictures of her.At a farmer\u2019s market she bought some mushrooms and blueberries and, after trying a plum, surreptitiously handed one to a reporter. \u201cI\u2019m stealing these!\u201d she said jokingly before paying Nina Allerberger, who ran the stand and who told her several times that she had seen and loved \u201cAida,\u201d adding that it had been so beautiful it had given her chills.Then Ms. Netrebko was off to Triangel, the bustling cafe across from the festival\u2019s theaters, where she sneaked up behind the owner, Franz Gensbichler, and covered his eyes with her hands. \u201cAnna?\u201d he asked. (A dish of pasta with truffles there is named for her, and a steak dish is named for her husband.) She booked a table for the weekend and then, as a large crowd formed, decided to leave.She ran into one of her former frequent co-stars, the tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, who is appearing in Handel\u2019s \u201cAriodante\u201d with Cecilia Bartoli, on the street as she left.\u201cHere, in this city, in this time,\u201d Ms. Netrebko said of the Salzburg swirl, \u201cit\u2019s crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was still reveling in Trump\u2019s upset win two nights later, over a bottle of wine on the patio of the Four Seasons in Georgetown, when a chocolate Lab padded over to his table to sniff his crotch. Stryk and the dog\u2019s owner got to talking about wine and cigars and finally, like most of the country, about Trump. It turned out that she worked for New Zealand\u2019s Embassy in Washington. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister still hadn\u2019t connected with the new president-elect, she told Stryk \u2014 a diplomatic and political embarrassment. Stryk cocked an eye across the table. \u2018\u2018What if I said I could get you the number of someone to call the president?\u2019\u2019 he asked her.The following afternoon, Stryk found himself in a cab, headed for a meeting with New Zealand\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser. Stryk was more than a little nervous. On the way over, he called a friend named Stuart Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran Trump\u2019s field operation during the Republican primary and spent election night with Stryk at Morton\u2019s. Jolly reached out to someone he knew in the Trump high command and delivered a cell number, but Stryk didn\u2019t know if it would actually work. At the embassy, Groser invited him in, uncorked a bottle of pinot noir and called the prime minister to pass along the number. A week later, President-elect Trump was finally able to accept a congratulatory phone call. But even before the call went through, plans and possibilities were blooming in Stryk\u2019s mind. \u2018\u2018I said to myself: \u2018This could be very, very interesting,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he told me when I first met him this spring. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The world\u2019s going to change.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Stryk, who grew up in Arizona, had bounced around the minor leagues of politics for most of his adult life. At 41, he has the frenetic energy of a serial entrepreneur and the motley r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to match. After dropping out of college to intern on Capitol Hill, Stryk wrote voter-contact scripts for a Republican P.R. firm, helped start a political job-listing website and eventually opened his own Beltway lobbying shop, Sonoran Policy Group. The firm almost collapsed in 2009, after Stryk tried to acquire a troubled Maryland-based security-guard business. Stryk decamped to California, owing thousands of dollars in back rent, and reinvented S.P.G. as a procurement and political-consulting business. He traded tequila shots with the California congressman Dana Rohrabacher, ran for mayor of a town in Napa Valley, handled P.R. for an arms dealer accused of smuggling weapons to Libya \u2014 the case was dropped last fall \u2014 and helped clients sell the government everything from flashlights to missile-guidance software. By the time he hooked up with the Trump campaign, Stryk had hustled his way to a good living, and he knew his way around Washington. But he was no one\u2019s idea of a Beltway insider.When the phone call to Trump went through, Stryk saw the geography of a new world forming before his eyes. Interests that spent millions of dollars studying Washington and shaping it to their liking had been taken totally by surprise by Trump\u2019s win. The rules had changed, and no one was sure what the new ones were. For Stryk, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for. As he saw it, the lobbying old guard \u2014 the guys that threw down black Amex cards at Joe\u2019s Crab and sent fat quarterly bills to clients they barely did any work for \u2014 were on the defensive. New people would have a chance. People like Stryk.New Zealand was a prime example. Groser and his staff had spent months researching Hillary Clinton, calculating who among her vast claque would win positions of power and influence in her administration. The main thing they knew about Trump was that he had sworn to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the complex 12-nation trade deal that Groser helped negotiate. Stryk, offering to work free, had a proposal. New Zealand would throw the biggest party of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Stryk would put the new administration\u2019s leading lights in the room; Groser would do the rest. \u2018\u2018It was about building brand recognition for New Zealand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk explained. \u2018\u2018If we can get them there, then forever, bad or good, Trump and New Zealand are a co-brand.\u2019\u2019In the tumult following Trump\u2019s win, Stryk was discovering that many of his old friends \u2014 most of them fellow Washington backbenchers, B-listers and understudies \u2014 had vaulted to positions of unexpected influence. A guy Stryk knew at the inaugural committee put out the word among Trump alums that New Zealand\u2019s party was the week\u2019s hot ticket. Stryk called a friend at Salem Media, the right-leaning media-and-talk-radio company, which signed on as a party sponsor. Another friend, the actor Jon Voight, agreed to attend as a special celebrity guest.Groser decided to hire Stryk full time. Not long after, Stryk pulled $250,000 out of his savings, moved his family to the Washington suburbs and started hiring.Over the decades, lobbying has evolved from a niche trade of fixers and gatekeepers to a sleek, vertically integrated, $3-billion-a-year industry. A good lobbyist doesn\u2019t go into a meeting asking for legislation; she or he already has the bill drafted, a coalition of businesses and trade groups poised to support it, a policy brief to hand out to reporters and to the officials positioned at dozens of decision points throughout the bureaucracy and relationships with advertising and polling firms to manage the public rollout. Everyone has a lobbyist \u2014 or three, or 50 \u2014 and the lobbyists know everyone. K Street is majestic and immovable, veined through Washington like fat through a prime steak.Like virtually every other candidate for president, Trump campaigned against this thicket of money and influence, positioning himself as an outsider who would \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 This pledge would soon prove more rhetorical than real, but it contained a grain of truth. Trump arrived in Washington with a relatively short baggage train of Beltway relationships and obligations. He didn\u2019t read policy briefs; he barely had policies. His inner circle was a hodgepodge of Breitbart alumni, nominally Democratic financiers, Trump Organization employees on loan, the odd reality-show star and Republicans who would have been unemployable in almost any other administration. The smart money in Washington \u2014 K Street and K Street\u2019s clients, the big corporations and trade associations \u2014 didn\u2019t quite know what to expect. But mostly, they didn\u2019t know whom to call.\u2018\u2018Many companies want to understand: What are the president\u2019s priorities?\u2019\u2019 Corey Lewandowski told me in February, a few weeks after the inauguration. \u2018\u2018But there are so few people in Washington who have a relationship or an understanding of him.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski, the president\u2019s former campaign manager, was happy to tell you that he was one of the few exceptions.Lewandowski\u2019s journey from obscure New Hampshire political operative to celebrity power broker was emblematic of how Trump\u2019s election scrambled Washington\u2019s hierarchies. Much like Stryk, Lewandowski had spent years in the lower ranks of conservative politics and lobbying. Being hired as Trump\u2019s campaign manager moved Lewandowski into the political big time, and being fired, midway through the race, did little to dislodge him. There were speaking gigs, a stint as a reliably pro-Trump pundit on CNN. At one point last year, Lewandowski even tried selling a book, tentatively titled \u2018\u2018Let Trump Be Trump\u2019\u2019; Stryk, introduced to Lewandowski by a mutual friend, helped him shop the proposal. \u2018\u2018Corey had a brand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me, and that brand was valuable. HarperCollins offered Lewandowski $1.2 million, an astounding figure for a campaign manager \u2014 though the deal evaporated when Lewandowski refused to show HarperCollins a copy of his nondisclosure agreement with Trump.Through it all, Lewandowski remained close to Trump and spoke to him often. But after the election, the White House job Lewandowski hoped for never quite materialized. Now Lewandowski, too, was on K Street. He had joined up with another former Trump aide, Barry Bennett, to start a lobbying firm called Avenue Strategies.Unlike other people on K Street, Lewandowski did not pretend to be an expert on the legislative calendar or the fine points of the Administrative Procedure Act. He was an expert on Trump. \u2018\u2018There are just so few people in Washington who know the president,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski told me in February. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a comparative advantage.\u2019\u2019 He was not shy about playing up their friendship. He sometimes tweeted from the White House grounds. When journalists or other visitors came to his office, on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House, he would point out his window to where, he claimed, he could see the president\u2019s bedroom.His mind-meld with Trump was what made him valuable to clients, Lewandowski explained to me. \u2018\u2018I think what I bring is a level of understanding of the president\u2019s thought process,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018only because I had the privilege of being next to him for so long.\u2019\u2019 He was doing as many as nine or 10 meetings a day: Chief executives, prominent Republicans, even other lobbying firms wanted his advice. He offered it freely, Lewandowski told me. He wanted to be helpful. \u2018\u2018You know what a guy said to me the other day?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You\u2019ve got a hot hand. Just remember, that hand\u2019s not going to be hot forever.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019One good source of business was the president\u2019s habit of calling chief executives to the White House for televised meetings. In January, when the chief executive of Whirlpool was summoned by Trump to discuss how to revive American jobs, the company asked Avenue Strategies to advise it. As one lobbyist who shared clients with Lewandowski put it to me, companies like Whirlpool needed to know the lay of the land inside the White House: How much sway did Wilbur Ross have? Was Steve Bannon for real? And what should the company do if Trump started dumping on it on Twitter?Everyone had seen what happened to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed, the federal government\u2019s single biggest contractor, is a powerful presence inside the Beltway. But through the winter, Trump had lashed out at the company over cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet. The company\u2019s shares dropped each time, taking Lockheed\u2019s value down by billions of dollars. These were the kinds of problems that Lewandowski believed others on K Street couldn\u2019t help with. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re a corporate C.E.O. and the president has tweeted at you and your stock has dropped 4 percent, you say: \u2018Why am I paying all these guys so much money?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said. The old model of Washington influence wouldn\u2019t work on Trump, he believed. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t know him, and they don\u2019t know any of his guys, and they don\u2019t understand how he thinks.\u2019\u2019 Eventually Lockheed, too, turned to Avenue.Over the course of a few conversations with the company\u2019s Washington office, Bennett told me, they advised Lockheed on how Marillyn Hewson, its president and chief executive, should approach conversations: \u2018\u2018Short, direct, honest answers,\u2019\u2019 as Bennett recounted it for me later. \u2018\u2018Feel free to educate the president. In the end, it\u2019s going to be transactional.\u2019\u2019 The next time Hewson met with Trump, a week before the inauguration, she came bearing gifts: a potential F-35 price cut and a promise to add jobs at a Texas plant.The Twitter attacks ceased. By the end of February, Trump was praising Lockheed. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve just announced eighteen hundred new jobs,\u2019\u2019 Trump told reporters after a meeting with Hewson and other manufacturing executives. \u2018\u2018I have to say this, Marillyn, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit because what you did was the right thing.\u2019\u2019The demand was so great that would-be Trump-whisperers were popping up in Washington like toadstools after a rainstorm. The former Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, a \u2018\u2018senior adviser\u2019\u2019 to the lobbying practice at Dentons, the world\u2019s largest law firm, was hawking a book titled \u2018\u2018Understanding Trump.\u2019\u2019 Established K Street firms were grabbing any Trump people they could find: Jim Murphy, Trump\u2019s former political director, joined the lobbying giant BakerHostetler, while another firm, Fidelis Government Relations, struck up a partnership with Bill Smith, Mike Pence\u2019s former chief of staff. All told, close to 20 ex-aides of Trump, friends and hangers-on had made their way into Washington\u2019s influence business.Beltway experience was not necessarily required. Squire Patton Boggs formed a \u2018\u2018strategic alliance\u2019\u2019 with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s self-described \u2018\u2018personal attorney\u2019\u2019 from New York, who had scant government experience. There was also Brad Gerstman, a brawny Long Island lobbyist and P.R. man who had done work for Trump in New York over the years. On election night, Gerstman was so sure Trump was going to lose that he got on a plane to Israel. As Gerstman tells it, his business partner called as soon as he landed. \u2018\u2018Why the hell are you in Tel Aviv?\u2019\u2019 his partner asked. \u2018\u2018We have an office to open in Washington.\u2019\u2019 Gerstman hung up and went to his hotel, where he looked out over the Mediterranean, put a cigar in his mouth and listened to the congratulatory messages piled up in his voice mail. In January, he set up an office in downtown Washington. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t want to sell ourselves as just the Trump guys,\u2019\u2019 Gerstman told me. \u2018\u2018But maybe that\u2019s what it takes for the first few years.\u2019\u2019Many of the Trump-connected lobbyists told me they were turning away as much business as they accepted. One person offered Lewan\u00addowski $250,000 just to get the president to tweet about him. A lobbyist who worked on Trump\u2019s inaugural committee told me of a billionaire who, within a week of the inauguration, offered a million dollars if the lobbyist could arrange for his picture to be taken in the Oval Office with the new president. \u2018\u2018You can make $2 million if you want,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me, sounding almost apologetic. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gold mine in Eastern Europe.\u2019 Or: \u2018My client is suing the I.R.S. \u2014 can you help?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Not all of the new arrivals affected to be part of a revolution. One day this spring, I met with Brian Ballard, a veteran Florida lobbyist and top-tier Republican fund-raiser. Ballard had recently opened an office in Washington just a few blocks from the new Trump International Hotel. He had known Trump since the 1980s, and he later started lobbying regulators and state officials on behalf of Trump\u2019s golf courses and his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, but he was practical about the realities of politics. Like most of Florida\u2019s Republican old guard, he started the 2016 campaign backing the state\u2019s former governor, Jeb Bush, before switching to the state\u2019s junior senator, Marco Rubio. Once it became clear that Trump would lead the Republican ticket, Ballard enthusiastically joined the campaign as Trump\u2019s Florida finance chairman.Ballard, who is 56, had a ruddy Florida tan that marked him as new in town, and the serene confidence of a man who saw no way he could lose. At his office, an attractive receptionist led us into a spotless conference room. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not an expert in Washington, D.C.,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me when we sat down. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m an expert in lobbying.\u2019\u2019 In Florida, Ballard had a blue-chip list of corporate clients: Google, pharmaceutical companies, Big Sugar. His business plan was simple: to sign up his Florida clients for Trump-related advice in Washington. \u2018\u2018When I was on the campaign, they didn\u2019t want to pitch in,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of his clients. \u2018\u2018And now they say: \u2018How do I figure out what is going on here?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019By the end of his first 100 days in office, it seemed, Trump had not so much drained the swamp as enshrouded it with a billowing fog of uncertainty. No previous president had changed his mind more often, or contradicted his cabinet so frequently, or permitted such vicious ideological combat under his White House roof. Many clients just wanted to know what they could safely ignore. \u2018\u2018White Houses are always somewhat opaque places of fascination, where you don\u2019t quite know who is up and who is down, or how decisions are ultimately reached,\u2019\u2019 said Bruce P. Mehlman, a prominent Republican lobbyist who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u2018\u2018The added complexity here was there was not a single consistent governing philosophy. It was not clear if the president saw trade the way that Gary Cohn sees it or the way Steve Bannon sees it.\u2019\u2019Moreover, some of the usual paths through the bog were now closed. Hundreds of senior administration jobs were going unfilled, as Trump\u2019s cabinet secretaries battled with his inner circle over potential hires from among the Republican regulars in Washington. One lobbyist at a well-regarded firm with numerous financial clients told me that his problem was less that he didn\u2019t know whom to call than that there was no one to call: Infighting and vetting problems had stymied so many appointments at the Treasury Department that many of the offices were empty.All of this had inadvertently created an entirely new business model for Trump\u2019s friends and former employees. In normal times, K Street did much of its business on Capitol Hill, where the churn of legislation offered unending opportunity to deliver goodies for clients. But the power vacuum in Trump\u2019s cabinet agencies, and the inexperience of his West Wing staff, seemed to offer a different kind of opening. It was easy to imagine that a single phone call, coming from the right person, could redirect a major policy initiative. Some of the old firms would do O.K., Lewandowski thought \u2014 the ones that had relationships in Congress, that understood the intricate ballet of lawmaking. But the real action, he was betting, would be at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018I think this particular administration is really going to be driving the agenda,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Not Congress.\u2019\u2019On a balmy spring day in April, I met Stryk and a few of his colleagues on a terrace at the Army-Navy Country Club, a sprawling and immaculate golf club near the Pentagon; S.P.G. still didn\u2019t have a proper office. Stryk wore cowboy boots and a T-shirt under a rumpled black sport coat. Most of K Street, he told me, was \u2018\u2018a washing machine. Money just goes from one firm to another. No one creates any new wealth.\u2019\u2019 Stryk\u2019s own politics leaned libertarian, he told me; despite his firm\u2019s ties to the Trump team, he didn\u2019t think of himself as particularly Trumpy. One of the new hires, a Democratic foreign-policy veteran, had been good friends with Paul Wellstone, the liberal senator who died in 2002. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re here for the opportunities,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Not for the ideology.\u2019\u2019Stryk was focusing not on nervous companies but on nervous countries. He and his new team had made a list of the governments S.P.G. wanted to work for \u2014 NATO allies mostly, nothing iffy like Ukraine or Pakistan \u2014 and with New Zealand as his calling card, they pitched S.P.G. as the go-to foreign lobbying and advisory firm in Trump\u2019s Washington. Historically, foreign lobbying has been a specialized business dominated by a few big firms. Stryk viewed them as he viewed the rest of the lobbying industry: as a cartel ripe for disruption. Stryk pitched his clients policy expertise, round-the-clock work habits and personalized service.Stryk believed his team could penetrate the uncertainty surrounding the White House. He wanted to be a \u2018\u2018calming resource for foreign countries and businesses,\u2019\u2019 he told me \u2014 and there was a lot of calming to do. Over the course of a few months, the new president had managed to start a trade war with Canada, picked a fight with the prime minister of Australia and hinted that the United States might need to pull out of NATO. He also wanted to slash the State Department budget, and through the spring and summer, many senior jobs at State would remain unfilled. Everyone, even close allies, was looking for Sherpas and back doors. R. Nicholas Burns, the veteran American diplomat, told me that Trump\u2019s denuded State Department had left diplomats from perhaps a hundred countries \u2014 most of them smaller nations \u2014 without their traditional liaison to the United States government. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s never been anything like this, ever,\u2019\u2019 Burns said.Trump\u2019s statecraft had a way of generating new business in other ways, too. The president of the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, was not a popular figure in Barack Obama\u2019s Washington: A right-wing populist who preached closer ties to Russia, he once banned the United States ambassador from Prague Castle, the Czech seat of government. Trump, naturally, invited him to Washington, and Zeman\u2019s government hired Stryk\u2019s firm to help plan the state visit. New Zealand needed to talk to the administration about a new bilateral trade agreement, now that Trump was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Korean trade association wanted help planning a conference in Washington but didn\u2019t know anyone in the Trump White House. Stryk\u2019s people got on the phone, cold-calling around the Commerce Department to find a senior official who would speak at the event. \u2018\u2018Most lobbyists are afraid of a \u2018no,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018A \u2018no\u2019 means you have no juice. I\u2019m not afraid of \u2018no.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019But Stryk\u2019s greatest coup was Saudi Arabia. Gulf-state oligarchs spend tens of millions of dollars a year lobbying in Washington and larding influential think tanks with grant money, and Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest spenders. The country\u2019s then-crown prince and minister of the interior, Mohammed bin Nayef, was an exception: He enjoyed deep ties to the American intelligence apparatus under President Obama and had never needed a lobbyist. This spring, however, Trump invited Nayef\u2019s chief rival \u2014 Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and the king\u2019s son \u2014 to a formal White House lunch. The lunch sent ripples through Riyadh. Did Trump favor Salman? Accidentally or on purpose, Trump had just waded into Saudi Arabia\u2019s treacherous succession politics. Nayef found himself in need of guidance.In May, S.P.G. signed a contract to provide \u2018\u2018congressional and executive branch brand engagement\u2019\u2019 to the Saudi Ministry of the Interior \u2014 Nayef\u2019s domain. Stryk did not want to reveal much about his work for the Saudis, but lobbying records show that the fee was $5.4 million, payable up front.That was the other thing about foreign lobbying: It paid even better than corporate lobbying. Inevitably, Stryk had competition.Basha was the young chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, the country\u2019s conservative party, which was looking to unseat the ruling Socialist Party in elections scheduled for June. Basha borrowed liberally from Trump\u2019s playbook; he had attacked the Socialists for being in bed with crime syndicates and, simultaneously, with George Soros, whose foundation was active in Albania. His slogan was \u2018\u2018Make Albania Great Again.\u2019\u2019 Now, according to Bennett, Basha wanted help beating the Socialists in June \u2014 and who better to advise him than a couple of Trump-campaign veterans? Bennett told me that it was a cordial meeting and that he later sent Basha a proposed contract. \u2018\u2018I told him we\u2019d love to be his political consultant,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said. (Through a representative, Basha declined to comment.)Through an intermediary, the Albanian Democrats also reached out to Ballard, who was making his own push into foreign lobbying. He had brought on board a couple of partners with experience in Eastern Europe and Latin America, including a former Democratic congressman and a former ambassador. \u2018\u2018They called me,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of Basha\u2019s party. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t know Albania in an atlas.\u2019\u2019 Ballard told them he couldn\u2019t help them. He was already working with the Albanian Socialists.When a friend referred the Socialists to him, Ballard told me, he had two questions. \u2018\u2018I asked: \u2018Is it a democracy?\u2019 Yes. \u2018Are they an ally of the U.S.?\u2019 Yes.\u2019\u2019 The Socialists had a story that was becoming increasingly familiar in Washington. After Trump won, most of the American diplomats their government had worked with seemed to vanish, and no one replaced them. One Albanian official, who asked not to be identified by name, told me his government felt that \u2018\u2018we had to increase our presence in Washington.\u2019\u2019 I asked him how his government picked Ballard. \u2018\u2018The internet makes it easy,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018You just Google.\u2019\u2019But as companies and countries vied for Trump\u2019s ear over the spring, the new Trump lobbyists found themselves competing with one another as much as with the established Washington firms. Ballard, for example, had explored working for members of the Venezuelan opposition. (\u2018\u2018I\u2019m no world-peace guy,\u2019\u2019 he told me, \u2018\u2018but I think I can help a little bit.\u2019\u2019) Lewan\u00addowski\u2019s firm, meanwhile, was pitching Citgo, the American subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company. (Avenue eventually signed Citgo, and in August the Trump administration would partly exempt the company from a new round of sanctions on the Venezuelan government.) Ballard was also working out a $1.5 million contract with Turkey \u2014 which put him up against Brad Gerstman, Trump\u2019s old New York guy. Gerstman\u2019s firm, Gotham Government Relations, had signed up a company linked to Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom the Turkish government blames for fomenting last year\u2019s failed coup.Not many lobbyists wanted to represent the Gulenists, partly because Trump appeared to have already picked a side. When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey won a widely disputed referendum in April granting himself expanded powers, Trump called to congratulate him. When Erdogan visited the White House some weeks later, Trump praised the bravery of Turkish soldiers and talked about beating ISIS together.I watched Erdogan and Trump\u2019s joint news conference on TV with Gerst\u00adman, who had been hired to spread the word about Erdogan\u2019s worldwide oppression of Gulenists. When Erdogan referred to the Gulen \u2018\u2018terrorist organization,\u2019\u2019 you could see Trump purse his lips during the translation, then nod a few times. It wasn\u2019t totally clear what the president was nodding about. Gerstman remained hopeful. \u2018\u2018Our view is that six months from now, everything is going to look different,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s fluid. It\u2019s dynamic.\u2019\u2019 He looked thoughtful. \u2018\u2018One thing we know about President Trump is he\u2019s not afraid to change.\u2019\u2019Stryk was having his own qualms. Lewandowski had beaten him on some pitches, Stryk was told by prospective clients, by promising that he could get Trump on the phone \u2014 a promise Stryk felt he could not make. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t sell access to Trump,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know Donald Trump.\u2019\u2019 He was increasingly impatient with the notion that he was simply providing entree to the new administration. He was in negotiations to acquire a small design and branding firm. He saw S.P.G. evolving into something bigger and more stable, a full-service \u2018\u2018advisory\u2019\u2019 company that could compete with the most sophisticated shops on K Street \u2014 and beyond. Stryk saw Lewandowski\u2019s firm, and some of the others associated with the new administration, as short-term plays. They could sell access or surf the disruption, but he aimed to outlast it. \u2018\u2018Do they have business outside of this Trump phenomenon?\u2019\u2019 Stryk mused. \u2018\u2018The talk around town is, how long does this last before the business goes back to the establishment?\u2019\u2019Among the new arrivals, Ballard, at least, was doing pretty well. After only a few months in Washington, he had signed up more than 30 clients: energy companies, insurers, Amazon, American Airlines. The new Washington office would soon be on track to make $15 million in 2017, almost as much as his firm reported making in Florida last year. Ballard, unlike some of his competitors, was at ease in the swamp. He didn\u2019t want to beat the Washington establishment; he was here to join it. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no big firm that should worry about us,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me. \u2018\u2018We augment other people, or they augment us. The Trump guys are not going to take over the town.\u2019\u2019If anything, the Trump guys were learning the downsides of proximity to the president. By spring, the Justice Department had appointed a special counsel to probe Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an investigation that would quickly reach into the president\u2019s inner circle. The various White House factions seemed to spend as much time planting negative press on one another as they did figuring out what the president should do. When the White House got involved in big legislative battles, like the Obamacare repeal effort, it tended to hurt, not help.Proximity was proving an especially mixed blessing for Lewandowski. A stream of news stories had detailed promises he was supposedly making to clients, which he mostly denied \u2014 not just phone calls with Trump but also visits with White House officials and even access to Trump\u2019s Twitter account. In late April, Politico reported that Lewan\u00addowski and Bennett also owned another, separate company called Washington East West Political Strategies. This new firm, a vehicle for overseas consulting, had circulated at least one written proposal promising to arrange meetings with Trump and other administration officials, seeming to undercut Lewandowski\u2019s earlier denials. I later obtained a copy of the proposal, which named the potential client: Edi Rama, Albania\u2019s Socialist prime minister. The new firm \u2014 or as Bennett later explained, a business associate in Europe, acting without authorization \u2014 had pitched opposing candidates in the same campaign.Official Washington professed itself to be aghast at Lewandowski, who did not bother to couch his sales pitches in the Beltway\u2019s customary euphemisms: He was what they pretended not to be. Ethics watchdogs cast him as living proof of the hollowness of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski disagreed. In his view, the swamp was the sprawling, unresponsive bureaucracy, not the people you paid to help you get your phone calls returned. Still, friends of Lewandowski\u2019s told me that White House officials had advised him to keep a lower profile.By that point, it was hard to know exactly how well Avenue was doing. As the summer recess drew near, the firm had disclosed fewer than 10 lobbying clients. Among them were a San Diego-based environmental consulting firm and an Ohio payday lender \u2014 valuable clients, but not quite blue-chip. For every Whirlpool that asked Lewandowski for help, his rivals told me, there was another big company that decided he was too radioactive. Lockheed never actually signed a contract with Avenue; when news leaked of Lewandowski\u2019s role in advising it on Trump, a Lockheed spokesman issued a carefully worded statement that \u2018\u2018Lockheed has not retained Lewandowski, or his lobbying firm.\u2019\u2019 In the same way that most big chief executives turned up their noses at Trump during the campaign but now hoped he would deliver tax reform and sweeping deregulation, they wanted Lewandowski\u2019s help without being too closely associated with him.Then, too, Lewandowski\u2019s clout wasn\u2019t always what he promised. Puerto Rico\u2019s government, for example, hired Avenue to help ease the island\u2019s fiscal crisis. But the job pitted Lewandow\u00adski against a coalition of hedge funds that owned much of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, and whose former lobbyist Trump had installed on his National Economic Council. The swamp\u2019s old guard prevailed: In late April, as Puerto Rican officials were begging Congress for more federal funding, Trump publicly dismissed their cause in his trademark fashion. \u2018\u2018Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars,\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2018\u2018Sad!\u2019\u2019In a sense, Lewandowski\u2019s biggest problem was the president himself. Lewandowski had bet that the White House would be the center of energy and action in Trump\u2019s Washington, but instead the Trump administration was being swallowed by its own chaos. Divided by factions and backbiting, unable to wield full control of the bureaucracy or execute on many of its own ambitions, the administration was in danger of becoming a minor player in the policy debates of the day. Many companies were coming to the conclusion that on complex issues like tax reform, their energies were better directed at lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2014 and their money better spent at the traditional lobbying firms stocked with ex-lawmakers and their former aides.Moreover, despite Trump\u2019s campaign pledges, many of the agencies he now oversaw had proved more than friendly to the legions of longtime Beltway lobbyists working for the energy, telecommunications and other industries. In many cases, Trump had hired them outright: By the summer, he had appointed more than 100 lobbyists to jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Federal Communications Commission and elsewhere. Their old clients didn\u2019t need much help from the new Trump guys on K Street. They already knew exactly whom to call.Perhaps that\u2019s why the traditional lobbying shops were doing just fine. As for protecting clients from Trump\u2019s Twitter howitzer \u2014 well, that had turned out to be easier than it looked, several lobbyists told me: Just show up in person, promise the president you\u2019ll create some jobs and publicly give him the credit. \u2018\u2018You make it about Trump and you link it to jobs, and you could be Russia or China and he will support you,\u2019\u2019 one told me. \u2018\u2018It is that unsophisticated.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There it is,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said, a little halfheartedly, pointing out the window. His day had not gotten off to a great start. That morning, Puerto Rico had filed for a territorial version of bankruptcy. A prominent watchdog group had sent a letter to the Justice Department asking officials there to investigate why Lewandowski had never registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a World War II-era law that imposes stringent disclosure requirements on Americans representing foreign governments in Washington. (Though Bennett and other Avenue employees had registered as lobbyists, Lewandowski insisted that most of his business was advising clients on strategy, not setting up meetings or contacting officials on their behalf, the kind of work that requires you to register.) Politico had struck again, revealing Avenue\u2019s Citgo contract. Technically, the United States-based company was owned by the left-wing government of Venezuela, whose vice president the Trump administration had accused of drug trafficking.Lewandowski told me he didn\u2019t work directly for foreign governments, notwithstanding the stories and documents. Not that he wouldn\u2019t be good at it \u2014 you know, if he wanted to. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t work for foreign governments, but if I were a foreign government, and I wanted to hire people who understood how to get to the president, there are a small number of people I would think of,\u2019\u2019 Lewan\u00addowski said. As he spoke, he seemed to recover his familiar brio. \u2018\u2018The establishment is so afraid of President Trump they will do anything. Which includes hiring individuals who have purported to be tied to the White House who really aren\u2019t.\u2019\u2019The next day, Lewandowski announced he was quitting Avenue. In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg, he explained that Bennett and their employees had been using his name to drum up business he didn\u2019t want, exposing him to criticism and sullying his reputation. He insisted he had never asked Trump for anything. \u2018\u2018People want to see me fail,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski grumbled.\u2018\u2018I feel bad for Corey,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me when I went to see him the following week. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But he\u2019s a lightning rod.\u2019\u2019 Bob Dole, he pointed out, had just signed a $500,000 contract for work on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a violence-racked country run by a kleptocratic strongman. But no one in Washington gave Bob Dole a hard time.\u2018\u2018He thought he could go in\u2019\u2019 \u2014 into the White House \u2014 \u2018\u2018during the second wave,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said of Lewandowski. K Street was just a way station for him, Bennett suggested, while he waited for the only job he truly wanted \u2014 the one he could picture when he gazed out his window, down Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018Looking back on it, he probably should never have owned a chunk of a lobbying firm. In the media\u2019s mind, every client we had was Corey\u2019s client.\u2019\u2019 But even with Lewandowski gone, Bennett said, there was plenty of work. \u2018\u2018All of K Street is doing well right now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Chaos is good for everyone\u2019s business.\u2019\u2019Not long ago, Stryk opened a proper Washington office, right in Georgetown, a stone\u2019s throw from the Four Seasons. The new space was undecorated and unmarked, and there wasn\u2019t much there yet but a couple of laptops. But Stryk was buoyant. He was about to sign two more big foreign lobbying clients, the governments of Afghanistan and Kenya, along with a pharmaceutical firm. Saudi Arabia had canceled its S.P.G. contract after Stryk\u2019s client, the crown prince, was deposed in a palace reshuffle, and New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry had decided that its embassy no longer needed Stryk\u2019s services. But in Stryk\u2019s view, these were just hiccups. Competitors around town \u2014 big firms that had never given him the time of day \u2014 were starting to ask around about S.P.G., wondering who they were and how they were getting so much business.In about a month, Trump\u2019s ham-handed defense of white nationalists and white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville would prompt most of the chief executives serving on White House advisory councils to quit in protest. It would cost the chief executives something, losing their face time with this impressionable, transactional president \u2014 and their loss would be K Street\u2019s gain. Those same companies would now just rely more on their lobbyists, or on the trade associations they belonged to, to drive their agendas.But as we sat down in his new conference room, Stryk was already looking beyond the Beltway. He saw Trump\u2019s disruption spreading beyond Washington, to foreign capitals and overseas markets. The chaos in Trump\u2019s government was creating a vacuum abroad, one that entrepreneurs like Stryk could fill with deal-making and private diplomacy. \u2018\u2018I want to grow a business that\u2019s 200 million a year,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to get that arranging dinners in Washington.\u2019\u2019The new contracts with Afghanistan and Kenya, Stryk explained, were prototypes for the kind of business he wanted to do, an escape from the washing machine. The Afghans and the Kenyans didn\u2019t just want help with the Trump administration. They wanted help with everything: attracting American investment, troubleshooting problems in other foreign capitals, finding companies that could build them roads or manage their health care records.So recently, Stryk had begun pitching investors on a new venture: a $5 billion private-equity fund that would specialize in infrastructure and procurement. One side of the business, the lobbying, would identify government customers abroad; the other side would invest in companies that could deliver what those governments needed. Secure voting systems, border-security hardware \u2014 the opportunities were limitless. \u2018\u2018It is our job, as conservatives and capitalists, to take the chaos and do with it what we can,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Our goal is to take an environment that was created by the president and use it to \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused for a second, thinking. \u2018\u2018To do some good.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

But the Amazon series takes a different tack, setting aside the \u201cWhat if the South had won?\u201d trope.In the back story of \u201cBlack America,\u201d the Confederacy was defeated. But instead of enduring the painful eras of Reconstruction and Jim Crow, African-Americans received reparations. The former slaves and freedmen claimed Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, a nation known as New Colonia.That nation has a \u201ctumultuous and sometimes violent relationship\u201d with the United States, which is described as both an ally and a foe.The series picks up in the current day, when New Colonia and the United States have enjoyed two decades of peace, but the new nation is growing rapidly while the old one declines.\u201cIt was something that was personally intriguing for me as a black American,\u201d Mr. Packer told Deadline. \u201cYou would be hard pressed to find many black Americans who have not thought about the concept of reparation, what would happen if reparations were actually given. As a content creator, the fact that that is something that has been discussed thoroughly throughout various demographics of people in this country but yet never been explored to my knowledge in any real way in long-form content, I thought it was a tremendous opportunity to delve into the story, to do it right.\u201dBut he addressed HBO\u2019s show in his Deadline interview, saying \u201cthe fact that there is the contemplation of contemporary slavery makes it something that I would not be a part of producing nor consuming.\u201dHe added, \u201cSlavery is far too real and far too painful, and we still see the manifestations of it today as a country for me to ever view that as a form of entertainment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Never-Ending Superheroes: Here Come the Defenders and the Tick", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is the story of two piles of rubble.Both of these shows, adapted from comic books, represent the fruition of yearslong efforts to bring them to the screen, and are the beneficiaries of a seemingly insatiable appetite for superhero stories \u2014 in movies, on network and cable television and on streaming services.But beneath the similarities, the two shows possess very different ambitions. \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d which brings together the main characters of four previous Netflix series in a single super team, is trying to inject some levity into a Marvel formula that has become increasingly serious and overly familiar.Meanwhile, \u201cThe Tick\u201d is fundamentally a satire, one that pokes fun at the conventions of comic-book narratives and the many media spinoffs they\u2019ve spawned.But in its latest incarnation, \u201cThe Tick\u201d \u2014 which is coming to TV for the third time \u2014 is also trying to see how much of the gravity in modern comic-book adaptations it can incorporate without losing its sense of humor.\u201cTo do a superhero comedy now and make it worth its salt, it had to matter to itself,\u201d said Ben Edlund, the creator of \u201cThe Tick.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively mattering to ourselves, and I recommend it.\u201dAll set in a version of New York where its characters cross paths, do battle and (occasionally) have sex with each other, these shows have been rolled out at a breakneck pace since Marvel and Netflix announced them in 2013.Each has its own creative team and varying narrative tones: For example, \u201cDaredevil,\u201d now approaching its third season, is a neo-noir about a blind lawyer turned costumed vigilante; while \u201cJessica Jones,\u201d heading into its second season, has offered a rugged redemption story about a private investigator haunted by past trauma.\u201cBringing these characters together into one world is going to require a dramatic shift from all of their individual shows,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cThat has made this show feel very different.\u201dAround the no-frills set of \u201cThe Defenders\u201d in early March, its actors teased and toyed with one another; like their characters, they have bonded from their past encounters and the ad hoc circumstances of this reunion.Crammed together in a small production office adjoining their set, Ms. Ritter and Mr. Colter spent a shooting break bantering about each other\u2019s dietary habits.\u201cMike always has some commentary on whatever we\u2019re eating,\u201d Ms. Ritter said. \u201c\u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to eat a banana? That\u2019s how you get belly fat.\u2019\u201dRight on cue, Mr. Colter replied, \u201cSplit one with a pal if you\u2019re going to have one.\u201dThat good-natured mockery is a welcome respite from a relentless work schedule. Mr. Jones, still damp with sweat from a fight scene he\u2019d just shot, described how in 2016 he finished shooting \u201cIron Fist\u201d and, within hours, was onstage at New York Comic Con to introduce \u201cThe Defenders.\u201d\u201cWe started filming at 5 p.m. and didn\u2019t finish until 10 a.m. the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cOn two hours\u2019 sleep, I\u2019m watching myself on a stage, trying to process what this last six months has all been about.\u201dMr. Jones added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do movie-quality storytelling on a television time-frame and budget. Everyone\u2019s slammed around the clock, all the time.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. Edlund wondered if the time was right to bring back \u201cThe Tick.\u201d\u201cPeople can\u2019t turn around anywhere without seeing 12 superhero dramas,\u201d said Mr. Edlund, a slender, longhaired man who described himself as possessing \u201cthe proportions of a bike.\u201dThe enduring obsession with comic-book characters, he said, \u201cis a perfect prey for our comedy.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou want to be able to laugh at what is, essentially, a sky made gray with a surplus of capes and boots.\u201dEven so, Mr. Edlund said this version of \u201cThe Tick\u201d actually takes the underlying mythologies of other superhero shows quite seriously. It\u2019s a reflection of the stark seriousness he sees in other narratives, and an element that distinguishes the Amazon series from earlier incarnations of \u201cThe Tick.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re utterly hypocritical, putting forward our own very earnest hero myth, as if we\u2019re completely oblivious idiots,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the meta-level of nonsense that we can be accused of.\u201dThe new live-action series is as much about its title character (played by Peter Serafinowicz) as it is about his sidekick, Arthur, who was essentially comic relief in the earlier shows.Arthur (Griffin Newman) is now a young man who, as a child, saw his favorite superhero team and his father killed in a sinister scheme hatched by a criminal called the Terror (Jackie Earle Haley).Years later, Arthur is still disturbed by these events and preoccupied by a paranoid certainty that the Terror remains at large. Then the Tick comes into his life, urging him to accept his destiny as a righted of wrongs, which makes Arthur even more skeptical of his own sanity.Mr. Serafinowicz, a British comic actor (\u201cSpy,\u201d \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d), said that the show operates in a space \u201cwhere superheroes and supervillains exist, and everyone plays it for real.\u201dSpeaking from his trailer, where his Tick costume hung nearby like a peeled-off layer of skin, Mr. Serafinowicz described his characters as \u201cthis big, blue lunatic.\u201d\u201cWhen he appears,\u201d he said, \u201ceven the superheroes in this real world are looking at him like, who the hell is this?\u201dIf \u201cThe Tick\u201d can get away with this blend of solemnity inherent in Arthur\u2019s story and silliness provided by its title character, it will be, in part, because the comic-book tropes it plays on are now ubiquitous.Growing up a lonely comic-book fan, Mr. Newman said, \u201cIf someone else said they liked Spider-Man, that was a beacon \u2014 \u2018We have to talk about this.\u2019\u201dThe precise details of superhero origin stories, he said, \u201cused to be things that a random person stopped on the street wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Now, Mr. Newman said, \u201cEverybody knows Batman\u2019s parents get killed. Whatever.\u201dFor the stars of \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d a sense of duty comes with their roles \u2014 to portray their characters in ways consistent with decades of comic-book continuity and multiple seasons of their own shows.Mr. Cox recalled an early draft of a \u201cDefenders\u201d script where his character, Matt Murdock, was supposed to say that a day didn\u2019t go by where he didn\u2019t wish for his sight to return. But after remembering a scene in a Daredevil comic where the hero says he has no regrets about his blindness, Mr. Cox asked for the line to be changed.\u201cI question myself less now when I feel strongly about something,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff I care about.\u201dOn \u201cThe Tick,\u201d Mr. Edlund said there was honor, too, in taking inspiration from the monolithic media companies responsible for the most popular superhero characters, but telling his own stories on the fringes of the mainstream.His show, he explained, is \u201ca totally autonomous universe that can borrow from DC or Marvel all it wants, all day, and has the right to be stupid-funny.\u201cIt\u2019s true that DC and Marvel are the McDonald\u2019s and Burger King in our world. But there\u2019s also room for Jack in the Box.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon-Whole Foods Deal Clears Last Two Major Hurdles", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon\u2019s bid to become a bigger player in the grocery business took a major step forward Wednesday, as federal antitrust regulators approved the internet company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Market.And earlier in the day, Whole Foods shareholders voted to approve the $13.4 billion deal, which will give Amazon a major bricks-and-mortar presence with more than 460 stores in a huge retail category where success has eluded the company.\u201cBased on our investigation we have decided not to pursue this matter further,\u201d Bruce Hoffman, the acting director of the F.T.C.\u2019s bureau of competition, said in the statement. \u201cOf course, the F.T.C. always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.\u201dThe agency\u2019s approval removed the last major hurdle to the deal\u2019s closing. Antitrust lawyers had not expected the acquisition to be blocked by regulators, largely because Amazon and Whole Foods are not major competitors today.Amazon has run an internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but it accounts for less than a 2 percent share of total grocery spending in the United States, according to estimates by Cowen & Company, a stock research firm.Amazon has said the deal is expected to close this year, and on Wednesday the company did not change that prediction.Despite its prominence as a purveyor of high-end groceries, Whole Foods is also a relatively small player in the overall grocery market. The food and beverage portion of the grocery business is one of the largest categories of consumer spending, totaling more than $800 billion a year, with more than $450 billion in additional spending on personal care, pet and other consumable products, according to Cowen.Combined, Cowen estimates Amazon and Whole Foods will be the fifth-largest grocery retailer in the country.Even if it seemed a long shot that regulators would stop the acquisition, there was still some uncertainty over the way competition regulators under the Trump administration would approach big acquisitions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Review: Apple\u2019s Self-Driving Shift", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsWhole Foods owns or leases more than 400 retail locations throughout the United States, each of which sits on anywhere from 25,000 to 50,000 square feet of land. That\u2019s a lot of space. Imagine, as many have said, that Amazon decides to parcel off a piece of each store as a holding zone for Amazon packages or perhaps instant Prime deliveries.One of Amazon\u2019s biggest challenges has been so-called last-mile delivery, or dropping off the item I ordered at my house. Having multiple distribution outlets in city centers could speed up local delivery times.The other thing I keep thinking about are those large kitchens in every Whole Foods. What would keep Amazon from diving into the business of delivering prepared meals, or even meal kits like the ones Blue Apron offers? The possibilities are endless.That said, the deal hasn\u2019t closed quite yet. We\u2019ll see what happens.For both companies, this sounds like a fine short-term hedge against Amazon. But they can\u2019t expect this to actually work out in the long run, can they? Amazon has more items and manages the logistics of the whole shopping process. Two companies with different interests working as one seems a bit kludgy to me.In any case, I\u2019m curious to see if this actually makes a dent. Amazon is already my default for so much of my online shopping.Building a car is hard. Building a self-driving car is even harder. And building a self-driving car from scratch, in house, when you\u2019re a tech company that has only ever built phones and computers, seems near impossible. But perhaps I\u2019m being too pessimistic.Honestly, Mike, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m yelling into a void. But really, why is Uber doing so well despite acting so badly? Do customers really just not care? Is there some danger in the numbers we aren\u2019t seeing?That, or more likely: People just don\u2019t care. Uber is incredibly convenient and works well if you\u2019ve got the money to spend on it. Why go back to waiting on yellow cabs or fighting your way onto a crowded bus if you don\u2019t have to?Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the verdict of investors in the retail sector.Among potential competitors to the e-commerce juggernaut founded by Jeff Bezos, some \u2013 including Ross Stores, Home Depot and AutoZone \u2013 may have the wherewithal to withstand Amazon. The market is conferring on them valuations commensurate with, or better than, the one accorded to Amazon.But not all chains selling stuff to consumers are equally in the path of destruction. E-commerce sales made up 9 percent, or some $111 billion, of total retail sales tallying $1.3 trillion in the second quarter, according to the United States Census Bureau. In that same time, Amazon notched $22 billion in North American revenue, suggesting there are still plenty of dollars to fight over.True, investors are betting Amazon will emerge with lots of them. They value its equity and debt at about 1.5 times projected 2020 revenue of nearly $300 billion, Thomson Reuters Eikon data show. Yet Home Depot bests Amazon at 1.8 times projected sales. That may reflect the fact that 40 percent of its online sales are picked up at more than 2,200 stores, giving it a potentially defensible mix of e-commerce and bricks and mortar.The auto-parts chain AutoZone may represent another retail slice that is somewhat resistant to Amazon. The $19 billion company trades at 1.5 times 2020 sales, a recognition that it has created a supply chain that minimizes inventory without crimping a timely ability to fulfill customer orders.Even in apparel, there are bright spots. At 1.4 times projected 2020 sales, Ross Stores, which sells reasonably priced clothing through more than 1,500 outlets, fetches an enterprise valuation close to Amazon\u2019s. TJX Companies, operator of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, lingers at 1.1 times sales. That\u2019s below Amazon but well above peers like Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s. Bargain hunting may offer some respite from online price choppers.Once he is done crushing the grocery business, Mr. Bezos may seriously set Amazon\u2019s sights on car parts, cheap clothes and home-improvement accessories. For now, though, the market is betting on a few pockets of calm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should Critics Aim to Be Open-Minded or to Pass Judgment?", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBookendsIn Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Thomas Mallon and Liesl Schillinger discuss what the best (and worst) criticism does.By Thomas MallonToday\u2019s literary reviews too often turn into participation trophies, quiet tour-guide appreciations.Mealy-mouthed may be the worst adjective one can apply to a critic, but I think the only fair answer to this question is \u201cboth.\u201d Criticism is of no use if the critic\u2019s mind isn\u2019t, at the last and however mixedly, made up. And while open-mindedness is a fine thing at the start, it should not mean that the critic comes to a book, new or old, without a set of tastes and values. In fact, a reader\u2019s awareness, accumulated over time, of that particular critic\u2019s underlying standards will help to illuminate why he felt able to conclude that something is good or bad.In an essay for Harper\u2019s Magazine in 1959, Elizabeth Hardwick worried that books were being \u201cborn into a puddle of treacle\u201d instead of the once-colder shower of scrutiny she could recall. The bedside manner that she deplored has become only more marked in the intervening decades, as the reviewing of fiction and poetry has fallen less to professional critics and more to fellow novelists and poets \u2014 colleagues who don\u2019t wish to run into those they\u2019ve disapproved of while riding the same circuit of readings and writers\u2019 conferences. Today\u2019s literary reviews too often turn into participation trophies, quiet tour-guide appreciations. Few things, of course, are duller than self-indulgent put-downs; but informed and spirited dismissals are another matter, and they remain in too-short supply.So do informed and spirited approvals. The phrase \u201ceveryone\u2019s a critic,\u201d once the complaining sigh of the creator, is today closer to being a literal truth. Criticism was always (and certainly in Arnold\u2019s time) vulnerable to careerism and hackery, but amid the pingings of Twitter and along the web pages of Goodreads and LibraryThing and Amazon, the fast one-star slash and the instant five-star burble are now given the same algorithmic weight as the lengthy and well-considered three- or four-star comment. There are, one should note, many of the latter, but they always seem about to drown in the shrill orthographical chaos surrounding them, complaints often written by those who look forward to the demise of critics \u2014 and editors \u2014 with a populist glee.Far removed from all this, and from most reality, we have academic literary criticism, now reducing literature to fodder for pseudoscientific cultural studies, taking its first duty to be the discovery of ways in which books can cause crushing personal offense. Students are fed literary theory before they\u2019ve read an appreciable number of literary texts to which those theories might be applied. It\u2019s all telescopes and no stars. Looking back on his own long critical career, in a lecture called \u201cTo Criticize the Critic\u201d (1961), T.S. Eliot took note of the theoretical concepts he had developed (\u201cdissociation of sensibility,\u201d \u201cobjective correlative\u201d), but declared that \u201cmy own theorizing has been epiphenomenal of my tastes, and . . . in so far as it is valid, it springs from direct experience of those authors who have profoundly influenced my own writing.\u201d Theories, like standards, should arise inductively; the critic has to remind himself that he exists because of the author and in service to the reader. The simplest prescription for better criticism of all kinds \u2014 electronic, journalistic, academic \u2014 remains: read more; think longer; write less.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022By Liesl SchillingerIf you\u2019re a writer known for dispensing venom, your targets grow immune to your poison.If I decide a book\u2019s appeal is a question of taste, not art (for instance, Faulkner isn\u2019t to blame if \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d leaves me cold), I ask myself what the book achieves that might fascinate readers other than myself, and explore the author\u2019s distinctive ideas, imagery and voice. It isn\u2019t easy; it\u2019s harder, in my opinion, to write an evenhanded review than a negative one \u2014 that is, one that holds the reader\u2019s attention. In his 1875 novel \u201cThe Way We Live Now,\u201d one of my favorite authors, Anthony Trollope (several generations older than Maugham and infinitely more indulgent of his fellow man), pointed out the hazard of a charitable critical approach: \u201cEulogy is invariably dull.\u201d There\u2019s a distinct line between eulogy and fairness, but every critic knows you make more of a splash when you wield a bludgeon than when you bestow a bouquet.Yet Trollope also recognized that brickbats too readily brandished lose their power to stun. If you\u2019re a writer known for dispensing venom, he explained, your targets grow immune to your poison: \u201cCensure from those who are always finding fault is regarded so much as a matter of course that it ceases to be objectionable,\u201d making the dependably whip-cracking critic a \u201ccaricaturist.\u201d Whereas an open-minded critic makes an enemy every time he or she lays down a harsh verdict: \u201cAbuse from those who occasionally praise is considered to be personally offensive.\u201dI read both the novels mentioned here in 1995, the year I started reviewing, when the responsibilities and consequences of criticism were much on my mind. A pan is the fledgling critic\u2019s calling card; and the second review I published remains the most negative I\u2019ve ever written. When the boyfriend of the author who provoked my scorn left a message defending her on my answering machine, I didn\u2019t regret my words \u2014 the book was truly vile. Still, I felt bad for her, and that phone message served to remind me, early in my critical path, of the person behind the pen. It strengthened my resolve to never censure without compelling reason \u2014 even if it meant that each of my nay votes would earn me a foe.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to be a gentleman and a writer,\u201d Ashenden says to his colleague Kear, mocking him for showing excessive delicacy in his treatment of another novelist Ashenden despises. Kear protests: \u201cYou know what the critics are. If you tell the truth they only say you\u2019re cynical.\u201d It would be easier, he claims, \u201cto be allusive and charming and rather subtle, you know the sort of thing, and tender.\u201dTenderness was not Ashenden\u2019s critical goal, or Maugham\u2019s; nor is it mine. But delicacy is not easier than condemnation; and as a fallback, I prefer it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$16 Billion Bond Sale Shows Amazon\u2019s Power to Pursue Deals", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAmazon\u2019s aggressive salesmanship now extends to its own debt.Its blowout $16 billion bond sale suggests almost unlimited potential for Amazon, the retailing juggernaut, to consider even more shopping. Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market, Jeff Bezos\u2019s company is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will, too.Mr. Bezos built his online empire by investing cash flow into the business and eschewing conventional corporate finance tools like debt and dividends. A result is a $472 billion goliath \u2014 the fifth-largest American enterprise by market capitalization \u2014 that has store owners and technology companies quaking over its ambitions.Amazon could have financed the Whole Foods deal by issuing stock with only minimal dilution of his 16.6 percent stake. But as Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk did last week, Mr. Bezos took the cheap money available in the fixed-income market. Investors submitted nearly $47 billion in bids, and the company was able to sell its paper at razor-thin margins, including a premium to comparable United States Treasury bonds of just 1.45 percentage points for $2.25 billion of 40-year bonds. A need for yield and a belief that Amazon will triumph from the retail shakeout that it is provoking created a powerful cocktail.The deal will nearly triple Amazon\u2019s outstanding debt, to slightly more than $23 billion. That is about a billion dollars less than the consensus estimate for its 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda.Given the company\u2019s cash pile, net debt will be even lower at less than $10 billion. That leaves the underleveraged Amazon with enough financial firepower to consider acquisitions that would make Whole Foods look like an appetizer.Whether that would be good for the company\u2019s stock is less clear. Belief in the Bezos vision has pushed Amazon shares up nearly 31 percent this year, and they are trading at 120 times 2018 estimated earnings as calculated by Thomson Reuters Eikon. Walmart Stores, by contrast, fetches 17.6 times earnings. As Amazon begins to more closely resemble peers in its physical footprint and its balance sheet, that gap will inevitably narrow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canadian Judge Faces Possible Discipline for Wearing Trump Cap", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Last fall, one Canadian judge was required to appear before a very rare disciplinary panel because he asked a rape complainant why she had not kept her knees together. A decade ago, another had to answer questions about changes he made to a court transcript.On Wednesday, Justice Bernd Zabel of Ontario faced a four-member disciplinary panel because he arrived in his Hamilton courtroom wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on Nov. 9 \u2014 the day after the United States election.The judge said it was meant as a joke, and a week later he apologized in his courtroom, stating that the hat was not a political statement or an endorsement of any political views, particularly not \u201cthe views and comments of Donald Trump.\u201dBut, as an indication of how pervasive American politics is in Canada and how divisive President Trump has become, that apology was not enough. More than 80 complaints from law schools, lawyers\u2019 associations and individual lawyers poured into the Ontario Judicial Council demanding that Justice Zabel be sanctioned, so public trust could be restored to the bench.Even Justice Zabel, 69, seemed to agree that in Canada, Mr. Trump\u2019s professed views are largely seen as contrary to Canada\u2019s embrace of multiculturalism and human rights. \u201cI\u2019m not a racist,\u201d he told the panel, according to Canadian media reports. \u201cI\u2019m not a bigot. I\u2019m not a misogynist.\u201dIn Canada, judges are appointed, not elected, and they are considered largely apolitical, particularly at the lower court levels.They are forbidden by law from participating in any partisan political activity, including making donations to political parties.Justice Zabel, who has sat on the bench for 27 years and presided over thousands of cases, said Tuesday that he had not voted in the American election or made any donations to the Trump campaign. He had merely ordered five iconic hats from Amazon as memorabilia and decided to wear one into his courtroom as a joke.In the courtroom on Nov. 9, he said the hat was \u201cjust in celebration of a historic night in the United States. Unprecedented.\u201d Soon after, he removed it from his head but left it on his desk.Later, once the court session was adjourned, he told a court official that the hat\u2019s \u201cbrief appearance\u201d was meant to annoy the rest of the judges because he thought they were Clinton supporters. \u201cI was the only Trump supporter up there, but that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said.By that, he explained on Wednesday before the panel, he did not mean that he supported Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas but rather that he was the rare judge in his courthouse who had predicted that Mr. Trump would win.The Canadian Association of Black Lawyers said its members would fear that Justice Zabel would judge their skin color rather than the merits of their cases.\u201cThis was an expression of opposition to the campaign rhetoric of Trump at the time and an expression of Canadian differentiation,\u201d Lorne Sossin, dean of York University\u2019s Osgoode Hall Law School. \u201cIf anything, it is more political now.\u201dJudge Zabel, a German refugee himself, said he deeply regretted his decision to wear the hat.The disciplinary panel\u2019s decision is expected in the coming weeks and could include a range of penalties, from a warning to a recommendation that Judge Zabel be removed from the bench. The Ontario Judicial Council has held only nine disciplinary panels since 1995, not including his. Of those cases, four were dismissed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gut Bacteria Can Fluctuate With the Seasons", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterIn Tanzania, not far from the Serengeti, live the Hadza, a community of about 1,300 people. For such a small group, they attract a lot of scientific attention.Many of the Hadza live solely on the animals they kill, along with honey, berries and a few other wild foods. For the first 95 percent of our species\u2019 history, there was no other way to live.So the Hadza have been closely scrutinized for clues about the hunter-gatherer way of life: how they find their food, how much energy they use \u2014 even how much sleep they get.Some bacterial species disappear entirely and then return, in a rhythm that likely reflects regular changes in the Hadza diet. Many gut bacteria that wax and wane drastically are rare in people living in industrialized societies.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a good grasp of what these seasonally varying microbes even do,\u201d said Justin Sonnenburg, a microbiologist at Stanford University and lead author of the new study.Each of us carries about 30 trillion bacteria, belonging to thousands of species. Dr. Sonnenburg hopes that by comparing the microbiomes of hunter-gatherers with those of people in different societies, scientists will be able to learn how diets influence their composition.As more societies switch to a Western diet, their microbiomes may change, altering their health. \u201cWe have to think of ourselves as these composite organisms, with microbial and human parts,\u201d Dr. Sonnenburg said.Until recently, microbiologists have mainly studied the microbiomes of people who eat a Western diet. Now they are casting a wider net.In 2013, Stephanie Schnorr, then a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, began the first study of the Hadza microbiome.At a meeting with community leaders, she and her colleagues explained their plan: to collect stool samples and study the microbes in a lab.\u201cOne of the camp\u2019s senior men said, \u2018Well, we give it to the ground, so why not just give it to her?\u2019\u201d recalled Dr. Schnorr, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oklahoma.The Hadza hosted a much greater diversity of gut microbial species than did the Italians, the researchers found, and there were some fundamental differences in species they carried. Some that were common in the Hadza were rare or missing from the Italians.The study raised many questions about what factors determined which species lived in a particular group of people.In 2013, Jeff Leach, a visiting research fellow at King\u2019s College London, began working with Tanzania\u2019s National Institute for Medical Research to collect stool samples from the Hadza four times over the course of one year.Some samples were collected during Tanzania\u2019s dry season, others during the wet season. Dr. Sonnenburg oversaw an analysis of those samples from 188 of the Hadza. In the new study, published in the journal Science, he and his colleagues reported sharp fluctuations in composition of the gut bacteria.Some species were more common in one season than the other; some simply disappeared altogether. A comparison of these samples with those taken by Dr. Schnorr confirmed the fluctuations to be a regular cycle.\u201cIn terms of the structure of the Hadza microbiome, we can say we have a fairly good grasp on that,\u201d Dr. Schnorr said. But the discovery of a seasonal cycle is new, for any human microbiome.Researchers already knew that the composition of gut bacteria can shift quickly. \u201cAn abrupt change in diet will lead to an abrupt change in the gut microbiome, on the order of a day or two,\u201d Dr. Sonnenberg said.But no one had ever documented a long-term, predictable cycle in gut species among a group of healthy people going about their daily business.Dr. Sonnenburg speculated that the diet of the Hadza dictates the composition of these bacterial communities. Throughout the year, the Hadza gather fruits from baobab trees.But in the dry season, they also dig for tubers and eat lots of meat, because it is easier to hunt for animals on a parched landscape. In the wet season, they forage for berries and harvest honey from beehives.In the new study, Dr. Sonnenburg and his colleagues also compared the Hadza microbiome with those of people in 17 other societies, including urban Americans and Yanomamo villagers in the Amazon rain forest.The Hadza microbiome is most similar to those in traditional societies, and least to the industrialized ones. The researchers found that the species that set the Hadza apart from industrial societies the most are also the ones that are the most seasonal.The families of bacterial species that swing most strongly over a year in the Hadza gut are extremely rare in developed countries. Researchers have no idea why.\u201cThat\u2019s a huge question \u2014 it\u2019s the elephant in the room,\u201d Dr. Schnorr said.The Hadza may offer clues about what the microbiome was like in other societies before diets were transformed by modern agriculture and industry. Refined sugar and other new foods, for instance, may have favored a new set of gut microbes over ones that fed on tough plant fibers.And once people began eating the same foods year-round, a loss of seasonality may have meant that some ancestral bacterial species were lost.\u201cWe\u2019re in some weird, perturbed state where many of the microbes we co-evolved with are not equipped to flourish,\u201d Dr. Sonnenburg speculated.By comparing microbiomes around the world, Dr. Sonnenburg said it might be possible to understand how gut microbes linked to industrialization are affecting people\u2019s health. He has hypothesized, for instance, that they may be causing chronic inflammation.In their new study, the researchers found that microbes in the guts of Americans make more enzymes that degrade mucins, compared with those in the Hadza. These enzymes allow bacteria to harvest carbohydrates from the mucosal lining of the gut, rather than from plant fiber.The result? \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeding your gut microbiome with dietary fiber,\u201d Dr. Sonnenburg said, \u201cyour gut microbiome is feeding on you.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the seasonal fluctuations of gut bacteria described mucins incorrectly. They are carbohydrates produced in the mucus lining of the intestines; they are not enzymes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google and Walmart Partner With Eye on Amazon", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Walmart are testing the notion that an enemy\u2019s enemy is a friend.The two companies said Google would start offering Walmart products to people who shop on Google Express, the company\u2019s online shopping mall. It\u2019s the first time the world\u2019s biggest retailer has made its products available online in the United States outside of its own website.But working together does not ensure that they will be any more successful. For most consumers, Amazon remains the primary option for online shopping. No other retailer can match the size of Amazon\u2019s inventory, the efficiency with which it moves shoppers from browsing to buying, or its many home delivery options.Walmart customers can link their accounts to Google, allowing the technology giant to learn their past shopping behavior to better predict what they want in the future. Google said that because more than 20 percent of searches conducted on smartphones these days are done by voice, it expects voice-based shopping to be not far behind.Google is a laggard in e-commerce. Since starting a shopping service in 2013, it has struggled to gather significant momentum. Initially, it offered free same-day delivery before scrapping it. It also tried delivery of groceries before abandoning that, too.If Amazon is a department store with just about everything inside, then Google Express is a shopping mall populated by different retailers. There are more than 50 retailers on Google Express, including Target and Costco. Inside Google Express, a search for \u201ctoothpaste\u201d will bring back options from about a dozen different retailers.Google said it planned to offer free delivery \u2014 as long as shoppers met store purchase minimums \u2014 on products purchased on Google Express. Google had charged customers a $95 a year membership for free delivery. Amazon runs a similar program called Amazon Prime, offering free delivery for members who pay $99 a year.In January, Walmart began offering free, two-day shipping on more than two million items \u2014 a move that takes direct aim at Amazon Prime, whose members who pay an annual fee for fast shipping and other services like movie streaming.Walmart has also been trying to integrate its digital business with its vast network of more than 4,690 stores.Many brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling with what to do with their increasingly empty stores, but Walmart is partially repurposing its stores into e-commerce fulfillment centers.Customers can now order their groceries online and then pick them up at hundreds of stores. For some items that they purchase online and pick up in a store, customers receive a discount. In-store pickup reduces shipping costs for Walmart, but offers a similar level of convenience to the shopper as home delivery.The efforts seem to be paying off. Walmart said last week that its online sales \u2014 including online grocery \u2014 increased 60 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. It was a big driver in the company\u2019s overall increase in quarterly sales.Efforts like online grocery seem to be gaining traction, but Walmart hopes the benefits of other moves \u2014 like its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an online retailer focused on urban millennials, and its purchase of the boutique clothing businesses Modcloth and Bonobos \u2014 will come down the road.Some analysts question how Walmart will add to its core low-price retail business at the same time it is trying to manage bolt-on acquisitions. While the company\u2019s sales were up, its profit margins in the second quarter slipped, in part because of its spending on e-commerce initiatives. With this new partnership, Google Express will offer items only from Walmart.com, and not from Jet.com or Walmart\u2019s online clothing sites.\u201cWalmart can\u2019t lose on the low-cost proposition,\u201d said Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of Vivaldi, a brand consulting firm. \u201cBut convenience, convenience that is where the game lies.\u201dWalmart has a long way to go to catch Amazon. Walmart\u2019s website sells 67 million items, up from 10 million early last year. Amazon sells hundreds of millions of items.In July, about 83.6 million people visited Walmart\u2019s website, nearly half as many visitors as Amazon had, according to comScore, a media measurement company. Jet drew an additional 10.9 million visitors.\u201cI am not saying Walmart is ever going to catch Amazon online,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. \u201cBut instead of being embarrassed by Amazon, it can be a strong No. 2.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a partnership between Walmart and Google misstated the role of the Google Assistant, the artificially intelligent software assistant, in the relationship with Walmart. The eventual plan is for Walmart customers to be able to buy products using the Google Assistant; customers cannot do that now.Advertisement"}

But the company\u2019s troubles run deeper than Mr. Kalanick\u2019s flubs and scandals, and new leadership alone won\u2019t be able to right this distressed ship.If Mr. Khosrowshahi is to succeed, he\u2019ll have to do what his predecessor refused to do: confront the reality that Uber\u2019s business model simply doesn\u2019t work.These are troubling signs. Every start-up must one day fulfill the market\u2019s demand that it turn a profit, but Uber has never figured out how to do that. While ride sharing in some form will probably survive, it\u2019s more likely that without some drastic changes, Uber won\u2019t be around in three to five years.Mr. Khosrowshahi must avoid the mistakes of his predecessor by accepting that \u201cpivots\u201d (Silicon Valley-speak for the desperate changes troubled companies make to reassure their venture capitalist funders) are not the answer. None of the pivots Mr. Kalanick tried \u2014 like on-demand delivery of food and packages through UberEats and UberRush, packing in more passengers via UberPool, and expansions into China, India and Russia \u2014 improved the bottom line.Why? Because none introduced efficiencies or changed the basic underlying economics of the taxi industry, the way Amazon did with retail by getting rid of brick-and-mortar stores through online sales.Uber\u2019s only chance to survive at this point is to actually make its taxi business work. If he\u2019s to have any chance of doing that, Mr. Khosrowshahi will need to make major changes.First, he should parlay Uber\u2019s popularity among its users into a significant increase in fares.Third, he should find a way to repair Uber\u2019s poor relationship with its drivers, since the company will need them for a good while longer. One study found that only 4 percent of people who sign up to drive for Uber are still driving a year later. Uber burns through drivers as fast as it burns through its investors\u2019 cash.Fifth, he should shut down Uber\u2019s foreign operations everywhere except London, where it has had a degree of success.If Mr. Khosrowshahi follows this blueprint, the company has a chance of surviving. If not, Uber will burn through its remaining estimated $6.6 billion in cash and go out of business in three to five years, and he\u2019ll be its final chief executive.Steven Hill, a technology and economic journalist, is the author of \u201cRaw Deal: How the \u2018Uber Economy\u2019 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Amazon did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.Beijing has become increasingly emboldened in pushing America\u2019s internet giants to follow its local internet laws, which forbid unregistered censorship-evasion software. Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn.The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts.Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues.Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon\u2019s cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall.While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale. In particular Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba runs its own cloud services, which have grown rapidly in China. In order to operate in the country, China\u2019s biggest internet companies must stay in close contact with the government and carry out Beijing\u2019s various demands, whether they be a request for user data or to censor various topics.Adam Wu in Beijing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Soviet-Era Program Gives Even Unoppressed Immigrants an Edge", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, Wash. \u2014 Growing up in the 1970s and \u201980s in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, Halyna Davydyuk was bullied by classmates and by teachers, who forced her to sit in the last row because she was an evangelical Christian. Her father was jailed for his beliefs.Today, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of persecution, but it\u2019s difficult to find work.\u201dWhat distinguishes the Davydyuks, who are Pentecostal, from other immigrants is a program created nearly three decades ago to benefit those who suffered from religious persecution in the Soviet Union, where the Communist Party hounded religious groups it could not control.\u201cIn a world where people are persecuted in many places for varying reasons, refugee resettlement programs should not privilege one category but rather prioritize the most vulnerable with the most compelling need to be resettled,\u201d said Bill Frelick, the refugee director of Human Rights Watch. He called the program for the ex-Soviets, known as the Lautenberg Amendment, a \u201cCold War anachronism.\u201dIranian religious minorities were added to the program in 2004. But Evangelical Christians make up more than 90 percent of the current Lautenberg pool, the vast majority of them from Ukraine.Nearly 4,000 Ukrainian refugees were admitted to the United States in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, compared with 2,543 for the entire 2016 fiscal year and just 227 four years ago. Their 2017 numbers are dwarfed by arrivals from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Myanmar. But since May 1, as the Trump administration began to restrict admissions of refugees, Ukraine has accounted for the second-largest number of arrivals, behind only Congo.In response to questions, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services described the surge in Ukrainian arrivals as \u201cunrelated to the executive orders\u201d on travel issued by Mr. Trump.In the 2017 refugee admissions report to Congress, the State Department said applications for the Lautenberg program had increased substantially since conflict erupted in Ukraine. Fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists has killed more than 2,000 civilians and thousands more fighters, and forced many people to move to other parts of the country, according to the United Nations.No one wanted to fault the Lautenberg program, though, noting the tenuous situation in Ukraine and the fact that Christian minorities, who are seen as being pro-West, are still vulnerable to persecution in pro-Russian areas.The Lautenberg Amendment has also been instrumental in the past in giving Jews a way to safety. \u201cFor Iranian religious minorities, like Christians, Jews and Bahai, the Lautenberg Amendment is a lifesaver,\u201d said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a resettlement agency.Over the years, the Lautenberg Amendment has spawned a chain migration as beneficiaries settle in the United States and then file \u201caffidavits of relationship\u201d for close relatives who qualify as refugees as long as they belong to a historically persecuted Christian minority from the former Soviet Union.Many wind up in the Pacific Northwest. Greater Portland, which includes Vancouver, is home to more than 100,000 Slavic Christians, who have erected dozens of churches at the epicenter of the community\u2019s life.Before the Soviet Union collapsed, Evangelical Christian churches there operated underground. For the pastor, who arrived here in 1992 with his wife and 13 children, memories of baptisms held under the cover of darkness, relatives imprisoned for practicing their faith and Bibles confiscated by state agents are still fresh. Even today, he said, in a country where the Orthodox Church is dominant, Pentecostals often are derided as spies or cult members.In March, Mr. Globak was among several Slavic pastors in the Northwest who sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Congress calling for the extension of the Lautenberg Amendment. Its annual renewal was delayed because it was pegged to an appropriations bill, but it was extended in May.Ken Demirjian, manager of Anoush Deli International Market, purveyor of borscht, sausages and other items favored by Slavic refugees, has witnessed the population explosion. \u201cWe used to be the only store for them,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are four or five.\u201dAt the Vancouver office of Lutheran Community Services Northwest, a resettlement agency, 250 of the 265 arrivals this fiscal year have come from the former Soviet Union, including 200 from Ukraine.\u201cWe want to diversify the refugee population that we serve,\u201d said Mindy Johnston, the resettlement director, adding that more Ukrainian arrivals were scheduled.Ms. Davydyuk, the Pentecostal who arrived in May, was invited to Vancouver by her sister, Lilia Volovodik. Ms. Volovodik\u2019s family settled here a decade ago, sponsored by a relative of her husband, who preceded them.Pentecostals in Rovno, their hometown in western Ukraine, began to worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies would harm Lautenberg applicants. At her church, worshipers prayed for the program, Ms. Davydyuk said.Ultimately, the Davydyuks were cleared to travel to the United States, arriving in Vancouver on May 30.Ms. Davydyuk, who spoke in Russian through an interpreter, said she was thinking about sponsoring two sisters. Her 22-year-old son, Davyd, and his pregnant wife, Anhelina, who is expecting to give birth next month, have filed forms for her mother, father, sister, brother and sister-in-law.\u201cIt\u2019s a better country,\u201d the mother-to-be said of the United States. \u201cIn Ukraine, it\u2019s so hard to live because of the economic and political instability.\u201dAnother refugee couple, Anna and Daniel German, made a living in the wholesale flower business in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, until a bomb crashed into their greenhouses in August 2014. They fled to Odessa, and Mr. German\u2019s grandmother, in Vancouver since 1999, offered to sponsor them under the program that had benefited her own family.\u201cWe thought a little and decided to emigrate,\u201d recalled Mr. German, whose family is Baptist.On their refugee application, they had to name the church they frequented and for how long. They were approved in just over a year, arriving in Vancouver in November 2015 with their four children, now 15, 13, 8 and 6.Mr. German works as an independent contractor making deliveries for Amazon. His wife cleans the Slavic Grace Baptist Church, one of several Ukrainian congregations where women must cover their heads and wear long skirts.In the last year, Ms. German has filed paperwork for the families of her two sisters and brother, who live in Odessa, to enable them to also emigrate.\u201cIn Odessa, it\u2019s O.K. but things can change at any moment,\u201d Ms. German said.Advertisement"}

Iger, said the deal proved yet again that \u201ccontent is king.\u201d\u201cIs the network \u2014 the platform \u2014 now most important?\u201d asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution \u2014 and a potential new revenue source.These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\u201cAnyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,\u201d said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.\u201dNetflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney\u2019s popular children\u2019s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney\u2019s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming \u2014 especially in the coveted children\u2019s market long dominated by Disney.Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children\u2019s programming.\u201cDisney served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix \u201chas reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn\u2019t really need Disney anymore.\u201dThe question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.And it\u2019s hedging its bet. For now, Disney\u2019s Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn\u2019t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s Disney \u2014 and only a few others.\u201cAfter Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\u201cDisney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cBut they\u2019re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they\u2019ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.\u201dAs Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney\u2019s move is putting \u201ca very settled and successful part of the business model\u201d at risk and \u201cmore aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dMr. Olson agreed. \u201cIf anyone can do it from a content perspective, it\u2019s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming from way behind.\u201dInvestors didn\u2019t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney\u2019s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company\u2019s move wasn\u2019t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. \u201cWe can both do really well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no zero-sum game here.\u201dAlthough it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney\u2019s move into direct-to-consumer distribution \u2014 not to mention the tech world\u2019s rush into original programming \u2014 demonstrates that \u201ccontent is everything these days.\u201dUnlike the old world of cable and broadcast, \u201cthe barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,\u201d he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. \u201cAll the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We\u2019re already good at both.\u201d (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)In short, from Disney\u2019s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, \u201ccontent is more king than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was the sharpest daily decline in the benchmark S.&P. 500 since May 17.Gold held at $1,283.70 an ounce after its strong run of late, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan steadied from its fall on Wednesday, closing at 19,730. The relative safety of United States Treasury securities continued to appeal, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 2.20 percent from 2.25 percent on Wednesday. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions from each other.)At the root of investors\u2019 nervousness was a jump in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the index measures investor expectations that stocks will experience sharp moves in the future.On Thursday, the VIX surged 44 percent from its historically low levels to close the day at 16.04, its highest close since Election Day in November.For many weeks this year, the VIX hovered persistently in single-digit territory, unusual for a barometer that historically trades around 20.The index\u2019s long period of placidity amid constant upheaval in Washington has posed a persistent riddle for Wall Street prognosticators.Some analysts warned that expectations of low volatility had lured a rush of recent investment, particularly from retail investors piling into exchange traded funds tied to the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and other indexes and strategies.A sharp upward trend in the VIX could well prompt many of those newcomers to flee at the same time, which could turn a market downturn into something more severe.The potential risks extend beyond those who are new to the party. In recent years, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into risk parity and other machine-driven funds that are programmed to start selling stocks and bonds once volatility rises sharply.In a period of investment calm and artificially low interest rates, automated funds, which churn out consistent if unspectacular returns, have become very popular among yield-hungry investors.\u201cBy definition, investors tend to be long the most risk when volatility is at its lowest levels,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investments. \u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201dAfter many years in which investors made a mint by betting against the VIX, a number of investors have begun to argue that the time has come to wager on the VIX \u2014 not against it.Of course, it may be too early to predict the end of one of the longest bull markets in financial history. The global economy continues to grow, and companies in the United States remain highly profitable, with earnings and sales in the quarter that ended in June handily beating expectations.The VIX\u2019s sharp move could also simply be a reversion to its mean and not a sign of panic in the markets.Analysts noted that a long period of stock market calm is highly unusual and that a correction should not come as a shock.Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm, said that before today\u2019s sell-off, the S.&P. 500 had experienced only two down days of more than 1 percent this year; the last similarly long period of financial calm was in 1964.That reserve of buying power, be it retail or institutional, has cushioned stock market drops in the past, and optimists are hoping that it will do so again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. Choice Faces a Question of Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe similarities were clear. Amazon began as an online bookstore, but it was never just about selling books; over two decades, Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, methodically expanded his company\u2019s range, operational infrastructure and ambitions to ultimately pose an existential threat to the entire retail industry.Uber, in Mr. Kalanick\u2019s expansive vision, was similarly never just about hailing rides. To him, a taxi-like car service has always been a gateway for a business model that he believed would upend the entire trillion-dollar global transportation industry, altering the way people and things move around the world \u2014 and turning Uber into one of the handful of American tech giants that will lord over this century.Mr. Khosrowshahi is a cipher in Silicon Valley. Much about the future of transportation, as well as the start-up scene in Silicon Valley, rides on his still unknown plans. Expedia declined to comment and Uber did not return a request for comment.His tenure also suggests a very different outlook from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s. In one of the biggest misses of Expedia\u2019s history, Mr. Khosrowshahi appeared wary of taking a big, potentially lucrative risk on a groundbreaking new idea in his industry \u2014 and he came out the loser. To his credit, he helped steer Expedia to adjust from that mistake. But his initial impulse may suggest a more risk-averse mindset than Mr. Kalanick\u2019s \u2014 though that, of course, may be just what Uber needs now.Its hotel booking business grew out of an acquisition that Mr. Khosrowshahi made while he was an executive at IAC in the late 1990s, and for several years, it looked unstoppable and deliciously lucrative.Expedia then operated according to what\u2019s known as the \u201cmerchant model.\u201d Under this system, when you booked a hotel, you would pay up front to Expedia, which would take a profitable cut of the deal and buy the room on your behalf. Expedia\u2019s margins were startling \u2014 the company got 25 percent or more of what you paid for the room.Instead of taking a large cut of the room, Booking.com used what is known as the \u201cagency model.\u201d The site let hotels set their own far smaller commissions \u2014 as low as 12 percent. And it also let hotel guests pay when they got to the hotel rather than up front.\u201cI think it was because we were attached to the merchant model and we were attached to high margins at the time,\u201d he told Mr. Schaal. \u201cAnd I think in hindsight that blinded us.\u201dUnder Priceline, Booking.com quickly became the largest hotel booking site in the world, because its cheaper model created a dynamic that Mr. Khosrowshahi and others at Expedia had not anticipated. It lowered prices and vastly expanded the number of hotels participating on the site \u2014 making Booking.com very popular with hotel-seekers, and making it impossible for hotels to pass up.This history, Mr. Thompson wrote, might inform how Mr. Khosrowshahi approaches Uber. In the same way that Booking.com became popular with hotel guests because it had the largest inventory of hotels, Mr. Khosrowshahi might understand Uber\u2019s secret is its popularity with riders.\u201cIn fact, what makes Uber so valuable \u2014 and still so attractive, despite all of the recent troubles \u2014 is its position with riders,\u201d Mr. Thompson wrote. \u201cThe more riders Uber has, the more drivers it will attract, even if the economics are worse relative to other services: driving at a worse rate is better than not driving at a better one.\u201dThis sounds reasonable enough. Yet I still found myself fixated on Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s initial dismissal of Booking.com. I suspect that if you told Mr. Kalanick, not to mention Mr. Bezos, that there was a competitor out there that had figured out a way to sell the same product at a vastly lower price, they would have moved instantly to purchase or copy it, regardless of the risks to short-term profits. Sacrificing lots of money today for a potentially huge share of the market in the future \u2014 that\u2019s classic Mr. Bezos, and then classic Mr. Kalanick.In fact, that\u2019s pretty much what Mr. Kalanick did when he created UberX, a cheaper version of his original black-car service, in response to lower-priced entrants like Lyft.That Mr. Khosrowshahi did not do that suggests he has a very different appetite for risk. It also suggests he may seek to turn Uber into a more normal, slower, less intense, less globe-swallowing company \u2014 but perhaps also a better company to work for, and one that may begin making money instead of losing it.For everyone who\u2019s had enough of Uber\u2019s drama lately, that may be a fine trade.The State of the Art column on Tuesday, about challenges facing Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s pick as its next chief executive, misstated the year Dennis Schaal of the travel news site Skift spoke with Mr. Khosrowshahi. It was 2016, not 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Walmart Academy, Training Better Managers. But With a Better Future?", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "A new program for store supervisors and department managers may make them better employees but may not help them reach the middle class.Supported byFULTON, N.Y. \u2014 The procession started in toys, marched through electronics, down into grocery and past the registers at the front end.Fifty-one men and women, dressed in shimmering blue and yellow caps and gowns, walked through the Walmart to receive certificates on a stage set up in the store\u2019s lawn and garden department. A bagpiper, wearing a kilt, led the graduates through the aisles.For Roy Walts, it was the first time he had ever graduated from anything.He dropped out of school in the ninth grade after his father died of cancer and his stepmother told him to leave the house. At 15, he lived in a Salvation Army clothing collection box. One Christmas night he ate cookies from a Dumpster.So as Mr. Walts, 53, crossed the stage that April morning in front of the local mayor; Walmart\u2019s regional manager for upstate New York; and his son, who had worked overnight stocking freezers, he had butterflies in his stomach.\u201cI thought for sure I would trip walking up on that stage,\u201d recalled Mr. Walts, the automotive department manager.Mr. Walts is a graduate of Walmart Academy, one of the largest employer training programs in the country. Since March 2016, Walmart has put more than 150,000 of its store supervisors and department managers through the training, which, over several weeks, teaches skills like merchandising and how to motivate employees.An additional 380,000 entry-level workers have taken part in a separate training program called Pathways. Most of these workers receive a $1-an-hour raise for completing the course.American companies spend about $170 billion a year on formal employee training, but most of that instruction focuses on workers with college degrees.Walmart has spent $2.7 billion on training and raising wages for 1.2 million of its store workers over the past two years \u2014 an investment that reflects the pressures the company faces in the retail industry.Fighting Amazon for sales, Walmart is trying to make its stores more pleasant places to shop. That requires a well-trained work force with a sense of purpose and self-worth, qualities that can be difficult to nurture in lower-wage workers.But it\u2019s not clear whether all this training is teaching workers valuable skills that could enable them to move into the middle class, or whether it is mostly making them better Walmart employees.And even with more skills, many retail workers may never be able to earn what factory workers made in places like Fulton, a faded manufacturing hub near Syracuse.\u201cIt is going to be very hard to replace what we\u2019ve lost,\u201d said Fulton\u2019s mayor, Ronald Woodward. \u201cRetail jobs don\u2019t compare to manufacturing.\u201dIn a study funded by Walmart, researchers at the National Skills Coalition, a nonprofit group that promotes investment in training, found that 60 percent of retail workers are not proficient in reading and 70 percent have difficulty working with numbers.The Pathways program addresses some of these issues by teaching \u201cretail\u201d math, or basic numerical skills a worker might need at the register or stocking shelves.The academy is geared to more-experienced supervisors and department managers. Working in classrooms set up in 150 Walmarts around the country, employees learn how to calculate profit and loss statements and how to run their department like a small business.Managers are also taught to get to know their employees and understand their home life.Walmart was once considered to be a pariah of rural America, vilified by some \u2014 especially people who shopped elsewhere \u2014 for wiping out local businesses by selling cheap goods made in China. Now, Walmart is rebranding itself as a company focused on the needs of its workers and the fate of small towns and hardscrabble cities.In the past year, Walmart has spent about $650,000 running television ads about Walmart Academy, according to Alphonso, a TV data company. It has spent $17.6 million on an ad highlighting the company\u2019s commitment to buy $250 billion in goods made or grown in America. That ad features scenes of factory workers and their families set to the squeals of Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cDream On.\u201d\u201cThe caps and gowns, the symbolism, these are not trivial things,\u201d said Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\u201cThey are trying to create this feeling among employees that \u2018we are the store.\u2019 They are taking small-town America and putting it into Walmart. Is that a bad thing? No.\u201dOther researchers say what many Walmart workers need most is not training, but higher wages. The training programs, they say, may be helpful in enhancing employee loyalty and performance, but increasing pay would benefit the workers most.Two years ago, the company raised its starting wage to $9 an hour, a $1.75 increase from the federal minimum wage.\u201cIf Walmart really wanted to invest in its workers, it would start people at $15 companywide and adequately staff its stores so they can service customers,\u201d said Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the National Employment Law Project, which lobbies for low-wage workers.Fulton, a city of about 11,400 people, was once known for producing one very important thing: chocolate.Specifically, Fulton was home to a factory that made Nestl\u00e9 Crunch bars. On humid days, before a summer rain, the smell of chocolate wafted through the city.The company shut the factory and moved operations to Wisconsin in 2003 to consolidate its production facilities and \u201cincrease the utilization of assets,\u201d a Nestl\u00e9 spokeswoman said in an email.\u201cI think what everyone misses most,\u201d said Geoff Raponi, manager of the Fulton Walmart Supercenter, \u201cis the smell.\u201dThey also miss the jobs \u2014 more than 1,500 of them when the factory was booming in the mid-1980s, according to Mayor Woodward. The local Walmart has about 300 employees.Mac Guile, 24, was not quite 6 years old when the chocolate works closed. He was living with his grandmother, who poured molten chocolate into bars, and his grandfather, who delivered supplies to the factory. They lived in a spacious house across from a McDonald\u2019s, where Mr. Guile was known as the store\u2019s mascot because of his name \u2014 Mac \u2014 and the fact that he ate breakfast there almost every day.After Nestl\u00e9 left town, Mr. Guile moved with his grandparents into a trailer. There were no more daily McDonald\u2019s breakfasts, and often there was little food at all. Mr. Guile and his younger brother took baths with water warmed on the stove.At 19, Mr. Guile got a job at the Fulton Walmart Supercenter as a part-time janitor, earning $7.50 an hour. He didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for utilities in his apartment for the first few months, so he showered at a relative\u2019s house.He now runs the meat department, a wall of refrigerated shelves, spanning from chicken thighs to Hofmann\u2019s hot dogs, a Syracuse-area favorite.He likes meat because of the fast pace and customer demands. He has memorized the internal temperature that pork, chicken and beef need to reach for safety, and recommends a variety of sauces and rubs.The Walmart Academy classes appealed to Mr. Guile because they were more like discussions than lectures. Instead of being scolded for using their phones, students were encouraged to look things up. He was impressed that the program was held in a real classroom equipped with tablets.The most useful lesson Mr. Guile learned at the academy was how to motivate his workers. \u201cHave more one-on-one conversations, that is key,\u201d said Mr. Guile, who has a brown beard and a tattoo that proclaims, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201dHe now earns about $15 an hour, has a 401(k) retirement account with matching contributions from Walmart, and receives bonuses.His former supervisor recommended him for the assistant store manager program, which could put him on track to manage a store one day \u2014 a job that pays an average of $170,000 a year.Many of Mr. Guile\u2019s family members also work in the store. His sister works in the deli, his cousin\u2019s mother works at the front end and his girlfriend is a cake decorator in the bakery.Some of his relatives who don\u2019t work at the store ask him for help. He buys some family members new shoes and clothing for school.\u201cThe whole town can\u2019t work at Walmart,\u201d Mr. Guile said.When Fulton\u2019s Walmart Academy graduated its first class, the store presented the mayor with a gift. It was a brick pulled from the rubble of the Nestl\u00e9 factory, which is being demolished 14 years after Nestl\u00e9 left.\u201cA piece of Nestle History,\u201d read the inscription on the brick. \u201cPresented this day 25th of April 2017.\u201dMr. Woodward, who is serving his third four-year term as mayor, appreciates Walmart\u2019s training program but says it will take more to save his city\u2019s economy.\u201cAnytime a company offers training, that is good,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t all going to run the store.\u201dMr. Woodward, a former maintenance supervisor at Nestl\u00e9 who made $89,000 a year, says he was one of the last two workers to leave the plant when it closed. His second-floor office in City Hall is like a time capsule, frozen in Fulton\u2019s glorious industrial past.There are black-and-white photos of a campaign banner for Theodore Roosevelt hanging over a downtown street, and of a long-gone horse racing track teeming with spectators in suits and bowler hats.A few years ago, Fulton tried to restart chocolate production. A confectionery company, owned partly by a consortium of cocoa suppliers from Ivory Coast, revived the Nestl\u00e9 property with help from the state. But the venture failed.The site\u2019s most recent owner stripped the factory of wiring to sell for scrap and walked away, the mayor said, leaving empty brick buildings behind.From his office, Mr. Woodward, 68, talks on a flip phone and peers out over his glasses with eyes like an owl\u2019s.He is busy working to dredge a public lake that is choked by algae and closed to swimming at the height of another summer.\u201cI love this town,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. \u201cI will do anything to help it.\u201dThat includes showing up one morning at the Walmart to attend the academy graduation.Mr. Woodward didn\u2019t have the heart to tell the store employees that the Walmart was not technically in his city.The store lists a Fulton mailing address but is actually in the neighboring town of Granby. That means Fulton misses out on the property tax revenue the store generates.The retailer does pay Fulton for water and sewage, an average of $11,703 a year, according to the city. But that pales next to the $364,218 the Nestl\u00e9 plant spent on those services in 2002. The chocolate company was also paying Fulton $166,253 in annual property taxes.Mr. Woodward appreciates that the supercenter provides steady jobs during a tough economic time. But in his mind, these are not the kind of jobs that earned Fulton the nickname \u201cthe largest small city in the state.\u201d In the past few decades, Birds Eye foods and Miller Brewing also closed plants in the Fulton area that once employed hundreds of people.\u201cYou could graduate from high school, work at a place like Nestl\u00e9, buy a car and send your kids to college,\u201d Mr. Woodward said.When the Nestl\u00e9 plant was roaring in 1985, the average wage in Oswego County, which includes Fulton, was about $51,000. Today, the average pay is 18 percent less, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency.Walmart declined to disclose the wages at the Fulton store. But the company said that at its stores in New York State, full-time workers earned an average of $14.10 an hour. Part-time workers make an average of $11.10 an hour.The company says its training programs are intended to help employees advance into higher-paying jobs at Walmart or in other industries.\u201cWhether they are coming to us for two years or 20 years, we want them to have the skills that allow them to create opportunities,\u201d said Kathleen McLaughlin, who runs the Walmart Foundation and also holds the title chief sustainability officer.Walmart has been working with the National Retail Federation, a trade association, to help devise standards for a certificate that retail workers could earn for gaining certain interpersonal skills like how to deal with angry customers. The hope is that certificate holders will have an easier time finding a job or getting promoted.Walmart points out that more than a quarter of its 1.2 million store workers are in supervisory and manager positions and that there are frequently openings for managerial jobs.And Walmart workers who stay in entry-level jobs over many years can earn up to $17 an hour nationwide.Activists and unions say the starting wage should be higher. But Ms. McLaughlin, who worked for two decades at McKinsey, the global consulting company, said increasing entry-level wages could do more harm than good. If the starting wage is too high, she said, employers will be less likely to hire unskilled, inexperienced workers.\u201cIn contrast to only increasing wages,\u201d Ms. McLaughlin said in an email, \u201cwe believe investing in people and developing their skills gives them access to more choice of jobs that reflect their particular talents and passions.\u201dAbout a month ago, Ashley VanHorn was stocking shelves in the Fulton store when she overheard two little girls tell their father they wanted to work at Walmart one day.\u201cYou can do better than this,\u201d Ms. VanHorn recalled the man telling them.Working at Walmart was never part of Ms. VanHorn\u2019s plan, either. She remembers going with her father to register at Cayuga Community College in Fulton. They rode their bikes to the campus because they didn\u2019t have a car.Ms. VanHorn, 27, described her father as someone \u201cwho could build a house with his bare hands\u201d but had faced some financial challenges. He was so insistent on enrolling his daughter in college that he filled out most of the paperwork himself.Ms. VanHorn wanted to be a social worker, but a few credits shy of getting her degree, she became pregnant and dropped out of college. Soon after, she got a job at Walmart.\u201cI know I let my dad down,\u201d she said.She started out in the health and beauty department and eventually moved to grocery, where she now manages dry goods. Her manager says Ms. VanHorn, who earns about $15 an hour, has what it takes to be a salaried assistant manager overseeing several departments and making nearly $20,000 more a year.But Ms. VanHorn worries that the longer hours as an assistant manager would mean less time with her two children. She also hopes to go back to college someday.On graduation day, Ms. VanHorn didn\u2019t know what to expect. Like many of the graduates in her Walmart Academy class, she had never taken part in a graduation ceremony because she didn\u2019t finish high school.As the procession made its way through the aisles and the bagpiper played, Ms. VanHorn spotted her father, sitting on a folding chair in the lawn and garden section.After the ceremony, he told Ms. VanHorn he was proud of her.\u201cThis was not the dream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the dream does change.\u201dRobert Gebeloff and Sapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpen ThreadHappy first week of August \u2014 or, as they call it in England, the silly season. You know: the time we get very excited about a politician\u2019s embarrassing choice of beach shorts, because there is so little else to write about.As if!I am not just talking about what\u2019s going on in Washington. Granted, there was a cat fashion show yesterday at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, but fashion isn\u2019t slowing down as much as it used to. Instead it seems to be speeding up. Literally.Selfridges just announced that it has opened its Christmas shop, and Rent the Runway introduced a pilot program for same-day delivery of items in New York if ordered before noon, joining Gucci and Net-a-Porter in the almost-instant-gratification game.I guess soon this may be the new normal: You\u2019ll be able to get something practically as soon as you think it.Still, even more than the immediacy, what struck me in all of this was a term that came up in my conversation with Jennifer Hyman, the co-founder and C.E.O. of RtR, about the new service. It\u2019s one step closer to \u201cthe closetless future,\u201d she said.\u201cThe closetless future.\u201d Let\u2019s just think about that phrase for a moment. It goes with our bookshelf-less future courtesy of Amazon, and giant-fridge-less future courtesy of Blue Apron, and CD-less future courtesy of Spotify. The goal here being a better use of real estate, smaller dry-cleaning bills and in general, less stuff \u2014 and with this, the opportunity to try on all sorts of different selfs.You can see the appeal. But is it a utopian ideal that involves not entirely no closet, but rather a tiny closet just for everyday necessities (jeans! T-shirts! The perfect black jacket!), with the rest of our wardrobes fungible and shareable in the cloud/RtR warehouse \u2014 or a route to the denaturation of our selves and our clothes?I am going to spend the next few weeks mulling over this question \u2013 as should you; let me know what you think \u2014 since I am now headed off to the Canadian woods. While I am gone this newsletter will be in the capable hands of my colleagues Isabel Wilkinson and Alainna Beddie.I know there is a move toward mini-me dressing, with parents and children appearing in much the same styles, but as far as I am concerned, that erodes the psychological distance of adulthood we all need, as much to signal to ourselves we are grown-ups as to signal to others. It doesn\u2019t mean eschewing specific materials, but rather going by their associations: Denim shorts are O.K., but maybe not Daisy Dukes; a sequined sheath or tank fine, but perhaps not a crop top. Anything you could imagine a 10-year-old absconding with should probably be avoided. Or go by the free-association adjective rule: \u201cElegant\u201d is better than \u201ccute\u201d; \u201cseductive\u201d better than \u201cbeach babe.\u201d Finally, if you\u2019re still not sure, that\u2019s probably your sartorial superego tussling with your id.

{"Headline": "New Citizens Hold Their Heads High, 102 Floors Above New York", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne hundred and two floors above the city, with a hazy view of the Statue of Liberty, 30 immigrants were sworn in as citizens of the United States on Tuesday.It was a morning thick with clouds and redolent with symbolism.\u201cHow fortunate we are to have you here, contributing your hopes, your aspirations, your skills, your heritages, your music, your culture, your literature, your food to the tapestry of this nation,\u201d declared Judge Katzmann, who is chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \u201cThe American story is your story.\u201dThe newest citizens, from 19 countries including Argentina, Bangladesh, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago, nodded in recognition, some shedding tears.Intending his words to \u201cbe timeless,\u201d Judge Katzmann said that he wrote his speech before the weekend\u2019s violence.Mr. Bharara, the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who joined New York University School of Law as a scholar in residence, invoked his immigrant father, who came from a village in India without running water.\u201cWe are bound together in ways that longstanding Americans don\u2019t always appreciate,\u201d Mr. Bharara said. Were his words meant to respond to the anti-immigration rhetoric of the current administration?\u201cA restatement of what\u2019s great about the country is never a rebuke to anything,\u201d he said when asked, with a slight smile.Joydeep Roy, the one naturalized citizen from India in Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, proclaimed Mr. Bharara\u2019s words \u201cvery moving,\u201d and posed for a picture with him after the ceremony. Mr. Roy, 45, works as an economist for the city and teaches at Columbia\u2019s Teachers College.A student of history, he reflected on his own overlapping messages of liberty: Aug. 15 is India\u2019s independence day. He was honored to be chosen that morning to lead his new class in the Pledge of Allegiance, though his family could not attend. His 9-year-old son was at taekwondo camp, and his wife, who was already naturalized, had an important meeting as a senior economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The proceedings inspired Hani Ali, 35, an accountant from Sudan, to think about the American dream. \u201cEverybody can do it, it teaches you that \u2018impossible is nothing,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Ali, proudly wearing a red tie and navy suit. The middle child of five siblings, and the only one to live in the United States, he graduated from the University of Connecticut and is a senior manager at Deloitte.Amid the flag-waving pomp, the new citizens did not get a message or congratulatory letter of welcome from the president. But that was not an indication of the administration\u2019s position on immigration.

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his.

Lampert, Sears borrowed heavily to buy back shares. But Mr. Lampert also appears to be building a moat around his investment. Last year, Sears sold much of its property to another publicly traded company, Seritage Growth Properties. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage. The move meant that Sears had to pay rent on real estate it once owned, to the benefit of Seritage investors.Some analysts say that it is now almost inevitable that, in spite of fixes that Sears is pursuing in its stores, the company is eventually destined for Chapter 11.\u201cThere has been a long, steady sale of assets to the point where the cupboard is pretty bare,\u201d said Ken Perkins, the president of the research provider Retail Metrics.Netflix\u2019s announcement early Monday that it had secured Ms. Rhimes, the creator of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d to an exclusive deal took a key creative force away from ABC, which is owned by Disney.\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal\u201d will stay at ABC, as will some shows already in development, like a \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff.

{"Headline": "As Brexit Nears, \u2018Discounters\u2019 Gain Ground in U.K. Supermarket Wars", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 At the vast Sainsbury\u2019s grocery store in south London\u2019s Tooting Broadway neighborhood, a basket of milk, eggs, bread, cornflakes and butter will cost shoppers four pounds and 70 pence, or about $6.15. A short walk away at Aldi and Lidl \u2014 two German discount grocery stores \u2014 those same items amount to \u00a33.92.Those small differences in price are having a major impact on grocery shopping in Britain.Opting for cheaper grocery stores like Aldi and Lidl is one such option, and the two retailers are taking advantage.Britain\u2019s supermarket sector is ruthlessly competitive. Major retailers like Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Walmart\u2019s Asda all jostle for market share by offering loyalty schemes, online shopping, home delivery and special offers (Amazon, by comparison, is a relative minnow in the grocery sector).Long dismissed in Britain as shops targeting only lower-income discount-hunters, Aldi and Lidl have steadily made progress and, since Brexit, their growth in market share has accelerated.Spending at the two stores grew by double digits in the 12 weeks to mid-July, according to Kantar Worldpanel, a research group, outpacing not only the wider industry but every other major supermarket. Together, they now account for more than 12 percent of the country\u2019s spending on groceries, up from just 4 percent a decade ago.\u201cWhen I was growing up, there used to be a bit of a stigma around shopping at discount stores at my school,\u201d said Christina Carr, who works at a bank in Newcastle, in northern England. If you shopped at one, \u201cyou\u2019d be classed as a poor family, and the kids would be horrible.\u201dWhen Ms. Carr, a 28-year-old bank employee, moved out of her grandparents\u2019 home, she found herself thinking much harder about her finances. She and her partner spent \u00a360 on groceries every week, which looked increasingly unaffordable.In November, she relented, switching from Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s to Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThe difference in price,\u201d Ms. Carr said, \u201cit\u2019s really significant.\u201dThat started to change when the financial crisis hit. Britain\u2019s economy went into recession and unemployment rose above 8 percent. Pay slumped in the years after the crisis, and though it has recovered somewhat, average wages are still lower in real terms than they were before the crisis.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cU.K. households are quite sensitive to pressure on disposable income,\u201d said Edouard Aubin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThat is why they are switching to cheaper alternatives.\u201dAldi and Lidl push their low-price messages relentlessly, both in advertising campaigns and in stores. The two retailers stock significantly fewer products \u2014 typically only a tenth as many as competitors \u2014 with a greater focus on items sold under their own lower-cost brands. Many goods are placed on shelves still in the crates or boxes in which they were delivered.At the Lidl in Tooting, stacks of vegetable boxes run down the middle of the store, while bright orange signs overhead advertise price cuts. The store\u2019s glass exterior is emblazoned with heart-shaped Union Jack flags and the words \u201cFresh British.\u201d Visitors to the Aldi across the road have to keep on the move to avoid staff members hurriedly restocking shelves or rushing to open cashier stalls.They currently have nearly 1,400 outlets between them, and their sales have risen faster than those of rivals. Three in every five British households have shopped at either Aldi or Lidl, and the demographics of their customers are now similar to that of the broader population, according to Mr. Aubin at Morgan Stanley.\u201cAlthough they\u2019re small in the U.K., they\u2019re massive businesses in their own right,\u201d said James Walton, chief economist at IGD, which carries out research on the food and grocery industries. \u201cThey have great scale when considered globally, and they\u2019re only buying a fairly limited range of products.\u201dAs their customer base has expanded, the stores have expanded their offerings, adding seasonal product lines that include luxury goods like lobster or magnums of prosecco. Lidl, for example, is selling inflatable pool toys, avocado oil and Iberico ham.That has helped retain a broader range of customers, like Mark Whitfield, who frequents both Aldi and Lidl in Sittingbourne, about 45 miles from London. \u201cYou\u2019re buying unusual or luxury products, but not paying as much,\u201d said Mr. Whitfield, 52.Their expansion extends beyond Britain.The American supermarket sector is significantly more fragmented than Britain\u2019s, and the German retailers have set their sights on expanding there. Among lower-price grocery stores, Aldi already has 1,600 stores in the United States and is planning to expand to 2,500 within the next five years. Lidl is looking at opening 100 outlets as well, after opening its first American stores in June.\u201cWhether you look at the U.S., U.K.,\u201d said Mikey Vu, a partner focused on retail on Bain & Company, a consultant firm, \u201cthere\u2019s a larger proportion of the population that\u2019s concerned with where they\u2019re spending their money.\u201d\u201cThe economy makes things a lot tougher for a lot of people,\u201d he said of American consumers. \u201cPeople are watching their pennies more. The hard discounter model is attractive to them, just like we saw in the U.K.\u201dThe shift toward \u201cthe discounters\u201d is not just a short-term issue for Britain\u2019s supermarket sector. Younger shoppers are increasingly willing to try supermarket-brand items, which are no longer seen as lower-quality knockoffs, a trend that could be accentuated if the economy takes a turn for the worse again.\u201cYou\u2019re paying for the name\u201d at other supermarkets, said Lucy Deacon, a 27-year-old who was shopping at the Aldi in Tooting. Ms. Deacon, who works in a local betting shop, said she would focus her shopping even further on discount supermarkets if Britain saw another downturn.As she picked through spices for a curry she planned to cook that evening, Ms. Deacon said, \u201cYou get more for your money here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A 20-Year Age Gap Makes No Difference", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsIt was early 2012 when Liz Axelrod met James Olson at a Manhattan bar near the New School, where both were getting Master of Fine Arts degrees; she in poetry, he in fiction. She thought he was cute. He thought she was pretty. They saw each other a few more times, after their Wednesday night class. Finally they talked. And talked. And talked.\u201cWe went from one bar to another and ended up at Around the Clock diner talking about everything until 3 a.m.,\u201d said Ms. Axelrod, an adjunct English professor and grant manager. \u201cIt was like kismet. We just connected. He was good friends with two of my best guy friends, so I felt really safe. It just felt right.\u201dMs. Axelrod was going to Florida the next day, so the two kissed good night outside the diner, and she went to Pennsylvania Station to catch the 3:19 a.m. train home to Long Island.These were some of the conversation highlights: She was divorced; he had never married. At the time, her daughter was 17; he had no children. She lived in Port Washington, N.Y.; he resided in Brooklyn. She was from New York; he was raised in Denver. She was 47; he was 20 years younger. Both liked punk rock, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, among other things.\u201cOur ages didn\u2019t come up until the end of the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember thinking we have so many things in common, but the age difference could be problematic. When I asked James about it, he said it didn\u2019t bother him, so it didn\u2019t bother me.\u201dMr. Olson recalls their all-night talkathon a little differently.\u201cThere were several kisses during the evening,\u201d said Mr. Olson, now 33, who is also an adjunct English professor. \u201cThe age thing came up early in the evening. When she told me how old she was, I was shocked. I didn\u2019t think she was older than 35. But I liked her and wanted to date her, so I was going to roll with it. And I remember her taking the 5:19 train home.\u201dWhat they agree on was that they planned to get together the next Friday at her place.They texted while she was gone, and when she returned, she asked him to dinner.The food was good. So was the company. The date lasted until Sunday, when Mr. Olson went home. \u201cWe both knew this was something special,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel the need to leave or get away for a few hours. I felt comfortable and happy.\u201dValentine\u2019s Day was that week. They went out for dinner, and didn\u2019t make a big deal over the romantic holiday. Though they both knew they were done looking, the age difference was still a consideration.\u201cWe were both really scared,\u201d Ms. Axelrod said. \u201cNeither of us knew if this would work, or how we\u2019d handle the age gap. It\u2019s a big gap. But then it became, \u2018What\u2019s so different?\u2019 Six months later, it took a back seat. Now we don\u2019t think about it. We\u2019re pretty equal everywhere else. We challenge each other, debate, argue and inform. I\u2019m a really strong woman, but he\u2019s a strong man.\u201dThings progressed quickly, but another possible roadblock emerged: having children.\u201cWe talked a lot about having kids,\u201d Mr. Olson said. \u201cI really had to figure out if I biologically needed to have my own. Internally, it took me a month to decide that I didn\u2019t. That we could adopt. I don\u2019t know if I want to. We can make that decision down the road.\u201dMs. Axelrod agreed, stating that she would not be having another child biologically, but that adoption was a possibility.They graduated in 2013. The logical next step was moving in together. Ms. Axelrod\u2019s home was larger, and at the time, her daughter, Maxine, lived with her. For an all-girls home, making room for Mr. Olson proved challenging.\u201cWhen a new person comes into your home, it\u2019s hard making space and giving them their own space,\u201d Ms. Axelrod said. \u201cMaxine and I have lived here for 12 years. I\u2019m a girlie girl, and I own a lot of jewelry. I had a dresser full of it, so I had to give up half of that. There were flowered curtains I got rid of.\u201dMoving from a studio apartment, Mr. Olson arrived with only his desk, TV, computer and 100 books.She took down some pictures; he put some up.\u201cWe had a lot of tiffs about whose stuff goes where,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we created a routine. It was hard. I kept asking myself, \u2018How do I fit into their pattern or create my own space?\u2019\u201dPersonal and shared space was found. Books, however, were kept separated on his and her shelves.\u201cEven though we both teach, I write notes in my books, and that makes her a little crazy,\u201d Mr. Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process.\u201dOn July 10, 2015, Mr. Olson packed a knapsack with freshly sliced peaches, a bottle of wine, two Mason jars and a ring. Then he asked Ms. Axelrod to take a walk on the small beach across the street from their home.\u201cWe had looked at rings on the internet, and she\u2019d found one she liked,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought she knew and was playing along. I didn\u2019t realize how shocked she was until I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.\u201dMs. Axelrod accepted.\u201cWhen he got down on one knee, I thought, \u2018How did he do this without my knowing?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d been talking about this for at least a year and had looked online at rings. I didn\u2019t know he had ordered the one I liked.\u201dThen they watched the sun set and drank peach-flavored prosecco.\u201cThis had always been my beach that I walked by myself, but I always wished I had someone to walk with, and then he was there,\u201d Ms. Axelrod said. \u201cWhen he proposed, I knew after that I wouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201dFor Mr. Olson, the decision to propose happened when he started turning down teaching offers from other countries. \u201cI realized I wanted to stay in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cI love her, and she had a daughter and couldn\u2019t move. The job wasn\u2019t important to me anymore. It was being with the person I love.\u201dOn July 20, a Thursday, William Sanchez, a justice of the Village of Rhinebeck, N.Y., officiated at the Rhinecliff hotel before 50 guests. The bride walked down the aisle to a song Mr. Olson wrote in 2008.\u201cI\u2019ve always loved writing music,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t decide on a song, so I went back to some that I had written, and we both liked this one.\u201dThe ceremony took only three minutes, and rain fell just as the couple were told to kiss.\u201cWhen my mom started going out with James, she was just so happy,\u201d said Maxine Axelrod, 22, the bride\u2019s daughter. \u201cI think they\u2019re really good for each other. They laugh all the time. They just have this great connection.\u201dNoah Beigelmacher, 33, a special-education teacher who knew both the bride and the groom separately from school, spoke similarly about the newlyweds.\u201cI could really see them together as a unit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you know each person independently, know their quirks, and then to see them fit so well together, and look out for each other, and take care of each other, that\u2019s really special.\u201dMayan Axelrod, 43, the bride\u2019s younger brother, felt the union is about \u201cmaking each other better while helping the other in the areas they might be weak in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey complement each other very well.\u201dBefore the couple sat down to dinner, the bride slipped off her first dress and changed into a white one with gold sequins. Glasses appeared on her smiling face, her hair fell loosely onto her shoulders, and the rose crown she had assembled the night before was removed.\u201cMy head feels so much lighter now that I\u2019m not wearing the flowers, and these are for dancing,\u201d she said, pointing to a pair of gold-colored shoes.They continued through the night, dancing to the beat of the music and of their love, which was clearly ageless.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crunchyroll Cultivates a Streaming Community With a Novel Idea: Film Screens", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingStreaming services that specialize in genre are highly invested in the communities that attach to them. Recently they\u2019ve been experimenting with enticing their audiences the old-fashioned way, by showing their programs in movie theaters before offering them on their sites.The 370-seat AMC Empire was about three-quarters full by the time the lights went down, and sitting through Crunchyroll Movie Night was very distinct from almost every other public film screening I\u2019ve been to in the past decade or even more. For most of the screening, except for the soundtrack of the show itself, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.\u201cBride\u201d has what you might call a humdinger of a premise: It begins with a teenage girl, Chise, in chains, being sold as a slave to a very tall individual with a human body and an antelope\u2019s skull and horns for a head. This character is a magus, and he sees in Chise what others do not \u2014 that she possesses great magical power.The initial episodes have the magus protecting Chise from impish fairies, taking her to a dragon-populated Iceland and introducing her to colleagues in the magic arts. The series follows a convention common in manga: When the characters are angry, or act awkwardly, or crack bad jokes, they are rendered as caricatures of themselves. These provided the laughs in the story, and the audience at Crunchyroll Movie Night responded with enthusiastic good humor. Otherwise, attentive silence.A couple of days before the event, Crunchyroll\u2019s chief operating officer, Colin Decker, told me that the site was created in 2006 by American software engineers who were also anime fans, and who wanted to create a way to access brand-new anime from Japan without resorting to piracy.Now, he said, Crunchyoll is the \u201clargest international distributor of anime.\u201d The site-app has more than one million paid subscribers and over 20 million registered users. A good deal of its content can be accessed for free, with ads, and at a resolution of 480p; there are two levels of premium subscriptions, one for $6.95 a month and another at $11.95, both of which eliminate ads and feature high-definition 720p and 1080p.The simulcasting model is currently the most vibrant part of Crunchyroll\u2019s programming, and getting the material out as quickly as possible for the international audience is a challenge. But fans have turned out to be a big help, Mr. Decker said.\u201cWe reached out to fans and found many of our subtitling people from the fan community, and they make sure the translations are as accurate as possible, and that titling is done as quickly as possible.\u201d That translation is a tall order for a site that subtitles its content in seven languages (and two dialects of Spanish).While I was interested in the site\u2019s Movie Night initiative, I was also curious about whether Crunchyroll would add more feature-film fare, particularly classic anime, to the site. Mr. Decker, who once taught film at Harvard, said that \u201chistorical material is something I\u2019m very interested in.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re looking at producing some documentaries about landmarks in anime,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking around and saying \u2018Someone\u2019s got to do this!,\u2019 and then it turns out that someone has to be us.\u201dAs for Crunchyroll Movie Night, Mr. Decker said that the service doesn\u2019t have ambitions for certain kinds of expansion. \u201cWe are not getting into theatrical distribution,\u201d he said emphatically \u2014 as if pre-emptively dodging a bullet.It\u2019s Crunchyroll\u2019s scale \u2014 big, but not too big, like that of Shudder \u2014 as well as its genre specialization that enables it to address its subscribers as a community rather than as a market. Which is why you\u2019ll probably never see Netflix Movie Night.An article last Sunday about the streaming service Crunchyroll misidentified Colin Decker\u2019s position at the company. He is chief operating officer, not chief executive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Superfans Unite: A New Breed Reimagines Criticism for a Digital Age", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A few Sundays ago, as millions of people were sitting down to watch the season premiere of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d those gathered at a small house party in the Van Nuys neighborhood here were still figuring out dinner.The host, Filup Molina, didn\u2019t have the right pizza delivery app installed on his iPhone, so he paused DirecTV\u2019s East Coast live feed to sort it out. \u201cHow many pizzas do we want?\u201d he asked. \u201cTwo? Three?\u201d A half-hour into the much-anticipated episode the doorbell rang, so he stopped the show again when the Domino\u2019s delivery guy arrived with three pies. All the while the armchair analysis continued apace.\u201cDo they literally bring winter with them?\u201d Mr. Molina asked about the White Walkers, referring to the zombielike army of the dead descending on a mostly oblivious human population in the south.His longtime friend Erik Voss nodded as he finished a mouthful of pizza. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about this idea that winter doesn\u2019t bring White Walkers \u2014 that White Walkers bring winter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be that winter didn\u2019t exist in this world until the White Walkers were created.\u201dThis is how America watches live TV in 2017 \u2014 starting late, pausing to grab food, debating the finer points of a show\u2019s mythology. But for Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss, this is more than an enjoyable pastime; it\u2019s a living.They are superfans \u2014 sophisticated ones \u2014 using visual aids to break down shows and movies for superfans. And their handiwork makes the audience for these pop-culture spectacles even bigger and more engaged.\u201cWe are in a world where the cacophony of coverage, whether it\u2019s Vanity Fair or New Rockstars, drives the cultural zeitgeist around the show,\u201d said Sabrina Caluori, HBO\u2019s senior vice president for digital media and marketing. \u201cThat breeds the FOMO \u2014 the Fear of Missing Out \u2014 that\u2019s driving continued growth of the show this season.\u201dThe morning after the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere, Mr. Molina, 32, and Mr. Voss, 29, started work early at their one-room studio, which is across the street from Universal Studios. Mr. Molina had watched the episode twice, made extensive notes and built the motion graphics for \u201cWesteros Weekly,\u201d a new show that New Rockstars is producing during this season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Mr. Voss was in another corner rewatching clips from the premiere and writing a script for an hourlong episode breakdown that he and Mr. Molina would begin taping the next day.The two men both have comedy backgrounds, and both are working on their own film and TV scripts even as they\u2019re becoming known online as film and TV personalities. New Rockstars, though, will be their full-time gig for the foreseeable future.\u201cThe moment we saw the response to that \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 video, we decided to reduce all the coverage on all the YouTubers,\u201d said Jeben Berg, a former Google executive and a partner in Zealot Networks, which owns New Rockstars. \u201cPeople wanted to see heightened, sensible, intelligent speculation on what was happening on big Hollywood film properties.\u201d(Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss have focused nearly all of their attention on the YouTube channel, which has about a million subscribers and is supported by advertising and sponsors, though this fall New Rockstars will begin making content for Facebook. So far the company has not delved into podcasts, Instagram or Snapchat as some other sites do.)There\u2019s a D.I.Y. spirit and modest scale to the New Rockstars operation. When Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss taped their breakdown video on Monday night, they were the only two people in the studio. They watched themselves on a monitor and advanced their teleprompter with an iPhone. No one yelled \u201ccut\u201d; they just kept recording.The next morning, as Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss were preparing to finish the video, an editor discovered that Mr. Voss\u2019s microphone had failed during the taping the night before. They didn\u2019t have time to rerecord, so they trudged ahead. That afternoon, Mr. Molina used an audio app to isolate and tweak Mr. Voss\u2019s vocal track from what his own microphone had captured.\u201cYou could replace everything in that studio with $5,000 and an Amazon Prime account,\u201d Mr. Molina said, \u201cand it would all be here in two days.\u201dNew Rockstars has only been in a studio since May; before that, Mr. Molina\u2019s apartment or whatever space they could find sufficed. But the smarts of their analysis, and the engaging presence the two men have on camera, more than make up for the bare-bones production.Advertisement"}

When you hear people say \u201cWe\u2019re creating more jobs,\u201d what they don\u2019t say is that, while that\u2019s true, most of that has been in the Bay Area and along the coast.I think we should all be concerned that Marin County has among the nation\u2019s highest rankings for well-being and 100 miles away in the Central Valley, they have among the lowest.What\u2019s your pitch to the Bay Area?The pitch to the Bay Area and to the affluent parts of Los Angeles or San Diego or any place on the coast is that we won\u2019t survive and thrive if we\u2019re not growing together.A high-wage worker puts more money into our Social Security system. A high-wage worker is buying more goods. A high-wage worker is less dependent on the public health system.How do you assess Eric Garcetti\u2019s tenure as mayor of Los Angeles?Oh, I\u2019m not running against Garcetti.You\u2019re the former mayor, you must ... I take a page out of Bush\u2019s playbook, where he didn\u2019t comment about Obama, and Obama doesn\u2019t comment for the most part about Trump \u2014 you would think he\u2019d comment a lot more given what Trump does \u2014 but you know Garcetti is a very popular mayor in this town.

{"Headline": "When a Scented Candle Just Won\u2019t Do", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipNow, those very same smells are also perfuming the living rooms and bedrooms of many private residences.But increasingly, these companies are finding a new revenue stream in the home market. (In other words, pull out those plug-ins.)\u201cOur company grew rapidly because when we would put a scent into a Sonesta hotel or a Ritz-Carlton or a Melia resort, guests would go up to the front desk and ask how they could get it,\u201d said Spence Levy, president of Air Esscentials. \u201cThe home market has grown 35 percent a year for us every year since we started in 2007.\u201dDrugstores and other retailers are fully stocked with low-cost home fragrances, from room sprays to candles and wall plug-ins. Now, thanks to Air Esscentials and other such firms, there are options on the higher end: compact yet high-powered diffusers that will infuse scent throughout a room for hours or days at a time.Jeanette Wolfe, a holistic health educator, is a big fan of such devices and a big believer in the power of scent to increase energy and \u201cdrop you into a calm place,\u201d as she put it.She used to rely on old-fashioned methods to perfume her Victorian home in Princeton, N.J.: dried flowers and squares of muslin that were infused with essential oils and placed in the air vents. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t as strong or clear or efficient a scent as I wanted,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said.Citrus, typically a combination of mandarin and bergamot, wafts through the first floor of Ms. Wolfe\u2019s home, while frankincense and sandalwood perfume the bedrooms on the two upper levels. And to get rid of the \u201cold house\u201d smell of the basement, Ms. Wolfe favors \u201cgrounded scents\u201d like evergreen, pine, mint and spearmint. \u201cBut I change them seasonally,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll add spices during the holiday season. I\u2019ll shift them if I\u2019m having a dinner party. I\u2019ll shift them depending on my mood.\u201dThe home fragrance market is a $6.4 billion business at the retail level, according to a 2016 study by Kline, a market research and consulting firm in Parsippany, N.J. Using data from a Simmons national consumer survey, the online research company Statista calculated that 73 percent of Americans used room deodorizers and air freshener sprays last year; the figure is poised to hit 77 percent by 2020.More than just a way of eliminating odor (we\u2019re talking about you, Fido and Frisky), home fragrance has lately become a means of self-expression. \u201cIt\u2019s an element of design, like the colors on the wall or the furniture \u2014 it\u2019s a way for people to communicate who they are,\u201d said Richard Weening, chief executive of Prolitec, the Milwaukee-based commercial air care company that recently introduced Aera.\u201cI do not think I\u2019ve met an individual who doesn\u2019t respond to scents,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said.Still, there are many who consider lemon-infused air to be a luxury, maybe even a necessity. \u201cThe general principle is: People like places that smell good, and they don\u2019t like places that smell bad,\u201d said Mr. Weening of Prolitec.To hear him tell it, the conventional tools deployed for making a place smell good \u2014 candles, sprays, wax melts, reed diffusers, and so-called liquid electricals like plug-ins \u2014 leave something to be desired. The scents are heavy, inconsistent and, in his view, maybe just a bit unrefined. \u201cIt\u2019s that New York taxicab smell,\u201d Mr. Weening said.Two years ago, Dimitri Gailit, the chief executive of AromaTech, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, noticed that his company was fielding calls from clients who wanted their residences to smell as inviting as their stores.\u201cSo we decided to make every one of our products available for home use,\u201d he said.The devices, sold through the company\u2019s website and Amazon, include the AromaCube ($30), a battery-operated diffuser meant for a small space like a bathroom; the AromaPod ($129), designed for up to 500 square feet; and the industrial-strength AromaPro ($849), which comes with an HVAC adapter, meaning it can work through a customer\u2019s home heating and air-conditioning system.The company\u2019s cold air diffusion process breaks down aroma oils and essential oils \u2014 the most popular are white tea and thyme, and oriental garden \u2014 and disperses them in the form of dry vapor.Depending on the device, customers can digitally adjust the intensity of the vapor as well as the hours that it is dispersed. Control of the diffusers via an app is in the planning stages.\u201cThere are people who are buying our machines for aromatherapy,\u201d Mr. Gailit said, \u201cand then there are customers who want to create a certain ambience in their home, like when they\u2019re having a party. They may be having a tropical-themed party or a chocolate fondue party, so they\u2019ll disperse a fragrance like coconut spice or chocolate.\u201dCustomers have responded, Mr. Gailit said: \u201cSince we introduced our consumer line, we have significantly increased our business.\u201dMr. Weening said he had had the same experience since Aera hit the market. \u201cWe\u2019re way ahead of where we expected to be with sales,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are buying multiple machines.\u201dAroma360\u2019s clients are mostly commercial, \u201cbut a lot of business owners asked for scents in their home as well,\u201d said Meghan McMahon, the company\u2019s director of marketing. Residential customers can choose from cold air diffusers that range in price from $149 (for 300 to 800 square feet) to $1,499 (to cover up to 6,000 square feet).ScentAir, too, ventured into the home fragrance market at the urging of commercial customers. But rather than sell directly to the consumer, ScentAir has made its home fragrance system \u2014 which is essentially a high-end plug in that costs $130 \u2014 available exclusively on the websites of hotel clients like Marriott and Westin.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice tie-in for us,\u201d said Edward Burke, ScentAir\u2019s vice president of customer strategy and communications. \u201cAnd by offering the home version on the hotels\u2019 websites, it helps us be a better partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We don\u2019t know if it has staying power.\u2019\u2019These objects are an example of \u2018\u2018memewear\u2019\u2019: the tangible detritus of a very popular, very temporary joke. Consider the face of the world-weary scholar whose BBC interview on South Korean politics was interrupted by his toddler lunging into the room. Now consider that face on a softball tee. A meme is intended to be seen only through glass: thumbed past on a Facebook feed, endlessly retooled in Reddit threads, batted across Twitter like a cat\u2019s feather toy, its own form of visual punctuation. When you first see it become physical, it feels like a hallucination, the stuff of your insomniac scrollings made manifest in the mundane world. Then comes a glorious shock of recognition, almost a thrill of the illicit: Should this be happening?You can break memewear down into categories. There\u2019s whimsically offensive: the Bed Intruder Halloween costume, which calls back to a man who found brief viral fame after his local news segment on a botched home invasion was set to music, consists of a wig and a do-rag in a box. There are animals on totes: lolcats requesting cheezburger or riding tacos through a cosmic backdrop, honey badgers refusing to tolerate your nonsense, the awed-looking shiba inu, known simply as the doge. (\u2018\u2018Wow,\u2019\u2019 one shirt reads, in the doge\u2019s distinctive Comic Sans patois. \u2018\u2018Very style. So shirt.\u2019\u2019) These are all classic memes, clever but innocent, like a smart-alecky fourth grader. Made by thousands of independent producers, distributed on Etsy and CafePress and Redbubble or mocked up by hand, memewear is for the Everyman.Memewear has its roots in fandom, though it\u2019s a limited precedent. In the 1960s, Andy Warhol played with the sheer ubiquity of pop-culture icons, retooling famous faces in lavender and yellow and silk-screening them on canvas. His waggish reconfigurations laid the groundwork for the self-diminishing T-shirts of the 1980s, with their stoned borrowings from television catchphrases and kitschy advertisements (\u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the beef?\u2019\u2019) that lost their tang by the early 1990s.At its most pure, fandom is an expression of mass enthusiasm. But memewear is about mass awareness, a completely democratic form of snobbery. Just as an NPR tote can occasionally be less about showing support for \u2018\u2018All Things Considered\u2019\u2019 than for the idea of news literacy, memewear establishes an in-group of the well-informed. It is a nod made flesh.Fashion\u2019s value is pinned to its materials. So what is memewear worth? If rare or labor-intensive materials like gold or silk are valuable and common ones like rayon and nylon are less so, what to make of a shirt spun of ubiquity? How do you appraise a dress made not of cotton but of pure recognition? You may as well try to market the air. A lolcat sweater is not meant for passing on, having none of the staying power my sister craved. Its magic lies in its complete disposability. It\u2019s a souvenir from time spent in an invisible world: I spent hours roaming the nether regions of Tumblr and all I got was this lousy hat.Unlike tchotchkes, collectibles and kitsch, memewear is not memorabilia: It accrues no value. Memewear, like a new car, starts leaking value as soon as it\u2019s off the lot. It is inherently ephemeral, but it is, crucially, less ephemeral than the images it pays tribute to. A \u2018\u2018Covfefe\u2019\u2019 tee (and inevitably, a \u2018\u2018Nevertheless, She Covfefed\u2019\u2019 tee) makes the internet real, gives it substance and shape. It lets our thoughts wear clothes. In blending the material world with the web, memewear proposes a compromise between what\u2019s stable and what\u2019s fluid. Fashion is written text, laid down in lace and aglets. The internet \u2014 your Twitter feed, your Amazon-recommended purchases, the Wikipedia page on Nicole Kidman\u2019s musical career \u2014 is a conversation, vanishing even as we have it. Memewear is an oral-history project, recording our community\u2019s customs before they can disappear.For me, memewear remains purely aspirational. I dress in neutral tones and generous plaids. I am afraid to wear colorful jeans. But I want to be bold enough to wear something that will be ridiculous in five months, if it isn\u2019t ridiculous already. Memewear may be more temporary than a tattoo, but it still functions as a statement of purpose, even if that statement is a rhinestone-studded \u2018\u2018meh.\u2019\u2019The \u2018\u2018Nevertheless, She Persisted\u2019\u2019 pencil pouch my sister rejected was the best possible option, a contradictory statement of purpose. It doesn\u2019t persist; that\u2019s the point. The \u2018\u2018Make America Read Again\u2019\u2019 hats in the gift section of the Strand now sit on the racks like deflated party balloons. In a bitter season in which we\u2019ve been forced to admit we don\u2019t share the same facts anymore, let alone the same cultural icons or values, memewear provides a modest acknowledgment of shared conditions, eliciting an all-too-rare murmur of recognition. It teaches us to accept that this moment, too, will pass.Jamie Fisher is a freelance writer and book reviewer. She is writing a novel set in postwar Italy.Advertisement"}

Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.With the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.That budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201dMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.It is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.But as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.And while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.It has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.Unlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.YouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.Although Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine. Originally, YouTube and its subscription YouTube Red channel were largely focused on creating bigger budget shows for YouTube stars.Data searches, Mr. Kyncl said, provided a \u201cwindow into the demand of Hollywood product on YouTube.\u201d\u201cWhy not fulfill this demand?\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes absolute sense. It\u2019s in the service of our users.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Is Said to Open Broad Inquiry Into China\u2019s Trade Practices", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is preparing to open a broad investigation into China\u2019s trade practices, according to people with knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s plans, amid growing worries in the United States over a Chinese government-led effort to make the country a global leader in microchips, electric cars and other crucial technologies of the future.The investigation will focus on alleged Chinese violations of American intellectual property, according to three people with a detailed knowledge of the administration\u2019s plans. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not yet public.Any move by the Trump administration to punish China over its trade practices would raise tensions within the world\u2019s largest trade relationship between two countries. China\u2019s export sector still contributes heavily to its economy growth despite Beijing\u2019s efforts to diversify its economy, and China represents a lucrative market for American automakers, technology companies like Apple, farmers and many others.At the same time, the Chinese government has demanded that American companies cut the licensing fees that they charge for key patents and has insisted that companies set up joint ventures to do business in China.Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official and longtime trade expert who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing research group, said that the Chinese government would study any American trade case before deciding how to respond and whether to seek intervention from the World Trade Organization, which hears trade disputes.\u201cChina thinks that the bilateral trade relation is governed by W.T.O. rules, not American domestic law,\u201d Mr. He said.Then the policy began to founder.The two sides met on July 19 to produce a series of trade deals that could be portrayed as an \u201cearly harvest\u201d in the three months following Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with President Xi Jinping of China last spring at Mar-a-Lago, Trump administration officials and trade policy advisers said. The two sides were unable to agree on any deals that went significantly beyond what China had previously promised the Obama administration, they said. Both sides ended up abruptly canceling the news conferences they had scheduled to discuss what were supposed to have been their accomplishments.China has also publicly dismissed linking trade and North Korea policy and defended its efforts to improve intellectual property protections. \u201cChina highly emphasizes intellectual property protection and has taken many effective measures,\u201d said Sun Jiwen, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, in May following criticism from American trade officials.Under the process that the Trump administration plans to set in motion, the Office of the United States Trade Representative will start an investigation into China\u2019s trade practices. Following the investigation, which could be completed in as little as a few months, the United States could impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports, rescind licenses for Chinese companies to do business in the United States, or take other measures. The process is known as a Section 301 investigation, after the relevant portions of the 1974 Trade Act.Much is at stake for both sides. Exports to the United States represent more than 4 percent of China\u2019s entire economic output. Those exports have created tens of millions of jobs in China and prompted multinationals to shift thousands of factories to China along with much of their latest technology. American exports to China are much smaller, representing about two-thirds of 1 percent of the American economy.American companies have tended to supply the Chinese market using factories and staff in China, instead of exports from the United States. But their profits from the Chinese market are large enough that many corporate executives have been loath to cooperate with United States trade officials, for fear that Chinese government ministries may retaliate against them.The potential impact of the American investigation is unclear at this early stage. Still, previous cases suggest their effect on China\u2019s industrial ambitions may be limited.Mindful of those limits, Congressional Republicans discussed in recent months whether to include what is known as a border adjusted tax, which would penalize all imports while benefiting exports, in their plans to overhaul the tax code this year. But the proposed tax ran into heavy opposition from retailers like Wal-Mart that rely heavily on selling goods imported from China.Until a couple weeks ago, it had looked as though the first industry on which the Trump administration would confront China would be steel. But any move to punish Chinese steel imports could hit other nations, too, and the Trump administration decided last month to rely instead on negotiations among the Group of 20 member countries scheduled for August and November.The United States used Section 301 energetically against other countries during the Reagan administration and the administration of President George Bush. Mr. Lighthizer was a deputy United States trade representative in the Reagan administration and has been an advocate of shielding the American industrial base from government-assisted foreign competitors.But the cases then thoroughly antagonized America\u2019s trading partners.\u201cIt was really the aggressive uses of this in the late 1980s and early 1990s that prompted the rest of the world to set up the dispute resolution system\u201d of the World Trade Organization, said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics here.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherJane Perlez contributed reporting, and Ailin Tang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}

The new money will go to redesigning the site and creating a better mobile version, in the mold of more modern services \u2014 it will look like Facebook or Twitter, per Recode, the technology site. This sounds smart, but entrenched communities tend to hate change, so we\u2019ll see what Reddit\u2019s hordes have to say about this.I can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do with a virtual assistant, though perhaps it would help me remember to pay rent on time, which I am constitutionally incapable of doing. In any case, I\u2019m curious to see how Facebook decides to use the tech. Perhaps they\u2019ll incorporate it into Messenger, the chat app that was playing around with its own virtual assistant ideas.I thought it was crazy and something I\u2019d never use, but a lot of folks on Twitter told me it\u2019s absolutely perfect for older people like their grandparents, who love to use video chat to keep in touch with family. Maybe I\u2019m wrong? Maybe I\u2019m just too young and cool to understand? Help me, Farhad.That\u2019s not good! But I can stomach it as long as they don\u2019t start leaking \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spoilers all over the place.Do you have any Bitcoin, Farhad? Or perhaps now some Bitcoin Cash?The caveats: This all happened last year, and Snap said the rumors were false (though there may have been \u201cinformal\u201d talks, according to B.I.). It may not have been a real serious possibility, and often when rumors like these get floated, it stems from folks who have quite a vested interest in making an acquisition actually happen.Advertisers are noticing. I keep hearing chatter about ad budgets being moved from Snapchat over to Instagram, which offers a nearly identical product but with better advertising technology and a much larger base of users. If you\u2019re an ad exec looking to spend dollars on digital ads aimed at youngsters, it seems like kind of an easy choice.So perhaps a bailout acquisition by Google would actually make a modicum of sense. Think back to when Facebook bought Instagram. Mark Zuckerberg basically said, \u201ckeep doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d to Instagram, and acted to help supplement Instagram\u2019s growth only by providing some of Facebook\u2019s strongest assets. Facebook is sitting on a mountain of sophisticated ad technology, not to mention hundreds of thousands of eager advertisers looking for more space to buy ads.I could see Google and Snap in a similar situation, especially since Snap is actively in the market to improve its advertising technology through a potential acquisition or two, as we\u2019ve heard rumors of over the past few months. Selling out seems like a no-brainer to me, even if it\u2019s a tacit admission that the company couldn\u2019t make it alone on the public markets.Also, it\u2019s expensive. Even for Google, tens of billions of dollars on a second-place social networking company might be too much to swallow. Also, aren\u2019t we holding out for Google to buy Twitter? How many social networks can we expect Google to save?Anyway, I\u2019m going to Disneyland, Mike! See you in a couple of weeks.Advertisement"}

As we grow older, time is punctuated by appointments and alarm clocks, and we forget how to live at our own pace.When we set off on an overland road trip in a van five years ago, we wanted to slow down time again by raising a family on the road and use their questions about nature and life as our curriculum. We are world-schooling our kids.Many factors determine our plans. Weather and finances help us decide which activities we do, where to camp and how long to stay. We have a loose idea of where we want to be for, say, a season, or if we need to meet someone somewhere in three months.From the highlands of La Paz, Bolivia, it took us three days to drive to the Amazon basin. After a few days by boat from Rurrenabaque, we met some locals who had just rescued this baby howler monkey the night before. They discovered it crying alone on the forest floor, and guessed that it was an orphan.When we saw these incredible rock faces in the Potosi department of Bolivia, we decided we\u2019d have to stop to climb them. We consulted local shepherds at Estancia Churata, who confirmed that bolted sport-climbing routes were there. The sight on the ground, though, awed us.

{"Headline": "With Disney\u2019s Move to Streaming, a New Era Begins", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Disney set off a sonic boom in Hollywood by unveiling plans to start two Netflix-style services: For the first time in the streaming age, the world\u2019s largest media company had decided that embracing a new business model was more important than clinging to its existing one.Disney\u2019s decision to better align itself with consumer trends \u2014 deemed \u201ca rare and impressive pivot\u201d by RBC Capital Markets \u2014 instantly reverberated through the entertainment industry. Disney\u2019s cable channels, which include ESPN, have long been seen as the reason many viewers were refraining from cutting the cord entirely. If Disney was going all in on streaming, the impact would be felt by almost every television company and cable operator.As part of its announcement on Tuesday, Disney said that it would spend heavily on original programming for its entertainment streaming service and pull future Disney and Pixar movies from Netflix. That sent Netflix shares downward. The question seemed to be, how would Netflix, even with its head start in terms of audience and reach, manage without the mighty mouse? And would Disney\u2019s plunge into streaming encourage the likes of Discovery and Viacom to do the same, intensifying competition?And would viewers who want to eschew traditional cable subscriptions eventually find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of streaming services they would need to cobble together to watch what they wanted to watch?On Wednesday, as analysts and investors scratched for answers, few firm ones emerged. In a research report, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, summed up Disney\u2019s streaming plans, especially for movies and television, as \u201caggressively\u201d pushing \u201cthe traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dDisney investors may also be worried about the enormous spending it will take to build two streaming services. Some might have been underwhelmed by the company\u2019s plans or might have thought that the decision came much too late.\u201cWhat Disney is doing is a really big deal in terms of trying new things, and I don\u2019t think it even has answers to some of these questions, including what the services will cost,\u201d said Michael Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and digital video consultancy. \u201cBut it\u2019s clearly not the end of linear television. It\u2019s not the end of Netflix.\u201dBut this still-unnamed subscription service is designed to protect the cable bundle, at least initially. The service will offer only sports programming that is not available on ESPN\u2019s traditional channels. Only people who also pay to receive ESPN the old-fashioned way (via a cable or satellite hookup) will be able to stream ESPN\u2019s core offerings, including N.F.L. and N.B.A. games.Mr. Iger has also made an important calculation that Disney \u2014 unlike most of its competitors \u2014 has programming that is must-have in the old model (cable and satellite) and in the new (streaming). Put another way, Disney has the power to introduce streaming offerings around ESPN, Pixar films and Disney Channel shows without worrying about being dropped by third-party distributors, including upstarts like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue.PlayStation Vue, for instance, tried to introduce a \u201cskinny\u201d television package without ESPN in March 2015 and drew little consumer interest. When PlayStation Vue started offering ESPN in spring 2016, the distributor quickly started gaining traction.Disney\u2019s announcement had an immediate impact on Netflix, as the news media raced to pit the two companies against each other, and some investors worried about Disney taking back its movies. (Starting in late 2019, new-release Disney and Pixar films will move to Disney\u2019s entertainment-focused streaming service.) On Wednesday, Netflix shares declined 1.5 percent, to $175.78.Omar Sheikh, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Disney\u2019s move \u201carguably reduces the consumer value of Netflix.\u201dBut most analysts contended that the news was less worrisome for Netflix than it would initially seem. \u201cWe don\u2019t view this as a strike at Netflix, as the content being pulled is actually rather limited,\u201d said Mr. Creutz of Cowan and Company.Disney has not yet decided whether to pull its Marvel or \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies from Netflix. Netflix will not lose access to Marvel-branded television shows like \u201cThe Defenders\u201d because Netflix is a co-producer of them.Executives at Disney and Netflix declined to comment publicly on Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Netflix said, \u201cWe continue to do business with the Walt Disney Company on many fronts, including our ongoing deal with Marvel TV.\u201dNotably, Netflix has been building up a huge original movie operation, including spending the $90 million \u201cBright,\u201d a forthcoming Will Smith movie. Netflix plans to start making as many as 50 of its own movies annually.BamTech, which Disney plans to use as the backbone of its streaming services, has substantial operations. But Disney faces a steep learning curve. By the time Disney even introduces its entertainment-based service in 2019, Netflix will have about 64 million subscribers in the United States and 158 million worldwide, according to BTIG Research.Disney would probably contend that Netflix\u2019s head start is irrelevant.\u201cIt\u2019s high time we got in this business,\u201d Mr. Iger told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cThe profitability, the revenue-generating capability of this initiative is substantially greater than the business models we\u2019re currently being served by.\u201dIn the end, there was only one aspect of Disney\u2019s move that everyone seemed to agree on: The streaming boom is only beginning.The race for streaming supremacy, Mr. Creutz said, \u201cmay well accelerate problems for the whole ecosystem via atomization of content and an overpopulation of content apps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Brotman, Founder of Retail Juggernaut Costco, Dies at 74", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeff Brotman, a founder of Costco, which became one of the world\u2019s largest retailers by luring loyal, card-carrying customers to its cavernous stores with startlingly low prices on everyday products, died on Tuesday in Medina, Wash. He was 74.Costco Wholesale of Issaquah, Wash., announced his death but gave no cause. The company said Mr. Brotman had attended a dinner for its warehouse managers on Monday night in nearby Seattle.He had been a reluctant retailer at first. After working in his family\u2019s chain of 18 men\u2019s stores during college, Mr. Brotman sought to escape a retail career by applying for law school. But his business acumen proved too compelling.After his father suggested that he replicate Price Club, a pioneering San Diego-based chain of warehouse stores for small businesses, Jeff Brotman teamed up with James Sinegal, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sol Price, the chain\u2019s founder and a retailing genius himself.Mr. Brotman went on to obtain critical financing from a venture capitalist, Fred Paulsell, whom he had met when their plane was struck by lightning and made an emergency landing.Their first Costco warehouse store opened in Seattle in 1983 (the same year Sam Walton opened Sam\u2019s Club); the company merged with Price Club a decade later.It soon became a global retailing juggernaut by offering consumer goods at rock-bottom prices (from 20-cent diapers in boxes of 198 to rotisserie chickens that it sold at a loss for $4.99), sticking to a no-frills inventory, and encouraging customer loyalty with annual membership fees.Costco was the world\u2019s largest retailer of a wide range of products, including organic foods and wine, in recent years. The company took in about $120 billion last year, its revenues second only to Walmart (although Costco was recently bumped to third place by Amazon).\u201cJeff understood immediately that there was an opening there,\u201d his brother, Michel, told The Seattle Times this week. \u201cThe Price Club idea appealed even to people with money \u2014 the idea of being able to buy value at the right price. It wasn\u2019t about buying cheap. It was about buying good value.\u201dWhile Mr. Sinegal was largely the public face of the company as its chief executive until 2012, Mr. Brotman served as its less visible chairman from the beginning. He became expert in scouting the most profitable locations for Costco\u2019s warehouse stores, which now number 736 worldwide.The two partners shared a feel-good philosophy, epitomized by their motto, \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d The company\u2019s unusually generous salaries and benefits for workers rankled Wall Street stock analysts, and the partners publicly characterized their retail rivals as Scrooges (although the company settled discrimination suits by women who said they had been passed over for promotions).Jeffrey Hart Brotman, a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Romania, was born on Sept. 27, 1942, in Tacoma, Wash., to Pearl and Bernard Brotman. His Canadian-born father owned Seattle Knitting Mills and, with his brothers, a chain of haberdashers called Bernie\u2019s in Washington and Oregon.Mr. Brotman earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science at the University of Washington in 1964 and graduated from its law school in 1967.After practicing law only briefly, he and his brother opened a women\u2019s jeans store named Bottoms and later a chain of men\u2019s clothing stores called Jeffrey Michael. Jeff Brotman was also an early investor in other retail ventures, including Starbucks, which went on to build a coffee empire from its base in Seattle.Mr. Brotman married the former Susan Thrailkill, an executive for Nordstrom department stores, whom he met on a blind date. Besides his brother, Mr. Brotman is survived by his wife; their son, Justin; their daughter, Amanda Brotman-Schetritt, and two grandchildren.Mr. Brotman also drew attention as a campaign fund-raiser for Democratic candidates and, with his wife, as a philanthropist whose beneficiaries included the University of Washington and the Seattle Art Museum.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated the subject of an anecdote and misattributed a quotation that was part of it. It was Mr. Brotman\u2019s father, not Mr. Brotman, who \u201cwas against impulse buying,\u201d and it was the elder, not the younger, Mr. Brotman\u2019s wife who said her husband had disliked shopping.Advertisement"}

At one end of the yard were fresh-cut peaches, sliced prosciutto and crusty baguettes accompanied by a pile of French Normandy butter; over by the pool, the Hollywood Farmers\u2019 Market\u2019s resident \u201coyster guy\u201d stood over a trough of ice, shucking. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a dinner and have it look like a Pinterest party,\u201d Ms. Oren said with a shrug.She was born in Tel Aviv but spent the majority of her formative years here in the San Fernando Valley. Early in her career she worked in catering; some patrons of the (now-defunct) company took note of her meticulousness and hired her to plan bar mitzvahs and weddings on the side. She fell into the business she was meant to be in. \u201cI was pretty O.C.D. to begin with,\u201d she said.Every good Los Angeles story has a big break. Ms. Oren\u2019s came in 2001 when she landed Jason Bateman\u2019s wedding to Amanda Anka (though pre-\u201cArrested Development\u201d). Three years later she found herself at Kevin Costner\u2019s Colorado ranch arranging the actor\u2019s nuptials to Christine Baumgartner (though post-\u201cWaterworld\u201d). Still. A celebrity is a celebrity regardless of where they land on the bell curve of fame.As Hollywood types dipped into their Rolodex on Ms. Oren\u2019s behalf, her acolytes skewed more notable: Reese Witherspoon, Anne Hathaway, Donna Langley, Mariska Hargitay, Drew Barrymore, Adam Levine, Natalie Portman, George Lucas and Mellody Hobson.The list goes on. Try cajoling names out of Ms. Oren, though, and she\u2019ll deflect. (She says her events end up in the tabloids only when stars or their guests share information of their own accord.) With clients dropping a minimum of $2,000 per guest, no precaution is too outrageous: code names, confidentiality agreements, casual espionage. Whatever prevents the paparazzi from showing up with long lenses.\u201cShe is not someone who just plans for people,\u201d Ms. Barrymore said in an email. \u201cShe is reliable and respected. She\u2019s tough, and you know she\u2019s got your back.\u201dMs. Oren has 10 people on her staff full time, though she will sometimes bring on up to 40 part-time employees depending on a party\u2019s scope. (Earlier this year, Ms. Oren filed a lawsuit against a former employee, one she had promoted to managing partner, after their business relationship dissolved. The suit is being arbitrated.)The parties may take place in the middle of a desert, in an art gallery or on a private yacht. Sometimes events have themes (\u201cOne of our favorite clients had a New Year\u2019s Eve party and was like, \u2018Let\u2019s do a little Marie Antoinette situation,\u2019\u201d Ms. Oren said), but most are an extension of the customer. \u201cThe more you know about them, the more you know about the type of event they\u2019d throw,\u201d she said. \u201cAre these people who would go to Tangier or Istanbul? Tulum or Cabo? What kind of hotels do they stay in? I take in what they wear, I look how they decorate their house.\u201dMs. Oren\u2019s clients often have sizable requests, but it helps that they usually have the budget to match. One three-day \u201cBohemian Burning Man\u201d-inspired event in Mexico required her to hire a team of local macram\u00e9 artisans. In planning a bar mitzvah for twins, she had mirror images of their silhouettes printed onto invitations, custom guitar picks and the two sides of a Ping-Pong table. \u201cIf I had to do the same thing over and over again in three of the same hotel ballrooms or ugly country clubs, this would not be appealing,\u201d she said.Ms. Oren is not a yes-person. \u201cWe would have an idea, and Yifat would be quick to tell us we were wrong,\u201d Ms. Dakhil said. \u201cShe is so assertive about her vision, and her confidence gave us great confidence.\u201dThe dinner held in Ms. Citrone\u2019s backyard was low key by Ms. Oren\u2019s standards, but had a celebratory spirit. \u201cMy whole thing is celebrating life,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery year something happens.

{"Headline": "How Rebecca Solnit Became the Voice of the Resistance", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySubjects that the author and essayist Rebecca Solnit has written about, some at considerable length, include Irish history, atlases, Alzheimer\u2019s, a traveling medical clinic, natural disasters, urban planning, tortoises, walking, gentrification, Yosemite National Park and Apple Inc.\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something interdisciplinary at best and wildly wandering at worst about how I think,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently over the phone from San Francisco, where she lives and works. \u2018\u2018I am interested in almost everything, and it can sometimes seem like a burden.\u2019\u2019 She cited Virginia Woolf and Henry David Thoreau as the writers most important to her: \u2018\u2018Each of them wrote exquisitely about experiential, immediate encounters with the tangible world but could also be very powerful political polemicists. And the arc of their work describes a space in which you can be both.\u2019\u2019In other words, Solnit is a certain kind of celebrity, if a reluctant one. \u2018\u2018I feel that it\u2019s really important to not depend on all this in any sense and not let this define my worth or work,\u2019\u2019 she said on the phone. \u2018\u2018I wrote \u2018Hope in the Dark\u2019 14 years ago. Am I somehow better or smarter now than I was then?\u2019\u2019 The answer, of course, is no. Strange as it is to say, Solnit\u2019s newfound popularity reveals more about her readers than it does her. That the book, and her other suddenly timely work, was not written in the last several months, but rather years prior, makes its ideas seem even truer, giving it the veneer of sacred text. She has become a Cassandra figure of the left, her writing, which seems magically to have long ago said the things that many Americans now most want to hear, consumed as both balm and rallying cry.Paul Yamazaki, the head book buyer at City Lights bookstore in San Francisco, which published Solnit\u2019s first book in 1991, adds the frank, genre-defying works of Kathy Acker and Jane Bowles to the list, but can\u2019t quite conjure a unifying theory of what all of these authors share. \u2018\u2018I wish I had one!\u2019\u2019 he laughed over the phone. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d be a much better bookseller if I did.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s worth noting, however, that these belatedly embraced writers seem to be mostly female. Perhaps it\u2019s because no one listens to them the first time they speak.There\u2019s another reason, too, that we look to the past for our current intellectual decipherers and idols. In the Trump era, Solnit, who writes against corruption of all kinds \u2014 environmental, political, social \u2014 seems herself wholly uncorrupted: by these sorts of discussions of commercial popularity; by the harried activity of online life; by the social spheres of Washington, D.C., and New York City; by the aesthetic fetishization that so many women writers are subject to. \u2018\u2018If you think of a kind of ecology of ideas, there are more than enough people telling us how horrific and terrible and bad everything is, and I don\u2019t really need to join that project,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a whole other project of trying to counterbalance that \u2014 sometimes we do win and this is how it worked in the past.\u2019\u2019 She continued, \u2018\u2018Change is often unpredictable and indirect. We don\u2019t know the future. We\u2019ve changed the world many times, and remembering that, that history, is really a source of power to continue and it doesn\u2019t get talked about nearly enough.\u2019\u2019For years, Solnit has been traveling with photographer friends to Lake Powell, a massive reservoir on the central border of Utah and Arizona that was formerly a series of magnificent sandstone gorges known as Glen Canyon. She has written about the awe-inspiring industriousness that is responsible for the lake \u2014 its creation, by damming the Colorado River, began in the late 1950s, and it took 17 years to fill to capacity \u2014 but also about the hubris that imbues it; it is, she says, \u2018\u2018failing quite spectacularly,\u2019\u2019 with water levels dropping significantly over the last two decades.The excursions come as a relief. \u2018\u2018Writing about the politics of this moment sort of feels like being stranded in the shallows, and means not writing about deeper cultural forces and longer timeframes in history,\u2019\u2019 she said. As the water levels of Lake Powell have dropped, the Colorado River has begun to re-emerge in some places. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not exactly hopeful,\u2019\u2019 Solnit said. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s something that\u2019s neither victory nor defeat. That\u2019s really interesting to me.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stitching Together Forests Can Help Save Species, Study Finds", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in recent years, some ecologists have asked whether they can help stave off an extinction crisis by, in effect, running Dr. Lovejoy\u2019s experiment in reverse. The idea is to link together the world\u2019s remaining forest islands by planting small corridors of trees between them, allowing native birds, mammals and plants to spread between the fragments, mingle with their brethren and become more resilient against extinction threats.On average, the populations in the connected forests were expected to survive 13 times as long as they would in isolated forest fragments.Although the newly built corridors need to be studied in more detail, Dr. Pimm said, early signs are encouraging.\u201cWe\u2019re already observing golden lion tamarins passing through, which means they\u2019re less likely to be isolated, they can meet tamarins elsewhere, and local populations are less likely to wink out,\u201d he said.The authors make the case that such corridors would be relatively cheap, costing an estimated $21 million to $49 million to reconnect fragmented forests in Brazil and Tanzania.Such corridors, they note, may also help plant and animal species adapt to climate change by making it easier for them to migrate to cooler habitats and higher elevations as temperatures rise.\u201cThe idea we wanted to get across is that reconnecting these landscapes doesn\u2019t cost all that much if you\u2019re smart about it,\u201d Dr. Jenkins said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring back the forest everywhere to create a lot of positive benefits.\u201dIt can take several decades for replanted corridors to blossom into lush forests that birds feel comfortable traveling through, the authors noted. Given that many species are predicted to disappear from their fragments in less than a decade, even a well-designed corridor may prove too little, too late for some.More broadly, Dr. Simberloff argued that overhyping the benefits of corridors may mislead people into thinking \u201cwe can make a meaningful contribution to conservation on the cheap,\u201d when larger-scale efforts to protect and rebuild forests may ultimately prove necessary to save their native species.\u201cThis paper offers good evidence that you can get a lot of bang for the buck with corridors,\u201d he said.Still, building wildlife corridors is not always easy, Dr. Jenkins said. It often requires buying farmland and painstakingly regrowing forests, keeping out invasive grasses and preventing fires. In some areas, conservationists may need to build large forested bridges over highways to allow species to pass through.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go in and plant trees and walk away,\u201d Dr. Jenkins said. \u201cThe key to making these corridors work is often to make sure local people are involved and committed to taking care of them.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

Compare that rating with how they thought others did in leading their companies: 79 percent for Steve Jobs, 69 percent for Mark Zuckerberg and 36 percent for the most recent Uber chief executive, Travis Kalanick.\u2022 Thirty-five percent of respondents said Uber should pick Mr. Immelt as its next chief executive. About 53 percent said they were undecided.\u2022 Thirty-three percent said Mr. Immelt would do a better job than Mr. Kalanick did as Uber\u2019s chief executive. Just 9 percent of respondents said they thought that Mr. Kalanick would be the superior leader.\u2022 One in four respondents said that Uber should bring back Mr. Kalanick as chief executive, while one in three said that Mr. Kalanick should not return.Mathew Martoma, once a portfolio manager for Steven A. Cohen, was convicted in 2014 of what prosecutors called the most lucrative insider trading scheme of all time.He has since argued that the jury in his trial may not have been properly instructed and that the evidence presented wasn\u2019t enough to support a conviction.The decision comes as some relief for the United States Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. Under Preet Bharara, the office embarked on a sweeping investigation of insider trading that led to a wave of convictions. But many were undone by a Supreme Court decision, United States v. Newman, that effectively raised the bar for evidence needed to convict someone for insider trading.Mr. Martoma had been relying on the Newman case to buttress his appeal. But the panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit looked to a newer decision by the Supreme Court, Salman v. United States, that effectively lowered the bar for evidence once more.But one of the three Second Circuit judges dissented, which may set the stage for Mr. Martoma\u2019s lawyers to ask for the entire appellate court to consider the appeal.Amazon and Whole Foods are nearly ready to combine.Federal antitrust regulators approved Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, and Whole Foods shareholders approved the $13.4 billion deal.The deal was not expected to be blocked because there was little overlap in Amazon and Whole Foods businesses. Amazon\u2019s grocery delivery business still accounts for only a small share of total grocery spending in the United States. And while Whole Foods is a prominent presence, its share in the grocery market remains relatively small.Prosecutors have cast Lee Jae-yong, the heir to the Samsung empire, as a mastermind bent on breaking the law to protect his family\u2019s wealth and power. They have accused him of paying $38 million in bribes to maintain control of Samsung without paying taxes.Mr. Lee paints himself as a detached leader with little knowledge of the inner workings of his companies. He was too busy building global alliances to be involved in the day-to-day operations, Samsung says.The judgment comes after the South Korean public has soured on Samsung. Though the conglomerate is known around the world for its electronics, it is viewed by many at home as holding back the country and financing political corruption.Whatever the judge decides, it isn\u2019t likely to look good for the de facto leader of Samsung. \u201cIn the trial, you come away with the impression that he is incompetent or at least he didn\u2019t know his own company,\u201d Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book about Samsung, told The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Washington Tries to Protect Tech, China Could Fight Back", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration moves to take on China over intellectual property, Washington will find it has limited firepower. Beijing has a strong grip on American technology companies, and global trade rules could favor China.But China can play a strong defense. The country has broad latitude, under special rules it negotiated with the World Trade Organization, to maintain restrictions within its market.\u201cThe problem is that U.S. trade negotiators agreed to provisions allowing China to limit market access for U.S. companies unless they engaged in joint ventures,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which Congress created to monitor the relationship between the two countries.\u201cPotential Chinese partners demand the family jewels,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies can say no, but too many give in to Chinese pressure to make a quick buck.\u201dThe current trade frictions trace back to the Clinton administration.When China was entering the W.T.O. in 1999 and 2000, American negotiators gave Beijing some leeway, a position later supported by the administration of George W. Bush. As a developing country, China was allowed extra protections, such as requirements that companies in critical industries work with Chinese partners. China, in return, promised to shed the extra rules gradually as its economy matured.But Beijing did not open up, even as China evolved into an economic powerhouse. Quite the opposite has happened under President Xi Jinping, who has pursued a more nationalistic agenda than his reform-minded predecessors.China now sees the technology sector as a critical piece of its industrial policy \u2014 a policy that Beijing is aggressively enlisting American tech giants to support and that the leadership will most likely go all out to protect.Beijing\u2019s demands have been partly driven by security concerns, particularly after disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, of electronic spying by the United States on China\u2019s rapid military buildup.China has also been explicit about its economic motives, seeking to dominate fast-growing global industries that could create millions of well-paid jobs for a generation of increasingly well-educated young Chinese.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.In several cases, China\u2019s strategy to control technology approaches the kind of oversight most countries reserve for industries serving the military or government.In the chip sector, a major initiative intended to lift Chinese capabilities has drafted America\u2019s biggest makers of the electronic brains that run everything from smartphones to driverless cars. Over the past four years, America\u2019s largest chip companies have entered into a dizzying network of partnerships unlike anything they have anywhere else.Qualcomm works with a company in southwest China to develop server chips. In 2014, Intel signed agreements with two Chinese chip makers, Spreadtrum and Rockchip, to give it a leg up in the market for China\u2019s smartphones and tablets. Last year, Intel agreed to a partnership with the influential Tsinghua University in China as part of a bid to make server chips that match local specifications.American technology companies can find themselves at a serious disadvantage in China unless they agree to cooperate with government-linked Chinese businesses.Take cloud computing, the fast-growing business of leasing computer power to companies. Chinese laws require foreign companies to join with local partners and allow them only a minority stake. International businesses are also blocked from branding such services under their own names.Both Microsoft and Amazon, dominant forces in cloud computing in the United States, have local partnerships in China. By contrast, China\u2019s e-commerce giant Alibaba operates two data centers in the United States without any partner.Another rule calls for data about Chinese consumers or business operations to be stored in China. Apple and Amazon recently set up data centers in China, again with local partners, to store more customer information in the country.Against that backdrop, the call for trade action is attracting bipartisan support.China can make its own play under global trade rules. Beijing can quickly demand binding arbitration \u2014 and could have a good chance of winning. China was allowed into the W.T.O. with very few limits on its ability to regulate services or foreign investment, two categories in which China was fairly weak when it entered the organization in 2001.If China did win a W.T.O. case, it would then have the right to restrict American exports to the same extent that the United States restricts Chinese imports.China consistently exports four times as much to the United States as it imports. Even so, China could penalize American companies like Apple and Starbucks that have very large operations that produce and sell in China with minimal imports from the United States.\u201cU.S. negotiators, I think, basically dropped the ball,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a longtime trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to the rules on services that were negotiated when China entered the W.T.O. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think China was very important.\u201dOn Twitter follow Keith Bradsher, @KeithBradsher, and Paul Mozur, @PaulMozurPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Any sensible production of the play has to choose which of its currencies to spend; there are simply too many for one evening. A credible version may emphasize the otherworldly charm of its fairyland, the pomp and politics of its nobles, the romantic melee of its lovers or the slapstick antics of its \u201cmechanicals\u201d rehearsing their play \u2014 or some combination thereof.An ideal production does more: It balances the busyness of all these worlds with the pain and foolishness such busyness engenders.This makes for a decisively upbeat take on a story that can as easily be agonizing. Though \u201cMidsummer\u201d is set in motion by a supernatural feud between the fairy royals Oberon (Richard Poe) and Titania (Phylicia Rashad), and though the lovers\u2019 misalignments and inconstancies are abetted by magic potions dispensed by the sprite Puck (Kristine Nielsen), its core is the human suffering that comes with love and its lack. When the nobleman Theseus warns Hermia to \u201cquestion your desires,\u201d he is telling us something about the play as well: Its humor is built on a profound examination of real, not painted, tears.Real tears are absent in the park, but the play hangs together anyway. Ms. deBessonet focuses on the way the characters, of whatever world, reflect varieties rather than specificities of human affection. Theseus and his Amazon fianc\u00e9e Hippolyta must convert their former enmity (as opponents in war) into marital unity, which the bloviating Bhavesh Patel and the quietly queenly De\u2019Adre Aziza bring off uncommonly well. Titania and Oberon represent the disgruntlements of a later stage of marriage; beneath her hauteur, Ms. Rashad admits a hint of fallibility, and Mr. Poe, beneath his bluster, more than a hint of guilt.Even the workingmen\u2019s presentation of their play, always the most purely foolish element of \u201cMidsummer,\u201d sticks to the program: Their text \u2014 a \u201ctedious brief scene\u201d of young Pyramus and Thisbe \u2014 is a love story. (Jeff Hiller, deadpanning in drag as Thisbe, gets some real feeling out of the role.) And what is the transformation of Bottom into an ass but a satire of self-love gone grandiose? Braying in both human and asinine form, Danny Burstein munches the scenery marvelously.But what the production lacks in depth and subtlety it makes up for in clarity and swiftness. David Rockwell\u2019s scenic design, dominated by three enormous mossy trees, delivers characters quickly to the audience on revolving platforms and even a woodland slide. Interstitial New Orleans-style music by Justin Levine, played by a six-man band among the branches and belted by the \u201cfairy singer\u201d Marcelle Davies-Lashley, helps frame the action in the manner of sitcom bumpers. Paradoxically, the additions seem to shorten the play by clarifying its structure; in any case, the night flies by despite only modest trimming of the text.For all that, I missed the moments when, in some productions, Helena\u2019s desperation \u2014 first about being unloved, and then, after the potions, about being loved too much \u2014 lands a punch in the gut. I wished that Hermia\u2019s apparent betrayal by her friend would be more than an occasion for a take-off-your-earrings catfight; it should also reflect a sad breach of comity. And I looked in vain for any recognition that the romantic disagreements destabilizing the play are not just pretty plot devices but dangerous disruptions with larger implications.Which is not to ask for a Trumpy Oberon or a Scaramucci Bottom. On a hot night in a hot season, perhaps light comedy, with no minor-key overtones, is all we can take.Follow Jesse Green on Twitter: @JesseKGreen.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Rally, Trump Blames Media for Country\u2019s Deepening Divisions", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter declaring, \u201cWhat happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America,\u201d Mr. Trump delivered a lengthy, aggrieved defense of his statements after the Aug. 12 violence that left one woman dead and the nation reeling at the images of swastikas in Thomas Jefferson\u2019s hometown.\u201cI hit \u2019em with neo-Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi. I got them all in there. Let\u2019s see. K.K.K., we have K.K.K.,\u201d Mr. Trump said sardonically of his rebuke to Charlottesville racists, after being faulted for failing to condemn those groups in his initial response on the day of the clashes.Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump had traveled to a sun-scorched border post in Yuma, Ariz., to highlight his determination to crack down on illegal border crossings from Mexico. In Phoenix, the president threatened to shut down the federal government if his proposal to build a border wall is not funded.Mr. Trump also implied that he planned to pardon Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who became a national symbol of the crackdown on undocumented immigrants with round-\u2019em-up searches that landed him in legal trouble. \u201cWas Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\u201d Mr. Trump asked to wild whoops and cheers.\u201cI won\u2019t do it tonight because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll make a prediction: I think he\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201dIn an angry, unbridled and unscripted performance that rivaled the most sulfurous rallies of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump sought to deflect the anger toward him against the news media, suggesting that they, not he, were responsible for deepening divisions in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s time to expose the crooked media deceptions,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added, \u201cThey\u2019re very dishonest people.\u201d\u201cThe only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t do Twitter storms,\u201d said the president, who often posts a few tweets in a row on a given subject, with exclamation points.Returning repeatedly to Charlottesville, he said the news media failed to focus on anarchists, who he said turned out in their \u201chelmets and the black masks \u2014 Antifa,\u201d Mr. Trump said, spitting out the nickname for the anti-fascist groups.Mr. Trump accused the news media of \u201ctrying to take away our history and our heritage,\u201d an apparent reference to the debate over removing statues to heroes of the Confederacy, which prompted the rally by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.The president singled out a familiar list of malefactors \u2014 including the \u201cfailing New York Times,\u201d which he erroneously said had apologized for its coverage of the 2016 election; CNN; and The Washington Post, which he described as a lobbying arm for Amazon, the company controlled by the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos.Pointing repeatedly to the cameras in the middle of a cavernous convention center, Mr. Trump whipped the crowd into fevered chants of \u201cCNN Sucks.\u201d Members of the audience shouted epithets at reporters, some demanding that the news media stop tormenting the president with questions about his ties to Russia.The people in Arizona on Mr. Trump\u2019s enemies list include both of the state\u2019s Republican senators: Jeff Flake, a longtime nemesis whom Mr. Trump has described as \u201ctoxic,\u201d not to mention a \u201cflake\u201d; and John McCain, who cast the decisive Republican vote in the Senate to dash Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.His voice thick with sarcasm, Mr. Trump said he had been instructed not to mention either of the senators by name. Of Mr. Flake, he said, \u201cNobody knows who the hell he is.\u201d Of Mr. McCain, he repeated over and over, \u201cOne vote,\u201d which cost Republicans health care.Mr. Trump recited a familiar litany of complaints about lawless immigrants and na\u00efve trade deals. But aside from a reference to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico \u2014 he said he expected he would have to terminate the accord first \u2014 the speech was light on policy specifics.At another point, he heralded the arrival of clean coal plants, adding, \u201cThey are taking out coal; they are going to clean it\u201d \u2014 which is not how clean coal plants function.He said in an interview on Tuesday night that he did not know Mr. Trump was going to mention his name at the rally and reiterated that he had not talked to the president since last fall. But Mr. Arpaio said he \u201cwasn\u2019t really surprised\u201d to hear he would likely be pardoned.\u201cI just know him,\u201d Mr. Arpaio said of the president. \u201cAnd even though everybody said he\u2019s not going to talk about it \u2014 deep in my heart, I knew he was going to say something. I had no hints, but that\u2019s who he is.\u201dOutside the convention center, the scene was a tense caldron, with hundreds of people screaming at one another, chanting slogans and hoisting placards that said \u201cFire Trump\u201d and \u201cFake President.\u201d Some voiced fears about the potential for the repeat of the violence that broke out in Charlottesville, while others griped about the 108-degree heat in Phoenix.At one point, as Mr. Trump defended his remarks about the unrest in Charlottesville, protesters interrupted.\u201cHow did he get in here?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be with the few people outside.\u201dArizona was the site of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most raucous rallies during the presidential campaign, and if anything, the atmosphere was even more charged on this visit, his first as president. The Democratic mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, pleaded with Mr. Trump to put off his trip, saying it would only aggravate racial tensions, coming so soon after clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Virginia.An article on Wednesday about President Trump\u2019s rally in Phoenix referred incorrectly in some copies to the destroyer John S. McCain. It was named for Senator John McCain\u2019s grandfather and father \u2014 John S. McCain Sr. and John S. McCain Jr., both Navy admirals; it was not named after the Arizona senator.Mark Landler reported from Phoenix, and Maggie Haberman from Washington.

{"Headline": "Why the Dow Isn\u2019t Really the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesDespite a few rocky days recently, the stock market is having a great year. But exactly how great depends on what you mean by \u201cthe stock market.\u201dAre you talking about the Dow Jones industrial average, the oldest and best-known measuring stick for the American stock market? If so, that one has risen more than 18 percent over the last 12 months, a spectacular return.Or are you referring to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the benchmark for large companies used by many stock professionals? If so, that market has been far less impressive, with a gain in the last 12 months of a little over 12 percent.Or do you mean something else entirely?The divergence between the two big indexes began in November, when the Dow started to surge ahead of the S.&P. 500. Though the shift in the indexes was little noticed at the time, the Dow has gained more than 20 percent since then, while the S.&P. is up about 15 percent. A gap of this magnitude is unusual: The two indexes usually move within a percentage point or two of one another. Why has this happened? To a surprising extent, the divergence depends on just two stocks, Apple and Boeing, and on the ways in which the two indexes are constructed.Both companies have had outstanding performances recently. Boeing stock, which trades at about $235, is up roughly 50 percent for the calendar year. Apple, which trades at roughly $157, has risen about 36 percent. But what may appear puzzling is that while Boeing has had a barely noticeable impact on the S.&P. 500, it has provided a gigantic lift to the Dow.According to data supplied by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, Boeing accounts for one quarter of the Dow\u2019s entire increase for 2017. That\u2019s almost double Apple\u2019s contribution.Yet Apple is the most valuable company in the entire stock market; its market capitalization is more than $800 billion. Boeing, while hardly small, has a market capitalization of only about $135 billion. Such considerations are critical in the S.&P. 500. Stocks with a bigger market cap have a proportionately bigger impact on the index. That\u2019s why it is known as a \u201cmarket-weighted index,\u201d and why professionals use it much more widely than the Dow.\u201cThe S.&P. tells you much more about how the market is really doing,\u201d said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor and market historian at the Wharton School. \u201cModern indexes that track stock markets are generally market weighted.\u201dThe Dow is not a modern index. It is old and simple, created more than a century ago by Charles Dow, who was the co-founder of Dow Jones and the first editor of The Wall Street Journal. For many , the Dow is synonymous with the American stock market. \u201cIf you say, how many points did the market move today, you\u2019re talking about the Dow,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a crazy way to measure the market.\u201dOnly 30 stocks are included in the index, which uses a measuring system so simple that it seems arbitrary: Stocks are weighted by price. That means that the highest-priced share of a stock \u2014 which happens to be Boeing at the moment \u2014 has the greatest sway in the index.Consider the implications of using that kind of index. Imagine that you are creating a food index based on all of the items you have bought in the last year.You purchased one jar of caviar and 1,000 cans of tuna fish. In a price-weighted index, caviar will have the biggest overall impact because it\u2019s the most expensive item you\u2019ve bought, even though you spent far more money on tuna. The rise and fall of caviar is the powerhouse that controls your price-weighted food index, even if you never buy caviar again in your life.\u201cNo one would build a stock market index that way today,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut remember, Charles Dow did it without computers, and it basically works. It tells you how the market performed and it requires relatively little calculation.\u201d It has some idiosyncrasies, though. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a $1,000 stock in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a stock like Amazon in it without all kinds of adjustments because its price is too high and it will change the index too much.\u201dConsider what the Dow looks like now. Through Thursday, Boeing\u2019s weighting in the index \u2014 based entirely on the price of a single share of Boeing stock \u2014 was 7.3 percent, Mr. Silverblatt said. Close behind were Goldman Sachs at a 7.07 percent weighting; 3M, with a 6.47 percent weighting; United Health, at 6.04 percent; and McDonald\u2019s, at 4.91 percent. Apple was only in sixth place in the Dow, with a weighting of 4.85 percent.Because of this price-weighting system, Boeing has more than nine times the stature in the Dow as General Electric. Yet G.E.\u2019s total value \u2014 its market capitalization \u2014 is much greater than Boeing\u2019s. No matter. Boeing has a far bigger impact on the Dow, and on \u201cthe market,\u201d if we are using the Dow as a shorthand way of talking about all stocks, than G.E. does.Is there a better way of defining the stock market? Absolutely. There are many other indexes. The S.&P. 500 does a good job of measuring large-capitalization stocks but it misses thousands of smaller ones.By that broader and no less precise definition, the market is not doing quite as well as either the Dow or the S.&P. would have you believe. The CRSP index is trailing the Dow by more than 2 percentage points this year, and is behind the S.&P. by more than three quarters of a percentage point. That may be why your stock portfolio, if it is diversified enough to capture the entire market, isn\u2019t turning in a performance as spectacular as the daily news reports may suggest.The problem may just be that everybody is talking about the Dow. They are not really talking about the stock market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toyota to Take 5 Percent Stake in Mazda and Build Joint U.S. Plant", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies.The factory\u2019s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said.Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States.The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. \u201cToyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!\u201d he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a \u201cbig border tax.\u201dThe alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology.In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts \u2014 especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars \u2014 many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution.\u201cTotally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said. \u201cWe need to cooperate and compete with them.\u201dJapan\u2019s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew.Toyota has been extending its reach, as well.Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership.With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges \u2014 both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla.Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company\u2019s products more flair.Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda\u2019s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent.Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion.\u201cAs Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi\u2019s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,\u201d said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers.Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. \u201cAny manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,\u201d Gov. Rick Snyder said. \u201cWe are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.\u201dAnd a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: \u201cToyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas \u2014 just recently opening their new North American headquarters \u2014 and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion.Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}

Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, urging them to work with Democrats on a tax plan.The reception was frosty. And it is still unclear how enthusiastic Democrats would really be about making compromises that would allow Mr. Trump to score a major legislative victory.But the Dow\u2019s rise nearly mirrors a fall in the dollar. Currencies including the euro, the yen, the renminbi and the Mexican peso have been climbing against the dollar, while trillions of dollars slosh around the global economy to places where investors can receive a higher return, whether that\u2019s junk bonds or Dow stalwarts like Amazon.The slip in the dollar has also been matched by tough talk on trade from the Trump administration.Related Reading\u2022 Dalian Wanda has become one of China\u2019s largest real estate and entertainment conglomerates, helped by political connections and a huge pile of debt.Wanda sold theme parks that covered more floor space than all the offices in Manhattan in a $6.5 billion deal. It off-loaded 77 hotels at a fire sale price of $3 billion.The conglomerate is a shadow of its former self. And, as The New York Times found in Wuhan, where Wanda has poured in money, it is still far from being the grand rival to Disney that the founder, Wang Jianlin, boasted of.Its $264.4 million deal for International Currency Exchange, based in London, and its takeover of Rezidor Hotel Group in Sweden have faced regulatory roadblocks.But executives are likely to feel uncomfortable holding onto trophy assets that leave them open to political attacks, so they will consider reasonable offers.The man who has invested in a circus and a margarine company wants to eliminate irrational investments.\u2013 \u201cIt can certainly eliminate a lot of irrational investments and therefore potential threats to financial security.

There are always people looking at us through a magnifying glass, including rating agencies, partners and portfolio companies. They will scrutinize details especially when we invest in core industries, such as financial assets.\u201d\u2013 \u201cChinese enterprises entering overseas markets will inevitably affect the established interests there. I do not believe in conspiracy theories, but I feel some people will always exaggerate. For instance, the Chinese government\u2019s plan to regulate Chinese companies\u2019 overseas investment is quite normal. But this plan was used as a pretext to short Chinese companies. Are these actions motivated by certain interests? Is this because our overseas development has impacted the foreign established interests?\u201dThe German carmaker will no longer have access to the low-cost financing it needs to keep up with research and development as the auto industry undergoes a period of upheaval.The European Investment Bank was harsh in its critique of the company.\u201cVW is an excellent company,\u201d Werner Hoyer, the president of the European Investment Bank, said in a statement, \u201cbut it has not been served well by its top management since the beginning of this affair.

They cautioned that the state\u2019s population of 600,000 could double with people heading for the zone of totality, which crosses the state.In Nashville, officials were preparing for a greater number of cars on the road and most concerned about drivers stopping during the total eclipse.\u201cWe just hope the citizens don\u2019t cause any obstructions,\u201d said Don Aaron, a public affairs manager at the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department.In Carbondale, where the moon will obscure the sun for more than two and a half minutes, 15,000 people are expected to gather in a football stadium to experience it.Among them will be Sarah Kovac, a recent graduate of Southern Illinois University\u2019s physics department, who will operate a telescope to observe the sun\u2019s corona, the wispy shroud of super hot plasma that is usually not visible from the ground on Earth. She is one of many scientists across the country who will be studying the corona to gain more insight into its scorching mysteries.Those who cannot make it to the path of totality will not be left out, however. Viewers in all 50 states will experience at least a partial eclipse, with the moon dancing across some of the sun\u2019s surface. In New York City, about three-quarters of the sun will eventually be blocked.The total eclipse\u2019s cross-country trek begins in the morning on the West Coast, when beachgoers in Oregon will be the first to experience the changes that occur as the moon begins to align between Earth and the sun. Over 75 minutes the sky will gradually darken as more and more of the sun is obscured until totality at about 10:15 local time, when it will seem that twilight has quickly descended.What you need to know about eclipses, how to be safe during an eclipse and some fun experiments you can try during this rare event.But the moon will still be moving. On the Oregon coast, near the centerline of the eclipse track, totality will end less than two minutes after it began and the sky will begin to brighten.That gradual fading out and in of the light \u2014 from partial to total eclipse and back \u2014 will last for about two and a half hours in each location. Totality will continue its parade across the country until 90 minutes later, when viewers here in coastal South Carolina will be the last to experience it.On Sunday, everyone was keeping an eye on the weather. Even one cloud, poorly timed, can spoil the party, although viewers will still experience the darkening sky.Haze from wildfires in Oregon and elsewhere in the West was threatening to affect viewing in some locations.Although much of the path of totality seemed in danger of being overrun, some prime viewing spots were quieter than anticipated, at least for now.But as of Sunday morning the crush had not appeared. There were even some vacancy signs on local motels, a rarity elsewhere in the path of totality, where lodging has been impossible to find for months.Brandon Cenedella, a motel manager in Depoe Bay, said the unpredictable coastal weather, paired with high room rates \u2014 which were doubled in many cases for the weekend \u2014 could be to blame. \u201cEveryone\u2019s expecting to it to be foggy and really hoping that it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Cenedella said.In New York over the weekend, the airports were filled with people heading toward a rendezvous with the total eclipse.John McIntyre and his family, from Mount Kisco, N.Y., had planned months in advance to travel to St. Louis to see a few baseball games. He said they realized three weeks ago their plans placed them near the path of totality for the eclipse.Mr. McIntyre said, while waiting for a flight at La Guardia Airport on Saturday, they decided to adjust their itinerary.\u201cWhat are the chances you book your vacation and something as historic as this is happening?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s eclipse mania and we didn\u2019t know about it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Julie Turkewitz in Glendo, Wyo.; Thomas Fuller in San Francisco; Hollie Deese in Gallatin, Tenn.; Nicholas St. Fleur in Carbondale, Ill.; Dennis Overbye in Portland, Ore.; and Phoebe Flanigan in Depoe Bay, Ore.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Incredible Shrinking Sears", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "How a financial wizard took over a giant of American retailing, and presided over its epic decline.Supported byImagine a retailer that began by specializing in just one product, then grew into a mammoth that redefined the American shopping experience.Among its innovations: No matter where you lived, it shipped your order directly to you, whether you were looking for cast-iron cookware, a mandolin, the newest technological marvel, or the latest in petticoats.Amazon, right? Actually, it was Sears \u2014 a century ago.The brainchild of a pocket-watch salesman, Sears navigated retailing through the end of the stagecoach era, the rise (and fall) of downtown department stores and the malling of suburban America. Recently it has been battling to stay relevant with the advance of online retailers \u2014 like Amazon.For many, the story of Sears is a reflection of the carnage occurring throughout much of retail right now. In recent days, the stocks of J.C. Penney, Macy\u2019s and Dillard\u2019s all tumbled after they reported another round of quarterly sales declines. Some analysts expect Sears to report a third consecutive double-digit decline in same-store sales in the second quarter.But what may ultimately lead to the collapse of the once-great retailer is a dose of Wall Street financial engineering.Under the direction of the hedge-fund moneyman Edward S. Lampert, Sears has borrowed to the hilt. Many of its most valuable assets have been sold off. Its stores have been starved for cash and attention. An early shift in the organizational structure designed to create competition among store departments \u2014 a strategy used by some hedge funds to allocate company resources \u2014 instead led to infighting.It was all done in search of a profit that, for Mr. Lampert and his investors, has not materialized.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was inevitable that Sears would find itself in the position it is in today,\u201d said Arthur Martinez, who orchestrated a turnaround of Sears as its chief executive in the late 1990s. \u201cThe Sears brand has become largely irrelevant,\u201d he said, \u201cand it breaks my heart to say that.\u201dToday, Sears Holdings, the publicly traded entity that is the result of the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart, coordinated by Mr. Lampert, is on analysts\u2019 short list of most-likely-to-go-bankrupt retailers.Over the past decade at Sears, more than $26 billion of market value has disappeared. Revenue has been halved, as has its work force, with 175,000 people losing their jobs.This year, Sears has sued two vendors to force them to continue supplying goods even as many others reduce shipments to the retailer, concerned they could wind up empty-handed if Sears files for bankruptcy protection. One suit was settled; the other is in progress.Mr. Lampert declined to be interviewed. Responding to questions through emails, the company said it continued to work on its transformation in a difficult retail environment and that it had no plans to file for bankruptcy.The company also disputed the idea that Mr. Lampert had focused on financial engineering, noting that many retailers rely heavily on integration of financial and operational structures. The company also said Mr. Lampert began responding to the e-commerce shift more than a decade ago, well before many retailers did. Just last month, shortly after announcing additional store closings (so far this year, 155 Sears and Kmarts around the country have been shuttered) Sears announced a deal to sell its Kenmore appliances through Amazon.Mr. Lampert said on the company blog this summer that Sears was continuing a strategic transformation that would return it to profitability. \u201cWhile there is still work to do,\u201d Mr. Lampert wrote, \u201cwe are determined to do what is necessary to remain a competitive retailer in a challenging environment.\u201dAt the turn of the 20th century, as Americans established roots across the nation, they turned to Sears. Through its robust mail-order business \u2014 some catalogs were more than 500 pages \u2014 Sears shipped groceries, rifles, corsets, cream separators, davenports, stoves and entire prefab houses to some of the most remote regions of the country.For decades, as Americans shifted the ways they shopped, Sears deftly evolved. In fact, it was often at the forefront of changing demands as it moved from catalogs featuring pages of saddles and bridles, to showrooms full of glistening home appliances, to auto-repair shops outside the mall.As Americans moved from rural communities to larger cities, many no longer needed to shop by thumbing through the catalog; they preferred to visit dazzling department stores. Sears began opening hundreds of stand-alone retail stores, some with soda fountains, dentist\u2019s offices and pet shops alongside tombstones and farm tractors.The set of \u201cThe Donna Reed Show\u201d in the 1960s featured a Kenmore stove, dishwasher and washer and dryer, all must-have appliances in American homes. And as TV culture grew in the \u201960s, Sears ramped up its advertising campaigns and signed licensing agreements with celebrities like the baseball player Ted Williams, the golfer Arnold Palmer and the model Cheryl Tiegs.In the 1980s, as Americans\u2019 fondness for credit grew, Sears introduced its wildly popular Discover card, which was the first to offer cash rewards to customers based on the volume of their purchases. Within four years, 20 million people had the card. Within a decade, credit operations accounted for a big chunk of Sears\u2019s revenues.When malls became the meeting place of American youth, Sears moved with them. Its stores anchored shopping centers all over the country.By the 1990s, however, Sears\u2019s dominance of the retail landscape had ended. It was surpassed by the discount shopping retailers Walmart and Kmart, the so-called big-box stores. By 2001, Walmart\u2019s revenues were about five times that of Sears.The new players were nimble, able to change inventory and prices quickly. Sears\u2019s overhead costs were higher, and catalog prices were usually set months in advance in order to meet printing and mailing schedules.But big-box stores were only one threat. Online shopping would soon emerge as an even more powerful force, one that Sears, with its hundreds of brick-and-mortar stores needing constant face-lifts and upkeep, was also ill prepared to compete with.That\u2019s when the hedge-fund titan came knocking.In late 2004, newspapers were still running articles about the coming $11 billion takeover of Sears by the discount giant Kmart when Arthur Martinez\u2019s phone rang. Mr. Martinez had been the chief executive and president of Sears in the late 1990s.On the line, he said, was Edward Lampert.A financial wizard who started his career on the vaunted risk arbitrage desk at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Lampert had just arranged the megadeal that created the nation\u2019s third-largest retailer. Among the new members of its board were Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert\u2019s former roommate at Yale and the current Treasury secretary.\u201cHe asked me if he had just done the stupidest thing in the world by buying Sears,\u201d Mr. Martinez recalled.Over a 90-minute meeting in Greenwich, Conn., where they both had offices, Mr. Martinez advised Mr. Lampert to focus on high-value businesses like appliance sales, Sears\u2019s crown jewel. He also noted that Sears was a capital-intensive business, requiring steady investments not only in the stores, but also in training and retaining employees.\u201cHe appears to have roundly ignored everything I told him to do,\u201d Mr. Martinez said.Sears disputed Mr. Martinez\u2019s recollections, saying it was Mr. Martinez who requested the meeting, and denied that Mr. Lampert had made the comment about buying Sears. The company also said Mr. Lampert had not ignored Mr. Martinez\u2019s advice.At Sears, Mr. Lampert typically led from afar. As the largest shareholder through his hedge fund and, since 2013, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Lampert has overseen the company\u2019s operations via videoconference from his home in Miami. He sets foot inside Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., roughly once a year for the annual meeting, according to interviews with several former executives.In the early days of the merger, when times were better, Sears used its cash to buy back shares, a move businesses often use to try to drive share prices higher. From 2005 to 2012, the company spent $6 billion buying back its own shares at prices as high as $174 a share.Today, Sears Holdings stock trades at $9.30 a share, a decline of 95 percent from its highs.Besides the share buybacks, one of the earliest moves by Mr. Lampert was to decentralize the managements of Sears and Kmart, effectively creating more than three dozen silos of business lines such as men\u2019s wear, shoes and home furnishings, each with its own management team and board of directors.It is similar to a strategy sometimes used at hedge funds, where different teams compete with one another for scarce company resources. At Sears, though, the design led to infighting between divisions for everything from space in the weekly advertising circulars to floor shelving.One former executive described how the clashes played out in Sears showrooms, whether in the jewelry or the tools departments. Managers would tell their sales staff not to help customers in adjacent sections, even if someone asked for help. Mr. Lampert would praise policies like these, said the executive, who asked not to be named because he still works in retail.The company said the descriptions by former employees presented an \u201cincomplete perspective\u201d and that the company had adopted different organizational models. It noted that it had recently consolidated its management structure to speed up decision making.Mr. Lampert\u2019s grand vision for Sears, many former executives said, was to position it to compete with Amazon. Instead of spending on store upkeep, he plowed investment, new talent and marketing into Sears\u2019s website and a customer loyalty program called Shop Your Way. The program allows customers to earn points, for purchases not only at Sears but at partnering businesses including Burger King, Under Armour and Uber, that can be redeemed for Sears merchandise.Sears, Mr. Lampert argued, had a big edge: Its hundreds of stores nationwide could act as distribution centers. People could order things online and have them delivered locally.The problem, former executives and employees said, was that the bulk of Sears\u2019s revenue still came from its stores. And they were rapidly losing traffic.\u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret has a $1 billion online business selling $25 bras and such because customers are totally comfortable going to victoriassecret.com, because they felt connected to the brand and the store experience,\u201d said Gary Schettino, a former vice president of merchandising at Sears Holdings. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret understood the overlap of the store and the online customer in a way that Sears never did.\u201dKmart and Sears stores around the country became dilapidated, their personnel demoralized. Employees at some Kmarts didn\u2019t receive raises for several years. Some salespeople who worked solely on commission said that they had been slashed to nearly nothing about three years ago.Customers walking into a Sears store in Kokomo, Ind., were greeted by stained carpets, broken mannequins and cracked display tables, recalled Amanda Marquand Householder, an assistant manager there before she left in 2014. The Kokomo store closed this spring.The problems extended to Kmart stores as well. Kristin Hamm, an assistant manager at a branch in Lancaster, Pa., from 2011 to 2014, said managers knew exactly where to put the buckets they kept handy \u2014 all 10 of them \u2014 to catch water from the leaky roof when it rained.Ms. Hamm also said inventory was hit and miss. On Black Friday one year, Kmart heavily promoted a particular television to drive traffic into its store. She said the Lancaster Kmart was given only one to sell.The store did receive plenty of items, however, from the body-conscious clothing line by the hip-hop star Nicki Minaj. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sell well,\u201d Ms. Hamm said. \u201cI mean, our store was located in the middle of one of the largest Mennonite populations in the country.\u201dKmart ended its partnership with Ms. Minaj late last year. The Kmart store in Lancaster, which opened in 1970, closed in March.In a statement, Sears said that the execution of Mr. Lampert\u2019s strategy has had its challenges, but that the company was making progress \u201cin a very difficult retail environment where many retailers, including Victoria\u2019s Secret, have also been challenged.\u201dRegarding pay and commissions, Sears said that rather than increase compensation in some outlets, it chose to keep people employed, and stores open, as long as possible. As for upkeep, Sears noted that at the end of last year it had 1,400 operating stores and that it spent a \u201csignificant amount\u201d on store appearance and \u201cnever wants a store\u2019s appearance to disappoint its customers.\u201dThe company also noted that other retailers have gone under even after investing in store renovation. Regarding inventory control, Sears said that given the scale of its business, there would be \u201csituations where the company doesn\u2019t always get this right.\u201dThe fallout from Sears\u2019s mistakes have hit its work force hard.\u201cSears was the greatest job ever. A1. No doubt,\u201d said Edd Oliver, who, for the past decade worked as a salesman at a Sears in Columbus, Ga. \u201cPeople were raising families and sending children to college off of this company.\u201dA member of the Sears \u201cmillion-dollar club\u201d for three consecutive years in which he sold more than $1 million of appliances, Mr. Oliver said his job started to take a downward turn around 2014. That was when commissions, which had once been as high as 6 percent for some items, were cut to around 1.3 percent, he recalled.Paid solely on commission, Mr. Oliver\u2019s take-home pay, which topped out at around $60,000 in 2014, fell sharply in 2015 and then fell some more in 2016. The store also cut back on local advertising, Mr. Oliver said, hurting foot traffic.In April, Mr. Oliver lost his job when his store closed.\u201cI still today would tell anyone to go to Sears and buy the appliances and get the warranty. It is the best,\u201d Mr. Oliver said. \u201cBut after working there all of those years and then losing my job, it hurts. I\u2019ve taken a big emotional hit from this.\u201dIn recent years, Sears has been kept afloat largely by selling off its most valuable assets. At the same time, Mr. Lampert has taken steps to protect his investment in the company.Since 2012, Sears has been raising cash through a series of spinoffs or sales of entities including Sears Hometown and Outlet, a national retailer that focused on appliances and lawn and garden equipment, as well as Lands\u2019 End and Sears Canada. More recently, the company sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker, for $900 million.In many of the spinoffs, Mr. Lampert, through his hedge funds and other entities, invested significantly. Those stakes appear to be under water.But one move that could yet prove profitable for Mr. Lampert and others was the 2015 sale of more than 266 Sears and Kmart properties for $3 billion to a publicly traded real-estate investment pool called Seritage Growth Properties.The sale drew intense scrutiny on the pricing of the properties as well as a shareholder lawsuit, which argued that there had not been an independent, fair valuation of the properties and that there were myriad conflicts of interest. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage. The lawsuit was settled this year for $40 million.Cutting companies into two pieces \u2014 a real estate side and an operations side \u2014 is a move hedge funds and private-equity investors have been performing for years. This can sometimes strain the operations side as it uses its cash to make rental payments.For Sears Holdings, the Seritage deal meant it now had to pay rent on properties it once owned. Sears Holdings paid an additional $200 million in rent and other expenses to Seritage in 2016.In its statement, the company said rent payments would decline as Sears Holdings reduces the size of its stores, as more customers shop online. This year, it expects rent payments to total $160 million.But as Sears Holdings exits those leases, higher-paying tenants are coming in, which benefits Seritage shareholders, including Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge funds. \u201cIn properties where Sears has given up the lease,\u201d said Wes Golladay, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, \u201cSeritage has moved in restaurants, small grocers, gym chains, a pretty broad-based group of new lessees who are paying more than $18 a square foot, from the $4 that Sears was paying.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Lampert has played the role of Sears Holdings\u2019s primary banker, collecting fees while providing loans to the operations side of the company. As a result, Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund and other entities hold a significant portion of Sears Holdings\u2019s debt, in effect making him one of the company\u2019s biggest lenders. The bulk of that debt is secured by property or inventory.The debt ensures that even if Sears Holdings goes into bankruptcy, Mr. Lampert has a prominent seat at the table \u2014 and a voice in its future course \u2014 since debt-holders come before shareholders in working out a corporate restructuring through the courts.Some observers say it is difficult for them to imagine a scenario in which Sears doesn\u2019t go into bankruptcy. \u201cThere has been a long, steady sale of assets to the point where the cupboard is pretty bare,\u201d said Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, which provides independent research to institutional investors. \u201cIt has been a long, slow bleed to keep the company afloat.\u201d\u201cIt is a shame,\u201d Mr. Perkins added, \u201cbecause this was such an iconic retailer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s the Golden Age of TV. And Writers Are Reaping the Rewards and Paying the Toll.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Kirk A. Moore\u2019s sleeping pattern had landed him in the hospital.The result: a panic attack that sent him to the emergency room.\u201cI remember I was at urgent care, working on my script because I was on deadline and I didn\u2019t want to tell them I was sick,\u201d he said of an episode he wrote for \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201d \u201cSo I finished it there.\u201dMr. Moore\u2019s hospital stay may be an extreme manifestation of the stresses of the TV writing life, but the profession\u2019s possible pitfalls are willingly accepted by a growing number of men and women who arrive in Southern California each year, armed with ideas, scripts and unbridled enthusiasm, looking for success in an industry famous for chewing up and spitting out talent. They are enticed by the increased prestige of writing for a medium long disdained as a vast wasteland, in the era of Peak TV, when streaming services do battle with the broadcast and cable networks to win the allegiances of audiences. A record 455 original scripted series aired last year, and by the time 2017 comes to a close that tally is expected to top 500.Though opportunities abound, the transition has presented additional challenges. Here, three writers discuss the nontraditional career trajectories, long hours, substance use (and abuse) and uneven returns that can come from working in the golden age of a continually shifting creative field.Growing up in Greenwich Village, she dreamed of a future stage career. In the 1990s, while in her early 20s, she hung around the Malaparte Theater Company, which was run by Ethan Hawke and Ms. Queller\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Jonathan Marc Sherman (\u201cSophistry,\u201d \u201cThings We Want\u201d). \u201cI came up with these crazy talents,\u201d said Ms. Queller. \u201cPeter Dinklage and Sam Rockwell and Philip Seymour Hoffman \u2014 and Calista Flockhart and Cara Buono, both of whom remain my two best friends.\u201dBut, unlike her peers, success eluded her. \u201cI was the Salieri of the Mozart story: \u2018I am so passionate about the theater! I\u2019ve read everything, seen everything!\u2019 But I just [couldn\u2019t] get cast at the Roundabout and on Broadway, where my friends were.\u201dSo in 1997 she went to Los Angeles to audition for pilot season. There, a light bulb went off: Why not try writing instead?\u201cAll my boyfriends had been writers \u2014 I revered writers and storytelling, and had the epiphany around the age of 30. \u2018Oh, maybe I don\u2019t want to marry a manic-depressive alcoholic writer, maybe I just want to be one,\u2019\u201d she recalled, laughing. \u201cI had this little voice inside of me going, \u2018I think I could do that.\u2019\u201dMs. Queller then burrowed for two years, writing at night and sleeping during the day. She eventually secured a job, her first, on \u201cFling,\u201d the ill-fated show from Glenn Gordon Caron (\u201cMoonlighting\u201d). The show was canceled by Fox in 2001 before an episode was televised. But the credit did lead her to a gig on \u201cFelicity\u201d and the writing niche that has determined her career ever since.\u201cHere I am, 47 years old, still writing for teenagers and early 20s [viewers],\u201d said Ms. Queller, who has also worked on \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d which ran on the WB and CW.It was advice from an agent \u2014 one she met because her mother\u2019s best friend\u2019s son-in-law was the man\u2019s tennis teacher \u2014 that set her on this path. Upon hearing that she was writing a spec script for the David E. Kelley show \u201cThe Practice,\u201d the agent told her to choose a lane.\u201cIt was easier for me to say \u2018I know everything about what it means to be a struggling young woman\u2019 than it was for me to say \u2018I know what it means to run a law firm in Boston,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe advice wasn\u2019t necessarily bad \u2014 it was a bit limiting \u2014 but it worked, because I did become the go-to person for those types of shows as I was trying to establish a career.\u201dFor those lucky enough to secure a job, maintaining it can take its own toll.Before his first staff writing gig on \u201cAmerican Crime,\u201d Mr. Moore worked a night shift in customer service at a psychic advice company. But in 2014, the Houston native was accepted into NBC Writers on the Verge, which trains aspirants from diverse backgrounds and introduced him to the peculiarities of writing for television. The image of the lone scribe, sweating over the Great American Novel or the next \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d does not translate to television writing. Collaboration is integral to the profession, and the work of more junior writers is ultimately subservient to the vision of the showrunner (not to mention the desires of the companies bankrolling the project).\u201cI had to be comfortable letting go of something that I knew was just a draft,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s TV. You go through a writers\u2019 draft, then a studio draft and then a network draft.\u201dHe also had to learn to be rigorously disciplined. \u201cI never thought I was a fast writer until I got into the program,\u201d said Mr. Moore, now 37. \u201cIt showed me that I really had to be structured: \u2018O.K., Kirk, you have to sleep at this time, you have to work at this time, you have to write at this time.\u2019\u201dUnfortunately, Mr. Moore\u2019s all-nighters, poor eating habits and self-medication would catch up with him during the third season of \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201d \u201cI was so stressed out and not getting sleep, it just compounded \u2014 and then I was in the hospital,\u201d he said.There may be more television shows than ever, but the spoils aren\u2019t necessarily trickling down to the writers. Between 2013 and 2016, the overall median earnings of writer-producers decreased by 25 percent, according to the Writers Guild of America West.Mr. Moore considers himself fortunate, finding his experience on \u201cCrime\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d to be, long hours aside, comfortable and inclusive. \u201cI\u2019ve been on shows where they actually respect my opinion, whether I\u2019m a staff writer or whether I\u2019m a producer,\u201d he said, before echoing the \u201cCrime\u201d creator John Ridley\u2019s approach: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t care about your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I care about what you can bring to my story and the show I want to tell.\u2019\u201dAfter his stint in the hospital, though, Mr. Moore knew he would have to make lifestyle changes to keep producing quality work. \u201cI had to stop drinking, I stopped drinking caffeine,\u201d said Mr. Moore, who is working on the second season of \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d (\u201cAmerican Crime\u201d was canceled in May by ABC.) \u201cThat\u2019s taking some time to get used to. But I learned from my mistakes. I want to do this for a long time.\u201dFor many television writers, like A\u00efda Mashaka Croal, the ultimate goal is running one\u2019s own show.Ms. Croal, currently a writer and co-executive producer on \u201cMarvel\u2019s Luke Cage,\u201d originally dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon while growing up in Vancouver, British Columbia, and her parents\u2019 native British Guiana. But her time at Stanford, studying under the playwright Anna Deavere Smith, steered her toward writing and eventually, in 2003, to the ABC Daytime Writers\u2019 Program.But while she\u2019s toiled on soap operas (\u201cOne Life to Live\u201d), sci-fi shows (\u201cSanctuary\u201d) and historical dramas (\u201cTurn: Washington\u2019s Spies\u201d), it\u2019s \u201cLuke Cage,\u201d about a black superhero in Harlem, where she feels most at home.\u201cWhen I looked at television, I thought every single show was about a white man doing something, and I felt like, \u2018I have to fit my stories into that narrative in order to be hired,\u2019\u201d Ms. Croal, 42, said. \u201cIt created a sense of insecurity: Well, what do they really want to see? What do they really mean? And I would kind of psych myself out about it, so it was nice to have somebody say, \u2018What we really want to see is what we really have to say.\u2019\u201dHer role on \u201cCage\u201d has also prepared her for her next mission: her own series. A show she co-created for AMC in 2016 did not get the go-ahead \u2014 she declined to divulge details, but said that it ran up against a similar show that came to fruition more quickly. (That show has since been canceled.) Nonetheless, Ms. Croal remains undaunted. \u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a couple of opportunities out there, and we will see very shortly which dream will come true.\u201d\u201cI think all industries go through phases of expansion and contraction, as well as periods of stasis,\u201d he said,Mr. Landgraf may be unsure about the timing of that decline, but he does have one piece of advice if, or when, that day arrives: \u201cWhen an industry contracts, it\u2019s just better not to be in the bottom third in terms of talent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to really preserve your longevity is to continue to grow, and retrain and get better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wonder Woman Effect", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWonder Woman is our calling card at the moment,\u201d said Keir Malem, 52, sitting with his partner, Paddy Whitaker, also 52, in the loft-like ground floor of their two-story home and atelier in Dalston, East London. Dotted around the walls are mementos from their travels mixed in with seminal artworks from the 20th-century Italian maestro Lucio Fontana and a 1970s 3D spotted torso by the British pop artist Allen Jones. The two men, who uncannily look and dress alike, had just returned from a five-month stint making more leather armor on location in Australia for Wonder Woman\u2019s sister movie, \u201cAquaman,\u201d scheduled for release in December 2018.Just upstairs from where they were sitting was the atelier where the Wonder Woman armor, commissioned by Lindy Hemming, the film\u2019s costume designer, was born. The two work at side-by-side desks, and pictures adorn the main wall, including a close-up of the Wonder Woman costume made before it was metallicized. Torsos fitted with leather corsets litter the room, while hidden at the back is a vintage 1950s Singer sewing machine, bought at North London\u2019s Chapel Market for 60 pounds in 1988. On it, Mr. Malem said, \u201ceverything is done, even though it wasn\u2019t made for sewing leather.\u201dCalled \u201cbeyond cool\u201d by New York magazine, Wonder Woman\u2019s armor has become a breakout star in its own right. \u201cWe were allowed to go close to the body and do sexy armor, which is unusual, as a lot of armor is massive,\u201d Mr. Malem said.Rihanna\u2019s stylist, Mel Ottenberg, asked to borrow a moss-green shearling corset for the kickoff of the star\u2019s jewelry collaboration with Chopard at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival. The veteran costume designer Sandy Powell, known for films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d and the coming \u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d asked Whitaker Malem to design armor for her latest film, \u201cThe Favourite.\u201d (They couldn\u2019t do it because of Aquaman. \u201cWe were gutted,\u201d Mr. Malem said.)And the arty French Double magazine featured Joan Severance, the model and actress, wearing one of their molded black bustier collaborations with Allen Jones in its current spring/summer issue. \u201cWe\u2019d never been in that magazine before,\u201d Mr. Malem said. Now \u201cwe\u2019re exposed to a whole new audience.\u201d Even Donatella Versace riffed on the Wonder Woman look in her recent couture collection, with a corseted catsuit glittering with nearly 8,000 sequins and a gold leather minidress.After two runway collections and after dressing such names as Paula Abdul and Cher in leather, however, the two were still struggling to make ends meet, and moved into collaborating with other fashion designers. They made a gold leather dress for Alexander McQueen\u2019s spring/summer 1997 Givenchy collection, and a leather eagle bustier for Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s spring/summer 2000 Red Label.Still, it was a learning experience that helped them embrace their newfound Wonder Woman fame.Mr. Malem and Mr. Whitaker are now focusing on personal fine art work, funded by their movie fees, which largely involves male and female bodies fashioned in leather and spliced together to create a wall sculpture.\u201cWe hope that the people who think this Wonder Woman stuff is cool are going to want to have it on their walls when we sell it,\u201d said Mr. Whitaker, pointing out the superhero overtones of an idealized hermaphroditic body. The pieces were first shown at a fine leatherwork exhibition curated by a British leather goods veteran, Bill Amberg, during May\u2019s London Craft Week just as \u201cWonder Woman\u2019s\u201d publicity machine was cranking up. This fall a solo show titled \u201cLeather Unbound,\u201d part retrospective, part new work (part, yes, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d) will open at the Gallery Liverpool. There are plans to take it to Moscow and Los Angeles later\u201cWe\u2019re going to show the Wonder Woman Barbie dolls because they are so accurate, but not in their boxes,\u201d Mr. Whitaker said. Instead, he said, the plan is to show them under acrylic \u201cin a cool, slightly ironic way to celebrate the pop art side of things.\u201d Photographs of the leather working process will also be on display, including illustrations of how the costume was gilded with gold, silver, copper and aluminum leaf.As to whether he was worried Wonder Woman\u2019s appeal might be over by the late autumn, Mr. Whitaker shook his head. \u201cThe Wonder Woman Blu-ray and DVD comes out for Christmas,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The volume of large deals is down 40 percent.\u2022 Corporate leaders expected more policy changes, particularly around taxes, infrastructure investments and a health care overhaul.\u2022 Many important regulatory positions, particularly those overseeing antitrust, have not been filled. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the people in place to really drive the decision making at this point,\u201d Mr. Waldron says.\u2022 Goldman remains optimistic about the prospects for deal making in general heading into the back half of the year.Regulators are scrutinizing HNA Group. A Wall Street bank has stepped away from it.And more questions are being raised about who owns the Chinese conglomerate.Take Pacific American Corporation, or PAC.HNA says it is an independent company that buys engines, spare parts and other airline equipment for Hainan Airlines, HNA\u2019s subsidiary.The younger brother, Chen Guoqing, was instrumental in helping to create the initial ownership structure of HNA through entities set up in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands, which effectively obscured the ownership.The lack of disclosures may have violated China\u2019s securities laws on \u201cconnected\u201d transactions, say experts on Chinese law.Related Reading:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In India, SoftBank Tries, Tries Again", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSoftBank\u2019s Indian shopping spree is venture capital with a kick.The Japanese conglomerate\u2019s Vision Fund is investing $2.5 billion in the online retailer Flipkart, effectively rendering worthless an earlier bet of nearly $1 billion on a rival start-up, Snapdeal. The investment ranks as the largest private bet on an Indian tech company. But it also shines a light on the SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s big-ticket investment flops.Mr. Son\u2019s company was the largest investor in Snapdeal, making bets at valuations worth up to $5 billion. But Snapdeal fell behind in India\u2019s e-commerce race. It was worth less than $1 billion by the time Mr. Son tried and failed to force a merger with Flipkart, which is now worth at least $12 billion. The decision to invest directly in Flipkart implies the Japanese company has given up on recovering value from the smaller company.The Vision Fund, a $90-billion-odd investment vehicle managed by SoftBank, will now have a large but noncontrolling stake in Flipkart. It is Amazon\u2019s main domestic rival in the battle for dominance of India\u2019s online retail market, which Forrester Research reckons will be worth $64 billion in annual sales by 2021. But Mr. Son may lack the influence to guide Flipkart to a merger with the retail unit of Paytm, another Indian start-up that is backed by Alibaba, the Chinese giant partly owned by SoftBank.Earlier this week, Mr. Son talked about the need to have a \u201cblood kind of relationship\u201d with companies in which SoftBank invests. But Snapdeal represents the second time he has lost control of the founders of a prominent Indian start-up. The first was at Housing.com, which fired its co-founder and chief executive after he pledged to give away his entire stake in the company to employees and attacked the board as intellectually incapable. The Japanese company ended up taking a back seat when Housing.com merged with a rival earlier this year.The mess in India vividly illustrates the conventional wisdom that most start-ups fail. But the sheer size and high-profile nature of Mr. Son\u2019s exploits make the misses more astonishing. This is venture capital, but on an epic scale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Doubles Down on Threats Against North Korea as Nuclear Tensions Escalate", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 President Trump escalated his war of words with North Korea on Thursday by declaring that his provocative threat to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d might not have been harsh enough, as nuclear tensions between the two nations continued to crackle.Rejecting critics at home and abroad who condemned his earlier warning as reckless saber-rattling, Mr. Trump said North Korea and its volatile leader, Kim Jong-un, have pushed the United States and the rest of the world for too long.\u201cFrankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d he told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201dAsked if that was a dare, Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a dare. It\u2019s a statement. Has nothing to do with dare. That\u2019s a statement. He\u2019s not going to go around threatening Guam and he\u2019s not going to threaten the United States and he\u2019s not going to threaten Japan, and he\u2019s not going to threaten South Korea. No, that\u2019s not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program has recently accelerated faster than expected.Mr. Trump made his latest comments on North Korea during a pair of televised media events that covered a dizzying array of topics. He assailed Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, for not passing his legislative priorities, calling it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the party\u2019s health care plan failed by one vote and hinting that the leader should step down if he cannot do better. Mr. Trump also said he would declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency and defended his decision to bar transgender people from the armed forces, saying he was \u201cdoing the military a great favor.\u201dIn his first response to Russia\u2019s decision to force the United States to slash its diplomatic staff in half, the president said he would thank President Vladimir V. Putin for helping him trim payroll costs. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, whose house was raided last month by law enforcement agents as part of an investigation into Russia ties, calling him \u201ca very decent man.\u201d He said he was not considering firing Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.After nearly a week of his working vacation here, the president was in an expansive mood and seemingly eager to talk and take on all issues. While his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, held a sign in the back of the room saying \u201cone more question,\u201d Mr. Trump kept plowing ahead, taking one after another until he was satisfied.Joining him at the club were Vice President Mike Pence and several aides, including Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, who has been under fire from the alt-right media after purging his staff of several hard-liners thought to be close to Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist. Mr. Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had confidence in General McMaster.Democrats complained that the president was inflaming the confrontation and called for diplomacy instead. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s escalatory rhetoric is exactly the wrong response to dealing with North Korea\u2019s provocative behavior,\u201d said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s East Asia Subcommittee. \u201cIt unnecessarily heightens the risk of miscalculation and creates the very fog that can lead to war.\u201dMore than 60 House Democrats sent a letter on Thursday to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson asking him to restrain the president. \u201cThese statements are irresponsible and dangerous, and also senselessly provide a boon to domestic North Korean propaganda, which has long sought to portray the United States as a threat to their people,\u201d the letter said.Former President Jimmy Carter, who has visited North Korea three times as a private citizen, added his voice to the criticism. \u201cIn addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries, especially China and Russia,\u201d he said in a statement. He added that all parties must assure the North Koreans that they would forgo \u201cany military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.\u201dFor all the bellicose words, Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he was open to negotiations, as Mr. Tillerson has urged. But the president expressed skepticism that talks would lead to a reasonable outcome, given the experiences of his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, none of whom was able to resolve the issue through negotiations.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll always consider negotiations,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been negotiating now for 25 years. Look at Clinton. He folded on the negotiations. He was weak and ineffective. You look what happened with Bush, you look what happened with Obama. Obama, he didn\u2019t even want to talk about it. But I talk. It\u2019s about time. Somebody has to do it.\u201dMr. Trump likewise said he doubted that sanctions passed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council last weekend would ultimately succeed. But he again suggested that he would bargain with China by backing down from a planned trade war if Beijing did more to resolve the North Korea impasse.\u201cWe lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know how I feel. It\u2019s not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade.\u201dHe was vague about exactly where the line would be if North Korea did not back down, and refused to say whether he would consider a pre-emptive military strike without an attack by Pyongyang.Asked what would be \u201ctougher\u201d than \u201cfire and fury,\u201d he demurred. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see.\u201dStress within the administration over North Korea again spilled over and into public view on Thursday. Speaking with reporters en route to Seattle, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the president was entitled to use whatever language he thought appropriate. \u201cI was not elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people elected the president.\u201dBut asked about his own equally tough but less colorful statement about North Korea, issued on Wednesday, Mr. Mattis said, \u201cThe rhetoric is up to the president. This is my rhetoric.\u201dA White House aide, meanwhile, said no one should listen to Mr. Tillerson on military matters related to North Korea after the secretary of state said he saw no imminent likelihood of war and urged Americans to sleep soundly.That drew a sharp retort from Mr. Tillerson\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cHe\u2019s a cabinet secretary,\u201d Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick.\u201dAdvertisement"}
