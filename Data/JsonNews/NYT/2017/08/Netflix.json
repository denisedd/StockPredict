{"Headline": "Review: A New \u2018Tick\u2019 on Amazon, Not Like the Old \u2018Tick\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Tick\u2019s creator, the cartoonist and writer Ben Edlund, has been just as persistent. He was in high school when he first drew the character, and he\u2019s gone on to be a writer and producer of all three TV shows (each named \u201cThe Tick\u201d).Given yet another shot, he hasn\u2019t written a sequel. He\u2019s given us a refurbished version of the basic \u201cTick\u201d story, a deserved do-over after the truncated 2001 series, which made its debut on Fox two months after Sept. 11 and lasted just nine episodes.The new \u201cTick,\u201d based on six of its 10 episodes, is bigger in just about every way than the old. It has more back story, more exposition, more special effects, more (and more graphic) violence. It\u2019s more knowing, more layered, more self-conscious.Where the 2001 show was a quirky, low-fi, episodic lark, the new show is an up-to-date serialized dramedy that feels an awful lot like all the other 10-episode streaming series out there \u2014 take away the laughs and it could be a Netflix-Marvel production.Is that an improvement? It\u2019s a matter of taste. You may appreciate having more information about why cartoonish superheroes and villains \u2014 parodies of the serious crime fighters and criminals at Marvel and DC \u2014 walk the earth. You may be drawn in by the continuing story, in which the relationship of the Tick (Peter Serafinowicz) and his sidekick, Arthur (Griffin Newman), develops in a more linear and coherent fashion than it did before, with a more well-defined nemesis (the Terror, played by Jackie Earle Haley).Or you may feel that the addition of all that plot slows things down, and that less actually happens. You may feel that \u2014 as in so many other peak-TV series \u2014 \u201cnuance\u201d brings with it an unwelcome sentimentality. You may miss the 2001 show\u2019s charm and innocence, and feel that the Tick\u2019s bombastic dialogue isn\u2019t as funny this time around. (There\u2019s nothing in the new show so far to match, \u201cI am the sterling-silver ladle of justice, pouring its foamy cream over the just-picked strawberries of crime.\u201d)And despite Mr. Serafinowicz\u2019s quite capable performance, you may miss Patrick Warburton\u2019s Tick \u2014 less perceptive, more like a giant, earnest puppy, and funnier. To find out, of course, you\u2019ll need to watch both shows, so you\u2019d better get started.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "She Just Won 3 Gold Medals for Her Swimming. She\u2019s Only 73.", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringDaniela Barnea, who is 73, typically swims for up to an hour and a half, seven days a week. At her age, that kind of workout, during which she covers nearly two miles, is noteworthy.Even more so is the fact that Ms. Barnea, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., is a record-breaking swimmer and senior athlete who competes in sanctioned races for her age group in events around the world.At the 2017 United States Masters Swimming Spring Nationals, in Riverside, Calif., she won three gold medals in the women\u2019s 70-to-74-year-old age group. These included the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke finals and the 200-yard individual medley finals.Ms. Barnea is among the youngest featured in the movie. Donald Cheek, known as Doc, a resident of Clovis, Calif., is an international gold medal Masters sprinter at 87. Mr. Cheek repeatedly wins in the 85-to-89 division, competing in the 50-, 100-, 200- and 400-meter events. Last October, in the Huntsman World Senior Games in St. George, Utah, he set the games\u2019 record for 100 meters at 17.38.Gary Player, the 81-year-old retired professional golfer, also appears in the movie, to offer fitness tips in a 20-minute boot camp workout that is included in the documentary. That instruction is geared toward amateur athletes of all ages who yearn to stay active and, perhaps, to compete.She schedules her workouts around the time she spends with her three grandchildren and her part-time job as a foreign language tutor for the Palo Alto Unified School District.It\u2019s \u201ckind of boring swimming back and forth, back and forth, but when you have a goal, it\u2019s not,\u201d Ms. Barnea said. \u201cIt\u2019s like meditation to me. It\u2019s very peaceful. There is something very soothing about being surrounded by water.\u201dFor many older people, though, exercising can be a challenge. That\u2019s why the producers of \u201cImpossible Dreamers\u201d decided to give viewers workout tips.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want viewers to feel inspired by the film and then go back to their regular habits the next day,\u201d said Eric Goldfarb, the filmmaker. \u201cWe caught up with several of the athletes after the film\u2019s production to get their demonstrations on safe exercises for older adults; different movements that are simple, maximizing bodily benefits and fun.\u201dThe message, Mr. Goldfarb said, is that \u201cno matter where you are in your life, you do what you can\u201d with regard to fitness.\u201cYou exercise as much as you can without going beyond what your body is able to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe athletes in this film are not superheroes. They are all plagued with injury and real-life circumstance that happens to everybody, and they get through it.\u201dA few years ago, Ms. Barnea had abdominal surgery and needed to rebuild her swimming regimen slowly. \u201cI could barely swim across the width of pool, but every day I added a few laps, and got stronger and stronger,\u201d she said.A rotator cuff injury sustained in a dog-walking mishap, when she was pulled abruptly toward a neighbor\u2019s cat, still makes her wince and prevents her from competing in the butterfly, one of her signature events.But she keeps on stroking. This year, she will enter an estimated 20 competitions. \u201cYou need to trust yourself, trust the hopes and not the fears, and keep going around the obstacles,\u201d Ms. Barnea said.\u201cOur bodies are made for being used,\u201d she said. \u201cPhysical fitness and activity improves brain function. Anyone who is keeping up physical activity \u2014 both the aerobic part, which is really important, and the strength and balance and flexibility \u2014 is reducing the risks and buffering the decline that is going on.\u201dFor Mr. Cheek, the nation\u2019s fastest 100-meter sprinter in his age group, there is \u201ca pride and a mental discipline that carries over into your whole lifestyle,\u201d he said. Consistent exercise, said Mr. Cheek, who is a part-time professor of social psychology at California State University, Fresno, allows you to have \u201ca body that can perform for you any time you want.\u201dMr. Cheek, who grew up in Harlem and earned a Ph.D. from Temple University, has been running track since his days at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx. \u201cThe track represents freedom to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very clear measurement of what I am. It tells me I have guts, character, that I have what it takes.\u201dIn the \u201cImpossible Dreamers\u201d boot camp video, these senior athletes provide their best advice on how to keep athletes with less lofty ambitions fit.Mr. Cheek, for example, starts his routine with a variety of relaxed stretches. He and his wife, Patti, are shown lying in bed wearing workout clothes; they lift their legs in the air, curl their toes and spin their ankles in each direction.Mr. Cheek is also shown skipping with his grandchildren; he recommends two minutes of skipping. \u201cThis develops a certain rhythm for your body,\u201d he said. \u201cSkipping is what children do, and it\u2019s fun. It makes you smile.\u201dThen Mr. Cheek moves on to high-step skipping, with the emphasis on lifting his knees. He also recommends standing in place and moving your feet as fast as you can. \u201cDo it rhythmically, and move your arms as fast as you can,\u201d he said.In the documentary, Mr. Player is shown pacing on a treadmill, lifting light weights, doing situps and running rapidly in small steps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep the body moving like a piece of elastic,\u201d he says in the film.These exercises help keep him performing well on the golf course. \u201cAll you need is 10 minutes on the treadmill every day,\u201d he says.For these seasoned athletes, there\u2019s seemingly no fear of getting older. \u201cPeople usually don\u2019t want to tell their age, but not me,\u201d Ms. Barnea said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell them I am moving up to my next age group for competing. I can break new records when I\u2019m the youngest one in the race.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019: Aidan Gillen on Littlefinger\u2019s Stark Obsession", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGame of ThronesPetyr \u201cLittlefinger\u201d Baelish has helped to orchestrate many of the most monumental events in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d a list that includes Ned Stark\u2019s downfall, the Stark-Lannister conflict and Joffrey\u2019s murder.Littlefinger wasn\u2019t born bad \u2014 at least that\u2019s the theory of the man who plays him, Aidan Gillen. Rather his merciless ambition has its source in the shame he experienced as an even littler finger, when he was rejected by Catelyn Tully (Arya and Sansa\u2019s mother) in favor of the brawnier Ned Stark.\u201cIt\u2019s a reaction to being humiliated and spurned as a young man in matters of love,\u201d Mr. Gillen said on Monday afternoon. \u201cAnd he\u2019s good at it, you know? This \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 universe, it\u2019s a wicked world.\u201dBefore \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Mr. Gillen was perhaps best known to American audiences as the calculating politician Tommy Carcetti on \u201cThe Wire\u201d \u2014 he will also appear next season in the Netflix crime drama \u201cPeaky Blinders.\u201d Speaking by phone from Dublin, he discussed Littlefinger\u2019s plans for the Starks and why his interest in Sansa might not be as creepy as you think. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why are you so evil?It\u2019s pathological. I\u2019m not trying to play him as a complete villain, really, although he had his hand in many of the more treacherous acts or events we\u2019ve seen over seven seasons. Most of them, in fact.Is his plan to divide Arya and Sansa just his usual sort of manipulation? Or is there more to it with the Stark girls?There\u2019s always something more to it when it involves the Starks, given his history with Catelyn Stark and that rejection, and that that\u2019s what\u2019s driving him. But I wouldn\u2019t say the undermining of the Stark family has been a goal. It\u2019s opportunistic. He couldn\u2019t have foretold that Arya was going to show up again, and that Bran was going to show up again. He has played his part in the rise of the Starks, showing up last season with the Knights of the Vale, but he will also undermine it and exploit it. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing \u2014 he\u2019s trying to drive wedges between all of them.How much of what we see comes from his overarching plans and how much is just him reacting to events?It\u2019s a mixture of both. He always seems to have a more far-reaching plan but it can be tailored quite instantaneously, depending on what fortune throws his way. Some of it is just guessing, and it doesn\u2019t always go right. But it usually does. [Laughs.]The one plan he has articulated involves him on the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side \u2014Yeah, maybe.Maybe?I don\u2019t imagine that was to be taken literally. It was intended to be taken literally by Sansa. But with this character he\u2019ll say something and mean something else. It wasn\u2019t far off the mark.Are we supposed to believe he has actual affection for her?That was maybe unintentional. I\u2019m not really playing a romantic interest there. I know that\u2019s how it appears, but it\u2019s something slightly different.How would you characterize it?Kind of mentoring, in terms of schooling Sansa in the ways of manipulation, the ways to play the game, or the ways to survive. Of course there\u2019s a certain lack of clarity in what he\u2019s after, and I think that\u2019s the way it should be. I don\u2019t think I should have to say anything about it.Do you know his ultimate end game? Or are you in the dark, too?For the last couple of seasons we have been in the dark \u2014 we don\u2019t have books to consult anymore. I guess if you really wanted to hound the writers for your end game, they might indulge you. But I personally don\u2019t like to know. I think if you know it, you play it, and you might do something obvious.In the beginning Littlefinger was more inscrutable but he\u2019s since become a more transparently villainous character. Which was more fun to play?Even with the obvious villainy, you\u2019re always trying to at least make it likable and for there to be some fun to it. Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of screen time. If you still have a lot of story to tell in a certain amount of episodes, sometimes you\u2019ve got to get straight to plot detail. It might seem a bit more black-and-white or, in my case, villainous. There\u2019s so much story going on at the moment. You\u2019re living in the shadow of dragons.The show has gotten much faster, narratively.The ill-will people wish for your character, on social media, is pretty profound \u2014Is it? I don\u2019t look at that stuff. What are they calling for, specifically?Who do you think poses the biggest threat to him?You\u2019d have to ask her \u2014 I wondered about that myself. She wanted all the credit, maybe. That\u2019s luck for you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Going Nomad to Avoid Summer Rent Spikes", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-five years old, employed and engaged, Elana Rosman had not envisioned moving back to her childhood home in Great Neck, N.Y., on Long Island.She is not in a quarter-life crisis, seeking a safe haven to figure out her next step. It\u2019s much simpler than that. To avoid taking on a new lease this summer, Ms. Rosman is \u201cgoing nomad\u201d and has moved home with her parents.The summer rental season is notorious for being the priciest time of year in New York, because demand shoots up as recent graduates flock to the city looking for a place to live, and prices naturally follow suit. As a result, some people do whatever they can to put off signing a lease until fall.Temporary strategies include couch-surfing, house-sitting, finding a short-term rental or a boardinghouse, or moving in with relatives \u2014 as Ms. Rosman did. She figures that by waiting out the summer\u2019s high rental season, she may find rents as much as a few hundred dollars a month lower when she starts apartment-hunting in the fall.Sharon Leonor, who just completed graduate school, and Max Scharf, who just graduated from law school, chose to delay their move to Manhattan until September, when Mr. Scharf starts a new job as a first-year associate in the city. Their nomadic solution: moving into an Airbnb basement apartment in a house in Paramus, N.J., for a month and a half.Ms. Leonor and Mr. Scharf, both 25, started an apartment search in New York in May. \u201cAlmost everything was over $2,000 a month for places that didn\u2019t have a good living space or even a complete kitchen,\u201d Ms. Leonor said. \u201cWe knew it wouldn\u2019t meet our needs.\u201dWith Ms. Leonor studying for her social worker licensing exam, and Mr. Scharf for the New York state bar exam, they needed an apartment with enough room for each of them to hit the books.Since finding a suitable rental seemed out of the question, the couple changed tactics and started looking for a short-term Airbnb rental. Their search in Manhattan was brief. Ms. Leonor realized \u201cthis is silly \u2014 we\u2019re not even working and it feels like with rent and cost of living, we would just be throwing money away.\u201dThey eventually found the Paramus Airbnb, which is just a few towns over from where her parents live in Teaneck. \u201cWe got more bang for our buck,\u201d Ms. Leonor said.Although Ms. Leonor and Mr. Scharf have enjoyed the perks of living in New Jersey for the summer (cheaper grocery stores and restaurants, more space), Mr. Scharf has not wavered on their plan to relocate to Manhattan come fall, especially as he anticipates some long workdays. \u201cI lived in Teaneck and interned in Midtown last summer, and it takes at least an hour each way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lincoln Tunnel during rush hour is the stuff of nightmares.\u201dTheir time in the Airbnb ran out late last month and they have moved in temporarily with Ms. Leonor\u2019s parents. They have started their online search for Sept. 1 rentals and estimate that the number available within their budget is almost double what they found previously.Summer is the most common time of year to move for three reasons, according to Grant Long, the senior economist at StreetEasy: graduation, the weather and employment cycles.\u201cA big factor is school turnover,\u201d he said. New graduates moving to the city for a job or college provide a steady flow of new residents through the summer.People generally don\u2019t want to move in the slushy, frigid New York winter weather, he said. Job turnover \u2014 specifically in the finance and insurance industries \u2014 is another factor. \u201cBonus season in finance comes from January to March, depending on the company,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s typical for people to wait until they get their bonus, give it a couple of months, and then find a new job over the summer.\u201dBut then begins the vicious cycle. A year or two later, those same people have decided to move when their leases run out and are once again on the hunt for a new place.Daniel Reisner, 25, and his two roommates were presented with a rent increase of several hundred dollars a month when the lease on their Upper West Side apartment expired this spring. Unable to take on more rent, Mr. Reisner, a third-year law student, decided to move into a two-month sublet with his girlfriend, a college senior, who was in New York for the summer.\u201cWe found it on Craigslist,\u201d Mr. Reisner said. \u201cIt was around the corner from my apartment. We needed a place to live for a few months and this was perfect.\u201dMr. Reisner\u2019s next housing solution as he enters his final fall semester of law school will be a bunk under the parental roof in Merrick, N.Y., on Long Island. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sharing a room with my brother, who just graduated from college and moved home, which will be interesting.\u201dDespite the extra burden of the commute to the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Greenwich Village and a hit to his social life, Mr. Reisner said the move home is a necessity. \u201cI\u2019ve had other people ask me to move into their apartments this summer, but it was too expensive.\u201cMy plan is to move back into the city in January, when rent is a little bit lower,\u201d he said.The rental cycle is deliberate, said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. \u201cOwners can try to stagger leases to have them expire during the May and June months, knowing full well it\u2019s the highest demand for apartments.\u201d Savvy renters try to negotiate a summertime lease beyond the typical 12 months to push their tenancy into the fall, when demand and prices drop.\u201cAs a D.I.Y. landlord myself, I\u2019ve experienced that first hand,\u201d said Mr. Coon, who is based in Chicago. \u201cIf I have units that are being rented during the summer, I am able to charge 10 to 20 percent more in rent. So in big cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, 10 to 20 percent is a very meaningful dollar amount.\u201dDaniel Gallant, 41, has considerable experience in short stays. Over the years, \u201cthere have been several times when I was nomadic,\u201d he said. In the summer of 2000, Mr. Gallant and his two roommates were preparing to re-sign the lease for their Turtle Bay apartment, only to learn that the rent had doubled.He had a college buddy who let him stay at his place while he was out of town. And when he ran out of places to crash, Mr. Gallant convinced New Dramatists, a playwrights organization where he had once interned, to let him sleep in rooms reserved for members \u2014 when they were empty, of course. He also spent some time at Penington Friends House near Union Square, a Quaker boardinghouse, and at Menno House, a Mennonite boardinghouse also near Union Square. He is neither Quaker nor Mennonite.\u201cThere are a lot of places like this, but each has its own rules,\u201d Mr. Gallant said. \u201cThere\u2019s a yoga place in the West Village that was a combo yoga studio and a residence. These places were not incredibly luxurious, but they are all clean and safe places to stay.\u201dFor Mr. Gallant, this uncertain lifestyle was thrilling at times. \u201cI was constantly trying to figure out the next place that I would be staying, he said. \u201cIt was exciting, it was nomadic, it was a little bit frightening. But I had the luxury of knowing I was in this situation by choice.\u201d He was comforted by the thought that \u201cif I didn\u2019t need to keep pursuing this directing project, I could have gone home to my family\u201d in Maryland.Going nomad is an attempt at beating a system that can seem to peg the renter as the loser.\u201cThe fact that we really got a look at the market and what was out there was really helpful,\u201d Ms. Feierman said. \u201cI was on the summer cycle, having moved here after graduation, but my boyfriend, Dan, was on a different cycle.\u201dEven though she had just re-upped on her lease, it quickly became clear to Ms. Feierman that they should go with Mr. Feinberg\u2019s cycle because his lease would expire in the fall. Hunting for a Nov. 1 vacancy, \u201cwe found out a lot more was out there,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there was not as much inventory, but the apartments were more affordable.\u201dWhen the couple found a reasonably priced one-bedroom in Chelsea in mid-September last year with a Nov. 1 lease, she moved out of her apartment early, having found someone to take her place there. She and Mr. Feinberg now have high ceilings, exposed brick, a nice bathroom and a renovated kitchen with a dishwasher and washer/dryer.\u201cWe kind of thought we would give up on those amenities,\u201d Ms. Feierman said.Mr. Long said listings lately include anywhere from one to three months of free rent. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a Netflix subscription, Amazon Prime subscription, or Uber credits and other crazy things they offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the concessions go overall, we did see a peak over the winter.\u201dReal estate brokers warn, though, that trying to outfox the system doesn\u2019t always work out. \u201cJust because you want to wait out the market doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will win,\u201d said Mr. Malin of Citi Habitats. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off \u2014 there\u2019s a risk and reward on both ends,\u201d he said.A renter who puts off a hunt in hopes of cheaper apartments in a few months could miss out on an ideal place. \u201cSometimes the reality is when you go see something you love and want, and if you can afford it, it\u2019s hard to turn it away,\u201d Mr. Malin said. The strategy could also backfire if the market shifts and rents go up across the board, even when the weather cools.Mr. Long said that being open to compromise will serve you well while apartment hunting. \u201cOne of the things to keep in mind is that renting and finding a good deal can favor those who are flexible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have the flexibility to stay on a friend\u2019s couch for a while, and it gives you a better chance to get what you want, do it.\u201dMs. Feierman believes her willingness to be flexible with moving dates made it easier to find a decent apartment. \u201cWe realized whatever we needed to do, we could make it work \u2014 like we could move out of our places a month early if we needed to,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving the time and money to do that made our process better. We didn\u2019t feel like we needed to settle or jump on the first thing we found.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Rosman spent part of the summer commuting from Great Neck to her job as a physician assistant at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She plans to move into an apartment with her fianc\u00e9 in November, around the time of their wedding. \u201cIt started out as a joke,\u201d Ms. Rosman said, referring to a conversation the couple had about her moving in with her parents on Long Island.But the concept turned serious when they realized they couldn\u2019t afford the summer leases they were finding online. \u201cWhen I go on StreetEasy and put in my specifications and my budget, there are fewer options available for this time of year than in the spring and fall,\u201d she said.Ms. Rosman says going nomad has been a good move. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely stressful moving home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s worth it.\u201dLooking ahead, she knows she won\u2019t have to be stingy when moving day arrives. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stress about nickel and diming my move,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saving in rent and I can move out in style.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But from 2007 to 2015 rates rose from 10.8 to 14.2 per 100,000 male teenagers and from 2.4 to 5.1 per 100,000 female teenagers. In 2011, for the first time in more than 20 years, more teenagers died from suicide than homicide.But these trends have been known for years. Our response to them hasn\u2019t adequately acknowledged their progression.There are things we as a society can do as well. We need to make things safer for teenagers, which includes reducing their access to the means they might likely use in a suicide attempt. Also important but more difficult, we need to promote connectedness and limit isolation. The best thing we can do for teens at risk is to prevent them from cutting themselves off from others.We have been failing to meet these goals too often when it comes to the media, guns and community.While we can debate the relative merits of making it easier or harder to own a gun, it\u2019s clear that guns should be kept out of the hands of children.We need to talk about suicide in ways that help, not harm. We need to make sure young people have no access to guns. And we need to make sure they are connected enough to each other, to family, and to the health care system so that those at risk can be recognized and given the care they need.

{"Headline": "To Survive in Tough Times, Restaurants Turn to Data-Mining", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe early diners are dawdling, so your 7:30 p.m. reservation looks more like 8. While you wait, the last order of the duck you wanted passes by. Tonight, you\u2019ll be eating something else \u2014 without a second bottle of wine, because you can\u2019t find your server in the busy dining room. This is not your favorite night out.The right data could have fixed it, according to the tech wizards who are determined to jolt the restaurant industry out of its current slump. Information culled and crunched from a wide array of sources can identify customers who like to linger, based on data about their dining histories, so the manager can anticipate your wait, buy you a drink and make the delay less painful.It can track the restaurant\u2019s duck sales by day, week and season, and flag you as a regular who likes duck. It can identify a server whose customers have spent a less-than-average amount on alcohol, to see if he needs to sharpen his second-round skills.So Big Data is staging an intervention.Both start-ups and established companies are scrambling to deliver up-to-the-minute data on sales, customers, staff performance or competitors by merging the information that restaurants already have with all sorts of data from outside sources: social media, tracking apps, reservation systems, review sites, even weather reports.They have an eager audience. The NPD Group, a market research company, is predicting \u201cflat\u201d growth in 2017 restaurant traffic, with a 2 percent decline among full-service restaurants and no growth for quick-service restaurants. A 2016 National Restaurant Association survey reported that four out of five restaurateurs believed that business would improve if they embraced technology, and a third worried that they were lagging in those efforts.In the old days, restaurateurs used ledgers to track sales, and scribbled notes about their customers\u2019 preferences or idiosyncrasies. Then along came point-of-sale software and reservation services that provided more sophisticated records and analysis, but created a tech tower of Babel, with most systems speaking their own dialect.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.These new tools make a paradoxical promise: that they can take restaurants back to the good old days, before the business grew so big.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201cis to leverage the technology to do what we would do if we had one little restaurant and we were there all the time and knew every customer by name.\u201dMr. Oberholtzer and his two partners opened the first of two dozen cafeteria-style restaurants in Culver City, Calif., in 2006, and plan to open an equal number in the Northeast by 2020. Every new Tender Greens will rely on what he calls \u201ca whole rebuild of technology,\u201d because the 11-year-old system it uses is about as up-to-date as a beeper.\u201cIt gives us ways to recognize people who\u2019ve been in regularly, or haven\u2019t been in for a while or have specific preferences,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said.A regular diner who always orders the ni\u00e7oise salad will get a message on the app about the halibut special. A diner who always orders vegetarian options will not get the message about the summer hog roast. \u201cWe want to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201csometimes before they even mention them.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t know that someone\u2019s going to become a regular, so you don\u2019t necessarily keep track of those people,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cBut the system does.\u201d It also tracks the top 100\u2019s dining companions when they split the check. Upserve sends a list of credit card numbers, dates of visits and items bought; the restaurant matches each number to a name, and a search on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn provides a face to go with it.\u201cWe\u2019re sure to recognize them\u201d the next time they come in, so the staff can welcome them back by name, Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn\u2019t make the reservation themselves.\u201dEven the type of credit card contributes to the dossier. If a customer pays with an airline card, a server might mention travel. If a customer is a sports fan, he will most likely get a server who is as well.Customers who find the mining of personal data invasive can opt out, up to a point, but it requires effort: To avoid detection, they have to pay cash and not make reservations. Those who participate actively in the process get more information in return.In June 2015, the online reservation service OpenTable, which represents 43,000 restaurants worldwide, started to provide customized recommendations, just as Netflix and Amazon suggest programs or products based on a customer\u2019s history.If users sign up for the company\u2019s app and allow OpenTable access to their GPS, they receive recommendations for restaurants in the United States and several foreign countries, said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing.And if data can help a customer find a restaurant, it can also help a restaurant find its customers. To pinpoint potential locations in the Northeast that best reach what Mr. Oberholtzer calls Tender Greens\u2019s \u201cpsychographic\u201d \u2014 the college-educated diner who cares about health and locally produced food \u2014 he starts with data from a customer analytics firm that specializes in site selection.He refines that list with Google searches like \u201cplant-forward lifestyle,\u201d he said, and looks at where delivery systems like Uber and DoorDash do a lot of business.\u201cYou overlay and look for redundancy,\u201d he said, \u201cand that begins to tell the story of where you want to be.\u201dThe scorecard ranks servers on multiple criteria, which makes it easier for Ms. Williamson to identify the right waiter, for example, for a large party with children. She might not pick the server who sells the most. The more appropriate match could be a server who ranks higher in tip percentage than in sales, thanks to grateful families who tend to order less alcohol.Start-ups aspire to create even more streamlined software, but it isn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe\u2019re making a moon shot here,\u201d said Mr. Chowdhury of Salido, which originally set an August deadline for \u201ca fully operational stack\u201d of features but is only about three-quarters of the way there. The company has extended its deadline to early 2018, as development work continues with 64 existing clients.Still, some early adopters approach the new systems warily. Mr. Guidara, who also uses Avero at Eleven Madison Park, thinks technology is great for a fast-casual operation that emphasizes volume and delivery, and for the business side at a fine-dining operation. It has no place, he said, when it comes to service at Eleven Madison Park or the NoMad, where he and Mr. Humm rely on traditional methods of high-end hospitality: expertise, eye contact and a hair-trigger response to a diner\u2019s every need.\u201cWhen I worked as a controller, in accounting capacities, we used it quite often,\u201d Mr. Guidara said. \u201cBut from an experiential, guest-facing point of view, we don\u2019t use it. That\u2019s never been how we approach things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pushed constantly about these new systems,\u201d Mr. Kinch said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s all about the guest? I think that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I place a tremendous value on direct eye contact and a genuine smile.\u201dAt Oriole, the Sandovals have left sake on the menu despite data showing that it doesn\u2019t sell well. \u201cWe go by our gut,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt pairs well with a lot of the courses, it\u2019s very versatile, and it speaks to how we\u2019re willing not to go the traditional route.\u201dThe sheer glut of new restaurant data systems can be overwhelming, even to those who embrace them.\u201cAt least once a week, I get something about a new start-up with a new gadget that\u2019s going to make our lives so much better,\u201d said Sisha Ortuzar, Mr. Colicchio\u2019s partner at \u2018Wichcraft. \u201cThey\u2019re distractions.

{"Headline": "The Culture Wars Have Come to Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe culture wars that have consumed politics in the United States have now landed on Silicon Valley\u2019s doorstep.Silicon Valley\u2019s politics have long skewed left, with a free-market\u2019s philosophy and a dash of libertarianism. But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore\u2019s firing has now plunged the nation\u2019s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country.Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Mr. Damore\u2019s comments carried additional weight to people on either side of the political spectrum because he was an engineer at Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.Alongside other giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Apple, these companies \u201care seen as pillars of our society,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cControversy and statements that emanate from these employees take on a different heft.\u201dThe technology industry has long marched in lock step on issues such as supporting immigration and diversity, even though their companies remained largely male, white and Asian. But last year\u2019s election of Mr. Trump \u2014 with his broadsides against political correctness, his coarse language toward women and his actions to restrict immigration and deny climate change \u2014 seemed to threaten many of those ideals.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s words may have made dissenters in the tech industry more comfortable about speaking out.\u201cTrump, in a sense, licensed people to express what some people would call politically incorrect thoughts,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Business School. \u201cThen there\u2019s the other force that a lot of Trump\u2019s policies go against the inclusive ideals these companies espouse.\u201dMr. Damore\u2019s memo and dismissal transformed him into a hero on right-wing news sites like Breitbart, which has long criticized the political leanings of the tech industry.\u201cGoogle drives a big sector of tech into the arms of Trump: fires employee who wrote memo about women in tech jobs,\u201d Dr. Pinker wrote.One of the most outspoken supporters of Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley has been Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who has since faced derision from other people working in tech for his political stance. In a sign of how deep that ill feeling runs, Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings warned Mr. Thiel last August, a few weeks after Mr. Trump had accepted the Republican nomination for president, that he would face consequences for backing Mr. Trump.\u201cI see our board being about great judgment, particularly in unlikely disaster where we have to pick new leaders,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote in the email to Mr. Thiel, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \"I\u2019m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from \u2018different judgment\u2019 to \u2018bad judgment.\u2019 Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Hastings declined to comment through their spokesmen; neither challenged the authenticity of the email. Both of the men remain on Facebook\u2019s board.Mr. Luckey, through mutual agreement with his employer, stayed away from the Oculus offices to let the controversy die down, according to three people with knowledge of the episode who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. In December, before returning briefly to the office, he told colleagues he was committed to staying at the company, according to a copy of a message he posted on an internal discussion board, which was reviewed by The Times.But by the end of March, Oculus said he was no longer working there.A Facebook spokeswoman reiterated an earlier company statement saying that Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure was unrelated to his political views. Mr. Luckey declined to comment on his departure from Facebook.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dave Chappelle Sizes Up America at Radio City", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyDave Chappelle is the only artist alive who would close a comedy show by finding a ray of hope in our current political situation through a poetic recounting of the tragic murder of Emmett Till.No reviewer\u2019s recounting can do justice to his intricate, virtuosic storytelling, so you will have to buy a ticket to Mr. Chappelle\u2019s show at Radio City Music Hall to find out how he pulls off this feat. As audacious as it is, this set piece is also an example of how his singular daring can be in tension with a comic\u2019s instinct to be as funny as he or she can be. There\u2019s no joke at the end of this bit. Instead, Mr. Chappelle says that he has had trouble sleeping since Donald Trump was elected. His new set exudes the weary tone of many following the daily bombshells in the news, with Mr. Chappelle even expressing second thoughts about his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d monologue after the election when he said he would give Mr. Trump a chance.Mr. Chappelle hasn\u2019t just started a three-and-a-half-week run, which ends on Aug. 24, when he\u2019ll turn 44. He\u2019s producing a massive cultural festival, headlining with a lineup of some of the greatest comedians of color in the country (Chris Rock, Leslie Jones, Ali Wong, Trevor Noah) along with top-shelf musical acts (Solange, Lauryn Hill, Chance the Rapper, Ice Cube). By presenting it in the sleepy month of August, he turns Radio City into the most exciting party in the city.Mr. Chappelle has always had an instinct for showmanship, honed from doing stand-up since age 14. His new show starts theatrically, with the comedian ascending from beneath the floor of the stage under a ring of lights and over a cloud of smoke. Puffing on a cigarette, he wears what has become his customary military jacket with his last name printed over his left breast pocket. This uniform makes him look more formal and severe than he did in his earlier days.His stage persona has changed too, with less animated physicality and a faster, raspier delivery. Mr. Chappelle\u2019s jokes once moseyed before they exploded. They\u2019re steadier now, quicker to start, but less likely to dart off in wild directions. And his voice doesn\u2019t range as much, staying in a deeper register. Some of his agility and mischievousness has been replaced with an increased narrative ambition, rooted in a confidence in his ability to get a laugh so firm that he goes deep into ideas without a punch line. This strategy has risks, which he not only embraces but also luxuriates in.Mr. Chappelle asks emphatically: How far is Ms. Dolezal willing to go to become black? \u201cAre you willing to refinance your house,\u201d he says, pausing for laughter before finishing the sentence, \u201cso you can invest in a mixtape that won\u2019t pan out?\u201dIn this new show, he tells a story of a fan who expresses hurt over such material, which leads Mr. Chappelle to examine himself. What follows is both fascinating and frustrating, searching and often funny. Like his material about Emmett Till, it\u2019s organized like an onion, with an initial response peeled away to find a different one which leads to an third and most absurd finale. Some of the biggest laughs of the show come from the transitional line he uses more than once: \u201cBut if I\u2019m honest.\u201dMr. Chappelle makes pleas for treating transgender people with respect, even praising their courage relative to Ms. Dolezal. But when he goes deeper into his feelings, he returns to the frame of race.He finds the discussion about sensitivity toward transgender \u201creeks of white privilege,\u201d and wonders pointedly why it\u2019s easier for Caitlyn Jenner to change gender than it was for Cassius Clay to change his name?This is one of those lines that gets not a laugh but a kind of audible nod of the head \u2014 or, to be more precise, a \u201chmmm\u201d that suggests an idea has lit up the minds of audience members. Mr. Chappelle gets more of this kind of feedback than most comics. Increasingly, he searches them out, which is part of why he remains one of the most compelling figures in popular culture.At his best, Mr. Chappelle\u2019s proves that thoughtfulness can make a joke funnier. Making smart comedy that is argumentative and funny is not a zero sum game, but his first performance of a long residency at Radio City does occasionally makes you wonder if it is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australian Friendliness, Shopping, Faith in Government ... and Angst?", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 21______I\u2019ll also be heading back to the United States soon for a holiday, and when I return, I\u2019ll share some impressions about that experience as well. A lot seems to be changing and not changing since I left.What\u2019s below is, of course, just a selection of what\u2019s front of mind at the moment, so don\u2019t expect comprehensiveness and feel free to disagree with or expand on my impressions. My goal, as always to some degree, is to open up the journalism process.So consider this, perhaps, my rolling answer to the question I hear all the time: So what do you think of Australia?Forever FriendlyThere are lots of countries with friendly reputations, certainly, but what I\u2019ve come to appreciate about Australia is that for most people I meet, the first instinct seems to be \u201chow can I help.\u201dIt\u2019s pretty different from New York City, my last home, where people are locked in their own bubbles of work, or Mexico, my home before that, where people were simply scared when strangers approached. Australia often feels to me (as a white English-speaking male) like a backyard party where it\u2019s assumed that I have a good reason to be sharing the food and drink.Buy, and Buy MoreThink of the neighborhood butchers. And the chemists. And, well, all the small storefront business, and the crowded shopping centers \u2014 this, my friends, is not the way Americans shop.Ordering online and waiting is the reality in cities across the United States, but here in this remarkably wealthy country, brick-and-mortar retail is still king. And it\u2019s all a bit stunning for someone who has had to set up a bureau, and a new home, after years of avoiding the routine of park, choose, wait in line, purchase, carry out, carry home.In the meantime, you can find me in line at Coles, scratching my head, asking the friendly guy next to me what\u2019s taking so long.Government, Good?Australians gasp in horror when they look at American gun culture, but many Australians tell me it\u2019s not just because of the violence. It\u2019s also about government.Americans often discuss government in pure binary terms: It\u2019s good or bad. In Iraq, in Haiti and in many other countries where I\u2019ve worked, government is seen, instead, either as an annoyance or a path to wealth.Politically, this is perhaps the clearest difference between how Washington and Canberra are viewed and judged. As Julia Gillard, the former prime minister, told me when we met recently for coffee:\u201cFaith in government is stronger here than in the U.S. Australians believe government can work and should work, and to the extent it doesn\u2019t that is the fault of politicians, and you get to vote them in and out.\u201dBanter Never EndsIf Australians\u2019 first instinct is friendliness and the second is curiosity, then could the third be humor, insecurity or a mix of the two? I\u2019m thinking of the jokes and sharp comments, which especially when directed at outsiders, often seem aimed at diverting attention from (or reflecting) some underexplored sense of angst.This is an aspect of Australia that I\u2019m still trying to figure out, with help from others. Two recent conversations with \u201cnew Australians\u201d \u2014 the children of immigrants \u2014 come to mind. Both are journalists, both have lived outside the country and returned with their own set of questions about what it is that keeps conversations in Australia from going as deep as they could.One works for a major broadcaster, and he argued that Australia is anti-intellectual. The other, Isabella Kwai, works for us, and she tied it more to the Australian penchant for prioritizing a laugh.\u201cThe banter here is never-ending,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked joking around in conversations, sometimes probably in situations where I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant, but here, people can take a joke very, very far. I wonder if it makes it difficult to have serious, deep conversations about tough things happening in the world.\u201dThis is not universal throughout Australia. I\u2019ve had many deep and probing discussions about uncomfortable subjects like race, gender and violence since I arrived. And other countries have their own issues when it comes to self-examination (Cuba, te veo).But you tell me: Is there not something to this? How would you describe what I\u2019m getting at?And with that, here are my New York Times picks of the week, plus a recommendation._____________________________See you in two weeks.Advertisement"}

They will also get access to a library of older shows, including \u201cLouie\u201d and \u201cNip/Tuck.\u201dFX\u2019s move is a baby step toward competing directly with rivals like Netflix and HBO, which offer current and past seasons of a legion of popular shows.But the agreement with Comcast is nevertheless significant, and another sign that a subscription-based business model has become more important as ratings have fallen throughout the television industry. Both the premium cable channel Showtime and the broadcast network CBS also have stand-alone apps.The announcement signals that the cable network may be less inclined to make these lucrative outside deals with other streaming services. Though the money from these deals is a shot in the arm in the short term, the network is finding that the long-term rights are more valuable because the programs can be used to entice potential future subscribers.\u201cThis initiative represents the first of its kind for an ad-supported cable network, and begins to put us on equal footing with premium networks and streaming services,\u201d FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venice Film Festival Tends Its Prestige With Care", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d and other opening-night predecessors, \u201cDownsizing\u201d is a pedigreed American film with stars, a hook and an ambitious use of genre. Mr. Payne, though a generation older than Mr. Chazelle, also had his roots in indie film before moving on to larger canvases and even bigger names. From \u201cDownsizing\u201d to \u201cGravity,\u201d a particular curated brand of cinema is discernible in Venice\u2019s opening-night selections, one that captures the imagination while delving into character psychology.\u201cThe premise may be a bit fantastical, but I\u2019m more interested in human beings and, in a way, the banal side of a fantastic idea. It\u2019s really a science fiction idea as an excuse to enter the story,\u201d Mr. Payne said of \u201cDownsizing\u201d in a telephone conversation during a break from putting the finishing touches on the film\u2019s coloring.\u201cDownsizing\u201d is one of three highly anticipated genre-related efforts from big studios in competition for Venice\u2019s Golden Lion honors. Darren Aronofsky returns with \u201cMother!,\u201d a thriller starring Jennifer Lawrence; \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d is the Cold War-era tale of an aquatic creature from the fantasy-friendly director Guillermo del Toro.Other high-profile selections include \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d starring Matt Damon and directed by George Clooney from a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen; the period picture \u201cVictoria and Abdul,\u201d starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria of England and directed by Stephen Frears; Paul Schrader\u2019s \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d with Ethan Hawke as an angst-filled priest; \u201cLoving Pablo,\u201d with Javier Bardem as Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug lord; the John Woo action film \u201cManhunt\u201d; and Martin McDonagh\u2019s salty Southern drama \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d starring Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson.Two films pair screen stars of a certain age: \u201cLeisure Seeker\u201d stars Donald Sutherland and Helen Mirren as an aging couple who hit the road while dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s, and \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d follows widowed neighbors played by Jane Fonda and Robert Redford (who will receive Golden Lions for lifetime achievement).These titles speak to Venice\u2019s appeal for mainstream films seeking a classy international debut and an early platform well in advance of their theatrical premieres in the United States. But the festival has also traditionally been home to its share of adventurous art-house fare. In that regard, Mr. Barbera, who heads what is billed as the world\u2019s oldest film festival, believes the landscape of contemporary cinema has definitively changed.\u201cFifteen or 20 years ago, there was a kind of auteur cinema you could expect to find in every festival,\u201d Mr. Barbera said in an interview from the festival\u2019s headquarters on the Lido in Venice. \u201cNow it\u2019s much more difficult for filmmakers to express themselves the same way and to finance the films.\u201dDespite Mr. Barbera\u2019s observations, this year\u2019s festival will offer premieres of films from an array of independent voices at various points in their careers. These include the new films by Japan\u2019s Hirokazu Kore-Eda, \u201cThe Third Murder\u201d; Israel\u2019s Samuel Maoz, \u201cFoxtrot\u201d; Takeshi Kitano, \u201cOutrage Coda\u201d; also the festival\u2019s closing film; \u201cThe Insult,\u201d from the Lebanese-born director Ziad Doueiri; and \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d from Andrew Haigh, the director of \u201c45 Years.\u201dBut two titles will probably top the watch list of the festival\u2019s cinephiles: Lucrecia Martel\u2019s colonial drama \u201cZama,\u201d her first in nearly a decade, screening out of competition; and \u201cMektoub, My Love: Canto Uno,\u201d from Abdellatif Kechiche, the outspoken director of \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color.\u201dThe premiere of \u201cMektoub\u201d will occur after months of reports concerning Mr. Kechiche\u2019s dispute with a financier, which was followed by his attempt to auction off the Palme d\u2019Or award he received at Cannes for \u201cBlue.\u201d Reached by email, Mr. Kechiche struck an optimist\u2019s tone.\u201cIn my films, I have always tried to achieve a certain faithfulness, a fidelity to how things are when they happen, and that still holds true for me. But in \u2018Mektoub, My Love\u2019 especially, I think the audience will also recognize an honest search for new talent. My protagonists, all of them first-time actors on the big screen, are wonderful,\u201d wrote Mr. Kechiche, who won a Golden Lion in 2007 for \u201cThe Secret of the Grain.\u201dEven as \u201cZama\u201d and \u201cMektoub\u201d attract critical attention, one of this year\u2019s most controversial films lurks in the festival\u2019s Horizons section. \u201cCaniba,\u201d directed by the nonfiction pioneers Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel (\u201cLeviathan\u201d), centers on Issei Sagawa, an aging Japanese cannibal. Jailed but ultimately released after eating a woman in France, Mr. Sagawa has made a living from his life story. \u201cCaniba\u201d promises an eyebrow-raising, intimate look at the man and his caretaker brother.\u201cI wanted to push collaboration further than filmmakers usually do with their subjects, and I knew he was interested in dying by being eaten by someone he desired,\u201d Ms. Paravel wrote of Issei Sagawa in an email. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure that he would want me to eat him, or that I would be able to. But I felt I at least partly understood his desire.\u201dOther nonfiction films in Venice may pale beside the mysteries of \u201cCaniba,\u201d but even sans cannibalism, the rest of the documentary lineup is robust.Frederick Wiseman examines a literary and social institution in \u201cEx Libris: The New York Public Library.\u201d Errol Morris rolls out his hybrid Netflix series \u201cWormwood,\u201d about the unexplained death of a Cold War military scientist. William Friedkin, the director of \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d confronts actual ghost-busting in \u201cThe Devil and Father Amorth.\u201d The Chinese art star Ai Weiwei surveys world immigration in \u201cHuman Flow,\u201d while Stephen Nomura Schible portrays a leading contemporary composer in \u201cRyuichi Sakamoto: Coda.\u201d The comedy trickster Andy Kaufman gets his close-up in Chris Smith\u2019s new documentary, with the help of Jim Carrey. And the Bronx\u2019s own Abel Ferrara takes a look at today\u2019s Rome in \u201cPiazza Vittorio.\u201dThis year, in addition to cultivating a larger-than-life documentary slate, Mr. Barbera is taking the plunge with the virtual reality trend that has swept across the festival world. Venice\u2019s twist is a competition devoted to virtual reality, subjecting an infant medium to the same scrutiny as film, with the help of a jury led by the director John Landis.\u201cThis is a bet,\u201d Mr. Barbera said. \u201cThe last two years, everybody talked about V.R. There were V.R. installations in Cannes, Venice, Sundance, Tribeca. So we thought that it was the right moment. There are big investments from the film industry in researching and implementing the technology, and at the same time curiosity from the filmmakers and a willingness to experiment.\u201dThe V.R. competition includes work by Laurie Anderson and Tsai Mingliang, and at 22 titles, outnumbers even the film competition. Other nontraditional cinematic offerings this year include Mr. Landis\u2019s own 3-D version of his \u201cThriller\u201d video. And just a vaporetto ride away is Venice\u2019s ongoing art Biennale, featuring film-related work: Candice Breitz\u2019s film installation about refugees starring Alec Baldwin and Julianne Moore, and a video piece by the Turner Prize winner Douglas Gordon.All of which brings new meaning to the notion of a festival competition: a competition for attention. By opening with \u201cDownsizing\u201d and featuring a potent mix of anticipated titles and conversation-starting nonfiction, this year\u2019s film festival is poised to continue attracting the notice of film fans beyond those populating its cinemas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prince Philip Makes His Last Solo Appearance, After 65 Years in the Public Eye", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe could be forgiven for finally taking a break.A native of Greece, Prince Philip courted the then-Princess Elizabeth during his time in the Royal Navy, a part of history that has captivated a new generation of Britons via the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown.\u201d Their seven-decade marriage has seen Britain through postwar austerity, the creation of a welfare state, the loss of empire, entry into what became the European Union and, now, plans to exit it.Befitting a rugged former naval officer with a passion for the outdoors, he paid tribute on the grounds of Buckingham Palace to a group of Royal Marines who had just finished an athletic challenge that included a 1,664-mile trek for charity.Perhaps befitting a prince known for his periodic blunders, his departure from public life did not pass without mishap. On Wednesday, The Daily Telegraph, a conservative-leaning newspaper known for its royal coverage, accidentally published an article on its website stating that Prince Philip had died, commemorating his life and detailing his funeral. (It has since been taken down.)In the end, after hours of waiting and anticipation, the palace announced the then-95-year-old prince was retiring, even as Buckingham Palace said that he might still occasionally attend public events at the queen\u2019s side. At the time, Prime Minister Theresa May offered him \u201cour deepest gratitude and good wishes.\u201dPart diplomat, part royal consort, Prince Philip has served as a patron, a president or a member of more than 780 organizations. The nephew of King Constantine I of Greece, he was born in 1921 in somewhat unroyal surroundings: a dining room table in a villa on Corfu, a Greek island.Offered a gift by a Kenyan woman in 1984, he asked: \u201cYou are a woman, aren\u2019t you?\u201dAsked his opinion of Beijing, while on a tour of China in 1986, his reply was succinct: \u201cGhastly.\u201d\u201cHow do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?\u201d he said to a driving instructor in Oban, Scotland, in 1995.Addressing a group of deaf children standing next to a Caribbean steel drum band in Cardiff, Wales, in 1999, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re near there, no wonder you are deaf.\u201dHis very conspicuous lack of political correctness notwithstanding, on Wednesday he was mostly heaped with praise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nostalgia Goes Niche in \u2018Wet Hot American Summer\u2019 and \u2018Comrade Detective\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe needn\u2019t have worried. Nostalgia is not merely a renewable resource. Like the atom, it can also be split, into ever-narrower, more time- and place-specific reveries. Two specimens of this niche-stalgia come to streaming TV this Friday.Now, the eight-episode sequel to the prequel returns for a reunion set in 1991, meaning the actors now play characters roughly the age they were when they made the original movie.So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters\u2019 \u201980s glory days; for the \u201990s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy \u201cThe State\u201d for MTV); and for itself \u2014 that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.As a cultural artifact, it\u2019s both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence. But as a franchise, it feels like it\u2019s running out of time.\u201cTen Years Later,\u201d with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on \u201990s stalker flicks like \u201cThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\u201d At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and \u201ca bunch of other things from 1991.\u201dMany of the core stories are the same. Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn\u2019t gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn\u2019t lost his virginity. And there\u2019s another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way. The lead roles \u2014 hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef \u2014 are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.It\u2019s a brilliant idea. But it\u2019s not much more than an idea.There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football). And the roster of famous voice-over actors \u2014 among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny \u2014 makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.But \u201cComrade Detective\u201d is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama \u2014 a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved \u2014 that it often plays like one. At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn\u2019t fast or frequent enough. Edited to a tighter length, \u201cComrade Detective\u201d might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.

And he knows it.\u201cI don\u2019t have the enjoyment of a gym that you need to play those kinds of roles,\u201d he said.For one thing, Chili Palmer isn\u2019t part of it. The series abandons the original\u2019s characters and narrative, replacing Palmer with an Irish hood named Miles Daly, played by Mr. O\u2019Dowd.And for Epix, a channel even the show\u2019s stars have a hard time finding, the hope is that \u201cGet Shorty\u201d will help transform it from an afterthought to a player in the crowded premium TV landscape.\u201cThis show has the opportunity to tell the rest of the world, \u2018This is what an Epix show looks like,\u2019\u201d said Mark Greenberg, its president and chief executive.What \u201cGet Shorty\u201d looks like might surprise fans of the book or, especially, the Barry Sonnenfeld film. A stylish crime flick in the 1990s mold, it combined violence and wisecracks into a confection that was glibly fun and self-consciously cool. (Its sequel, which introduced Chili to the music business, was even called \u201cBe Cool.\u201d)By contrast the series is a slower, grimmer tale that originates not in glitzy Miami but in the bleak sandscape of Pahrump, Nev.Miles is cool, certainly, but he cares less about that than about repairing his broken family by finding legitimate \u2014 or legal, at least \u2014 work in Hollywood. His way in is a potent visual symbol: A bloodstained script, taken from a murdered screenwriter, that Miles convinces Rick to help him turn into a film.But unlike \u201cFargo,\u201d which introduces a new story and cast each year, any future seasons of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d will continue the narrative and feature the same characters (those that survive the first season, anyway).The unconventional choice of Mr. O\u2019Dowd to play the heavy began with Allen Coulter, a former \u201cSopranos\u201d director who helmed the \u201cGet Shorty\u201d pilot, and who early in the series\u2019s development reviewed a casting list that included photos of potential actors. \u201cHe goes, \u2018I want someone menacing, like that guy.\u2019 And he pointed to Chris,\u201d Davey Holmes, the creator of the series, recalled. \u201cWe said, \u2018You\u2019re not familiar with Chris\u2019s work, are you?\u2019\u201dBut with his normally tousled hair shorn close to the scalp and some tattoos added in makeup, the six-foot-three actor transformed into a believable tough guy.Mr. O\u2019Dowd hadn\u2019t read \u201cGet Shorty\u201d or seen the movie. But he was intrigued by the opportunity to play a \u201chard man,\u201d especially one that was the focal point of the show. \u201cTo be the person in the room who can hurt people is kind of fun,\u201d he said.The actor, married with two young sons, was on a dad break, having walked the few blocks from his house to a cafe on Melrose Avenue. Born and raised in western Ireland, Mr. O\u2019Dowd has lived in Los Angeles for several years and remains a fan of the city, even as he agreed that the central joke of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d \u2014 that criminal talents translate nicely to Hollywood \u2014 is well founded.\u201cThe brutality that people can treat each other with in this business is undoubted,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get rid of actors, get rid of jobs, lose people\u2019s money, and then they go for granola somewhere.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily do consequences in the way the rest of humanity does,\u201d he added.\u201cI think it\u2019s genuine,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dowd said, laughing. \u201cRay finding his place in the world is a constant battle that he fights with himself, which is kind of gorgeous to watch.\u201dMr. Romano\u2019s latest challenge: Finding his show. \u201cI\u2019ve still got to figure out a way to get Epix,\u201d he said.\u201cAt the time we were kind of like, \u2018Does Netflix even do TV?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverything ends up wherever it ends up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Diversity Initiatives Are \u2018Way Overdue,\u2019 Academy President Says", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Last week, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that John Bailey would serve as its next president, succeeding Cheryl Boone Isaacs, Hollywood scratched its head.Who?Mr. Bailey, 75, is a cinematographer who has thrived in the film business by helping others shine. He handled the cinematography for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d which won four Oscars in 1981, including one for Robert Redford\u2019s direction. Mr. Bailey\u2019s work on \u201cAs Good as It Gets\u201d helped Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson win Academy Awards in 1998.But it has become immediately clear that Mr. Bailey \u2014 a foreign-film lover who has never been personally nominated for an Oscar \u2014 is ready for the klieg lights that come with his new job. He was elected by the academy\u2019s 54-member board of governors last Tuesday night. By Friday, he was at work. On Monday, he spoke to a reporter by phone, tackling questions about an array of academy challenges with a candor often lacking in its officials.For instance, asked whether his election undercut the organization\u2019s push to better represent women and minorities \u2014 as some people in moviedom immediately snarked \u2014 Mr. Bailey responded in colorful fashion. \u201cWell, they can snark themselves up their wazoo,\u201d he said. \u201cI was born white. I was born male. It\u2019s who I am, but it\u2019s not a limiting factor in what I can do. We\u2019re going to keep doing everything we can to be more inclusive. I happen to think that the academy\u2019s initiatives regarding diversity are way overdue.\u201dMr. Bailey added: \u201cBut the academy is not the industry. We can jump in and work to solve this issue \u2014 and we are. But we can\u2019t bear sole responsibility. The jobs have to be there.\u201d The academy, which is 72 percent male and 87 percent white, pledged in wake of the social media campaign #OscarsSoWhite to double female and minority membership by 2020.Here are some excerpts from the interview:The academy presidency is an unpaid job and involves a lot of work. Why did you sign up for this misery?Somebody\u2019s got to do it! I have been on the board for 14 years and served for the last three years as a vice president, chairing the preservation and history committee. Over time, I have felt more and more committed to the programs and initiatives of the academy. Where do you stand on Netflix? If a movie is mostly seen on a streaming service and not in theaters, is it still a movie? This is a question, of course, about whether Netflix movies should be nominated for Oscars.There\u2019s no question that they\u2019re movies. How the academy is going to define those films in terms of qualifying for Academy Awards is something that needs to be addressed. I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but we need to be looking at this topic in a realistic way. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to get lost in the dust. What about construction delays? Your election was read in Hollywood as a win for the below-the-line part of the movie industry \u2014 craftspeople who are not actors, directors, producers or writers. Do you see it that way?That\u2019s a false narrative. Fake news, you might say. I don\u2019t think it represents the dynamics on the board at all. For people who may not know you, what is your origin story? College? Children? How did you get into the business?We don\u2019t have children. My wife, Carol, has always been a cat person. She\u2019s a lover of all animals, actually. She\u2019s been hanging on to me for 45 years!Advertisement"}

That said, this is no typical action movie: He uses wide shots and long takes for his action sequences, forgoing the incoherent compositions and rapid-fire edits of too many bone-crunching blockbusters, to better showcase the skills and athleticism of the star Gina Carano. And the script, by Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cThe Limey\u201d collaborator Lem Dobbs, is a crisp, lean piece of work, in which a black-ops soldier (Carano) takes the fall for a mission that goes sideways, only to meticulously track down and take out the men who set her up. Brisk, witty and just plain fun, it\u2019s the female James Bond movie you\u2019ve always wanted.Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t exactly the first person you\u2019d think of to helm a globe-trotting action movie featuring a mixed martial arts champ, but he\u2019s never really been one for easy categorization.

Yet they all tell deeply personal, difficult stories from new perspectives that challenge both their audiences and mainstream narratives, which is where much of their power lies.Many of the directors made their films hyper-specific and intimate, so their broadly familiar narratives feel fresh. \u201cFor Ahkeem\u201d seems at times like a young woman\u2019s confessional video diary. In \u201cStrong Island,\u201d Yance Ford focuses tightly on the lead-up to and aftermath of his brother\u2019s death, which devastated and splintered their family. Sabaah Folayan, who directed \u201cWhose Streets?\u201d with Damon Davis, said she sought to avoid numbing audiences with grim statistics to instead plumb the daily lives of a few activists.\u201cIt sometimes seems like all of our political actions are exhausted or have been compromised, and there\u2019s a real pressing sense of the magnitude of the issues, with no clear path forward,\u201d said Ms. Folayan, whose film is in theaters. \u201cI think the way out of that is for us to look around, and in our backyard, and tackle problems in front of us, rather than being consumed in this massive huge story.\u201d\u201cThere is a greater awareness of the problem, and I think more black people are being believed about their treatment by the police,\u201d said Mr. Ford, whose film, a Sundance favorite, will debut on Netflix and have a limited theatrical release in September. \u201cOnly in America does it take movies to authenticate reality, and not the other way around.\u201d\u201cThis is something as a country we\u2019re grappling with,\u201d Mr. Nicks said. \u201cThe totality of these expressions is important to us right now, those of us who feel this divisiveness has to be addressed in some kind of way. We can\u2019t continue on toward some apocalyptic ending. It\u2019s not healthy for democracy.\u201d\u201cThe Force,\u201d due in September, is among the films that challenge audiences by trying to jolt them into examining their own beliefs. Mr. Nicks humanizes police officers, and presses viewers to see them as more than two-dimensional aggressors. \u201cA lot of people in the public don\u2019t have the capacity for holding that truth that we as filmmakers saw, which is that very clearly, a lot of positive movements have been made,\u201d he said, \u201cThe profound reality is that cops, in their minds, believe they are trying to save black lives.\u201dMr. Ford\u2019s film will also make some viewers squirm. He very deliberately made \u201cStrong Island\u201d blistering, because he wanted audiences to experience a fraction of the pain his family has lived with since his brother, who aspired to be a corrections officer, was gunned down, and a grand jury declined to indict the man who shot him and argued self-defense. Mr. Ford wants audiences to question shooters\u2019 motives, too, especially in cases that are racially charged or involve the police.\u201cWhen people are killed, you will discover anything and everything they did wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is the scrutiny of people who claim to shoot because of fear?

{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P. Morgan) and $275 (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).As for other large multinationals and the broader market indexes, Mr. Arone sees no immediate threat to further gains. None of the warning signs he looks for \u2014 more-frequent market corrections, higher interest rates and widening credit spreads \u2014 have yet materialized. \u201cNone is flashing red,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even yellow.\u201d While conceding the bull market \u201cis getting long in the tooth,\u201d he said, \u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.Then, one of Uber\u2019s largest shareholders sent an open letter to all of Uber\u2019s employees. The shareholder is Benchmark, which last week sued Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former C.E.O., to get him off the board. The letter included an intimation that there was more damning information that could leak if Kalanick didn\u2019t back down from a fight.In sum, it\u2019s like watching a slow-motion car wreck, where no one seems to have escaped unscathed.Some went even beyond that. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.There was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.I understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.To me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.What do you think?Let me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201dIsn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?Maybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon.

{"Headline": "How a Conservative TV Giant Is Ridding Itself of Regulation", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trip was, in the parlance of the business world, a deal closer.Mr. Smith did not have to wait long.It was only the beginning. Since becoming chairman in January, Mr. Pai has undertaken a deregulatory blitz, enacting or proposing a wish list of fundamental policy changes advocated by Mr. Smith and his company. Hundreds of pages of emails and other documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveal a rush of regulatory actions has been carefully aligned with Sinclair\u2019s business objectives.Mr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory drive has also helped win him a following as a champion of pro-business, conservative causes \u2014 even leading some Republicans to approach him since he was first named to the F.C.C. in 2012 about running for elected office.An examination of the F.C.C. records shows that the Smith-Pai alliance does not follow the familiar script of a lobbyist with deep pockets influencing policy. Instead, it is a case of a powerful regulator and an industry giant sharing a political ideology, and suddenly, with the election of Mr. Trump, having free rein to pursue it \u2014 with both Mr. Smith, 66, and Mr. Pai, 44, reaping rewards.Neither Mr. Pai nor Mr. Smith would comment for this article.Associates say both men believe that local television stations, which fall under the commission\u2019s rules because they broadcast over federally owned airwaves, are at a disadvantage when competing against cable companies and online streaming services like Comcast and Netflix.Tina Pelkey, spokeswoman for Mr. Pai, said the new chairman had not taken steps to help Sinclair specifically; his concerns relate to the broadcast industry generally.\u201cIt has nothing to do with any one company,\u201d Ms. Pelkey said.Other broadcast companies, as well as the National Association of Broadcasters, have pushed for some of the same changes that have benefited Sinclair.Loosened regulatory requirements, Sinclair executives said, will help even the playing field and benefit millions of Americans who rely on broadcast stations for news and entertainment by allowing the companies to invest in new equipment and technology.\u201cI worry that our democracy is at stake because democracy depends on a diversity of voices and competition of news outlets,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.If Sinclair\u2019s past is any guide, the changes for viewers could be profound.The company has a history of cutting staffs and shaving costs by requiring stations to share news coverage, in that way reducing unique local content. And it has required stations to air conservative-leaning segments, including law-and-order features from its \u201cTerrorism Alert Desk,\u201d as well as punditry from Republicans like Boris Epshteyn, a former surrogate to Mr. Trump, who was still seen visiting the White House after joining Sinclair.In the political battleground state of Wisconsin, a merger would give Sinclair six stations in the biggest markets \u2014 Milwaukee, Green Bay and Madison \u2014 causing some journalists to fear a statewide, coordinated corporate news strategy that would tilt right.Mr. Friedland previously worked as a news manager at WITI, the current Fox affiliate in Milwaukee. It is owned by Tribune and would become part of the Sinclair empire if the merger is approved, as expected.Sinclair rejects suggestions that its stations push right-leaning views, and says the company\u2019s mission is to be objective in its news coverage.With more stations, Sinclair could command more lucrative advertising, and later, higher fees from cable and satellite companies that retransmitted its broadcasts.Sinclair helped pioneer a range of creative growth techniques that the company insisted were both legal and good for television viewers.Most notable was its use of so-called joint sales agreements, which allowed it to work around ownership rules that prevented any one company from owning multiple top-rated channels in a single market.Consumer advocates long complained about the maneuver, and by President Obama\u2019s second term, regulators at the F.C.C., then led by Democrats, were taking a hard look at it.That is when, records show, Mr. Pai first met with Sinclair\u2019s top lawyers.Mr. Pai was a fresh Republican face on the commission. He had an impressive background: degrees from Harvard and the University of Chicago Law School, and stints at the Department of Justice, at the general counsel\u2019s office of the F.C.C. and at the Senate Judiciary Committee, as an aide to Sam Brownback, then a Republican senator from Kansas and now the state\u2019s governor.Perhaps most appealing to Sinclair and other TV station owners, Mr. Pai exhibited blanket empathy for the broadcasting industry, both television and radio.An enthusiastic purveyor of free-market philosophy, Mr. Pai quickly became a dependable opponent to regulations created by the F.C.C.\u2019s Democratic majority. He promised to take a \u201cweed whacker\u201d to regulations if he ever became chairman.\u201cThe commission,\u201d he told the broadcast executives, \u201ccan do a better job of focusing on what\u2019s important to broadcasters.\u201d\u201cTelevision stations have utilized J.S.A.s for at least 10 years,\u201d Mr. Faber told Mr. Pai according to records of the meeting filed with the F.C.C., referring to the joint sales agreements that Sinclair utilized in Pittsburgh and elsewhere.Mr. Faber added that \u201cto his knowledge, not a single example of harm to program diversity or competition for viewers resulting from J.S.A.s has been documented.\u201dThe Sinclair executives made the same pitch to the other commissioners, but it was Mr. Pai, the records show, who aggressively picked up the company\u2019s cause in opposing the commission\u2019s crackdown on the disputed agreements.Ms. Hanson said the meetings were entirely appropriate, and they were disclosed as required under F.C.C. rules. \u201cSinclair has followed the rule-making process like everyone else,\u201d Ms. Hanson said in an interview.Mr. Pai also made appearances on conservative media, extending Sinclair\u2019s arguments beyond telecommunications circles to the broader Republican audience. The advocacy did not go unnoticed. Mr. Pai has been eyed for years by Republican leaders in Kansas and asked at least three times to consider a run for public office, according to two former government colleagues familiar with Kansas Republican politics.Harold Feld, a senior vice president at the left-leaning consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said Mr. Pai had translated his visibility \u201cinto enormous influence and a much brighter future\u201d in Republican circles.\u201cHe discovered in the same way Trump discovered that sounding off on things \u2014 taking extreme positions, using social media, being the \u2018rock star\u2019 \u2014 has benefits,\u201d he said.Sinclair also faced two investigations into rule violations.A second investigation, which is continuing, deals with commercials aired on Sinclair stations by the Huntsman Cancer Institute, based in Salt Lake City. The commercials were broadcast as news stories on some stations without viewers\u2019 being alerted to the fact that they were paid content.Emails reviewed by The Times show that Ms. Hanson, the Sinclair lobbyist, reached out to her former F.C.C. colleagues about the Huntsman investigation.\u201cBeing on the outside of the F.C.C. is so \u2026 weird,\u201d she wrote.At that point, tensions between the F.C.C. and Sinclair were at a high point.Mr. Smith, the Sinclair chairman, had shown his own frustration around the same time with the F.C.C.\u2019s investigation of the Huntsman segments. He lashed out during a session in Baltimore with more than 100 news directors and executives.In an expletive-filled rant, Mr. Smith suggested that Sinclair stations that ran the segments would have to pay for their mistake. He also ordered news directors to write him emails admitting they had erred and outlining what they would do to prevent it from happening again.Mr. Pai was widely seen as the top contender to take over as F.C.C. chairman under a Republican administration, and Ms. Hanson had already invited him to speak at a gathering on Nov. 16 of general managers from Sinclair stations at the Four Seasons Hotel in Baltimore.Now that Mr. Trump had been elected, she was adding another request: \u201cWould he have time to meet with our C.E.O., David Smith, for a few minutes after his session?\u201dThe answer was yes, and Mr. Pai and Mr. Smith, then Sinclair\u2019s chief executive and chairman, met in private at the end of the event.It is unclear whether the two men had previously met. If not, Mr. Pai would soon learn that Mr. Smith was hardly a conventional television mogul.Unpolished, gruff and intensely private, he does not belong to the slick world of media elites, where his contemporaries, like Leslie Moonves at CBS and Rupert Murdoch at 21st Century Fox, are staples of the society pages.Mr. Smith and Mr. Pai met for a second time in January, just before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Mr. Smith was joined by Armstrong Williams, a business partner and Sinclair conservative talk show host, and Mr. Ripley, Sinclair\u2019s newly named chief executive, who later expressed confidence that the F.C.C. under Mr. Pai would enact sweeping regulatory changes.\u201cWe do expect this new F.C.C. to tackle the ownership rules,\u201d Mr. Ripley said on an earnings call with investors in February. \u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about this new F.C.C. and the leadership of Ajit Pai.\u201dMr. Smith had already made clear his expectations. \u201cIf Donald Trump is as deregulatory as he suggests he is,\u201d Mr. Smith said at a media industry conference just after the election, according to TheStreet.com, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be the first industry in line to say, \u2018We are the most over-regulated industry that exists in the United States.\u2019\u201dNeither Sinclair nor the White House would say if Mr. Smith had recommended Mr. Pai for the chairmanship. Either way, Mr. Pai did not disappoint.Mr. Pai also froze a program for broadband subsidies for low-income families and began a rollback of net neutrality rules that ensured internet traffic was equally available to all consumers, acting on regulatory issues that will reshape other multibillion-dollar businesses under his watch.But days after the action on the ownership cap, Mr. Pai gave a keynote speech to the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, where he promised to rethink all media ownership restrictions.Sinclair\u2019s increasingly tight relationship with the F.C.C., and the likelihood that the commission will allow it to grow and spread its conservative agenda further, has made critics, including some longtime television journalists, uneasy.\u201cWill Sinclair be a responsible broadcaster of the news,\u201d she asked, \u201cor a creator of the largest programmer of propaganda?\u201dAn article on Monday about the Sinclair Broadcast Group misidentified the position that Jill Geisler once held at WITI, a television station owned by Tribune Media, a company Sinclair is trying to acquire. Ms. Geisler was a vice president, not a general manager.An article on Monday about Sinclair Broadcast Group referred imprecisely to the results of an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission involving the company, the nation\u2019s largest owner of television stations. Sinclair agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle the case, without admitting wrongdoing; it was not fined that amount by the F.C.C.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington and Milwaukee, Eric Lipton from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York.

That familiar sitcom cheer \u2014 the crowd whooping when a favorite star walks onstage \u2014 has become rare in the age of comedies made without a studio audience.Kathy Bates gets a hearty \u201cWoo!\u201d when she first appears in Netflix\u2019s \u201cDisjointed,\u201d an old-school comedy (zinger-based, shot in front of a live audience) about a new-school subject, a legal marijuana dispensary in California.Ms. Bates throws all she has into the role of Ruth, an oversharing earth mother and pot evangelist. But there\u2019s not much else to woo about in this painful mishmash.\u201cDisjointed,\u201d whose first 10 episodes appear Friday, is at least an interesting example of the odd place Netflix occupies in the fragmented TV universe. Like HBO, Netflix is subscription-only and censor-free. But like an old-fashioned broadcast network, its audience is too broad for a specific brand identity like a cable network has.Instead, its brand is simply, \u201cThings someone might want to stream on Netflix.\u201d You get arty experiments (\u201cThe O.A.\u201d), bubble gum nostalgia (\u201cFuller House\u201d), dystopian sci-fi (\u201cOkja\u201d) and adult crime-noir (\u201cOzark\u201d) all for the same fee, if perhaps not for the same viewers.Given that, you can sort of see how \u201cDisjointed,\u201d from Chuck Lorre (\u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d) and David Javerbaum, sort of makes sense there. Like Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Ranch\u201d and \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d it\u2019s structurally an old-fashioned broadcast sitcom. But even in a more choom-friendly America, it\u2019d be a tough sell at CBS.The result is a mess of a comedy that doesn\u2019t feel as if it belongs anywhere.Ruth runs her shop, Ruth\u2019s Alternative Caring, with her strait-laced M.B.A. son, Travis (Aaron Moten). (She\u2019s white, he\u2019s black, and there are some obvious jokes about it.) Their staff of eccentric \u201cbud-tenders\u201d includes Pete (Dougie Baldwin), who talks to his cannabis plants; Olivia (Elizabeth Alderfer), a potential love interest for Travis; and Jenny (Elizabeth Ho), who calls herself the staff\u2019s \u201ctokin\u2019 Asian.\u201dBut for the intoxicant, this kind of wacky family-work hybrid could have aired 25 years ago. (The sitcom veteran James Burrows directs the premiere.) But it\u2019s also raunchy without much sophistication and distractingly self-conscious. Where HBO\u2019s \u201cHigh Maintenance,\u201d about the peregrinations of a pot dealer, plays its material cool, \u201cDisjointed\u201d makes marijuana the joke in a way that would have felt more at home in the Cheech and Chong \u201970s.The best subplot involves the security guard, Carter (Tone Bell), an Iraq veteran grappling with post-traumatic stress disorder. (The show represents his mental state with free-associative animated breaks.) But where Mr. Lorre\u2019s \u201cMom\u201d has integrated more serious subjects like addiction, this story line feels out of place amid the zaniness.Befitting its name, \u201cDisjointed\u201d plays less like a series and more like a collection of clunky sketches. One is a video flashback to 1972, when young Ruth urges protesters to cheer \u201cWoo!\u201d in support of legalization. Back in the present, she shakes her head at how worked up she and the crowd got over what was, in retrospect, lousy pot.Listening to the inexplicable audience hoots in \u201cDisjointed,\u201d I felt much the same way. What a waste of woo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Netflix Can Thrive After a Disney Divorce", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsNetflix losing Disney sounds like an HBO sequel.Disney will be pulling \u201cCars\u201d and more from the $75 billion streaming service. Time Warner\u2019s pay-TV network HBO also once grew so popular that Hollywood studios got scared and started rival options. HBO kept thriving, and so will Netflix.Walt Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, unveiled on Tuesday a new strategic plan aimed at the rapidly changing landscape of movie and TV consumption. The company will create its own direct-to-consumer streaming-video services, and that means ditching Netflix starting with the 2019 theatrical releases of Pixar movies and others.What remains unclear is whether Marvel superhero and Lucasfilm \u201cStar Wars\u201d fare also will be taken away. It is a trade-off for Disney. The company gets paid about $300 million a year from Netflix for about 10 movies, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox and AMC Networks have withheld some programming, too.HBO encountered a similar backlash more than three decades ago. By 1983, it had grown to about 12 million subscribers on the back of live sporting events and movies. Fearing HBO\u2019s encroaching power, studios including Paramount and Viacom started Showtime and The Movie Channel as alternatives.They hardly impeded HBO\u2019s growth or its symbiotic relationship with Hollywood. Over the next five years, the network attracted seven million more customers, while also striking a $500 million deal with Paramount. HBO now has nearly 85 million subscribers around the world and its own stand-alone digital service; last month, it received over 100 Emmy nominations for programs like \u201cWestworld.\u201dThe Netflix playbook has been similar. It is spending some $6 billion this year to buy and create original shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d It also just announced the first acquisition in its 20-year history, of comic book publisher Millarworld, a move that evokes Disney\u2019s larger purchase of Marvel in 2009.With some 100 million customers globally, Netflix should be able to comfortably survive without Disney. After all, the industry has seen this movie before.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s So Hard About Casting Indian Actors in Indian Roles?", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s a brief exchange in the new drama \u201cWind River\u201d that is brusquely telling. On a reservation in Wyoming, a white man, Cory (Jeremy Renner), tries to console an Arapaho tribal member, Chip (Martin Sensmeier), who has just learned that his sister has been murdered.When Cory philosophizes, \u201cThis land is all we got left,\u201d Chip excoriates his use of \u201cwe\u201d and adds, \u201cOnly thing Native about you is your ex-wife and a daughter you couldn\u2019t protect.\u201dIt\u2019s at this moment, when Cory is reminded of his place, that the film refuses to dance with wolves. Marriage, affinity or even lifelong residency may change the white man, but he will always be a foreigner in Indian Country.Taylor Sheridan, the writer-director, kept that unbridgeable distance in mind when he told his casting team: Hire Native American actors for Native American roles.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to sit here and tell a story about very real issues,\u201d namely sexual violence against women in Indian Country, \u201cand cast people to portray characters in that world suffering those burdens and not have some connection,\u201d Mr. Sheridan, who is not Native American, told me. He hired, among others, Mr. Sensmeier (of Tlingit and Koyukon-Athabascan heritage), Graham Greene (Oneida) and Julia Jones (Choctaw and Chickasaw).Mr. Sheridan admitted, \u201cThere was someone far and away that was the best, but I didn\u2019t hire them because they were not Native American.\u201d He even told his casting directors that when it came to auditioning actors, \u201cDon\u2019t even read them unless you can vet the authentic nature of their ancestry.\u201d\u201cIf you are Native, you rarely get cast in crossover parts,\u201d he said, referring to ethnically nonspecific roles. \u201cMy approach to characters is that I play them as human beings.\u201dKelsey Asbille, who plays Natalie, the young Indian woman who is raped and murdered in \u201cWind River,\u201d is of Taiwanese, British and Eastern Band Cherokee descent. Although she did not grow up in an indigenous community, she said she had an \u201cintense connection\u201d to Natalie and what she stood for, adding, \u201cThis role, more than any other, it\u2019s in my blood.\u201dAs Bird Runningwater, director of the Sundance Institute\u2019s Native American and Indigenous Film Program, explained: \u201cMost Americans consume media and then you have our representation within that. They consume what has been created by the system.\u201dFor \u201cWind River,\u201d that system involved an intertribal collaboration. Leaders from the Wind River nations \u2014 the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho \u2014 read the script and visited the set. The Tunica-Biloxi tribe of Louisiana had no actors in the film but provided 90 percent of the film\u2019s budget in a joint venture with Acacia Entertainment. Marshall Ray Sampson, the tribe\u2019s vice chairman, explained, \u201cWe are always looking for ways to diversify our portfolio.\u201dThough the quest for authenticity was a community effort, Mr. Sheridan said, \u201cAs a filmmaker you have to stand in front of what you did and make choices that you could do with a clear conscience.\u201dThose choices included making white characters, played by Mr. Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, the leads in a film about Native Americans. \u201cEveryone puts words into their mouths and says, \u2018This is your experience,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cI\u2019m a white guy \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of trust from a community that\u2019s generally been betrayed.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Chris Eyre\u2019s role in the making of the 1998 film \u201cSmoke Signals.\u201d Mr. Eyre directed the film, which was adapted by Sherman Alexie from his 1993 short story collection \u201cThe Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\u201d; Mr. Eyre did not write the screenplay.An earlier version of this article misidentified \u201cWind River\u201d as Taylor Sheridan\u2019s directorial debut.

In \u201cAmerican Buffalo,\u201d opening on Aug. 25, he is one of the stars. Yet the temptation to back out persisted.What nagged at him was the guilty prospect of letting down his co-star, Treat Williams, who was already a movie star when Mr. Guirgis was in college. A veteran Mamet actor, Mr. Williams now lives year-round not far from the playhouse, on 16 rolling acres with a little orchard and a pond. His excitement about doing the play \u2014 a verbally explosive dissection of male power dynamics, set in a Chicago junk shop \u2014 had been palpable in the months leading up to production.\u201cHe would always text me or leave voice mails like \u2018I can\u2019t wait to do this,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Guirgis, who is 52 to Mr. Williams\u2019s 65. \u201cAnd sometimes I wouldn\u2019t call him back because I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201dIf casting Mr. Guirgis was a risk, Mr. Rubin \u2014 who first directed him in the late 1990s and \u201cnever got over thinking of him as an actor\u201d \u2014 says he didn\u2019t believe Mr. Guirgis would cancel on him.\u201cWhen he was writing, he was regretting not acting,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cHe procrastinated as a writer, he had trouble as a writer, but he never had trouble as an actor.\u201dMr. Guirgis arrived in Dorset only an hour before the \u201cAmerican Buffalo\u201d meet-and-greet, a first-day ritual where the theater staff and visiting artists introduce themselves to one another. He was a day later than originally expected; he had put off traveling as long as possible. That morning in New York, when he caught a train at Penn Station, he took a photograph of himself with his ticket and texted it to the people he\u2019s closest to, to show that he really was going.\u201cAnd they needed to see that \u2014 the proof,\u201d he said.In the lobby of the playhouse, he sat down with Mr. Williams \u2014 who plays a shady character nicknamed Teach, the Robert Duvall role in the 1977 Broadway premiere \u2014 and the third member of the cast, Oliver Palmer, a 23-year-old fresh out of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. When it was Mr. Guirgis\u2019s turn to introduce himself to the room, he offered to hold a writing workshop if anyone was interested. \u201cBut after I learn the lines,\u201d he added, and got a big laugh.What was scaring both Mr. Guirgis and Mr. Williams, they said later, was having just 12 days of rehearsals to get the play down before technical rehearsals begin. They have only a single preview before opening, and the run ends Sept. 2. Ambitions for the production beyond Dorset, possibly a tour to regional theaters, might allow them to delve further.In recent years Mr. Guirgis has had small roles in films, including \u201cBirdman\u201d and Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s \u201cMargaret.\u201d He would have been in Martin McDonagh\u2019s coming \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d a job he was thrilled to have, but he never got on the plane to go to the shoot. For that, his acting manager fired him.\u201cAnd I still haven\u2019t reached out to Martin,\u201d Mr. Guirgis said, attributing his no-show to \u201cdepression, anxiety, darkness. Self-destruction.\u201dHe is trying to change his habits. Sixteen days before \u201cAmerican Buffalo\u201d rehearsals started, worried about being able to breathe, he quit cigarettes cold turkey. He is mostly off sugar. And he did get on that train.On his first night in Vermont, he was in bed by 11, hours earlier than usual. The next morning, well rested, he biked to the playhouse to work on his lines before rehearsal. In the room, Mr. Rubin had the actors sit around a table reading from their scripts to get Mr. Mamet\u2019s rhythms. But even then, just trying things out, Mr. Guirgis gave a beautifully modulated performance: tender-tough, supple, funny in surprising places.In the back flap of the binder that holds his script, he has tucked a photo of Hoffman with his children, a reminder of the seriousness of the work and the importance of attending to the rest of life.\u201cI would love to call him,\u201d Mr. Guirgis said, \u201cand be like, \u2018Bro, what do I do?\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Messy, Confusing Future of TV? It\u2019s Here", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf you\u2019re like me and the millions of other Americans who have canceled a cable television subscription over the past few years, you\u2019re probably familiar with the phenomenon I\u2019ve started calling \u201cthe hunt.\u201dIt goes like this: First, you decide to watch one of your favorite shows \u2014 HGTV\u2019s \u201cFixer Upper,\u201d in my case. You plop down on your couch, turn on your TV and boot up your streaming device. Then you shuffle from app to app, trying to remember which of your half-dozen streaming services has the program. Was it Netflix? Hmm, no. HBO Go? Nope. Hulu Plus? It has the first three seasons, which you\u2019ve already seen, but not the fourth.You finally find the fourth season on Amazon, but it\u2019s not included free with Prime Video. It costs $2.99 per episode. The hunt ends with a whimper: You sigh, suck it up (those kitchens aren\u2019t going to renovate themselves), and fork over $19.99 for the entire season.What happened to the glorious, consumer-friendly future of TV? We were told that the internet would usher in a golden era of streaming video, and that incredible shows and movies would be a click away through low-cost, easy-to-use services. The $100-a-month Time Warner cable packages that required navigating a byzantine menu of third-rate channels would be a distant nightmare.Instead, we\u2019ve rushed headlong into a hyper-fragmented mess, with a jumble of on-demand services that, added up, cost more and often offer less than the old cable bundle. There are lots of great shows and movies being made, but finding them has become harder than ever.I felt another twinge of cable nostalgia last week, when both Disney and Facebook \u2014 very different companies, but united in their desire for your attention \u2014 announced big steps in their next-generation video strategies.A day later, Facebook announced Watch, a tab inside the main Facebook app that will soon host a slate of professionally produced video series. The company says people will be able to enjoy premium fare like \u201cReturning the Favor,\u201d starring the \u201cDirty Jobs\u201d host Mike Rowe; a reality show about tiny houses; and \u201cBae or Bail,\u201d which Facebook describes thusly: \u201cUnsuspecting couples put their relationship and wits to the test as they\u2019re thrown into terrifying scenarios.\u201dDisney, which has built an enormously profitable business that includes movie ticket sales and cable revenue from ESPN, is betting that a significant number of customers will pay $10 or $20 a month to watch \u201cFrozen\u201d and keep up with their NBA teams, above and beyond what they\u2019re already shelling out for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime subscriptions.On the other hand, Facebook \u2014 which makes its money from advertising \u2014 is giving its shows away free. Their theory is that the more time Facebook users spend watching video, the more ads they\u2019ll see. Facebook doesn\u2019t have a huge library of popular content like Disney, but it does have a treasure trove of data about the personal tastes and preferences of its more than two billion registered users, and presumably plans to use that data to target ads at exactly the people companies want to reach.More than $70 billion per year is spent on traditional television advertisements, and as that pile of money shifts to digital video, Facebook presumably wants to make sure a hefty chunk ends up in its own pockets. It also very likely wants to replace YouTube as the home for amateur creators who might not produce professional-quality shows, but still have large and loyal audiences.On the surface, these seem like very different strategies \u2014 selling premium video to an existing audience of fans, versus giving away premium video in an effort to sell hyper-targeted ads and attract a network of amateurs. But they\u2019re both part of the same seismic change. As the decline of traditional TV creates a gold rush for ad dollars and consumer attention, every tech and media company seems to be heading to the mine, pickax in hand.Consumers, meanwhile, are forced to contend with (and often pay for) an ever-expanding group of services. There are already Netflix and Hulu, single-company services like CBS All Access, and \u201cskinny bundles\u201d such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV, not to mention the endless amateur video available from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\u201cOne of the barriers to entry for the consumer right now is simply confusion,\u201d said Paul Verna, the principal video analyst at eMarketer, a media research firm. \u201cThe more of these services that are out there, the harder it\u2019s going to get for people to make rational, informed decisions about what to subscribe to.\u201dNumbers like these have created an industrywide panic and set off dozens of efforts to replace the revenue seeping out of the old cable model. Disney\u2019s streaming service won\u2019t be the last of its kind; pretty soon, you\u2019ll be forced to choose from an overwhelming menu of streaming apps and services, each of which will have its own price tag, interface and ever-changing libraries of shows and movies.An enterprising entrepreneur might someday be tempted to package some of these new services and sell them for a single price, essentially remaking the old cable bundle for the internet. But industry experts say that such cooperation between the industry\u2019s giants is unlikely, given the enormous sums at stake.\u201cThere\u2019s no chance of that happening,\u201d said Dan Rayburn, who analyzes streaming media for Frost & Sullivan. \u201cCompanies will do what\u2019s best for their bottom line.\u201dThe post-TV world \u201cwill not be orderly or neat,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, a marketing technology company. \u201cNo one is sitting back and saying, \u2018What\u2019s the perfect way the consumer wants to come at this?\u2019 Everyone is arming up.\u201dIn other words, the hunt will only get harder.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s how you get belly fat.\u2019\u201dRight on cue, Mr. Colter replied, \u201cSplit one with a pal if you\u2019re going to have one.\u201dThat good-natured mockery is a welcome respite from a relentless work schedule. Mr. Jones, still damp with sweat from a fight scene he\u2019d just shot, described how in 2016 he finished shooting \u201cIron Fist\u201d and, within hours, was onstage at New York Comic Con to introduce \u201cThe Defenders.\u201d\u201cWe started filming at 5 p.m. and didn\u2019t finish until 10 a.m. the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cOn two hours\u2019 sleep, I\u2019m watching myself on a stage, trying to process what this last six months has all been about.\u201dMr. Jones added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do movie-quality storytelling on a television time-frame and budget. Everyone\u2019s slammed around the clock, all the time.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. Edlund wondered if the time was right to bring back \u201cThe Tick.\u201d\u201cPeople can\u2019t turn around anywhere without seeing 12 superhero dramas,\u201d said Mr. Edlund, a slender, longhaired man who described himself as possessing \u201cthe proportions of a bike.\u201dThe enduring obsession with comic-book characters, he said, \u201cis a perfect prey for our comedy.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou want to be able to laugh at what is, essentially, a sky made gray with a surplus of capes and boots.\u201dEven so, Mr. Edlund said this version of \u201cThe Tick\u201d actually takes the underlying mythologies of other superhero shows quite seriously. It\u2019s a reflection of the stark seriousness he sees in other narratives, and an element that distinguishes the Amazon series from earlier incarnations of \u201cThe Tick.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re utterly hypocritical, putting forward our own very earnest hero myth, as if we\u2019re completely oblivious idiots,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the meta-level of nonsense that we can be accused of.\u201dThe new live-action series is as much about its title character (played by Peter Serafinowicz) as it is about his sidekick, Arthur, who was essentially comic relief in the earlier shows.Arthur (Griffin Newman) is now a young man who, as a child, saw his favorite superhero team and his father killed in a sinister scheme hatched by a criminal called the Terror (Jackie Earle Haley).Years later, Arthur is still disturbed by these events and preoccupied by a paranoid certainty that the Terror remains at large. Then the Tick comes into his life, urging him to accept his destiny as a righted of wrongs, which makes Arthur even more skeptical of his own sanity.Mr. Serafinowicz, a British comic actor (\u201cSpy,\u201d \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d), said that the show operates in a space \u201cwhere superheroes and supervillains exist, and everyone plays it for real.\u201dSpeaking from his trailer, where his Tick costume hung nearby like a peeled-off layer of skin, Mr. Serafinowicz described his characters as \u201cthis big, blue lunatic.\u201d\u201cWhen he appears,\u201d he said, \u201ceven the superheroes in this real world are looking at him like, who the hell is this?\u201dIf \u201cThe Tick\u201d can get away with this blend of solemnity inherent in Arthur\u2019s story and silliness provided by its title character, it will be, in part, because the comic-book tropes it plays on are now ubiquitous.Growing up a lonely comic-book fan, Mr. Newman said, \u201cIf someone else said they liked Spider-Man, that was a beacon \u2014 \u2018We have to talk about this.\u2019\u201dThe precise details of superhero origin stories, he said, \u201cused to be things that a random person stopped on the street wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Now, Mr. Newman said, \u201cEverybody knows Batman\u2019s parents get killed. Whatever.\u201dFor the stars of \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d a sense of duty comes with their roles \u2014 to portray their characters in ways consistent with decades of comic-book continuity and multiple seasons of their own shows.Mr. Cox recalled an early draft of a \u201cDefenders\u201d script where his character, Matt Murdock, was supposed to say that a day didn\u2019t go by where he didn\u2019t wish for his sight to return. But after remembering a scene in a Daredevil comic where the hero says he has no regrets about his blindness, Mr. Cox asked for the line to be changed.\u201cI question myself less now when I feel strongly about something,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff I care about.\u201dOn \u201cThe Tick,\u201d Mr. Edlund said there was honor, too, in taking inspiration from the monolithic media companies responsible for the most popular superhero characters, but telling his own stories on the fringes of the mainstream.His show, he explained, is \u201ca totally autonomous universe that can borrow from DC or Marvel all it wants, all day, and has the right to be stupid-funny.\u201cIt\u2019s true that DC and Marvel are the McDonald\u2019s and Burger King in our world. But there\u2019s also room for Jack in the Box.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Are Markets Due for a Reckoning?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a decade after the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, concerns are rising that euphoric markets may be headed for a hard fall.Technology companies have been an important driver behind the increase in financial markets in recent years, with seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies now coming from that sector.The so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and the Google parent Alphabet \u2014 have had some of the biggest gains in the past 12 months.And a stunning amount of money (more than $60 billion a year for the past three years) has flowed into the tech sector through venture capitalists and private equity funds.\u2022 Many of the gains have been concentrated around a small number of stocks, rather than resulting in a broader rise.\u2022 Tech companies may face increasing scrutiny from regulators.Google was fined a record $2.7 billion this summer by European Union antitrust officials for unfairly favoring some of its own services over rivals. The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Outcry Over Admissions at University of California", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.After the University of California, Irvine, withdrew admissions offers for nearly 500 students, the outrage spread far beyond the campus community.But the practice is not unusual among California\u2019s public universities.According to figures from the University of California, since 2015 more than 4,000 applicants to U.C. campuses, aside from Irvine, have had their offers of admission rescinded \u2014 the bulk of them over paperwork problems.An outcry led the campus to reinstate many of the students and adopt more forgiving admissions policies.Universities sometimes underestimate how many students will accept their offers of admission, putting them in a bind to create room. Critics say that too often campuses have resorted to looking for any excuse to revoke offers.\u201cThose deadlines \u2014 we tell students all the time, \u2018They are the smallest thing, but it\u2019ll make or break whether you get into the college,\u2019\u201d said Bernadine Diele, who advises high school students in Merced. \u201cAnd it has nothing to do with your competitiveness.\u201dLast year, U.C. Riverside rescinded more than 300 admission offers over missing paperwork; U.C. Merced revoked about 160; and U.C. Davis nearly 100.Jill Orcutt, U.C. Merced\u2019s associate vice chancellor for enrollment management, said incoming freshmen were repeatedly reminded about the transcripts deadline. Many of those who fail to meet it, she suggested, most likely had no real intention to attend the university.As of last week, roughly 280 of the students had been reinstated. Others were under review.Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat, has been a vocal critic of what he described as a \u201cgotcha game\u201d in U.C. admissions.He\u2019s pushing Janet Napolitano, the system president, to adopt policies across all 10 campuses that ensure young people are given every chance to meet their enrollment conditions.\u201cThese are people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Ting said. \u201cGoing to college is a transformative experience and to deny that over some paperwork seems to me mind-boggling.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Several thousand white crosses dot a hillside in Lafayette, a bedroom community near Berkeley.The first of them were planted in 2006 to represent American service members killed in the Iraq war.

He said his hope was for a memorial to the military\u2019s dead that also \u201cexpresses a desire for a peaceful world.\u201dVolunteers stopped adding crosses on the crowded hillside some years ago, but they still update a death toll painted in black on a prominent white sign.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Mr. Mercedes,\u2019 a Stephen King Story With a Difference", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThrough four episodes, \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is probably the most enjoyable, even though \u2014 or perhaps because \u2014 it\u2019s the least King-like of the productions.A bigger factor, though, is the TV show\u2019s creator, David E. Kelley, who developed the series and wrote the first two episodes. He\u2019s in good form, and \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d has the Kelley hallmarks \u2014 snappy dialogue, credible characters, a story that adds up, an overall feeling of polished craftsmanship. It may lack King\u2019s intensity, but it holds on to a measure of the author\u2019s dark humor.(Mr. Kelley has some high-class help: the novelists A.M. Homes and Dennis Lehane wrote the third and fourth episodes, respectively.)Being a King story, \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is a mystery predicated on an act of extreme carnage. In a fading Ohio industrial city in the post-crash year of 2009, a driver in a clown mask plows a Mercedes through a crowd of people waiting outside a job fair. The story then jumps ahead two years and burrows into the life of Bill Hodges (Brendan Gleeson), a recently retired detective unable to let go of the still unsolved massacre.In its early episodes, at least, \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is a show soaked in decline. The sagging economy makes an easy target of the desperate job seekers, camped out on a walkway. The killer, whose identity is revealed early on, works for a big-box electronics store that\u2019s being driven out of business. Saddest of all is Hodges, shuffling around his empty house, and Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Kelley combine to give an unusually honest portrayal of middle-age depression and decrepitude.The story slowly kicks into gear when the killer, calling himself Mr. Mercedes \u2014 he\u2019s actually a 20-something victim of a terrible childhood named Brady, played by Harry Treadaway (Dr. Frankenstein on \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d) \u2014 begins sending the detective taunting emails about his failure to solve the case. These have the dual effect of stoking Bill\u2019s post-traumatic stress over the case while reinvigorating him, and soon he\u2019s independently investigating, like a Philip Marlowe brought back from the dead.\u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d is full of people who are off, on a spectrum from mildly antisocial to psychopathic, and Mr. Kelley works hard to humanize them, making even the sadistic Brady sympathetic. He mostly reins in his propensity for quirkiness for its own sake, though a character added for the series, a sexually aggressive neighbor of Bill\u2019s played by Holland Taylor, is a little too good to be true.(Ms. Taylor is fun to watch, though, and the cast includes a number of distinctive actresses, including Kelly Lynch as Brady\u2019s mother, Breeda Wool as his co-worker and Mary-Louise Parker as the woman who hires Bill to pursue the case.)The problem with \u201cMr. Mercedes,\u201d at least early on, is a version of Netflix bloat: it dawdles, and through the first four episodes it feels like the story is still getting started. One of the most important characters from the novel, a woman who joins in Bill\u2019s investigation, has yet to appear. So far Mr. Kelley has put together a decent character study, but whether he\u2019ll pull off a hard-boiled thriller remains a mystery.Advertisement"}

He\u2019d enter with a thud. He would squeeze an arm through one of the straps of his massive, 30-pound backpack and slide the bag down his other arm before it went airborne, meeting the floor with a crash.Packed with a combination of a laptop, notebooks, textbooks, a change of clothes and more, I understood why he lugged it around all day: We lived far from campus and he needed all of those things throughout the day. I had the same problem, though maybe not 30-pounds\u2019 worth of weight. But you don\u2019t have to suffer the way we did. Some smart technology choices can lighten your load and keep you prepped for a full day of classes.But by the end of my college years, I made an investment that saved me money, time and back pain: an iPad.I read everything on my iPad. Renting my textbooks as e-books was cheaper than renting hard copies or buying them used. Plus, I didn\u2019t have to deal with the inconvenience of waiting for books to come in or struggling to sell them after the semester ended. In five minutes you can have a complete textbook and when the class ends, it leaves your possession automatically.You may have heard that an iPad can replace a laptop. After all, Apple even suggests that in its own ads. That might be the case for some people, but probably not a college student.Recommending laptops can be tricky, because some colleges and universities have specific recommendations for new and returning students. Some majors, like engineering and graphic design, may even have their own requirements. A video production student may need certain graphics capabilities in a computer that someone studying history may not. Check with your campus IT department before you decide on a computer. It may even offer student discounts you can take advantage of.At the same time, consider how much you\u2019ll use that laptop, how portable it is and, as the Wirecutter mentions, its battery life. Some of the moments that caused me the most stress in college came at unexpected times. I, of course, would always be completely, unquestionably focused on my professors\u2019 lectures until my computer urged me to find an outlet before the battery died. My heart rate would speed up. I\u2019d start to sweat. I\u2019d frantically look under my seat for an outlet, the most precious resource in lecture halls. Usually, I found nothing.Resigned, I saved my notes, closed my computer and began to scribble illegibly in an old-school spiral notebook. Battery life and portability may be the most important things for any college student\u2019s laptop, especially at schools that have older buildings with fewer outlets.There are few things more fundamental to the college experience than music.Dream bigger. Get a Bluetooth speaker.They\u2019re easy to use and most of them pack a decent, room-filling sound into a portable, sleek body.Let\u2019s go full circle, back to my friend with the heavy backpack.His backpack was old and worn down, just a carryall to toss things in. Lucky for the rest of us, they\u2019ve evolved over the years. The best backpacks these days must be equipped with special compartments to better house and organize your gadgets and other innovations to be up to the task of carrying your gear. Consider something with enough compartments to hold your books and your tech separately, with quick-access pockets to things you may need on the go, like your keys, wallet, phone or even a bottle of water.Advertisement"}

Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for \u2014 the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix\u2019s singular sense of innovation. The future of Shondaland at Netflix has limitless possibilities.\u201dThe deal was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Ms. Rhimes has been with ABC for more than a decade and has long been one of that network\u2019s biggest names. She\u2019s been a reliable generator of hits, including building an entire Thursday-night lineup that ABC\u2019s marketing department has dubbed #TGIT.Ms. Rhimes\u2019s development slate at ABC will not suddenly vaporize. In addition to keeping its Thursday lineup for the coming season, ABC still has a midseason show that is expected from Ms. Rhimes, \u201cFor the People,\u201d and a \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff that is in preproduction, among some other projects in development.Nevertheless, losing her is enormous for ABC and its corporate parent, Disney. The network finished in last place among the advertiser-coveted demographic for a second straight season, and though it is doing fine with comedies, it badly needs a hit drama. This fall, ABC is pinning its hopes on revivals, including \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cRoseanne,\u201d to help improve its standing in the ratings.In a statement, ABC\u2019s entertainment president, Channing Dungey, said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked-about shows on television. With the launch of a new season upon us, fans can rest assured that TGIT remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever.\u201dFor Netflix, this is more of the same. It has been on a spending spree, pouring billions into acquiring big-name talent.The latest moves come just as digital rivals like Apple and Facebook have taken steps that suggest they are prepared to become serious players in the scripted and unscripted television game.An earlier version of this article misidentified the creator of \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder.\u201d It is Peter Nowalk, not Shonda Rhimes.

{"Headline": "MoviePass Drops Its Price, Pleasing Customers but Angering AMC", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMembership to the theatergoing subscription service MoviePass surged after it dropped its prices this month, with more than 150,000 new users signing up in just two days. Its members can now go to the movies 365 times a year for $9.95 a month, and so far they have been going in droves, according to data released by one of the company\u2019s investors.But not everyone is happy: AMC Theaters, the country\u2019s largest cinema chain, has said that it is looking for ways to block subscribers from using the MoviePass app to buy tickets to its theaters.\u201cWe believe that you want to see more movies in theaters,\u201d the company told subscribers in a blog post.But that, according to AMC, is exactly the problem. MoviePass is essentially a company that resells movie access: It pays the full ticket price for a film and then makes those tickets available to subscribers, who pay a lot less than they would otherwise.AMC said the average nationwide price for a ticket at one of its theaters was $9.33 in the most recent fiscal quarter. A MoviePass customer who saw 31 movies in a month would be paying 32 cents for each film.Ticket-by-ticket, it works out to be a good deal for consumers. But AMC said a nationwide $9.95 price point was \u201cnot in the best interest of moviegoers, movie theaters and movie studios.\u201d It may not even be in the best interest of MoviePass itself, AMC said.The statement added, \u201cIn AMC\u2019s view, that price level is unsustainable and only sets up consumers for ultimate disappointment down the road if or when the product can no longer be fulfilled.\u201dThe chain also said MoviePass\u2019s approach to pricing could damage the movie industry long-term because it \u201cwill not provide sufficient revenue to operate quality theaters nor will it produce enough income to provide film makers with sufficient incentive to make great new movies.\u201dThe company declined to explain how it makes money by selling memberships at the lower rate.Helios and Matheson, an analytics firm that bought a majority stake in MoviePass this month, said the surge in new subscribers had surpassed the company\u2019s membership projections through late 2018. But a spokesman for MoviePass said it would not release the overall number of its subscribers.Data released by the firm indicated that two theater chains, which the firm declined to name, had seen significant increase in attendance since the new price plan came into effect.Comparing data from the week before the plan was announced and the six-day period afterward, the firm said the number of seats filled by MoviePass subscribers had jumped from 206 to approximately 4,137 in one of the chains.

{"Headline": "Review: Netflix\u2019s \u2018Defenders\u2019 Is Less Than the Sum of Its Superheroes", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNetflix and Marvel have collaborated on four comics-based television series over the last few years, and while they share a setting (New York) and a few overlapping characters, they\u2019re pretty distinct. You wouldn\u2019t confuse \u201cJessica Jones\u201d with \u201cIron Fist\u201d or \u201cDaredevil\u201d with \u201cLuke Cage.\u201dBut the challenge for the showrunner Marco Ramirez (who worked on Season 2 of \u201cDaredevil\u201d) is a little different. Coming hot on the heels of the individual shows, each of which has already devoted 13 to 26 hours to its story, he\u2019s not just juggling personalities and plot points. He\u2019s also trying to mesh four different tones, styles, rhythms, color palettes, music philosophies and acting styles.But the professionalism \u2014 and have no doubt, \u201cDefenders\u201d is very well put together \u2014 comes with some costs. One is the standard problem for this kind of assemblage: the need to give everyone equal screen time, and the exposition required to make sense of their getting together, means less of the things we come to comic-book stories for. There\u2019s a lot of getting-to-know-you and here\u2019s-what-we\u2019re-doing talk in the early episodes, and not a lot of action or emotion.And the corollary to that: It takes a while for things to get going. A long while. \u201cDefenders\u201d is an egregious offender in this regard. Minor spoiler alert: The team doesn\u2019t truly come together until halfway through the season, which doesn\u2019t leave as much time as you\u2019d like for villain-bashing and heart-tugging sacrifice.One final problem, at least for real fans: The producers have chosen the shadowy ninja syndicate called the Hand as the enemy that unites the Defenders. Because of the histories of the various Marvel comics from which the show is drawn, this results in the story flowing primarily through Iron Fist, the least interesting and least popular of the Netflix-Marvel characters.That story picks up shortly after the time frames of each of the antecedent series, with Jones (Krysten Ritter) and Daredevil (Charlie Cox) licking their wounds after deadly battles, Cage (Mike Colter) newly released from prison and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) traveling the world seeking revenge. Seemingly unconnected events \u2014 a new case for Jones, a Harlem crime wave, an earthquake centered in Daredevil\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood \u2014 are all connected to the Hand, drawing the four together.None of it seems very urgent, though. It would help if the series had a better villain. The nebulous, largely faceless (ninja robes, after all) forces of the Hand were a drag in \u201cDaredevil\u201d and \u201cIron Fist,\u201d and even with the addition of Sigourney Weaver as their leader, they\u2019re pretty dull here, too. The best Marvel-Netflix seasons have benefited from larger-than-life bad guys: Vincent D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s raging Kingpin in Season One of \u201cDaredevil\u201d and especially David Tennant\u2019s icy psycho, Kilgrave, in \u201cJessica Jones.\u201d\u201cJones,\u201d the best of the Marvel-Netflix bunch, offers Ms. Ritter\u2019s barbed but compassionate portrayal, and \u201cDefenders\u201d perks up whenever she\u2019s on screen. (In fairness to Mr. Colter, Mr. Cox and Mr. Jones, they have to do a disproportionate amount of the obligatory arguing and explaining.) The show also comes alive when Scott Glenn shows up as the no-nonsense sensei, Stick.There\u2019s nothing terribly wrong with \u201cMarvel\u2019s The Defenders,\u201d but there may not be enough right about it to make it worth the time of anyone but the completist. By the end of the year, there are set to be 11 live-action Marvel shows spread across five TV networks and streaming services. You can afford to be choosy.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly credited Marco Ramirez and Douglas Petrie as the showrunners of \u201cMarvel\u2019s The Defenders.\u201d The sole showrunner is Marco Ramirez.Advertisement"}

The central focus is Sam\u2019s preoccupation with finding a girlfriend, something that provides plenty of opportunities to showcase his social awkwardness.His mother, Elsa (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is overprotective and underappreciated, that second quality leading her mind to wander off the straight and narrow. By the end of the first episode, she is text-flirting with a bartender.Michael Rapaport has the somewhat thankless job of playing Sam\u2019s father, Doug, a stereotypical clueless dad who often seems barely to have realized that he\u2019s been living with an autistic child for 18 years. There\u2019s a better way to write this character in the slowly growing universe of shows dealing with disabilities; maybe someday someone will find it.And thus \u201cAtypical\u201d takes a while to get used to. The transitions from humor to heft can be jarring. The voice-overs from Sam are supposed to take us into his world, give his perspective, and they do, but in a surface sort of way.\u201cPeople think I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m being picked on, but I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t always know why, which in some ways is worse.\u201dIt\u2019s an intriguing thought, but it\u2019s left dangling, as are many others, because we need to get back to the girlfriend thing, which is the plotline with the least weight despite being the focus of the show. Sam is desperate to see some breasts. He is fixated on making his therapist, Julia (Amy Okuda), into his girlfriend, a presumably unattainable goal, though he doesn\u2019t realize this.In service to these goals, Sam makes all sorts of socially inappropriate remarks and misapplies various concepts, like the idea that practice makes perfect.\u201cIn order to be a good boyfriend to Julia, I need a practice girlfriend first,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou get good at something when you do it repeatedly, when you get into a routine.\u201dWhen the show is working such gags as opposed to its more substantive threads, it\u2019s amusing, but it\u2019s also pretty familiar, since in these moments Sam sounds an awful lot like any of the countless male nerd characters TV has presented over the decades. Nerds and geeks are one of television\u2019s most ingrained stereotypes and viewers without a connection to the world of autism might be tempted to just put Sam into that pigeonhole and think they understand a complex and vexing condition. The line between illuminating and trivializing is particularly thin here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turner Will Create New Streaming Service for UEFA Champions League in U.S.", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurner Broadcasting was a surprise winner earlier this year in the bidding for rights to the UEFA Champions League, Europe\u2019s top club soccer competition. But what the company plans do with the rights may be even more surprising: Launch a stand-alone sports streaming service next year that will broadcast the vast majority of the games.Many of the most important Champions League games, including the semifinals and final, will still be broadcast on cable television. But starting next summer, more than 80 percent of the matches will only be available to fans who pay for the new subscription service \u2014 the latest move by a media organization to monetize unused parts of a multimillion-dollar sports rights deal.Turner, which owns cable networks including TNT, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network, and already owns some rights for games in Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and the men\u2019s N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, will build its new product around soccer, at least to start.Once the contract begins, less than 20 percent of the hundreds of games in the two tournaments will be broadcast on Turner\u2019s linear television channels; the rest will form the backbone of the new streaming service.\u201cWe went into this specifically thinking about an O.T.T. product,\u201d David Levy, the president of Turner, said Wednesday about the company\u2019s decision to pursue the soccer rights. \u201cThere was just kind of an overall company strategy to innovate beyond the traditional television ecosystem.\u201dIn the past 16 months, Turner already has started a movie streaming service, FilmStruck, based around the Criterion Collection, and a cartoon streaming service, Boomerang.Of the 340 annual Champions League and Europa League matches that Turner acquired \u2014 games that have become a midweek afternoon staple for American fans \u2014 only about 60 will appear on television, mostly on truTV. The semifinals and finals of the Champions League will air on either TNT or TBS, as will the Europa League final.Through the Champions League group stage in the fall, Turner will televise four matches a week \u2014 two each on Tuesday and Wednesday, at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. Eastern time. Beginning with the knockout stage in February, Turner will televise two matches a week, one each on Tuesday and Wednesday.The other 280 or so matches will appear exclusively on Turner\u2019s yet-to-be-named sports streaming service, which cable subscribers will have to purchase in order to watch the matches.Levy said viewers should not expect any games from the other sports for which it owns the rights, such as the N.B.A. or Major League Baseball, to appear on the streaming service, at least not at the beginning.\u201cThis isn\u2019t about taking current rights and putting them on this platform,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new platform, which is untethered to our existing businesses.\u201dLenny Daniels, the president of Turner Sports, said the network planned to announce the acquisition of rights to other events and programming before the launch of the new service next year.Turner is entering what is becoming a quickly crowded marketplace. Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said that ESPN\u2019s new digital streaming service, scheduled to begin in early 2018, will feature more than 10,000 events in its first year, including M.L.B. and National Hockey League games and Grand Slam tennis matches \u2014 a much deeper selection than Turner can offer.\u201cAs a company, we are committed to ensuring that the current ecosystem remains healthy,\u201d Levy, the Turner president, said. \u201cBut we are also prepared for what\u2019s next.\u201dThat means putting its most desirable soccer matches on television while monetizing the lower-profile parts of their new inventory by making them available for purchase digitally.NBC Sports Network adopted a similar strategy this year after four years of allowing cable subscribers to view all Premier League games online at no additional cost. It created Premier League Pass, a $50 streaming service that allows fans to watch 130 Premier League games. Those games, about a third of the season\u2019s Premier League schedule, will no longer be available to cable subscribers.Similarly, none of the events broadcast on ESPN or ESPN2 will be available on that company\u2019s new streaming service; instead, it will attempt to monetize ESPN\u2019s vast catalog of rights.It remains to be seen how many sports fans will be interested in these offerings. Are there sports fans willing to subscribe to both cable and streaming services, or will they be content with the biggest ones and decline to pay extra to be able to see everything?\u201cIt might be both,\u201d Levy said, adding: \u201cThese aren\u2019t going to be C- and D-league games. This is the Champions League. These are all A\u2019s.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But with the likes of Universal and Sony reportedly budging only slightly on royalties, Spotify\u2019s ability to turn a decent profit is still in doubt.The company, a loss-making Swedish start-up led by Daniel Ek, renegotiated the licensing agreements in the hope of cutting the amount of money it pays in royalties. But if the terms of the Warner deal are anything like those reported for previous agreements, concerns about Spotify\u2019s future profitability will persist.The company has 140 million active users, 60 million of whom are paying subscribers, and made just over 2.9 billion euros in revenue in 2016. But its \u20ac2.5 billion cost of revenue \u2013 mostly payments to labels, publishers and other suppliers \u2013 meant little was left over to cover product development, marketing and administrative costs. The result was an operating loss of \u20ac350 million.True, labels may have to compromise further if they want to maintain pricing power in the face of tech behemoths like Apple Music. But a bet on Spotify is a gamble that the company can either substantially raise subscription prices or persuade artists and their labels to take a much smaller slice of the digital-streaming pie. The first will be difficult if Spotify\u2019s cash-rich rival Apple keeps subsidizing its music offering. And there\u2019s slim chance of the second coming true anytime soon if the recent round of royalty negotiations are anything to go by.

{"Headline": "Disney, Ditching Netflix, Grabs a New Key to the Kingdom", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIs content still king?It was Bill Gates of Microsoft who declared it so in 1996, but the proposition has been repeated so often by Disney executives that it could have served as the company\u2019s corporate slogan.When AT&T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said the deal proved yet again that \u201ccontent is king.\u201d\u201cIs the network \u2014 the platform \u2014 now most important?\u201d asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution \u2014 and a potential new revenue source.These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\u201cAnyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,\u201d said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.\u201dNetflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney\u2019s popular children\u2019s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney\u2019s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming \u2014 especially in the coveted children\u2019s market long dominated by Disney.Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children\u2019s programming.\u201cDisney served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix \u201chas reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn\u2019t really need Disney anymore.\u201dThe question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.And it\u2019s hedging its bet. For now, Disney\u2019s Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn\u2019t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s Disney \u2014 and only a few others.\u201cAfter Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\u201cDisney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cBut they\u2019re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they\u2019ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.\u201dAs Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney\u2019s move is putting \u201ca very settled and successful part of the business model\u201d at risk and \u201cmore aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dMr. Olson agreed. \u201cIf anyone can do it from a content perspective, it\u2019s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming from way behind.\u201dInvestors didn\u2019t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney\u2019s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company\u2019s move wasn\u2019t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. \u201cWe can both do really well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no zero-sum game here.\u201dAlthough it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney\u2019s move into direct-to-consumer distribution \u2014 not to mention the tech world\u2019s rush into original programming \u2014 demonstrates that \u201ccontent is everything these days.\u201dUnlike the old world of cable and broadcast, \u201cthe barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,\u201d he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. \u201cAll the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We\u2019re already good at both.\u201d (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)In short, from Disney\u2019s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, \u201ccontent is more king than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was the sharpest daily decline in the benchmark S.&P. 500 since May 17.Gold held at $1,283.70 an ounce after its strong run of late, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan steadied from its fall on Wednesday, closing at 19,730. The relative safety of United States Treasury securities continued to appeal, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 2.20 percent from 2.25 percent on Wednesday. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions from each other.)At the root of investors\u2019 nervousness was a jump in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the index measures investor expectations that stocks will experience sharp moves in the future.On Thursday, the VIX surged 44 percent from its historically low levels to close the day at 16.04, its highest close since Election Day in November.For many weeks this year, the VIX hovered persistently in single-digit territory, unusual for a barometer that historically trades around 20.The index\u2019s long period of placidity amid constant upheaval in Washington has posed a persistent riddle for Wall Street prognosticators.Some analysts warned that expectations of low volatility had lured a rush of recent investment, particularly from retail investors piling into exchange traded funds tied to the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and other indexes and strategies.A sharp upward trend in the VIX could well prompt many of those newcomers to flee at the same time, which could turn a market downturn into something more severe.The potential risks extend beyond those who are new to the party. In recent years, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into risk parity and other machine-driven funds that are programmed to start selling stocks and bonds once volatility rises sharply.In a period of investment calm and artificially low interest rates, automated funds, which churn out consistent if unspectacular returns, have become very popular among yield-hungry investors.\u201cBy definition, investors tend to be long the most risk when volatility is at its lowest levels,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investments. \u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201dAfter many years in which investors made a mint by betting against the VIX, a number of investors have begun to argue that the time has come to wager on the VIX \u2014 not against it.Of course, it may be too early to predict the end of one of the longest bull markets in financial history. The global economy continues to grow, and companies in the United States remain highly profitable, with earnings and sales in the quarter that ended in June handily beating expectations.The VIX\u2019s sharp move could also simply be a reversion to its mean and not a sign of panic in the markets.Analysts noted that a long period of stock market calm is highly unusual and that a correction should not come as a shock.Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm, said that before today\u2019s sell-off, the S.&P. 500 had experienced only two down days of more than 1 percent this year; the last similarly long period of financial calm was in 1964.That reserve of buying power, be it retail or institutional, has cushioned stock market drops in the past, and optimists are hoping that it will do so again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Misunderstood History of Trump on Letterman", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyBut the three-decade on-air relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Letterman is more complex than this ad suggested. What it didn\u2019t show was that in the same episode, Mr. Letterman apologized to Mr. Trump for calling him a racist for promoting the lie that Barack Obama was not born in America. Mr. Trump had boycotted \u201cLate Show\u201d over the comment, and Mr. Letterman had held his ground at first, but after a year and a half, he capitulated and took back his criticism. Only then did Mr. Letterman expose Mr. Trump\u2019s hypocrisy about China, which in context appeared as much an attempt at saving face as a defiant takedown.Before he became an outsider politician, Donald Trump was an establishment talk-show guest, appearing on Mr. Letterman\u2019s shows more than 30 times. I rewatched all those episodes \u2014 in the last decade there were typically two a year, with the chats lasting 10 minutes or more \u2014 and what stands out is the chemistry between host and guest, both irreverent stars who came to fame in 1980s New York. Mr. Trump was an unusually game and entertaining guest, and Mr. Letterman clearly liked and got along with him. At the same time, Mr. Trump test drove his current brand of populism to crowd-pleasing success in front of a blue-state audience, and Mr. Letterman was one of the first mainstream figures on television to regularly treat Trump as a serious political thinker, not just a joke of a rich guy (although he did that, too).One decade and a few appearances later, their conversation became chummier. On \u201cLate Show,\u201d Mr. Letterman asked Mr. Trump about the duty of the wealthy to give back. \u201cCould you give me an idea of something nice you\u2019ve done for someone recently?\u201d Mr. Letterman asked, a setup to perhaps talk about charity. Instead, Mr. Trump referred to his ex-wife Marla Maples: \u201cI married Marla, and now I\u2019m giving her a huge settlement.\u201dSay what you will about the etiquette or morality of this quip, but for the purposes of late-night comedy, it\u2019s hard to beat. Mr. Letterman chuckled, even looking a bit jealous. \u201cIf I had said that, people would have booed me,\u201d he said.After separating from Ms. Maples, Mr. Trump, who occasionally laughed on the show, something he rarely does in public today, offered to set Mr. Letterman up with her (\u201cI\u2019m going to wait and see how she makes out in the prenup,\u201d the host said). They bonded over being older fathers. \u201cGod forbid something happens to me, would you take my son?\u201d Mr. Letterman asked and Mr. Trump agreed: \u201cThat\u2019s called a great gene pool.\u201dIn Mr. Letterman\u2019s final decade in late night, when he leaned more on long-form conversation than scripted comedy, Mr. Trump acted as a pundit, hitting the same populist notes that became his campaign rhetoric. \u201cI don\u2019t see greatness unless we do something about China and some others,\u201d he said in 2010, adding that America should be sending businesspeople, not diplomats, to negotiate deals.With Mr. Trump, Mr. Letterman felt comfortable going long stretches without jokes, probing his thoughts on the issue of the day and treating him with more respect than he did a sparring partner like Bill O\u2019Reilly. Mr. Letterman took shots at Mr. Trump, but they were typically about his hair. The host treated their disagreements seriously, pushing back, for instance, when Mr. Trump praised coal instead of green energy. \u201cI\u2019d rather see the windmills than the choking clouds of coal smoke,\u201d Mr. Letterman responded.Mr. Letterman and Mr. Trump had such an amiable rapport that they could disagree heatedly without rancor. No conversation illustrates their kinship better than Mr. Trump\u2019s first appearance after Mr. Letterman, facing a blackmail threat, confessed to having affairs with staff members. On the show, Mr. Trump always expressed sympathy for whatever famous man was then battling scandal, including Mike Tyson, Rod Blagojevich and Woody Allen.Here too Mr. Trump celebrated the \u201ctoughness\u201d of Mr. Letterman\u2019s response (the host pressed for an arrest), saying he wished more people would take Mr. Letterman\u2019s pugnacious approach. In a deep, deadpan voice full of anguish, Mr. Letterman, who was privately in pain over the scandal, responded to this support: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come home with me tonight, Don?\u201dEven though Mr. Trump\u2019s political success owes a debt to popular culture, no talk show, not even Mr. Fallon\u2019s, is responsible for his rise \u2014 and it\u2019s important to recall that until recently, few thought him a plausible presidential candidate.Mr. Letterman has said he never did, but what\u2019s striking about the episode where he called Mr. Trump a racist is how seriously he took the comments about Barack Obama. \u201cNobody should be amused,\u201d Mr. Letterman told another guest, Dr. Phil, who made light of Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of the birther movement. Mr. Letterman wasn\u2019t having it: \u201cIt\u2019s all fun. It\u2019s all a circus. It\u2019s all a rodeo,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil it smacks of racism.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump was considered by many to be a diversion, Mr. Letterman approached Mr. Trump\u2019s outrageous comments with moral gravity. Mr. Letterman not only went further than Dr. Phil, who said he didn\u2019t think Mr. Trump was a racist, but argued earlier than most that what Mr. Trump was doing merited a serious response, not just jokes. And yet, when Mr. Trump dug in after being criticized for making a norm-shattering comment, something he would go on to do many times, Mr. Letterman backed down. On the same show where Mr. Letterman apologized, Mr. Trump had barely sat down before noting it was the first day of sweeps. \u201cYou need me, David,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Icarus\u2019 Puts Russia, Cycling and Doping Into One Cocktail", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe filmmaker Bryan Fogel recently reminded me that the practice of doping goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks, who in their own Olympic Games would drink drug and herb concoctions to kill pain. A few years ago, Mr. Fogel, a filmmaker and a dedicated amateur cyclist who had, like so many, idolized Lance Armstrong in the years when he vehemently denied doping, had an idea for a movie on the theme: He would create a doping regimen for himself that could go undetected and record the results of the experiment.\u201cI had initially conceived this as a movie like \u2018Super Size Me,\u2019 in which I\u2019m the subject of this experiment to expose the failure of antidoping systems,\u201d Mr. Fogel said in a phone interview. \u201cUltimately the question would be, what is the good of this system that\u2019s supposed to police doping if it can be defeated like this?\u201dHad things gone according to plan, his film, \u201cIcarus,\u201d available for streaming on Netflix on Friday, Aug. 4, might well have ended up a persuasive albeit dispiriting account of how easy it is to mask the use of performance-enhancing drugs. But a world sporting scandal intervened, making Mr. Fogel\u2019s story more suspenseful and more disturbing.\u201cIcarus\u201d begins with Mr. Fogel describing his lifelong cycling obsession as a largely masochistic one. Having cycled without using such drugs his whole life, in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal he decides to cheat and consults a man who has devoted his life to finding cheaters \u2014 Don Catlin, a scientist who invented many of the protocols for contemporary drug testing in sports. Dr. Catlin assists Mr. Fogel for a while and then refers him to his Russian counterpart, Grigory Rodchenkov.Initially, Dr. Rodchenkov comes off as an eccentric. Bluff and voluble, he conducts Skype calls with Mr. Fogel while shirtless. He dryly refers to his homeland as \u201cthe most relaxing place in the world\u201d during Mr. Fogel\u2019s visit to Moscow, after Mr. Fogel has had enough experience to know it\u2019s more likely the opposite.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of the scheme,\u201d Mr. Fogel said. \u201cWhen you see me helping Grigory get out of the country, I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m putting it on my credit card, everything.\u201d At that point, Mr. Fogel said, he had to go back to the movie\u2019s investors and tell them that what started as a meta-expos\u00e9 with himself as a guinea pig was going in a very different direction.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to Russia, its national identity, and this is particularly true of its national identity under Putin, that it be a dominating force in sports,\u201d Mr. Fogel said.\u201cIcarus\u201d has archival footage from the 1970s in which Dr. Catlin shares ideas with a contingent of Russian doctors visiting his labs in California \u2014 one of whom is Mr. Rodchenkov.\u201cIn a sense, Grigory was there as a spy!\u201d Mr. Fogel said. \u201cAssume that Russia has been doing this for 40 years and that Sochi was just the icing on the cake. Think about it: They were robbing the bank, and they owned the bank. They spent $50 billion to create Sochi. What they had at stake was showing Russia as a world power in sports.\u201dAll of which brings up a timely question: How far will Russia go to achieve other goals? As for Mr. Rodchenkov, in \u201cIcarus\u201d he evolves from an eccentric character into a courageous man who is forced to make some difficult decisions. For about a year now, he has been in protective custody in the United States. His wife and children remain in Russia, unable to travel because their passports have been confiscated. Mr. Fogel has been able to screen the film for Mr. Rodchenkov and is still concerned about the state of his friend\u2019s case. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the government has planned for him or how this is going to resolve,\u201d he said.The global implications of Mr. Fogel\u2019s topic makes Netflix\u2019s reach appealing. \u201cNo other company can press a button and get your movie out to 190 countries,\u201d he said. Mr. Fogel does not intend to go back and make his own \u201cSuper Size Me,\u201d despite some of the questions about doping in both amateur and professional sports that the movie leaves open. Does everybody really do it? If so, what does the term \u201cfair play\u201d even mean anymore? Would play be more fair if it were allowed? And given the conditions, would permitting a practice we consider corrupt be not just more expedient but somehow morally justifiable?Advertisement"}

The realization has been exhausting. This week, we take a step back to think about what the political moment is doing to our emotional and physical states. We discuss our routines of self-care \u2014 and investigate the origins of the phrase and why it feels overused and even a little clich\u00e9. We also talk to Matthew Steinfeld, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine about our ailing country and get a few ideas for how to remedy ourselves, and perhaps one another.From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your iPhone or iPad:On your Android phone or tablet:This unedited transcription from the podcast may contain errors. Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it.JW: I\u2019m Jenna Wortham.WM: I\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers at the New York Times.JW: Coming to you live from Wesley\u2019s stoop in Brooklyn.WM: Why are we on my stoop?JW: Well, I\u2019m picking you up because I want to go to this store that\u2019s right around the corner from your apartment. One of the best stores in Brooklyn for holistic and herbal and various plant medical things. I have a shopping list of items that I need. I\u2019ve got to stock my pantry for fall to get ready for the transition between seasons, but also, let\u2019s be real. Times are tough. Times are dark. And I\u2019m not just talking about the solar eclipse. I\u2019m talking about the state of the union, and we need tonics and healing things to take care of ourselves and each other.WM: So we\u2019re going to go to the store.JW: We\u2019re going to run my errands.WM: You\u2019re going to, you\u2019re going to...JW: Buy a bunch of stuff.WM: Get all the stuff to heal the country. And then what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll go record the show, and then afterwards, we\u2019ll come back to my stoop and we\u2019ll talk about what we got.JW: Perfect.WM: That sound good?JW: Let\u2019s do it!WM: We\u2019re in the studio, we were on my stoop. I...don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t just do the show on my steps, but that\u2019s fine. It is actually better in here and I\u2019m not sweating anymore, so.JW: Yeah, it was real steamy.WM: What\u2019s happening? What\u2019s on your mind? What\u2019s been going on in your life?JW: Wesley. You don\u2019t watch this show, so you don\u2019t know, but Game of Thrones is wiling right now. It is getting so crazy. And like, plot twists and plot points and who is related to whom and who is going to sleep with whom next aside \u2014 not a big deal. Whatever. I\u2019m along for the ride. What I\u2019m interested in is that this season has somehow managed to centralize all the female characters on the show and give them such interesting texture and back stories. The first couple seasons of that show were mostly like, women were being shown topless and crazy, like grotesque sex stuff. And you know, honestly, I didn\u2019t mind that stuff as much, but it\u2019s just so much more satisfying to watch these murderous women duke it out to be the queen of the Iron Throne. It\u2019s the best thing ever.WM: Wow. They\u2019re fighting each other?JW: They\u2019re about to. And the furs, and the looks, and the chains, and the metal. Oh my God. Anyway. Game of Thrones, you have a fan. Okay. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the politics of survival lately. And because I\u2019m a nerd and I don\u2019t know where to start, I started with like wilderness survival guides. Just like the literal most tactile approach to this whatsoever. And I\u2019ve been reading a lot of Lawrence Gonzalez, who is a well known writer about these things. He wrote a book called Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why, and I got his newest book, which is called Surviving Survival: What Happens After You Survive. Because I\u2019m very much interested in thinking about getting through this political moment and what it will mean to come out on the other side hopefully not terribly scathed. And there\u2019s this beautiful line in the book that I want to read to you.WM: Please. I\u2019m ready for it.JW: Your experience of life in the aftermath may even be more dramatic, sometimes more painful than the experience of survival itself. But it can be beautiful and fulfilling too, and a more lasting achievement than the survival that began it all. What comes after survival is, after all, the rest of your life.WM: Oh my God.JW: I\u2019m pretty deep in it. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s my light.WM: That is both totally obvious and very profound at the same time.JW: The last thing I\u2019m working through is I\u2019m trying to research and get into kiss proof lipstick so that I don\u2019t leave my face all over everybody else.WM: This is why I am doing this show with you.JW: And let me tell you \u2014 it is not easy to find a kiss proof lipstick. You have to exfoliate your lips. You have to moisturize them. You have to do all this stuff so the stuff goes on in the first place and doesn\u2019t look cake-y and weird and gross.WM: What?JW: And then you can\u2019t get it off at the end of the night. I\u2019m telling you. I mean, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. If anyone has any recommendations, hit me up.WM: Wait. I\u2019m sorry. They haven\u2019t figured this out yet?JW: No, science has figured it out. I haven\u2019t figured it out. I need to crowdsource it, I need more help. What\u2019s new in your world?WM: The eclipse. I wasn\u2019t kidding before. I was very touched by other people\u2019s experiences with something that I wish I had experienced for myself. Listening to all of these people who managed to get in the path of total darkness...just listening to all the spiritual experiences people say they had. What must that have been like?JW: Incredible, I\u2019m sure.WM: I just, I don\u2019t know. I think the next time this happens, we should just go.JW: I\u2019m going to wheel you out. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get your glasses. It\u2019s going to be 2024.WM: You\u2019re going to wheel me out in 2024?JW: Yeah.WM: I\u2019m Cathy Moriarty in Patty Cakes? In 2024?JW: I\u2019ll get you your special glasses, your special oversized glasses.WM: Oh my goodness. I don\u2019t even know what to do with that. Okay. Seriously, I think we should talk about taking care of ourselves in this particular political climate. After the show we did last week where we talked about the events of Charlottesville and how much they hurt \u2014JW: We need to do it. It\u2019s important. I mean, we spent all last week talking about what it looks like when this sickness that is just embedded in this country basically collapses in on itself, and now we have to spend some time really reconciling what it\u2019s doing to us, beyond what it\u2019s doing the country \u2014 but what is it doing to us on the individual level?WM: Yeah. So, we\u2019re going to have my friend Dr. Matthew Steinfeld come in, and we\u2019re going to talk about what it means to seek counseling during this time, to see a therapist. And then, I also just want to hear from you about where you stand on the way we talk about what we talk about.JW: When we talk about self care. And also the way it\u2019s been coopted, the way it\u2019s been bastardized a little bit, the way it\u2019s been very diluted. All things that are valid and true and don\u2019t take away from its importance as a concept.WM: We\u2019ll be right back.JW: BRB.WM: We spent that whole episode last week talking about the meaning of Charlottesville, the toxicity of it, how it made us feel...but we also really didn\u2019t mention that you and I were together when that was happening.JW: We were in New Orleans for this journalism conference, we were looking at all these black journalists, and this thing kept coming up for both of us. But you put a very fine point to it, which was we talk about what it means to be a minority and working in majority white newsrooms. We talk about what it means to cover things we care about and get attention to these national issues that sometimes get overlooked. But we don\u2019t talk about the trauma that comes from being a journalist but also the trauma that comes from being a person of color or a black person in America, and what do you do about that?WM: We, as a people, as individuals, as a nation, do not talk enough about trauma \u2014 what it is, and how much we all have it. I think to be a citizen of this country is to carry around just a native negativity toward some aspect of being here. And I don\u2019t know how it manifests itself all the time, but one of those manifestations is what happened two weeks ago. And I\u2019m thinking that if we have this trauma and we have all this negative energy, what do we do about getting rid of it? How do we make it go away? It\u2019s in you, and you want to get it out, you want to heal yourself. You want to do things to feel better and don\u2019t know how. But I do think that it\u2019s really important to talk about and think about what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about self care. Because I think that term has so...it\u2019s been so misused and diluted and bastardized.JW: I mean, Ivanka Trump is now on the self care tip. That should tell you something. I mean, like...let it go.WM: See, you said that to me and I don\u2019t even \u2014 should that be bad? I don\u2019t know.JW: Yes. I mean \u2014WM: I need a little history lesson.JW: People come to me all the time and ask me for self care tactics, or if I post something on Twitter that\u2019s like, oh, made chamomile tea \u2014 which sometimes I do, just because I want to \u2014 people will be like, I love your self care strat. And I feel like self care has somehow become synonymous with self indulgence or...self investment, or people who have time to indulge in self care practices are somehow, you know, they have an excess of time and money. It\u2019s become something that\u2019s not even about \u2014 like you said it really well earlier. When we talk about this, we\u2019re talking about taking care of ourselves. But when people hear the term self care, they think, I always think about the clip from Parks and Recreation with Retta and Aziz Ansari when they have the like, the shopping competition marathon. And they\u2019re like, treat yourself. Like I actually think that\u2019s what people think self care is. And I overheard someone on the street the other day be like, I\u2019m going to go home and binge watch Netflix and order Seamless, you know, because like, hashtag self care. And I\u2019m not saying those things aren\u2019t doing what it means to take care of yourself, but when we\u2019re talking about it, we\u2019re talking about actively trying to push back against systems that break you down and institutional ways of not being cared for. Like what does it mean to live in a country that isn\u2019t actively trying to make sure you are well cared for? So I did a little research into the history of self care, to try to understand where it comes from and sort of when we started thinking about this as a concept for taking care of our bodies.WM: Okay, I already love this, because I don\u2019t know.JW: Look, I\u2019m just picking up from let\u2019s say, the \u201960s. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a much longer history, but where I came in was around the \u201960s, when there was a lot of radical activism, and there were a lot of groups that were thinking about women\u2019s liberation and women\u2019s rights and also the interests of black people and interests of non-white groups of bodies, and how they, what they needed to be be well, and what they needed for care taking. And there was, among some of these groups, a consensus that western medical institutions were not prioritizing female bodies.WM: Huh.JW: Non-gender conforming bodies. Black bodies. And they started taking it upon themselves to think about, well, what do women need? Well, what do black people need? And I didn\u2019t learn until maybe a summer or two ago, there was an installation at the New Museum that did talk about the Black Panther party and how a huge priority of theirs was the health care system. They did sickle cell anemia testing. They did free lunches, like free breakfasts. They were very invested in trying to pick up where they felt the government left off for black communities in America. And so, this idea of reflexive care taking came from a lot of that radical work.WM: So like everything else, this term becomes something is very specific usage and refers to a very specific history and winds up turning into something like Goop.JW: It\u2019s become a little bit meaningless. It\u2019s become very individualistic. It\u2019s come to mean...a justification for something that (a) you should not be justifying, but also maybe spending time and usually money on yourself. It\u2019s very strange. So, I started thinking a lot more about collective care taking. I\u2019ve started thinking a lot about just wellness in general, in the sense of what does it mean to care for yourself when you\u2019re not sick? Like what are the things that I need to do on a daily basis \u2014WM: Maintenance.JW: Maintenance! That make me feel good. How do you undo how it feels to think about Charlottesville? That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been reading survival books because I\u2019m just thinking a lot more about what does it really mean to live under an administration that is not interested in our survival.WM: Listen. The health care situation alone is the literal taking away of people\u2019s ability to get treatment for things, without concern for giving them anything in replacement. Basically, what we\u2019re talking about is repealing something and then putting nothing in its place, and not fixing the admittedly broken system that through neglect, through legislative neglect, is falling apart. So, you were correct, you have to take care of yourself. Because this government isn\u2019t going to help you do it.JW: Yeah. And there\u2019s a long history of that in this country. People are obviously interested in trying to figure out how to deal with the shock, we can call it trauma, but the anxiety and the uncertainty of what that administration would mean. So there\u2019s a renewed interest in it anyway, like trying to figure out \u2014 on a very practical level, like in terms of the health care act being repealed, of like, well, wait a minute. If I don\u2019t have access to these things, then what do I do? And then also, people who are literally saying, I have this existential fear that\u2019s causing me to feel unwell. How do I \u2014 like actually, how do I care for myself because of that?WM: What do we do in a moment like this, for betterment and sane keeping purposes?JW: I mean, the first thing, right, has to be acknowledging you need help. If you aren\u2019t aware that you\u2019re suffering, you can\u2019t take steps to remedy it or put things in place, or put new routines in place to take care of yourself. Right? When you and I talk, when we talk about our stress levels, we talk about our anxiety levels. I\u2019m someone who suffers from chronic anxiety. I have a tremendous amount of not very existential fear that there will be something about my gender presentation or the partner that I\u2019m walking around with that triggers or invites violence. It\u2019s something that I think about near constantly. So, when you feel those things, then do you ignore them? Or do you say, like I\u2019m actively struggling with this feeling, how do I address it?WM: There\u2019s two questions, right? Do people want to, and in trying to address it, who is going to listen? Now, to the second question, I will give you an example of a very good friend of mine, who, when I was explaining to them that I walk around with a not dissimilar level of anxiety or trauma, this person said, why would you? You\u2019re you. Nobody wants to both you. Nobody wants to shoot you \u2014JW: X that person out of your life.WM: Or call you the N word. I cannot, he\u2019s too important to me. But it wasn\u2019t that he was unwilling to hear...me. I think that in some cases, depending on who you\u2019re talking to about this stuff, if you are a black man talking to a white man about your trauma, there is a way in which even for the best of us of our white friends, it can feel a little farfetched because it\u2019s beyond their imagination the degree to which black people are under threat or feel they are under threat would extend to some bougie ass person like me. I was raised to be afraid of the same things every other black person was pretty much raised to be afraid of, and it\u2019s not like N word using MFer is going to come up to me and be like, oh, well, I see your shoes, I guess I\u2019m going to spare you today, sir.JW: Yeah. That\u2019s not how it works.WM: I\u2019m going to move onto the gangsta down the end of the subway car. No! Me and the gangsta, we same. Same thing.JW: Yeah, and I think a lot of the feeling also comes from lack of control, right? Like, it\u2019s this feeling of not knowing what\u2019s coming and not knowing what\u2019s happening next with the administration, not knowing on a day to day level what\u2019s happening or what could happen. But I don\u2019t know. I think part of \u2014 I mean, my answer to that dilemma is really simple, which is you need to cut them, but I know you can\u2019t. But I do think part of taking care of yourself has to be understanding your own limitations and whatever your own threshold is for \u2014 what is your capacity for endurance. Because I know for me, I\u2019ve taken very active steps to not be around people that don\u2019t understand the fears that I have or the type of pain that I worry about, or what my anxieties look like. If you are someone and you\u2019ve expressed to me that kind of dismissal of something that is really valid and important in my life, then we\u2019re not in commune anymore, and we\u2019re not in conversation anymore. And I\u2019ve, it\u2019s been a little lonesome for me since the election, but I\u2019ve had to really step away from relationships and friendships and social dynamics where I don\u2019t feel that understanding is implicit.WM: I think that one of the reasons that people won\u2019t listen in some ways is because they don\u2019t care for themselves. And \u2014JW: Or they haven\u2019t had to, but they\u2019ve never been in a situation where they haven\u2019t had a scarcity of resources. I\u2019m not even talking about financial, I\u2019m just talking about access. Support. Understanding. There is an emotional and economic disparity when it comes to care taking where if you\u2019ve never been a body who has been challenged or told your pain isn\u2019t real, or dismissed or told, like, I don\u2019t understand what a microaggression is \u2014 like if your coworker questioned your SAT score, then why would that bother you? Like, a person who has never dealt with that, a person who is probably not of color or has never been in the minority in any way, then that\u2019s not something they\u2019re going to understand. I mean, that\u2019s exactly like they don\u2019t need the self care. They might think they do, but they\u2019re going to post a hashtag on Instagram under a photograph of themselves eating a bowl of spaghetti.WM: Right, but that\u2019s not self care.JW: Carbs! Self care.WM: I mean, that\u2019s self. I think that it\u2019s useful to make that distinction in understanding the history of why the term even exists in the first place is part of that. So, I\u2019m sitting here talking to you about like, somebody should or should not do X, Y, or Z, but I don\u2019t really know. What really are we talking about when we\u2019re talking about \u2014 both conceptually and practically, what are we talking about when we talk about taking care of yourself in this particular way?JW: Well, what I\u2019m talking about is trying to figure out what the ailments are and recognizing that you can\u2019t throw money at them. Very abstractly, it\u2019s going to vary from person to person. I am obviously operating from a very political and almost an activist framework when I think about care taking, and I think a lot about Audre Lorde. And she was someone who, you know, she\u2019s got this quote about what it means to take care of herself, and it being an act of resistance, an act of political warfare. Part of her diaries when she was suffering from cancer, she started to really understand that as a black, lesbian body, she wasn\u2019t prioritized by the western American medical system, and she wrote a lot about it very beautifully. About comparing the fight that her body was going through to actually get rid of or deal with cancer cells to the fight that she felt herself being subjected to every single day living in American society as a black lesbian woman, and a lot of people have glommed onto the way she talked about taking care of herself as a metaphor for how we all take care of ourselves. And I use that framework too, where I think about, I want to feel good. Yes, I want to look good. I have to eat well, I have to get a lot of sleep, I have to prioritize making sure that people around me are well, too. Like not just that I\u2019m doing good, but like checking in on people when, you know, President Trump says, trans people are a burden. I\u2019m going to text all my trans friends, how are you guys doing? Can I do anything? Can I send you some broth? I love you. Even just saying that. I love you. You know, those are things that I\u2019m thinking about when I think about care taking. And I\u2019m really being specific about not just saying self care because for me, I think about it now as collective care. I take great care of myself. I brush my teeth. I have all my teeth. I sleep well. You know, I don\u2019t eat a lot of sugar or junk food. I\u2019m good on self care. I take care of myself. But for me, it means something more about what am I doing to foster wellness and health around me. Because if my environment is toxic, I\u2019m going to feel sick. And the kind of trauma we\u2019re talking about isn\u2019t something that you can spend away, it isn\u2019t coming that you can soak away. You have to deal with it. It\u2019s latent.WM: I tried to text it away...JW: I knew Solange was going to come up at some point in this conversation. But no, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s like, when we talk about wellness, we\u2019re also talking about mental wellness and emotional wellness, and those are typically the underlying things that we\u2019re trying to \u2014 we\u2019re not talking about physical wounds.WM: We\u2019re talking about being brave enough to talk about stuff that you\u2019re afraid to talk about. And we\u2019re also just talking about incorporating a degree of mental wellness into your everyday life, because that is important, whether you...whether you\u2019re a neo-Nazi or us. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are. I think everybody needs to be talking to somebody about how they\u2019re feeling.JW: And not in a Gchat box. I think there\u2019s definitely a phenomena of like a Gchat therapist where you\u2019re just chatting with your friends about your angst and just spewing it into a chat box or Twitter box or whatever box.WM: No, 4chan does not count. So what I think we should do is have my friend Dr. Matthew Steinfeld come on the show. He\u2019s a clinical psychologist. Really, really smart about how to think both theoretically and practically about our sense of well being and the sense of psychological health and emotional health as connected to the strife that\u2019s going on in this country.JW: Let\u2019s bring him in.WM: Jenna, you and I have been talking about taking care of ourselves, how to do it, wellness, and sort of the fraudulent ideas of what those are, and what truly they are individually. I also just feel like since we\u2019ve been talking about trauma too, it would be crazy not to have a mental health professional help us talk about how to talk about some of this stuff. And to also help us figure out what\u2019s going on. So, I thought it would be great to talk to my friend, Matthew Steinfeld. Dr. Matthew Steinfeld, who is a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. Welcome, Matt.MS: Thanks so much. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here.WM: Are you ready to talk about this stuff?MS: Absolutely.WM: I think we have a lot of questions for you.JW: Matt \u2014 Dr. Matt. What are you seeing right now? What are you hearing from people \u2014 we\u2019ve just been talking about what we\u2019re experiencing in our own relationship to these feelings, but are you seeing some larger emotional angsty moment that\u2019s happening?MS: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I should preface this by saying, for most of the week, I help run a public mental health clinic, and then I also have two private practices. So, I see fellow citizens suffering across the economic and social demographic spectrum. So, how people are responding and with what resources, mental reserves they even have to focus on this, varies. But that said, for the people who are focusing on the current political milieu, a lot of people are suffering. And those people that aren\u2019t, that\u2019s very interesting in terms of what that says about their beliefs or values, or historical awareness of what this country is, how it was founded, and what direction it may be headed in.JW: So what does that diagnosis?WM: Oh, that\u2019s a great question.MS: I don\u2019t know we have good language to talk about what\u2019s happening yet. I think that\u2019s part of the issue that we\u2019re all grappling for ways to cohere what we\u2019re feeling into language in some sense, that generalizes to another person. My sense is that people are groping for...words and ways of thinking together about what to name this.WM: Yep. Yep.MS: In order to orient towards what to do about it \u2014 and this is actually emblematic of what, I do know the point of departure in most therapies, which, when I was a student, one of my 90 year old supervisors said, people come into therapy with a mess. They don\u2019t come in with a problem. The first order of business is to turn a mess into a problem that you can do something about. Because if they knew what the problem was, they probably would have already done something about it. It wouldn\u2019t be there.JW: Right. Right.WM: I guess to take that and then ask this other question, or to apply this nationally, what is the mess, and what is the problem?MS: I don\u2019t have an answer. Perhaps part of the mess is that the people that constitute America have very, very different understandings of what it is, where it comes from, and what they want it to be. So maybe one way of thinking about it is that part of the mess is that there is a battle over the narrative right now of who we are to one another. And divergent opinions on the reality \u2014 and I\u2019m going to emphasize reality \u2014 of interdependence. That we fundamentally are implicated in one another\u2019s well being or lack thereof, regardless of whether of not people want it.JW: Right. But there is this thing that\u2019s happening among those who are suffering where \u2014 and I love the way you\u2019re talking about interdependence, but I think there\u2019s this thing that\u2019s happening where those who are suffering are suffering in part because they feel people voted for them to suffer, or people are taking an active role in that suffering. And then the other side of it, I guess those who took the active role in the suffering are kind of like, this is a big deal. So I think there\u2019s like a weird gaslighting that\u2019s happening too, between two sides.MS: I agree with you.JW: That\u2019s part of this problem too, and part of the illness. Because if you don\u2019t feel well, or you have a lot of anxiety or you\u2019re scared about the future and what you can\u2019t control and then someone on the other side of it is like, well, there\u2019s no problem, though.MS: I think your analysis is right. I think that if we could refer to a group of people who say, your suffering is not my problem, that is a group of people that are not acknowledging interdependence. Your well being can be part of my well being as well. And that is like a fundamental disconnect in terms of political ideology that we\u2019re suffering from.WM: Is part of like, in this mess, one of the problems that, the sort of unacknowledged degree to which a white nationalist or racist also has a trauma that they...are trying to work through. And what really struck me about what happened in Charlottesville, for instance \u2014 and also what you\u2019ve seen throughout the history of antisemitism, homophobia, racist behavior \u2014 there\u2019s a fear and an anger in the performance of contempt and hate for others that always feels to me like it really isn\u2019t about the group being oppressed or violated, it\u2019s really about the violators.MS: Absolutely. So, one way to think about this comes from the work of a British psychoanalyst named Melanie Klein, who wrote a paper in 1946. This is super reductive, but it goes a little something like, this, which is that, the feelings that we can\u2019t tolerate inside are defended against and kind of split off and then extruded out, like projected out onto other people. And then there are strong incentives for them to identify with them, whether they want to or not. So, projection \u2014 many people are familiar with, when you know, people project onto somebody else \u2014 but projective identification, which is the concept she advances in this paper, is when people identify with the projections. And so, let\u2019s say person A is really angry and filled with hate. But they want to view themselves as a good person. So, they split off all the hate, they project it out, and they point at another group of people who are responsible for their feelings. But this is an unconscious process. And those people are like, what did I do? And they use that as a the pretext for validating their perceptions in some sense. And so, when it comes to racism, which is frequently predicated on fear, lack of interconnection, no way to disconfirm a biased belief about somebody \u2014 the way this theory\u2019s been applied by a number of really powerful senior analysts in the community, Kimberlyn Leary, Dorothy Holmes, has been to point out the fact that the racist needs the person they\u2019re persecuting to be the repository of the feelings they can\u2019t tolerate. And then needs to hold them close to confirm that those feelings aren\u2019t located in themselves but are outside of themselves, and paradoxically becomes subordinated to the people that they\u2019re persecuting, because they can\u2019t operate without them. This, therapeutically, is fascinating, because we need each other to understand the problem, and it\u2019s incredibly painful to sit with people who are persecuting you or what you dead, or gone, or like, you know, want America to be what it was during Jim Crow. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 like who is going to sit there for that?WM: How do you get a person who won\u2019t listen to you to talk to you?MS: So, with regard to Charlottesville, I would imagine that among the people present there holding torches, the people assembled have a range of different investments in whatever agenda they were putting forth, from wanting to cause actual harm to perhaps \u2014 maybe this is too charitable \u2014 but not wanting to cause physical harm to anybody, but wanting to be seen and heard. For people that are oozing with \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what the right term, but \u2014 white fragility, a sense of historical amnesia, and a sense of righteous indignation mixed with presentism, my sense is that the opening kinds of conversations would be quite contentious, but what would be necessary is some frame to hold people in relation to one another so they can maintain dialogue over time. There are debates in the psychoanalytic community about whether to take white racists\u2019 suffering seriously or not. How useful that is in terms of ameliorating these impasses.WM: I think you would have to.MS: I often think of the 50 or so workers at the Fukushima nuclear plant from Japan who volunteered to stay inside so the thing didn\u2019t melt down and hurt more people as sort of what these sort of conversations might feel like to some people. Like, I\u2019m going to hang in there with somebody so that I could potentially help somebody have a positive experience with somebody who looks like me. Everybody\u2019s got families, and there\u2019s always somebody in somebody\u2019s family whose thinking could use a little updating. And \u2014WM: Amen. Ain\u2019t it the truth.MS: And so this is where each of us \u2014 you know, it\u2019s possible to love somebody who has views that are abhorrent, you know. Maybe starting there.JW: I mean, this was my mom\u2019s strategy would, we went on TV to talk about Charlottesville. She told all my white relatives that voted for Trump to watch. She didn\u2019t say what we were going to be talking about. She just texted them and said, tune in now. And I said, Mom, what are you doing? And she said, maybe it\u2019s time they heard it from someone they love.MS: That\u2019s as good an answer as I\u2019ve heard.WM: How do you treat this toxicity, and how do you get the unexamined person to examine his or herself? Like how do you treat this?MS: Right. Let me offer one broad association and then a couple ideas. You just really nicely articulated sort of one way to think about what therapy is, which is the study of how people maintain not knowing what they know to be the case. Like, if you put your glasses on your head and you forget they\u2019re there, and you\u2019re searching all around, it\u2019s quite frustrating. But you put them there, so how do you not know that they\u2019re up there? And so, all of us, when we go into therapy, do so because we can\u2019t quite put our finger on something that we want to change. Because if we could, we would have done it. And so, this is one of the really useful values of thinking about things outside of awareness that contribute to repetitive cycles of human suffering. In the American context, the dominant nationalist American narrative is very invested in not knowing what the body politick knows. Which is to say, if you read a high school textbook, it would gloss over the slaughter of tens of millions of indigenous people and the seizure of land. It would gloss of the middle passage, and the slaughter, rape, and murder, forced slavery of millions and millions and millions of fellow human beings of African ancestry. The American narrative is that shining castle on a hill.JW: The medicine is also the poison, right? Like if so much of the sickness is tied up in the way as Americans we\u2019ve come to view the American narrative, and we can\u2019t unlearn, or we\u2019re trying to unlearn what that is \u2014 we\u2019re literally doing that right now with this, this argument over what to do about Confederate statues, right. We can\u2019t even agree that we should rethink the narrative. How do we even start to think about what it means to try to cure that?WM: Right, because I think so much of what we\u2019re talking about is the ways in which identity are bound up in totems of, of nationhood, but then by extension, also selfhood.MS: So, the question is how do we facilitate movement? So, I have a few thoughts. One is self care. I\u2019ll quote the law professor and trans activist Dean Spade here in saying that self care during this time, in this country, is a form of resistance. And increases the likelihood of an equitable distribution of life chances for lots of different kinds of bodies. Many of these kinds of bodies are being explicitly targeted. In order to sustain the long marathon in the pursuit of justice, self care is crucial.JW: How should we be thinking about the larger medical infrastructure that doesn\u2019t facilitate that? Like what are people not getting from their regular medical routines or lifestyles that does imply that we should be taking better care of ourselves, if that makes sense? Or sorry, why are we not conditioned or taught earlier on that taking care of ourselves should be essential?MS: Yeah. I mean, I think many of us, many people are, and then we grow up and the tempo increases and the seductions of materialism are like, rampant. You look at Instagram, you would think that human beings have no sadness, anger, they don\u2019t mourn. They don\u2019t remember. Instagram is \u2014 which is such a potent and useful platform in many instance \u2014 sort of implies that a large portion of the palate of human emotions are not useful, and that if you have them, you\u2019re not on target or something like that. And so, I think there are just endless instances of social messaging that pull us away from our wholeness. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re trying to talk about here, which is like, how are we all able to stay in relationships with one another and be able to be whole? After self care, number two would be other care. So, to quote Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, when you\u2019re feeling helpless, help someone. If we can invert the ways in which we feel marginalized and reach out to a neighbor, that is a meaningful and substantive gesture that in the aggregate have real weight. And I would say number three would be to seek out elders.JW: This is what I do all the time!WM: Very Jenna.MS: The psychotherapeutic community is a wisdom community. I, with regularity, seek out people who know more than I do because I don\u2019t know what to do. I think it\u2019s really useful to interact with people that have a longer time horizon. People don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. We also live in a culture that discards wisdom, in a sense. We don\u2019t venerate elders as we might, and with wisdom \u2014 not even wisdom, but like facts under such assault, which is antithetical to the practice of academic rigor or science or just staying rooted in reality, I think elders can afford some nourishment, and care, and also hugs, if nothing else. Number four, make and consume art and music.JW: It\u2019s perfect.MS: The arts are the pulse of the body politick as I see it. The extent to which you can get a read on how healthy it is, how generative it is able to be with what means and creativity it\u2019s reflecting on its own mind in some sense. And...there needs to transcend, organize, and orient people to new realities. I was thinking about 10,000 people standing around is a mob. One person stands up with a guitar and it\u2019s a concert. And then people are listening. And once you have people\u2019s attention deplored in a direction, the question is, where do you want to go? When we\u2019re talking about how do we sustain a relationship with one another and curate difficult encounters, the arts are an extremely potent form of doing this.JW: I kind of feel like the eclipse was that a little bit, like a very universal piece of art. Like, we were saying earlier, it felt like a ceasefire. People were looking at the crescent shaped shadows and taking pictures of them with a colander. There was so much about that that felt like for the first time in a while, a kind of moment of something greater than ourselves and our weird insignificance in all of it. I don\u2019t know. It was really beautiful to me.WM: I agree with that.JW: I was very moved by that yesterday.MS: That sounds like Mother Nature\u2019s ability to still get us to stop and pause and slow down and just pay attention, which is at its most fundamental, elemental level what we need in some sense, and is always the point of departure for good psychotherapy, which is like, how can we find a place to really been seen as we see each other and to notice what that feels like? Number five \u2014 might be expected \u2014 is therapy\u2019s a good idea.JW: Yes! I tell everyone who asks. I\u2019m like, get thee to therapy.WM: But everyone\u2019s \u2014 go on, sorry. I just, I feel like the barriers to people going have everything to do with the way in which culture depicts therapy. It is depicted as a very bougie thing to do rather than going to the doctor and working on your head and your feelings. And yourself. Your full self.MS: Yeah, I mean, we live in a culture with a lot of barriers to engaging in mental health care. Let\u2019s call it what it is. Mental health care. A major one is stigma, and I\u2019m a big advocate of just destigmatizing as a really normal \u2014 we brush our teeth twice a day, we all eat some food every day, and there\u2019s as many kinds of therapists as there are people, and as many kinds of therapeutic relationships as there are relationships. And as everybody knows, the good ones are life changing, and the bad ones...better to keep it moving.JW: It\u2019s just like dating people. But I will say, I mean, this is part of one of the reasons why we wanted to have you on today, I think if you are someone who is moving through the world and trying to deal with racial trauma, and trying to deal with anxiety or fear over persecution because of your citizenship or lack thereof, or your gender orientation, or your gender identity or your sexual orientation, it\u2019s like, are you going to be able to talk to someone who understands that or has context for that, or are you going to go to someone who...doesn\u2019t know how to talk to you about what a microaggression is, or what it feels like if someone calls you the N word on the subway? I mean, I feel like that \u2014 I know in the course of my having a relationship with lots of different therapists, there are things I selectively tell them and don\u2019t tell them because the fear of a therapist of all people saying, you know, not that they would say this, but a therapist not understanding what it feels like to worry about your safety because you\u2019re black looms large. I mean, that\u2019s a big barrier to entry to, is like, what if I go to this therapist, and they\u2019re like, this is not a real concern?MS: Everything you just said I think is really, really important. When I\u2019m teaching my students at Yale, when I\u2019m working at a clinic, when I\u2019m thinking with friends and colleagues, or when friends and family, people I don\u2019t know, reach out to me for a referral, one of the things I always tell them is to ask about these questions. Hopefully, a therapist will set what\u2019s called a therapeutic frame \u2014 kind of like setting the framework in which they bring the social, economic, political into the conversation. Psychotherapy is at its root \u2014 and a lot has been written about this lately \u2014 a first amendment practice. It\u2019s about free speech. When free speech is possible, it can be a democratizing activity, given other amendments like the 4th amendment, like, you feel safe. So, 1st amendment practices with 4th amendment protections. Anything that gets in the way of being able to lay claim to one\u2019s head and heart and find language to speak to that is going to get in the way of treatment. And so hopefully, good therapists find a way of referencing any kind of difference in the room between them and their clients, and just bringing it up as a topic of conversation that, you know, I notice I\u2019m taller than you or you know, I\u2019m younger than you and you\u2019re older than me. How does this feel? And most of the time, people are like, yeah, I\u2019m fine with it. But you\u2019ve marked the moment, and you have opened the door to say, if at some point you notice you\u2019re having difficulty saying what you want to say, just know that it\u2019s okay \u2014 including if it\u2019s about me, my body, how I\u2019m constituted, and the way it\u2019s impacting you \u2014 and a crucial recognition is that regardless of positive intentions, all of the social, political, and economic dynamics outside of the room may recapitulate in the room. And then, the question is how do we stay in relationship with one another long enough to speak to the truth of that, to bear the feelings that come up and to try to lay claim to our wholeness in one another\u2019s sight? And that is a model of what we need to do nationally. And that can be very painful sometimes. But hopefully, with a good guide, it feels safe enough to go there. And each of us, regardless of whether it feels that way to us in the moment, has an innate capacity to recognize what is more true than not, to be able to utilize reality. And I would suggest there\u2019s a difference between productive discomfort and not productive discomfort. So, being able to have those conversations can really be growth promoting, but a therapist that misses the mark or says something insensitive or leaves a patient feeling unseen, it can really hurt for quite a long time. So, my recommendations to friends, family, whatever, when they\u2019re working with somebody is to call it out. If you feel something, say something.JW: If you feel something, say something. I\u2019m going to write that down.MS: And then see what the therapist does. Therapists usually only run into problems when they feel the need to be right, and when they can\u2019t yield. When they can\u2019t say, oh, yes, the way I look has hurt you. I\u2019m so sorry. That was not my intention. How I\u2019m embodied in this lifetime has made you feel unable to join here with me. I\u2019m so sorry. Let\u2019s try and think about how that happened and in what ways we were collaboratively maintaining some way of not knowing what we were feeling together. How were we doing that together? Does this have any relevance in other relationships in your life? And so on and so forth. I mean, there\u2019s this caricature of you know, the run on therapy that goes forever and ever and ever, but that\u2019s sort of what the American experiment is. Like, how do we have a never ending conversation with people with different commitments and values, and how can we forge something decent together that provides enough for all? We\u2019ll see what happens. I mean, it\u2019s going to depend on who lays claim to it more. And in this context, self care is crucial, because we need to be feeling okay in order to be able to not just react, but act intentionally.JW: That\u2019s perfect. Matt.WM: Thanks for coming on.MS: It is my pleasure.WM: We\u2019re back on my stoop.JW: Dropping you off after work.WM: We have talked about self care, we have talked about seeing a therapist and the importance of therapy, and now I just, I want to put something on my body. I want a sort of bodily tonic or something. So, what can you give me?JW: Okay. So, here\u2019s what I got at the store. And I\u2019ll show it to you. I picked up two new essential oils. I like working with essential oils because they\u2019re very accessible. Obviously we went to a specialty store, but you can buy them anywhere. They have them in any health food store. Most drug stores now carry various types of essential oils, and they\u2019re very simple to work with. Today, I got ginger and I got black pepper.WM: Oooh.JW: Which are unusual, fragrance wise, right? But both work to warm up the body, which will be really nice as we move into fall to kind of keep you warm, keep you focused, keep you active. They both are antibacterial, so if you\u2019re putting it on your body, it\u2019s good. It can help you keep from getting sick.WM: I\u2019d like to smell these in their premixed modes.JW: This is the ginger.WM: Mmm.JW: Spicy, right?WM: It\u2019s very spicy.JW: This is the black pepper oil.WM: It\u2019s very intensely pepper-y, but not in a food way. It does not remind me of anything I put on my food. It\u2019s like...JW: It\u2019s iconic.WM: It\u2019s a separate class of black pepper fragrance.JW: So, basically, what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re just going to take a little bit of the ginger essential oil and a little bit of the black pepper oil, and we\u2019re going to add it to some grapeseed oil and make a little body lotion for you that you can then rub all over yourself. And I like grapeseed oil, but you can use coconut oil, you could use sesame oil, you could use...you know, whatever oil that you happen to have lying around. I just like grapeseed oil because it\u2019s very light and it doesn\u2019t clog my pores. And I\u2019ll give you a little extra on the side, because you can add essential oils to a tea candle, you can add it to a bath, to a diffuser, you can put a little bit in a bottled water and spray it around as a mister. I mean, there are lots of ways you can use essential oils in your lives to imbue your life with whatever properties they have naturally.WM: How should I be feeling? How would you like to be feeling with these on your body?JW: I mean, the basic thing is that we can\u2019t really control what\u2019s happening in the world, and we can\u2019t really control how it makes us feel, but we can control how we care for ourselves. And so, for me, just taking a few moments every morning to just put on a little bit of a body oil that I made, maybe I\u2019m listening to some jazz, maybe I\u2019m having a coffee, it\u2019s just that 30 seconds to a minute of just literal care taking makes all the difference for me in terms of how I move through the world every day.WM: Thank you.JW: You\u2019re welcome.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "Six-Second Commercials Are Coming to N.F.L. Games on Fox", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new kind of advertising is coming to N.F.L. games and other programming on Fox Sports this fall: the six-second television commercial.\u201cWhen the six-second ads are placed in unique positions, it has the potential to gain even more attention than a traditional unit,\u201d Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, said in an interview.N.F.L. fans will first see the ads on Fox on Sept. 10 just before kickoff in the network\u2019s games on the regular season\u2019s opening weekend, and Mr. Shanks said they were also being offered for the World Series and other \u201cmarquee events.\u201d The network is working to integrate them sparingly into some in-game breaks with 15- and 30-second spots; it may also place them through new formats, like in a box adjacent to players on a field during pauses. The hope is that they will eventually help reduce the overall commercial time that people sit through.\u201cSo, for example, if a pitching coach comes to the mound just to have a conversation and you know that conversation is going to last 30 seconds, is a six-second unit in there going to add to the experience and then be able to decrease the amount of ad inventory somewhere else?\u201d Mr. Shanks said.The effort underscores the new strategies that broadcasters are deploying to keep the attention of consumers who often clutch a smartphone or tablet \u2014 or both \u2014 while watching their shows, or avoid ads entirely through Netflix. It\u2019s a major shift from the typical spots that TV networks sell and will put a new burden on marketers to not only attract viewers\u2019 attention but also pitch a product in less time than it takes to read this sentence out loud.On network television, the trend has been toward shorter commercials: In the first half of this year, 36 percent of national TV ads were 15 seconds long while 49 percent lasted 30 seconds, Nielsen data shows. In 2014, 29 percent of ads were 15-second spots, while 61 percent were 30 seconds long.Part of the network\u2019s pitch with the Teen Choice Awards was the messaging around the shorter commercials, such as telling viewers that their programming would return in less than 30 seconds, then airing several of the short ads. That improved the odds people would stay in their seats while fostering some good will with a quicker interruption.That rationale helped Fox charge roughly as much for the six-second spots on the show as it did for 15-second ads, according to people familiar with the negotiations, and reduced the program\u2019s overall commercial time.Similarly, Fox has been able to maintain the premium for the six-second ads it is selling now by pointing to lucrative placements, like just before kickoff for an N.F.L. game, the people said. While the ads are being sold as part of broader packages, a six-second spot could cost, at the high end, around $200,000, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s a long enough amount of time to actually tell a story, whether it\u2019s to convey an emotion or deliver a product message or a piece of news, and yet short enough that the consumer is not irritated by being forced to watch an ad,\u201d said Tara Walpert Levy, vice president of agency and media solutions at YouTube and Google.Mr. Marchese is aware of the challenges but unperturbed. \u201cThe brands and agencies that are able to buy these new models, not stuck in legacy-only buying structures, will be the ones that get to take advantage,\u201d he said in an email.Dave Penski, who oversees media investments as chief executive of Publicis Media Exchange Americas, said that while six-second ads might not work for brands aiming to sell complicated products, he anticipated interest from large sports advertisers that want to reinforce longer messages or simply remind consumers about already recognizable goods.\u201cIt\u2019s an innovation that\u2019s more cross-screen than others because there\u2019s already, certainly in the digital world, a huge amount of six-second advertising that\u2019s going on out there,\u201d he said.Dave Campanelli, who oversees video investments at Horizon Media, an ad-buying firm, said he would explore Fox Sports\u2019s six-second TV ads but was skeptical that the unit would become a new standard, partly because of the constraints around crafting messages of that length.He agreed, though, that broadcasters needed to find more ways to shorten commercial breaks and the number of brands featured there.\u201cWith so many different ways to record and fast-forward, or look at your phone during the commercial break and not pay attention, or just change the channel, that\u2019s hurt commercial retention and hurt commercial viewership,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaying with pods and commercialization will definitely change over time and become a bigger piece of what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "War Is Hell? In New Military Dramas, It\u2019s One-Dimensional", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cPeople don\u2019t want boots on the ground, so this is what war is now,\u201d he says.The military may be having a TV moment, but as Captain Gallo says in \u201cValor,\u201d these shows assume that the public doesn\u2019t want a deep engagement. Instead, they present combat as a quick-hit operation. War may be hell, but this fall it\u2019s just another action-drama genre.The common response to the announcement of these series last spring was that they were a network pander to \u201cTrump\u2019s America.\u201d But while they may well land differently in the political climate of 2017, they could have as easily been aired in the Obama or Bush administrations. (At least judging by the rough-cut pilots, which could change before airing.)There\u2019s nothing specifically Trumpian about the shows\u2019 premises or tones. While Muslim terrorists are prominent, for instance, the shows conspicuously avoid any West-vs.-the-world clash-of-civilizations framing. They\u2019re cast multiculturally and multiracially; \u201cThe Brave,\u201d like \u201cSix,\u201d includes Muslim soldiers in its special-operations unit.And each series tries to balance the red meat of shootouts and explosions with the vegetables of network-TV moralizing. In the pilot of \u201cThe Brave,\u201d a soldier dismisses Doctors Without Borders workers in Syria as \u201cbleeding hearts\u201d who don\u2019t get that \u201cit\u2019s just too dangerous to try and help people over here.\u201d His comrade, a devout Christian, replies that \u201cGod gave us two hands, one to help ourselves, one to help others.\u201dThese series, likewise, have two hands: one to pull the trigger, one to pull back on the jingoism. Rather than a political statement, they seem like an acknowledgment that war has been a constant of American life for a generation.One simple dramatic explanation for this year\u2019s trend may be that this type of combat \u2014 quick strikes by small units \u2014 is made for TV. There\u2019s a small core of characters, high-explosive action and short, defined operations, which lend themselves to weekly episodes the same way police cases do.Like other established genres, military shows have their clich\u00e9s, and even within this small handful there\u2019s a lot of repetition. \u201cSEAL Team\u201d isn\u2019t just about the same unit as \u201cSix\u201d \u2014 it has the same framing device (a flashback to a mission that goes wrong) and similar subplots about the strain on soldiers\u2019 family lives.The plots of the \u201cSEAL Team\u201d and \u201cThe Brave\u201d pilots are head-smackingly similar, down to small details. Both involve a blond, female nongovernmental-organization worker being abducted by Muslim extremists. In each, the unit has to decide between rescuing the hostage and targeting a terrorist leader.The twist in \u201cThe Brave,\u201d such as it is, is that the focus is divided between special forces on the ground and the intelligence officers back home (led by an officer played by Anne Heche) directing the mission by satellite link. The success of the show may depend on how compelling you find videochat sessions.\u201cValor\u201d stands out, if only for having a slightly different premise \u2014 it too starts out with a covert operation gone wrong, but that sets up an ongoing story line about a cover-up and conflicting loyalties. This being CW, the soldiers are also young, hot and quick to show off their battle scars, among other flesh.There\u2019s also a world of stories to be done about military families, who have been represented only sporadically on TV. The \u201cSEAL Team\u201d pilot gives this cursory attention: Will Jason Hayes (David Boreanaz) make it home in time for his daughter\u2019s music recital?Its ambition is much different, obviously, from escapist special-forces dramas. Those series have a commercial interest in selling their subject \u2014 like the old recruiting ads did \u2014 as not just a job but an adventure. \u201cThe Vietnam War\u201d is a much broader story of how one decision after another turned a small commitment of advisers into a generation-defining catastrophe.But the documentary is an ever-timely reminder of the consequences of buying into the Hollywood idea that war can be limited, surgical and over with in about an hour with commercials.Advertisement"}

It was, in fact, an upscale model, and when I used it, I felt certain my teeth were not only getting cleaner and whiter but also perhaps even better aligned. And yet, my old manual toothbrush, poking out of a mug on the vanity, beckoned. One night, as I wearily approached the sink, I realized the last thing I wanted to experience was the frantic whir of yet another spinning gizmo. I plucked out the old-timey toothbrush instead, and never looked back.I deliberately downgraded.Over the past few years, as my work life has accelerated at boggling speed, my personal life has begun creeping backward toward the 20th century.

These incremental lifestyle downgrades help calibrate a rate of technological change that might otherwise produce a resting state of whiplash. They let me catch my breath.Even the highest-tech among us seem to feel this need: Digital tweens lust after manual typewriters while techies embrace Maker culture on weekends. People want to use more of their hands than just their thumbs, to get them dirty and scrub them clean afterward.This requires occasionally putting down the smartphone. According to a 2017 study by the American Psychological Association, more Americans are employing \u201ctechnology usage management strategies\u201d such as banning cellphones from the dinner table (depressingly, only 28 percent of people do this), taking occasional \u201cdigital detoxes\u201d and forbidding devices during family time.My personal mode of self-restraint is to always carry my phone when I\u2019m not with my kids and always leave it in another room when I am. The kids themselves don\u2019t get phones at all. When my 12-year-old daughter walks home from school without one, I intentionally have no idea where she is, just like nobody knew where kids were when I was growing up. How rare it is these days not to be able to know something.Though we are a forward-looking people, Americans are also quite good at nostalgia. We understand that the economy, the technology, the culture, the media are relentlessly pushing forward (\u201cThe March of Time!\u201d), yet a streak of Luddite backwardness persists. This tendency is aided and abetted by an ancient technology, the book. Each season seems to have its stop-the-world best seller. In the mid-1990s it was Elaine St. James\u2019s \u201cSimplify Your Life.\u201d In the mid-aughts, \u201cThe Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.\u201d At the end of the last decade, it was the sweaty toolbox of \u201cShop Class as Soulcraft.\u201d Most recently, it was the minimalist Marie Kondo\u2019s book about tidying and the sensibly titled \u201cOverwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time,\u201d a book I may one day have time to read.Why this yearning? In recent years, a number of studies have documented the effects of techno-stress \u2014 the psychological and physical impact of spending countless hours staring at a screen. According to the 2017 A.P.A. study, on a typical workday, 85 percent of people are constantly or often digitally connected (by email, text and social media). On their days \u201coff\u201d? It\u2019s nearly the same: 81 percent.This turns out not to be soothing. According to the A.P.A. study, nearly half of millennials worry about the negative effects of social media on their physical and mental health. Often for good reason. A 2017 survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 66 percent of Americans have witnessed online harassment and 41 percent have experienced it themselves.When I watch kids giggling at their phones rather than at one another or families in the local diner silently sitting together in front of their respective devices, I can\u2019t help thinking of Pixar\u2019s post-apocalyptic \u201cWALL-E,\u201d a nightmare vision in which earthlings, stripped of their musculature and humanity, recline blobbily in automated loungers, affixed to portable screens whose animated features are all they know of human interaction.And so, I resist. I downgrade, I discard, I decline to upgrade. More than a decade ago, I got rid of cable TV, then network TV. I cut out personal phone calls (unless the person is a continent away), then anything other than businesslike emails. If I want to catch up with a good friend or a family member, I wait until we actually see each other.When the pop-up window on my computer asks if I\u2019d like to install the latest version of this or that, unless it\u2019s for security reasons, my response is, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Nor do I want that \u201camazing\u201d new app. My mother \u2014 yes, my mother \u2014 knew about Lyft before I did. I\u2019ve never tried whatever Spotify is, preferring the radio and ye olde compact discs. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d still be using a CD Walkman if I\u2019d ever gotten one to begin with.Never got a Nook, a Kindle, an iPad, don\u2019t want them. Until quite recently, I thought Alexa was a joke, a wild, hypothetical Orwellian item that might one day be foisted upon the world, not something that anyone might actually desire, pay for and willingly allow into her home.Forced to buy a laptop in order to work on the train, I had to consider the latest models, so swift, so dynamic, they might leap into your backpack lest you accidentally forget to tuck one in yourself. In the end, I let my husband pick out the sleekest, most enlightened version for himself, while I took his four-year-old model, one his own mother had rejected as a relic from another geological age.Do I slip up? Do I email unnecessarily? Have I found myself frantically texting something inconsequential from a beautiful outdoor setting surrounded by impatient children and adults making the same judgy how-could-you-be-doing-that face I so often make myself? I have. But I feel bad about it.Pamela Paul is the editor of the Book Review.Advertisement"}

Lampert, Sears borrowed heavily to buy back shares. But Mr. Lampert also appears to be building a moat around his investment. Last year, Sears sold much of its property to another publicly traded company, Seritage Growth Properties. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage. The move meant that Sears had to pay rent on real estate it once owned, to the benefit of Seritage investors.Some analysts say that it is now almost inevitable that, in spite of fixes that Sears is pursuing in its stores, the company is eventually destined for Chapter 11.\u201cThere has been a long, steady sale of assets to the point where the cupboard is pretty bare,\u201d said Ken Perkins, the president of the research provider Retail Metrics.Netflix\u2019s announcement early Monday that it had secured Ms. Rhimes, the creator of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d to an exclusive deal took a key creative force away from ABC, which is owned by Disney.\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal\u201d will stay at ABC, as will some shows already in development, like a \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff.

{"Headline": "Crunchyroll Cultivates a Streaming Community With a Novel Idea: Film Screens", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingStreaming services that specialize in genre are highly invested in the communities that attach to them. Recently they\u2019ve been experimenting with enticing their audiences the old-fashioned way, by showing their programs in movie theaters before offering them on their sites.The 370-seat AMC Empire was about three-quarters full by the time the lights went down, and sitting through Crunchyroll Movie Night was very distinct from almost every other public film screening I\u2019ve been to in the past decade or even more. For most of the screening, except for the soundtrack of the show itself, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.\u201cBride\u201d has what you might call a humdinger of a premise: It begins with a teenage girl, Chise, in chains, being sold as a slave to a very tall individual with a human body and an antelope\u2019s skull and horns for a head. This character is a magus, and he sees in Chise what others do not \u2014 that she possesses great magical power.The initial episodes have the magus protecting Chise from impish fairies, taking her to a dragon-populated Iceland and introducing her to colleagues in the magic arts. The series follows a convention common in manga: When the characters are angry, or act awkwardly, or crack bad jokes, they are rendered as caricatures of themselves. These provided the laughs in the story, and the audience at Crunchyroll Movie Night responded with enthusiastic good humor. Otherwise, attentive silence.A couple of days before the event, Crunchyroll\u2019s chief operating officer, Colin Decker, told me that the site was created in 2006 by American software engineers who were also anime fans, and who wanted to create a way to access brand-new anime from Japan without resorting to piracy.Now, he said, Crunchyoll is the \u201clargest international distributor of anime.\u201d The site-app has more than one million paid subscribers and over 20 million registered users. A good deal of its content can be accessed for free, with ads, and at a resolution of 480p; there are two levels of premium subscriptions, one for $6.95 a month and another at $11.95, both of which eliminate ads and feature high-definition 720p and 1080p.The simulcasting model is currently the most vibrant part of Crunchyroll\u2019s programming, and getting the material out as quickly as possible for the international audience is a challenge. But fans have turned out to be a big help, Mr. Decker said.\u201cWe reached out to fans and found many of our subtitling people from the fan community, and they make sure the translations are as accurate as possible, and that titling is done as quickly as possible.\u201d That translation is a tall order for a site that subtitles its content in seven languages (and two dialects of Spanish).While I was interested in the site\u2019s Movie Night initiative, I was also curious about whether Crunchyroll would add more feature-film fare, particularly classic anime, to the site. Mr. Decker, who once taught film at Harvard, said that \u201chistorical material is something I\u2019m very interested in.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re looking at producing some documentaries about landmarks in anime,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking around and saying \u2018Someone\u2019s got to do this!,\u2019 and then it turns out that someone has to be us.\u201dAs for Crunchyroll Movie Night, Mr. Decker said that the service doesn\u2019t have ambitions for certain kinds of expansion. \u201cWe are not getting into theatrical distribution,\u201d he said emphatically \u2014 as if pre-emptively dodging a bullet.It\u2019s Crunchyroll\u2019s scale \u2014 big, but not too big, like that of Shudder \u2014 as well as its genre specialization that enables it to address its subscribers as a community rather than as a market. Which is why you\u2019ll probably never see Netflix Movie Night.An article last Sunday about the streaming service Crunchyroll misidentified Colin Decker\u2019s position at the company. He is chief operating officer, not chief executive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back-to-School Clothes, Back in the U.S.S.R.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesWhen summer winds down and my teenage daughter gets ready to start the new school year, she and I go through a ritual. I open her closet and take things out. She wrinkles her nose, rolls her eyes and ignores me, her eyes firmly glued to a screen. I pile clothes on her bed, taking them off hangers or rescuing them from drawers filled to such capacity that opening them is a challenge. She takes her eyes off Instagram for a moment, and says:\u201cMother, I don\u2019t want to go through this now. Can\u2019t we do it another day?\u201dI keep going.Eventually she sighs a great, big sigh, puts away her phone and joins me. The process of separating clothes into three piles begins. One for charity, another one for the local second-hand-sale Facebook group, and yet another for out-of-season storage (we live in Europe, where our closets are too small to hold several seasons worth of clothes). It\u2019ll take us a couple of hours to go through all of her stuff, but for me, it\u2019s not work. It\u2019s a welcome bonding experience that pulls my daughter away from her usual pursuits: maintaining her Snapchat streaks, talking with friends on WhatsApp and bingeing on recent Netflix releases.When I was a teenager, my mother and I also often bonded over clothes \u2014 but in a very different way.I grew up in Moscow in the Soviet era, and my peers and I despised the apparel churned out at the time by the planned Soviet economy. Constantly on the hunt for foreign-made clothes, we spared no time, effort or ingenuity to find a pair of pants, a dress or a blouse that didn\u2019t look as if it came off the conveyor belt in the textile center Ivanovo. We saved money to purchase them on the black market, begged to borrow them from classmates fortunate enough to have parents who traveled to Warsaw Pact countries, or \u2014 in my case \u2014 made them ourselves.In 1980s Moscow, the fashion magazine BurdaModen \u2014 a German monthly \u2014 was second only in popularity to bootlegged tapes of Vladimir Vysotsky, Russia\u2019s outspoken bard. Smuggled in by those lucky enough to travel abroad, each issue that made it behind the Iron Curtain created a fury of organizing activity in the Soviet workplace. At the Economic Institute where my mother worked on generating five-year plans and at the state gas company, Gazprom, where my father designed pipelines, a sheet of paper made the rounds as soon as the new issue of Burda came into someone\u2019s possession. By the end of the day that paper was full of names of co-workers desperate to borrow the magazine. With access to its pages limited to just a couple of days for each person on the list, we quickly replicated patterns that caught our eye and then passed it to the next fortunate soul.My mother and I pored over the magazine the very night she brought it home. We discussed silhouette lines, we considered the potential ease or difficulty of the job, and we estimated the availability of compatible cloth in the empty Soviet stores. In the end, with the decision made on what was to be my next skirt or my next pair of pants, I copied the patterns from Burda onto the old front pages of Moskovsky Komsomolets, the daily newspaper of Moscow\u2019s Komsomol chapter.My mother, meanwhile, scouted the city for fabric on her lunch breaks. If the magazine model wore plaid, she had to find plaid. If it was stripes, she looked for stripes. If polka-dot seemed in style, she crisscrossed the city searching for polka-dot. Occasionally someone would buy the same fabric for the same Burda pattern and later we\u2019d run into each other on the metro, dressed as if we had stood in the same queue at GUM, Moscow\u2019s central department store, to partake in a rare apparel shipment from one of our Eastern Bloc allies.Once my mother and I started each new sewing project, we worked on it for days, stealing an hour or two during the week from homework and housework and teaming up with my grandmother on the weekends. To the hum of the sewing machine and the squeak of our old scissors, I learned to spread the fabric flat on the kitchen table, pin the pattern to it and trace it with chalk. I practiced eyeballing a one-centimeter margin when cutting it out and I mastered threading and rethreading our clunky Tula, the Soviet-made sewing machine. Each fitting brought me closer to finishing a blouse meant for the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, to putting final touches on the sarafan destined for the spring dance, and to owning the pants I wore on my first date with a boy I liked.While we worked, we talked: about fashion, about school, about the demise of the latest Politburo leader, and about which banned samizdat book we were reading. We drank tea: sometimes with jam, conserved the summer before by my grandmother, and sometimes with my mother\u2019s famous sharlotka, or apple cake. When we finished a garment \u2014 several fittings and often weeks later \u2014 I ironed it and hung it in my closet along with our previous creations. Then I wore it day in and day out. There was no rule that stipulated a daily change of clothes in the Soviet Union. We didn\u2019t own enough garments to warrant that.It\u2019s now been over 30 years since I last traced a pattern or basted a seam. I no longer own a sewing machine and most of my clothes come off sale racks at the local Zara. When I want a skirt hemmed or a pair of pants taken in I go to a tailor. My only connection with needle and thread is an occasional sock that needs mending or a button that has to be reattached. Unfortunately my daughter doesn\u2019t even know how to do that. With cheap clothes readily available in our neighborhood, teaching her to make her own didn\u2019t seem essential. I never showed her how to sew.She knows how to shop, though. Every year she declares that she needs to overhaul her closet and disappears into Pull&Bear, her favorite store. There she assembles the styles she\u2019s seen and liked either on the streets of Madrid, on television or among her friends. Rather than planning each outfit, buying the fabric and stitching the garments, her new wardrobe quickly materializes in shopping bags. But the concept is the same: She cares about controlling the image she presents to the world just as I did at that age.She\u2019s excited about each new item, but clothes don\u2019t mean nearly as much to her as they did to me as a teenager.Yet they do their job: My daughter and I talk while we sort, and once every season I can count on her closet to guarantee some together time.Margarita Gokun Silver is a writer and an artist living in Madrid.Advertisement"}

[Angela and I] may not have intercourse but the relationship is very strong, communication is better, and it\u2019s actually a lot more peaceful and loving.What statement are you trying to make?There are so many broken families in this world, and in the African-American culture. But you don\u2019t have to break up your family because you and your partner broke up. You still have to father your children, you still have to communicate, you still have to grow your family together.

He helped us to dream, to look at life, look at poverty, look at education and try to better ourselves. To say that that show didn\u2019t affect me would be a lie. But to say that the allegations against him didn\u2019t affect me would be a lie as well. What I\u2019ve learned in my life is I have a lot of imperfections but I would hope that people can extract whatever good I have and the rest you throw away. After parodies like \u201cFifty Shades of Black,\u201d why \u201cNaked\u201d?\u201cNaked\u201d was a chance for me to do a romantic comedy because, believe it or not, I\u2019m trying to transition into a leading man. I forget that I\u2019ve got dramatic skills, and it\u2019s good to flex those muscles. I want to do things that not only make you laugh but make you feel and think.You\u2019re a younger brother to Keenen, Damon and Shawn. Are you positioning yourself to break free from their legacy?I look at the Wayans as a great institution, as a wonderful tribe of talented artists who love, love, love comedy. I\u2019ll be a Wayans forever at heart and in spirit. I just want to carry my own torch into the darkness and find Marlon.Advertisement"}

A blind mentor to the superhero Daredevil, he wields a sword with such lightning-fast intensity that heads roll with their eyes still blinking.Offscreen Mr. Glenn, 78, is his own brand of daredevil \u2014 a freak-of-nature, ramrod-erect warrior of ripped muscle, steely sinew and nonexistent body fat who skis, hikes, races motorcycles and open-water spear fishes in the Pacific.Mr. Glenn first came to Anderson\u2019s last winter with the goal of learning his comic-book character\u2019s killer moves by way of kali, a Filipino martial art that traditionally uses knives and sticks but can turn everyday objects like umbrellas and car keys into lethal weapons.\u201cIt\u2019s more than a martial art; for me it\u2019s a philosophy,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cAnd that philosophy is Accept and embrace and become really good at what works for you, and reject what doesn\u2019t work for you and get rid of it.\u201dAfter stretching, Mr. Glenn met Mr. Anderson \u2014 whom he calls Sifu Dan, meaning \u201cmaster,\u201d out of respect and affection \u2014 on the mat.As Mr. Anderson counted from one to nine, Mr. Glenn practiced a two-knife movement called \u201cdefanging the snake\u201d on Mr. Anderson\u2019s protected forearm, before attempting a feigned stab or slice in a vulnerable body part like the armpit, the jugular or the groin.When creating a routine for the actor, Mr. Anderson considers Mr. Glenn\u2019s \u201cbody geometry,\u201d which dictates his range of movement, as well as his age, his speed and his left-handedness. He also works in a few \u201chigh-percentage movements\u201d that can prove debilitating or even fatal if necessary in real life.\u201cMartial arts builds the mind, the body, and the spirit,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThe mind becomes very strong just from a memory standpoint. And holy moly, he moves like a 20-year-old kid.\u201dMr. Glenn began to dabble in martial arts at the age of 9 to rebuild a body left gaunt by scarlet fever. It was around that same vulnerable age that Mr. Anderson, now 42, started learning martial arts for self-defense after being relentlessly bullied as one of two Asian-American children (the other was his sister) in his small Arkansas hometown.Mr. Anderson earned certification under Dan Inosanto, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Lee, and then founded the academy in 1996. The 6,000-square-foot, two-room gym also offers classes in muay thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and kettlebell kickboxing, a method developed by Dasha Anderson. There are also martial arts classes for children.Mr. Glenn practices his knife skills each day, whether he\u2019s at his permanent residence in Idaho; on location in Massachusetts, where he is shooting \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d Hulu\u2019s coming Stephen King-J.J. Abrams anthology; or on set in New York, where, in addition to the knife routine, he\u2019ll complete a 100-rep workout of push-ups, chin-ups and assorted flies and curls in the gym of his Battery Park building.\u201cAt my age, I know absolutely that when I do that, the next two days I\u2019m going to feel like I was hit by a train,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m going to wake up in the morning and feel almost nauseous and not want to work out, so I\u2019ll do patterns with knives. I know there will be one hard workout day, two bad days and then I\u2019ll feel phenomenal.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to wonder why Mr. Glenn would train so hard at an age more associated with golf and water aerobics. \u201cNow, I could say I do it because I\u2019m an actor and this is all I\u2019ve got,\u201d he continued, pointing to his body. \u201cI\u2019m the inventory, the display window, this is it. And if I can\u2019t play this part, I don\u2019t get paid.\u201dBut the real answer, he suspects, goes back to his boyhood \u2014 his rib cage protruding, his bones crooked \u2014 when he was mortified by the way he looked and felt.\u201cI think it probably runs that deep, because as old as I am, there\u2019s no real reason why I should go to the gym and beat myself up,\u201d Mr. Glenn said.\u201cBut this place on the other hand answers a deep appetite for me,\u201d he added, grinning as he pulled on a cap that read \u201cJeet Kune Do Is Everything.\u201d\u201cThis is huge fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crowded TV Marketplace Gets Ready for Three Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has more than $1 billion budgeted for original programming, Facebook wants its own version of \u201cScandal\u201d and Google is ready to spend up to $3 million per episode on a drama.The three digital giants have signaled to Hollywood that they are serious about entering a television landscape that Netflix and Amazon shook up just a few years ago. Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.With the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.That budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201dMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.It is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.But as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.And while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.It has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.Unlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.YouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.Although Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine. Originally, YouTube and its subscription YouTube Red channel were largely focused on creating bigger budget shows for YouTube stars.Data searches, Mr. Kyncl said, provided a \u201cwindow into the demand of Hollywood product on YouTube.\u201d\u201cWhy not fulfill this demand?\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes absolute sense.

{"Headline": "How Disney Wants to Take On Netflix With Its Own Streaming Services", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company, under pressure to address threats to its vast television business, unveiled its answer on Tuesday: two Netflix-style streaming services.\u201cI would characterize this as an extremely important, very, very significant strategic shift for us,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. Underscoring the need for Mr. Iger to reposition his company for growth, Disney reported a slight decline in revenue and a 9 percent drop in net income.Disney\u2019s move online could put the company in conflict with Netflix, which will lose access to new Disney and Pixar films, and with cable providers, which pay Disney handsomely for the right to distribute ESPN and other channels. Mr. Iger said Disney had not yet talked to cable providers. He added, however, that he had \u201call the confidence in the world\u201d in Disney\u2019s ability to maintain favorable deals with them.The ESPN streaming service will arrive early next year, Mr. Iger said. It will include baseball, hockey, tennis and college sports \u2014 about 10,000 regional and national events in its first year. Users will be able to access the service through an enhanced version of ESPN\u2019s current app, which includes news, highlights and scores. People who pay to receive ESPN the old-fashioned way (via a cable or satellite provider) will be able to access standard ESPN programming through the same app.Mr. Iger said Disney had lately noticed \u201ca dramatic increase in app-based media consumption,\u201d and not just for its own offerings.Disney will also offer a separate entertainment-oriented streaming service. (With traditional cable hookups, people are usually forced to pay for sports channels even if they do not watch them.) It will arrive in 2019 and provide exclusive access to new Disney films, including a sequel to \u201cFrozen,\u201d a live-action version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d (Netflix currently has rights to new Disney-branded films; Disney will take back those rights.)The Disney-branded entertainment service will also include a vast amount of library content, including movies and television programming from Disney Channel, Disney Junior and Disney XD. Mr. Iger said that Disney would also make a \u201csignificant\u201d investment in original movies and shows for the service, which will not have advertising.Mr. Iger said that Disney had not decided whether to include films from its Marvel and Lucasfilm (\u201cStar Wars\u201d) labels, in part because of their different fan bases.\u201cIt\u2019s possible we will continue to license them to a pay service like Netflix, but it\u2019s premature to say,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been talk about launching a proprietary Marvel service and \u2018Star Wars\u2019 service.\u201d He added, however, that Disney was cautious about stand-alone services for those film brands, in part because a large amount of content would be needed to satisfy subscribers.Disney declined to say how much subscriptions would cost. Mr. Iger said the goal was a price low enough to encourage widespread adoption but not so low that it would cannibalize traditional cable and satellite subscriptions. In the past, Mr. Iger has hinted about a \u201cdynamic\u201d model, with viewers able to pay based on how much they want to watch.In some ways, Disney is late to this party. CBS, for instance, introduced a direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service in 2014. But Disney is a media superpower, and its decision to aggressively pursue streaming could speed the entertainment industry\u2019s adoption of the platform.\u201cNo one is better positioned to lead the industry into this dynamic new era,\u201d Mr. Iger said, noting his company\u2019s trove of popular content and unrivaled connection to its audience \u2014 particularly children, who are a huge driver for streaming services.Meantime, cord-cutting continues to affect ESPN. Traditional subscriptions declined 3.5 percent in the most recent quarter; in the year-ago period, ESPN had a 2 percent decline.For its fiscal third quarter, the company had a profit totaling $2.37 billion, or $1.51 a share, compared with $2.6 billion or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. Disney had revenue of $14.2 billion in the quarter, down slightly from a year earlier.Adjusting for a one-time charge related to a legal settlement, Disney had per-share earnings of $1.58 in the most recent quarter. Analysts had expected $1.55.Among the biggest challenges for Disney in the quarter were costs at ESPN, which recorded about $400 million in incremental expenses because of a new contract with the National Basketball Association. As a result, operating income at Disney Media Networks, which includes ESPN, fell to $1.84 billion, a 22 percent decline.Expenses also increased at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, which opened an attraction in Florida based on \u201cAvatar\u201d and brought one of the Disney cruise ships in for refurbishment. But the theme park unit nonetheless reported an 18 percent increase in operating income, to $1.17 billion, because of the timing of the Easter holiday and improved results at overseas parks, including Disneyland Paris.Disney\u2019s movie studio had a difficult quarter. Its operating income fell 17 percent, to $639 million, because of a lineup of films that could not match last year\u2019s highs. In the most recent quarter, Disney released \u201cCars 3,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201d In the year-ago quarter, the studio\u2019s blockbusters included \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Disney\u2019s Move to Streaming, a New Era Begins", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Disney set off a sonic boom in Hollywood by unveiling plans to start two Netflix-style services: For the first time in the streaming age, the world\u2019s largest media company had decided that embracing a new business model was more important than clinging to its existing one.Disney\u2019s decision to better align itself with consumer trends \u2014 deemed \u201ca rare and impressive pivot\u201d by RBC Capital Markets \u2014 instantly reverberated through the entertainment industry. Disney\u2019s cable channels, which include ESPN, have long been seen as the reason many viewers were refraining from cutting the cord entirely. If Disney was going all in on streaming, the impact would be felt by almost every television company and cable operator.As part of its announcement on Tuesday, Disney said that it would spend heavily on original programming for its entertainment streaming service and pull future Disney and Pixar movies from Netflix. That sent Netflix shares downward. The question seemed to be, how would Netflix, even with its head start in terms of audience and reach, manage without the mighty mouse? And would Disney\u2019s plunge into streaming encourage the likes of Discovery and Viacom to do the same, intensifying competition?And would viewers who want to eschew traditional cable subscriptions eventually find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of streaming services they would need to cobble together to watch what they wanted to watch?On Wednesday, as analysts and investors scratched for answers, few firm ones emerged. In a research report, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, summed up Disney\u2019s streaming plans, especially for movies and television, as \u201caggressively\u201d pushing \u201cthe traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dDisney investors may also be worried about the enormous spending it will take to build two streaming services. Some might have been underwhelmed by the company\u2019s plans or might have thought that the decision came much too late.\u201cWhat Disney is doing is a really big deal in terms of trying new things, and I don\u2019t think it even has answers to some of these questions, including what the services will cost,\u201d said Michael Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and digital video consultancy. \u201cBut it\u2019s clearly not the end of linear television. It\u2019s not the end of Netflix.\u201dBut this still-unnamed subscription service is designed to protect the cable bundle, at least initially. The service will offer only sports programming that is not available on ESPN\u2019s traditional channels. Only people who also pay to receive ESPN the old-fashioned way (via a cable or satellite hookup) will be able to stream ESPN\u2019s core offerings, including N.F.L. and N.B.A. games.Mr. Iger has also made an important calculation that Disney \u2014 unlike most of its competitors \u2014 has programming that is must-have in the old model (cable and satellite) and in the new (streaming). Put another way, Disney has the power to introduce streaming offerings around ESPN, Pixar films and Disney Channel shows without worrying about being dropped by third-party distributors, including upstarts like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue.PlayStation Vue, for instance, tried to introduce a \u201cskinny\u201d television package without ESPN in March 2015 and drew little consumer interest. When PlayStation Vue started offering ESPN in spring 2016, the distributor quickly started gaining traction.Disney\u2019s announcement had an immediate impact on Netflix, as the news media raced to pit the two companies against each other, and some investors worried about Disney taking back its movies. (Starting in late 2019, new-release Disney and Pixar films will move to Disney\u2019s entertainment-focused streaming service.) On Wednesday, Netflix shares declined 1.5 percent, to $175.78.Omar Sheikh, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Disney\u2019s move \u201carguably reduces the consumer value of Netflix.\u201dBut most analysts contended that the news was less worrisome for Netflix than it would initially seem. \u201cWe don\u2019t view this as a strike at Netflix, as the content being pulled is actually rather limited,\u201d said Mr. Creutz of Cowan and Company.Disney has not yet decided whether to pull its Marvel or \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies from Netflix. Netflix will not lose access to Marvel-branded television shows like \u201cThe Defenders\u201d because Netflix is a co-producer of them.Executives at Disney and Netflix declined to comment publicly on Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Netflix said, \u201cWe continue to do business with the Walt Disney Company on many fronts, including our ongoing deal with Marvel TV.\u201dNotably, Netflix has been building up a huge original movie operation, including spending the $90 million \u201cBright,\u201d a forthcoming Will Smith movie. Netflix plans to start making as many as 50 of its own movies annually.BamTech, which Disney plans to use as the backbone of its streaming services, has substantial operations. But Disney faces a steep learning curve. By the time Disney even introduces its entertainment-based service in 2019, Netflix will have about 64 million subscribers in the United States and 158 million worldwide, according to BTIG Research.Disney would probably contend that Netflix\u2019s head start is irrelevant.\u201cIt\u2019s high time we got in this business,\u201d Mr. Iger told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cThe profitability, the revenue-generating capability of this initiative is substantially greater than the business models we\u2019re currently being served by.\u201dIn the end, there was only one aspect of Disney\u2019s move that everyone seemed to agree on: The streaming boom is only beginning.The race for streaming supremacy, Mr. Creutz said, \u201cmay well accelerate problems for the whole ecosystem via atomization of content and an overpopulation of content apps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

PBS said it had not made a decision about broadcasting Ms. Berry\u2019s new projects.An article on Aug. 12 about casting and other changes to \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d referred incorrectly to efforts to reach Love Productions, which created the program.

These little endorsements can reach a much larger audience than an interview with the author on a popular television show or a rave review in a major newspaper. \u201cIn previous times, you would have the Oprah or Daily Show bump,\u201d says Todd Doughty, the director of publicity at Doubleday. \u201cNow you have the Reese Witherspoon bump from Instagram.\u201dWitherspoon and Ritter are two of several actresses, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Emma Watson, Lena Dunham and Emma Roberts, who share photos of their favorite books with millions of followers on Instagram. While it is difficult to isolate the impact of a social-media post from the other facets of a promotional campaign, nearly all the major publishing houses see these accounts as a way to connect with audiences that would be difficult to reach through the traditional organs of book publicity. Watson\u2019s pictures, for example, go out to 38 million Instagram followers, while an interview on NPR\u2019s popular \u201cFresh Air\u201d radio program reaches about a million listeners. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely something we think about,\u201d says Miriam Parker, an associate publisher at Ecco Books. \u201cWe try to get books to people with big social-media followings and are strategic about it.\u201dA person need not necessarily be a celebrity to attract a publishing house\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat we really look for is people who are a little more niche, who do make sense for a particular title,\u201d says Lydia Hirt, the marketing director at Riverhead Books and Viking Books. Instagram\u2019s director of fashion partnerships, Eva Chen, for example, is not a household name, but she regularly recommends books to her 850,000 followers. \u201cShe\u2019s somebody who absolutely puts books in front of a group of people who may not have normally come across them,\u201d says Cristina Gilbert, the vice president of sales and marketing at Bloomsbury. Chen\u2019s endorsements of young-adult fiction are an unlikely pairing with her carefully composed photographs of beauty products, handbags and designer shoes \u2014 which is exactly what makes them so valuable to book publicists, who might struggle to reach her audience through more traditional outreach. Other book publicists have received promotional boosts from the comedian Patton Oswalt on Twitter and the fashion designer Zac Posen on Instagram.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Names New President", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood has a new de facto mayor: John Bailey, a cinematographer, who was elected to a one-year term as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Tuesday night.But Mr. Bailey will serve as the public face of an institution that faces an array of challenges.Most of all, Mr. Bailey will be expected to serve as a voice on the topics of race and gender \u2014 two things few people in Hollywood want to discuss in the open, largely because the entertainment industry has such a long history of exclusion.Ms. Hudson and Ms. Boone Isaacs often clashed, with Ms. Boone Isaacs seen as taking a more conservative approach to academy affairs. Whether Mr. Bailey will have a better working relationship with Ms. Hudson is unknown. He has been on the academy\u2019s board for 14 years, recently serving as a vice president. He has never been nominated for an Oscar.His election represents a victory for the academy\u2019s less-visible contingent of \u201cbelow the line\u201d artists \u2014 those who are not actors, writers, directors or producers \u2014 many of whom have felt overlooked in Hollywood.Under the academy\u2019s sometimes stuffy rituals, board members are not allowed to openly seek the job of president. But whisper campaigns are rampant, and most Hollywood insiders had expected the actress Laura Dern to be named president. Other contenders included the documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy and David Rubin, a longtime casting director.Mr. Bailey, who received the American Society of Cinematographers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014, will help lead the academy with the assistance of Lois Burwell, an Oscar-winning makeup artist who was elected first vice president. Serving as vice presidents will be Kathleen Kennedy, the Lucasfilm chief; Michael Tronick, a film editor; and Nancy Utley, president of Fox Searchlight.An article on Thursday about the naming of a new president by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences misstated the occupation of Michael Tronick, a vice president of the Academy. He is a film editor, not a music editor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Introduces a Dedicated Home for Videos", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is coming for broadcast television. And YouTube. And Netflix. And every other place for video.On Wednesday, Facebook introduced Watch, a dedicated home for videos in the social network.Watch is a redesign of the site\u2019s current video tab, altered in a way intended to entice people to watch for longer stretches and return regularly to view shows, including the first programs funded by the company. The idea is that when users open Watch, the latest episodes of their favorite shows will be there waiting for them.Facebook is betting that adding a social component to online video consumption \u2014 the ability to chat with people in your network during a show or knowing what\u2019s popular among your friends \u2014 will make the experience notably different from YouTube and Netflix.For example, Watch will highlight different shows under categories such as \u201cMost Talked About\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s Making People Laugh.\u201d Facebook said the videos that will appear in Watch will be pulled from creators and publishers who have created \u201cShow\u201d pages on Facebook \u2014 akin to how some small businesses create a dedicated page.Facebook said the show pages would also provide a way for dedicated fans to interact with the shows\u2019 creators beyond merely watching the episodes.\u201cMore and more people are coming to Facebook with the intention of watching videos,\u201d said Fidji Simo, who leads Facebook\u2019s video efforts. \u201cThis is the next step.\u201dTo encourage more people to create shows for Watch, Facebook said it would expand its video advertisement monetization program, which shares revenue from commercials that appear during videos. Facebook has limited the number of content creators who can take advantage of the program during a testing phase.Many Facebook users see videos only as they scroll past a friend\u2019s wedding photos or a cousin\u2019s political rant, unlike YouTube users who visit that site for the purpose of watching videos. As advertising dollars earmarked for television move online, Facebook is seeking a way to coax its huge audience \u2014 two billion users monthly \u2014 to see it as a destination for video.YouTube has said its mobile viewers watch videos for more than an hour a day on average. Facebook has not disclosed the time its users spend viewing, but it is expected to be much less. The Watch initiative could change that; Facebook said it expects the videos within Watch to be longer than the videos users find in their Newsfeeds.The shows that will appear in Watch are a mix of videos that are already popular on Facebook \u2014 like \u201cNas Daily,\u201d a series that chronicles the travels of a social media star around the world \u2014 and original programs funded by Facebook.Among the shows Facebook is paying for are \u201cReturning the Favor,\u201d a show about inspiring people starring Mike Rowe, who was the host of \u201cDirty Jobs.\u201dWatch will also feature live programming, including one Major League Baseball game a week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still Processing: The Transformation of Dave Chappelle", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStill ProcessingThis summer, Dave Chappelle returned to the stage for an ambitious, monthlong residency at Radio City Music Hall in New York. We saw the show independently, on separate nights. What we witnessed inspired us to dedicate an entire episode to the legacy of Chappelle\u2019s comedy as he works to re-establish his place in American culture. But much has shifted in the decade since Chappelle, through his much-loved TV show, \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d brilliantly explored how black people are represented and misrepresented: Nowadays, he\u2019s no longer interested in speaking on behalf of anyone else. We consider his past to consider where he might be headed and whether we still need comedians \u2014 and comedy, for that matter \u2014 to help us make sense of the present.From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your iPhone or iPad:On your Android phone or tablet:This unedited transcription from the podcast may contain errors. Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it.JW: On today\u2019s show, we\u2019re going to be looking at the canon of Dave Chappelle. His old stuff, his new stuff, some in between stuff \u2014 and just a quick warning, you know, some of this stuff is a little explicit, so enter at your own risk. I\u2019m Jenna Wortham.WM: I\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers for The New York Times.JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology.WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture relates to humans.JW: This is Still Processing.WM: Hi.JW: Hi, Wesley!WM: Nice to not see you at Afropunk this weekend.JW: We didn\u2019t see each other in person, but we were there together psychically.WM: Spiritual conjoinment continues. Um, what\u2019s going on with you?JW: Okay. So, I have a giant jar of coconut oil in my bathroom. That is a personal salve for my body, but it also functions as a weather vane, and guess what? Guess what state it is in right now? It is solid. Summer is coming to an end. I don\u2019t feel good about this. I\u2019m mourning the loss of summer that I felt never fully bloomed. It was a very cool summer for us here in New York.WM: It was a cool summer. It was a cool summer.JW: So, you know, if my coconut oil goes back to liquid in September and October, I\u2019ll be happy. I just hope that this isn\u2019t the end of the warm weather. Numero dos. We were at Afropunk this week, saw Solange again perform. She does this thing where she dresses in all red. Her backup singers and musicians are all in all red. The stage is bathed in red. And I just...I couldn\u2019t even focus on the music, I was just thinking about the color red and what message that is sending. Let me tell you what I found out. So, I already knew that the color red is associated with the root chakra in Ayurvedic medicine. The root chakra is all about our relationship to the earth, our sense of being grounded, but listen to this. The color red is a warm and positive color associated with our most physical needs and our will to survive. It\u2019s all about self preservation. So, my fall wardrobe is going to incorporate a lot of red. Get ready.WM: Oh, really?JW: Yeah. I\u2019m just taking notes from Solange.WM: I\u2019ve seen you wear red maybe one time.JW: Now it\u2019s going to be all red, all the time, so just get ready for it.WM: Number three.JW: And I\u2019m still thinking about Afropunk in general. This year, again, it\u2019s in Brooklyn at Barry Commodore Park. It was very crowded, a little less indie and punk than years past, and some of the acts they brought in were more mainstream, it felt like. Normally, they have like a ton of black punk bands, they have a ton of black hair metal. This year, it was sort of more up and coming like cutesy little acts that we\u2019ve kind of heard, like Willow Smith, SZA, etc., but despite all of that, it still felt like to me a black Burning Man. It\u2019s a place I can go, kind of let my hair down. Basically, it\u2019s like unhooking a bra strap in my brain. I feel like everything just gets to hang out and be a little bit loose and free.WM: Some people were just letting the actual bra strap go. Saw a lot of free boobies.JW: And more power to everyone that let them fly. But one of the best things I saw there was King, which is a three woman band out of Los Angeles. So funkified, so groovy, still so below the radar, I think, but still so much potential and just so \u2014 we should listen to them for a little bit, because they\u2019re so good. But that was three badass black women just jamming on their instruments. Let\u2019s check them out for a second.WM: I will just say, I enjoyed King, but to me what you\u2019re talking about with this indie thing, the spirit of Afropunk to me was coopted by the Solange industry complex, and this sort of very specific kind of R&B. It just seemed...separate from what I think this festival for me was about, which was about outcast black artists who had no marketplace viability whatsoever finding a place to bring other black people who like rock and roll together.JW: Yeah. We\u2019ll table this and we\u2019ll come back to it, because this is a bigger conversation we should have about black musicians, and specifically female musicians because they were all the headlining acts. But anyway, what\u2019s on your list for this week?WM: The VMAs, Video Music Awards, happened on MTV on Sunday, and Taylor Swift debuted her Look What You Made Me Do video, the most passive aggressive pop song I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Nobody\u2019s making Taylor Swift do anything. She\u2019s Taylor Swift! I wasn\u2019t here for any of that. What I was really moved by was Pink, who got the video vanguard award. She doesn\u2019t deserve it for that, her videos are whatever. She does not move the needle in the music video universe, but this is what we got now, because music videos are basically worthless. (Sorry, Taylor Swift.) But I was reminded that among all the shenanigans between whatever\u2019s going on with Taylor Swift and Kanye and Katy Perry, Pink was somebody who was originally sold to us as like, the white Aaliyah.JW: Yes. Yes. Yes. The white Missy Elliott!WM: And they needed something to put forward and they had this white girl who could sing and looked good in a pair of pleather pants. As it turns out, she had other stuff to do, and I think the Pink story is really fascinating to me because she was somebody who was sold to us as a minstrel act, who fought really hard to make the music she wanted to make. She managed to move away from R&B at the point at which R&B was peaking. I mean, it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t have that sound in her music, but she was more in her own self conception a rock artist, and I like that her songwriting was personal and about her own struggles with herself and her demons, and all that other stuff. I, I also love the quality of her voice and her singing. We could play something like Bad Influence from Funhouse...I salute whoever decided to desperately give her something, or give it to her, because she actually deserves it. Dick Gregory died two weeks ago, almost. Really important comedian, was doing stand up comedy about race at a time that it just seemed really dangerous to do. I think by the time we got Dick Gregory, which was, you know, he was a very old man and he seemed curmudgeonly, at least to me, I didn\u2019t receive him as a standup person. I received him as like an elder who had a lot of feelings about what the youth should do. But he was a really, really pioneering standup comedian. I mean, lots of people know this. Here\u2019s Dick Gregory talking about baseball in, I don\u2019t know, the early 1960s.DG: You know, I feel so sorry for Willie. I hate to see any baseball player having trouble. That\u2019s a great sport for my people. That is the only sport in the world where a Negro can shake a stick at a white man and won\u2019t start no riot. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, now. We\u2019re doing all right. At the rate we\u2019re going, ten years from now, you might have to be my color to get a job.WM: That\u2019s Dick Gregory, he\u2019s really great. And the week that he died, I also wound up seeing Dave Chappelle and his big comedy revue, basically, his big music and comedy revue that was at Radio City Music Hall for about three weeks. I had a really good time the night I went, and it was really nice to see Dave Chappelle eventually, because it took almost four hours, or three and a half hours for him to take the stage. But it was great to see him and his ideas about where comedy should go and what comedy is now get worked out. So, let\u2019s just talk about Dave Chappelle.JW: Yes, let\u2019s do it.WM: I mean, we can spend the whole episode just talking about our experiences at the show...JW: Yes. We both went, we had very different but strong reactions to the show.WM: What it means to have him practicing standup comedy after leaving it for as long as he did after...Chappelle Show basically, after it ended. And he quit the show. And...what it means also for him to be practicing standup comedy in 2017 in the different, fraught atmospheres of political correctness and identity politics, and our current presidency, and what\u2019s different about Dave Chappelle now versus what Dave Chappelle was like...JW: Ten years ago.WM: 17 years ago.JW: 17 years ago?WM: 17 years ago, he had an HBO special.JW: It\u2019s been that long?WM: Killing Them Softly!JW: I\u2019m just thinking about the show, but yeah, you\u2019re right. Wow. 17 years.WM: I mean, he got the show because he was a great standup.JW: Okay, well, let\u2019s walk through it. We\u2019ll talk about past, present, and future, basically.WM: Yeah.JW: The Chappelle Show. Still Processing. Let\u2019s do it.WM: Dave Chappelle spent his August in a residency at Radio City Music Hall. So, you got some standup that started the show, then a musical act, then some more standup, and then at the end of the night, Dave Chappelle would come out and perform for about an hour. So, the night I went, I got Donnell Rawlings, who was on Chappelle Show \u2014JW: Oh, I got him too.WM: He\u2019s fantastic. And then Yasiin Bay came out. Then I got Chris Tucker \u2014JW: That\u2019s wild.WM: It\u2019s wild! Wild! Chris Tucker came out and did a thing for like 40 minutes. And then, Jerry Seinfeld comes out. Jerry Seinfeld comes out and everybody flies to their feet, and just the, whaaaaat? Like the instant standing ovation. You\u2019d have thought they said, ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama. He was engaged, and he loved \u2014 it was such a pleasure to watch him enjoy knowing that he was having a great night, and when he left the stage, he took a look at the audience, and he waved. I mean, it was just beautiful. And then Dave Chappelle comes out. And I don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t know what Dave Chappelle was like the night you got in, but I actually liked that he was more interested in storytelling than joke telling.JW: The night I went, the format was a little different. So, Solange performed. We got more of Solange than we did of warm up acts. Both opening sets contained a lot of mimicry of different types of Asian identities with the joke being that they\u2019re all basically indistinguishable from one another. Like, there was a series of jokes about like, what kind of Chinese are you? Vietnamese Chinese or Korean Chinese? Chinese Chinese? Filipino Chinese? And I was just like...shocked. It was a very surreal experience to have that sandwiched...you know, between these like, pretty offensive jokes at the expense of Asian Americans and then this sort of rally cry for black women, and then Chappelle to come out and work through what felt like a midlife crisis. And I walked away so satisfied with the whole experience, but I think I walked away also not sure what Dave is so defensive about. Like so much of his comedy up until now has been him setting the tone of what he\u2019s trying to discuss or being on the offensive, sort of opening up new types of discussion about race. Like, this felt very much, he felt like he had to defend where he is in life, and his views, and the ways in which he hasn\u2019t changed, but the world around him has changed. I thought that was pretty interesting.WM: It was almost like a Socratic dialogue in a sense. He was basically saying, look. Comedy audiences have changed, basically. And the question that he asked the audience was this. Why can\u2019t people hear comedy anymore? What\u2019s the audience\u2019s problem? Because I\u2019m a comedian. My job is to tell jokes. And it seems to me that in the last 20 years, audiences have gotten worse and worse at hearing the jokes. Audiences are so bound up in political correctness or ideas of political correctness and so bound up in defending the territories of their identity that it really puts a comedian who practices the elimination of the boundaries around those things or disrespecting people\u2019s personal sense of sanctity about who they are...JW: Yes. And let\u2019s pause for a quick second, because a lot has changed since the last time Dave was doing this. Namely, the ability for people to respond in real time to his art, and that was best exemplified by what happened when you walked into Radio City Hall. They give you a little bag \u2014WM: They give you a bag.JW: And you have to put your phone in it. They lock it with a special tool. So, you get to hold onto your phone, but you don\u2019t get to access it the whole time. If you want to use it, you\u2019ve got to leave the theater, and you\u2019ve got to go to a special phone zone. They unlock the little bag so you can use it, but then they make you put it back into the bag before you go back in the Music Hall. I thought this was a really interesting tactic. Because on one hand, you can argue, artists are getting tired of audiences consuming things via their cell phones. Holding their phones up, taping stuff, sharing with their friends. I also \u2014 while I understand that, I have to say, at Afropunk, everyone was livestreaming everything. Everyone was taping everything, and I think for me, it really illuminated that, yes, part of it is documentation, people want to brag on social media, people want to share on social media, yes. But also, it\u2019s about accessibility and availability, and Dave Chappelle is someone who is an important comedian. So it makes sense that people would want to parcel out some of the things he\u2019s doing and share it widely. All that said, we were not allowed to have cell phones, and I think that is in big part because he didn\u2019t want people to be live tweeting the show, and he didn\u2019t want people to be taking things that he was saying out of context, which I think he has experienced the negative side of that. Although, honestly, when you see it all in context, it doesn\u2019t make it less offensive.WM: He went on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to talk about, you know, the show and where he\u2019s been, and invite Stephen on to do the show, but then, in his invitation to Stephen Colbert, he offers this bonus, like incitement.DC: We do a thing at the show, we do a thing at my concerts where nobody has their cell phones, so all this you know, comedian witch hunt stuff, it doesn\u2019t happen at my shows. I have a wide margin of error and a lot of crazy things get said and done. It\u2019s an opportunity for artists to really flex their muscles without the fear of the repercussions of the overly sensitive. And we\u2019ve all got to kind of recalibrate our ears a little bit so that we can actually hear each other and understand each other, and I think comedy and music is one of the best ways.JW: So, sure, people can applaud that, okay, but that belies a fundamental misunderstanding about how the world works now. You can\u2019t stop people from commenting on the thing that you\u2019re doing even if you take their phones away.WM: I can\u2019t tell whether the taking away of the phones lets Dave Chappelle feel free to practice the kind of comedy that he wants to practice, or whether it is some sort of ego trip to take away the phones in order for us to...he would say, focus on what he\u2019s actually doing. So, here\u2019s what happened though. He makes this declaration about how we can\u2019t hear, we don\u2019t have our phones, and then he goes into what is going to be the meat of this performance. And he does a joke about Rachel Dolezal. Rachel Dolezal, of course, being the white woman who claims that she\u2019s black. And...the problems that many people have with this claim. And he objects to her, to the concept applied to her, that she could be transracial. And then, this allows him to go where you presume this idea is going, which is to actual trans people. And his discomfort with them. I think for a while, a lot of what he wanted people to hear was, get himself out of the hole he had dug in one of his two previous Netflix specials that involve a lot of comedy around trans people.DC: Alright, what happened was, I went to a gallery party. Alright. I don\u2019t know who here has ever been rich before, but these are very nice parties. Uh, you know, wine and cheese, a ball of conversation. And there were a few eccentric types, one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress. I don\u2019t know what you call a man \u2014 a tranny, a drag queen, perhaps? Whatever it was, it was definitely a man. And this man was definitely on drugs. I don\u2019t know what kind of drugs he\u2019s on, but I knew he had too much. He didn\u2019t look good. He looked sick, and all his friends were standing around him, concerned, trying to revive him. I don\u2019t know, it looked like some kind of gay CPR, there was fanning and shit. I saw all this from a distance. Now, I should have minded my own business, but I got curious. I was like...and I went over. All I said, excuse me, gentlemen, gentlemen, is he okay? And then they looked at me like I was evil. She is fine. I said, word up. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know this is what we were doing. Here\u2019s my thing. I support anybody\u2019s right to be whoever they feel like they are inside. I\u2019m your ally in that. However...my question is...to what degree do I have to participate in your self image? Is it fair that I have to change my whole pronoun game up for this motherfucker? That doesn\u2019t make sense.JW: The moment I realized that the bulk of the show was going to be about trans people and his reaction to people\u2019s reaction to his first set about trans identity and then realize we were going to sit through this, I became even more uncomfortable. You know, I had this moment where I went from audience member/regular consumer to like, kind of in journalist critique mode. Like I just switch at some point. I stop thinking about whether or not I was enjoying this and started trying to really understand what was going on. You\u2019re probably always in that mode. I can, I go back and forth. In the beginning, I was like, wow, I\u2019m really here for...Dave Chappelle using the vehicle of comedy to work through this discomfort, to work through what he felt was an unfair reaction to his initial comments, and trying to really explore some of the underlying issues that unsettle him about a trans identity and unsettle him about the way gender identity is evolving, and unsettle him about the way he feels black identity and black masculinity has been disregarded...WM: That\u2019s been usurped by the trans civil rights movement, basically.JW: Right.WM: And gay rights.JW: Yeah, and gay rights, which is a false equivalency, but \u2014 so, in the moment, I was like, wow, Dave, like I\u2019m kind of proud of you for really owning this and trying to explain to us like, what\u2019s going on. And then I realized, you know, it\u2019s one thing if the joke is not at the expense of people who identify as trans, but there were few moments within that entire set where trans people were not portrayed as gross, as abnormal, as weird and a little bit icky, and I think that\u2019s a really dangerous thing to do because \u2014WM: You\u2019re saying that he was portraying them that way?JW: I\u2019m saying that he wasn\u2019t able to fully lampoon himself at the expense of the joke. He really put the joke on the expense of the weirdness that he feels is the trans identity.WM: None of this was funny, right. And I don\u2019t mean it was unsuccessful in its attempt to make you laugh. I don\u2019t think that the kind of laughter that you expect from certain comedians was what Dave Chappalle \u2014JW: It wasn\u2019t the intention. It was kind of like a Medium essay/Thought Catalog you know, first person monologue about his feelings about trans people.WM: It was therapy.JW: And then he kept saying, I have no problem with this community. I support this community. And I\u2019m like, well...I\u2019m not okay with it, and I came to rely on Dave Chappelle as someone who can use comedy as a tool that is like a, you know, an everyman. You know those tools, I can do a million things at once? I always saw him as someone who could do that \u2014WM: A utility knife.JW: A utility knife for social commentary, social construction. Even like the way we talk about what is PC culture, and the way we think about what we hold up as...as untouchable to talk about. He talked about it.WM: So, we\u2019ll play a moment from the Age of Spin, which is the first of the two Netflix specials that he did that got released this year. This is him talking about his wife\u2019s gay friends, and how much he hates him.DC: My wife\u2019s friend Stuart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stuart\u2019s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don\u2019t like them. Not because they\u2019re gay, I\u2019m just judging them on the merits of their character. They\u2019re just not nice dudes. They\u2019re fucking rude houseguests, they\u2019re sitting on my couch, getting with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons, and I come in, they act like the party\u2019s over. Hey, Stuart, what\u2019s going on? This guy talks to me the way a cat could speak if a cat could talk. Hi, David. Stuart, what\u2019s the beef, man? What\u2019s going...he also has some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words husband and wife out of the law. I said, well, why would you want those words out of the law? He said, because it discriminates against same sex couples? I was like, please, save me the semantics, just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck of the casino, you\u2019re about to crap out. Let\u2019s go out, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that\u2019s the wife.JW: So, very quickly though, can we just acknowledge something that\u2019s so apparent about Dave in this clip? That when he is really in a groove, he is a maestro. It doesn\u2019t matter what he\u2019s talking about, and the thing that\u2019s annoying is that you still want to laugh while he\u2019s talking, even though what he\u2019s saying is so offensive. He\u2019s so good at the physicality. He\u2019s so good at...intonating just different voices.WM: His twang is \u2014 he\u2019s also...JW: It\u2019s so frustrating! He\u2019s so good.WM: I mean, the thing about this special to me is there was nothing in it that was really new. What was in it to me that was interesting was how much insight into where Dave Chappelle is at the moment.JW: And also what we\u2019re willing to let him get away with.WM: Yes.JW: Because so much of his bit right now, so much of the material he\u2019s been working through in the last couple of years is about his own fragility, and it\u2019s very clear he feels threatened, and it\u2019s very clear that there\u2019s a degree of his own masculinity that he\u2019s...maybe not grappling with, but he\u2019s worried about something being taken away from him by the emergence of all these other identity categories he doesn\u2019t understand.WM: Well, the culture\u2019s changed, and it changed it a way that seemed to require Dave Chappelle\u2019s two cents. His five dollars, actually. I mean, he was somebody who, because of Chappelle Show, his Comedy Central show that aired for two official years, I think that meant so much to so many people that it seemed to set him up as somebody who was intellectually and comedically equipped to deal with all kinds of racial/racist situations. But having a breakdown and leaving the show and then leaving comedy for as long as he left it, what do you do when you come back? Like, what kind of shape are you in?JW: For me, the most successful part of the show that I saw was when he talked about going to vote early for Hillary Clinton. And...he talks about how nobody wanted to vote for Hillary, but we had to vote for Hillary, and it\u2019s this very funny thing where he\u2019s like comparing it to all these other things that you don\u2019t want to do but you kind of have to do, and he describes where he lives in Ohio. And he\u2019s like, I went to the early voting polls, and I realized a week before the rest of America would figure it out who was going to be our next president. He goes up to the voting poll, and he overhears all these, you know, redneck-y white people talking about how Donald Trump is going to fight for them. And then he\u2019s like, he takes a pause, he takes a drag off a cigarette, and he\u2019s like, you\u2019re wrong! In that great Dave Chappelle way. He\u2019s like, Trump\u2019s going to work for me, because I\u2019m rich, not you. And it\u2019s just like this really funny moment of, that\u2019s the kind of laugh I wanted. I wanted to laugh, in a way, at something political but not directly political. I wanted to laugh at someone\u2019s...inside joke about poor white people thinking they were getting one over on someone like Dave Chappelle by voting for Donald Trump, whereas he\u2019s like, I\u2019m going to benefit from this more than you, kind of. But...even if that\u2019s not necessarily true. I just enjoyed that the most. And he could have just done it the whole time. This is what my life is like now.WM: So his ego is a huge part of where his comedy is right now. A lot of his humor before...leaving Chappelle Show and going away, it was not about who Dave Chappelle was. I want to play something from the Age of Spin that sort of tells me a lot about where Dave Chappelle is, and like, where a lot of...prominent artists are with regard to like social issues and themselves.DC: A couple weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It\u2019s actually making people sick. I mean, Hollywood people like, so what, at least they have water, but this water\u2019s fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint and they did a tremendous charity benefit. Uh, and I was on schedule to appear. So, the reason a lot of people haven\u2019t heard about this benefit \u2014 it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars, can you make it? And I was like, sure, I\u2019m on my way to the airport right now. Come on, man! What am I going to do about that water? What am I, a fucking super hero? I need to have fun. I need to live too! I didn\u2019t fuck that water up. Stevie Wonder was there, they didn\u2019t need me. I\u2019m sorry, everybody. I had never been to the Oscars. You\u2019ve seen the movies I make.JW: I hate to admit that I laughed a lot.WM: It\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s also sad because this is the person who...if the Flint water crisis had happened in 2004 would have been on top of it. He would have had a way on Chappelle Show to get at how crazy the water crisis is, and how the infrastructure around...the poor and black people, and poor black people in Flint failed them. But this bit here is, to me...it\u2019s like Superman refusing to go into the phone booth. It\u2019s like Clark Kent being like, I\u2019m going to keep typing, y\u2019all. Let Batman do it. It\u2019s an acknowledgement of abdication of sort of cultural responsibility. It\u2019s also sort of immoral, right? The whole point of that, the night of the Oscars, was to be on the night of the Oscars. It wasn\u2019t an accident. He had no Flint water crisis routine. That was his Flint water crisis routine, right there. It was about he was too famous or like, didn\u2019t feel famous enough previously to go to the Oscars, but now, his friend Chris Rock is inviting him to go \u2014 how could he turn it down? You\u2019ve seen Half Baked. I\u2019m never going to the Oscars. I don\u2019t know. It just really bummed me out.JW: But I think there\u2019s something interesting in him working out what it means to be a selfish person and what that means about what he feels obligated to do. I think it\u2019s pretty immoral, but I think I\u2019m also interested in why Dave Chappelle no longer feels obligated to black people. Socially or morally obligated to what he perceives to be the black community. And I think it comes back again to the way he\u2019s constructing himself right now, and that is in response to, I\u2019ve given you enough, and also no one cares about my feelings. He said that on stage. At the Radio City residency, he said, very markedly, the reason he feels strongly about trans identity issues is because no one cares about his feelings. He actively feels like something is still being extracted and taken from him.WM: As a black man.JW: As a visible black person, as a black man, as a celebrity, as a wealthy person, as someone with a platform, as whatever. So...there is a little bit of, he\u2019s still recovering from what it felt like to be so extracted from during the Chappelle years. And I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m trying to rationalize where he\u2019s at.WM: No, but I also think it\u2019s really, really important to remember something really crucial about Chappelle Show. It was a show that ran for only about 28 episodes. There were maybe 13 episodes per season, from 2004 ultimately to 2006. The show became, it became a sort of cultural phenomenon without being a ratings juggernaut, but it was something that young people got something out of. But it\u2019s important to specify maybe what they were getting. It wasn\u2019t as though Chappelle Show was about how hard it was to be black in this sort of universal civil rights oriented way. Dave Chappelle didn\u2019t perform that kind of blackness. He wasn\u2019t that kind of black entertainer. The style of blackness that he pursued in sketch after sketch after sketch on that show \u2014 and often with really funny results \u2014 was a kind of ghetto black.JW: I mean, I\u2019m thinking a lot about the mad Real World skit, and how liberating that was to see. And in the skit, you have a white guy going into an all black house on the Real World and him adapting to being around all these...hyper black black people.SKIT FROM THE CHAPPELLE SHOWJW: As someone who was going to a largely, predominantly white institution at the time and feeling very policed in how I could behave as a black person and being very conscious of not being that type of black person, to see someone putting that type of black person on TV \u2014 and not only saying, this is the best thing going, this is hilarious, this is also very okay...was so...gratifying for me. And I mean, not necessarily because I wanted to behave in that way or that was natural to me and my mannerisms, but just because I was like, yes, there are so many different ways to be black, and this is one, and this is not worse than any other kind. And I think that is not messaging that was in the media at all during that period of time.WM: There was a real argument being made on Chappelle Show about poor black people and black street life that is usually treated with fear and terror, and any pejorative you can put on that, American popular culture basically did that.JW: And then the Chappelle Show subverts that, and I rewatched the black Bush sketch, and he basically takes you know, all these hood N-words and puts them in the White House.SKIT FROM THE CHAPPELLE SHOWJW: It\u2019s hilarious.WM: I mean, there were a lot of places that black comedy just wasn\u2019t going because there was not enough black comedy to go there. And I think that this show was really in some ways about depicting a version of black culture that you never see, but I also think there are a lot of white people involved in the making the show.JW: And I think that\u2019s where things start to take a turn. And we should listen to part of Dave Chappelle\u2019s interview with Oprah where he talks about the moment he realized maybe he wasn\u2019t in on the joke as much as he thought he was. Because so much of the early parts of that show were really about using black culture in a way that was funny, but black culture wasn\u2019t the bunt of the joke.DC: I was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible. I felt like I was being deliberately encouraged, and I was overwhelmed, so that\u2019s like, you get flooded with things and you don\u2019t pay attention to things like your ethics when you get so overwhelmed. A lot of these people traditionally get paid on a percentage basis. The more you work, the more they make. You make that real money. They lost their minds. I thought they were crazy. It was like, you\u2019ve got to do everything. So, I got these things, and I got, you know, your own personal problems that get inflamed when this kind of money comes in, and I got to write a show and do the show, and I was overwhelmed, and it was almost like...I don\u2019t know. It was almost as if this was happening deliberately.OW: Okay. We\u2019ll be right back.JW: I always wondered why Oprah stopped Dave right at that moment. He was about to make a really good point. I guess someone in her ear was like, gotta go to commercial break. But she should have pushed back and been like, let him finish.WM: Well, I got some bad news for you. I gotta pause you there. Let\u2019s take a break, we\u2019ll be right back. We\u2019re going to finish that thought, but we\u2019ll be back in a second.OW: Dave Chappelle is here, speaking out in his first television interview about why he walked away from $50 million and the hit show that was considered the hottest, the hippest comedy show on television. Okay, you mentioned a moment ago that you felt that there were some things that weren\u2019t socially responsible. Like what?DC: Like there\u2019s this one sketch that we did that was about the pixie that would appear whenever racist things happened, whenever someone would make you feel like they were calling you that N word. But don\u2019t say it. And it was funny, and the premise of the sketch was that every race had this like, pixie, this like racial complex. So then when I\u2019m on the set and we\u2019re finally taping the sketch, somebody on set that was white laughed in such a way \u2014 I know the difference when people are laughing with me and people are laughing at me. And it was the first time I\u2019d ever gotten a laugh that I was uncomfortable with.OW: Okay. I still haven\u2019t gotten to why you just disappeared. So you had that moment, the guy\u2019s laughing too much. Was that the tipping point for you? Was that the straw?DC: That was the first tipping point. The whole time, they\u2019re trying to convince me I\u2019m insane. They\u2019re trying to get me to take psychotic medication. Yeah. Like I\u2019m sitting around \u2014 yeah, I was stressed out, but the people that were telling me I was insane, I believe that they knew what was going on. It\u2019s very stressful for someone to constantly walk behind you and say, you\u2019re insane.WM: The degree to which his personal mental health was less important than to keep his team bathing in money was one thing, but there\u2019s also just how he was feeling the show was not doing the most it could in its depiction of black people and black culture. It is clearly always been one of the tensions in his comedy, which is, how do I tell stories about being in black America as a black person that are funny, but that white people are also going to hear in the presence of other black people. And what responsibility do I have as a black person to treat black people responsibly? Like, we\u2019re not perfect.JW: But can we talk for a second about the pressure.WM: Oh, yeah.JW: On black celebrities in the public spotlight, especially when their work revolves around race, because as I was watching that Oprah interview, I kept thinking about someone like Dane Cook, who...made a lot of really irresponsible jokes about rape culture and women and, but he isn\u2019t worried. I mean, he\u2019s still raking it in. He\u2019s not worried about \u2014 not even someone like Amy Schumer, who even to this day is still really irresponsible with some of her racial stereotypes. It\u2019s just interesting to me what it means to be in the minority and the additional weight that it carries.WM: Mm hm. Well, I mean, I think you chose Dane Cook and Amy Schumer, but I would actually pick someone like Lena Dunham. Someone who...in the way that Dave Chappelle has been reckoning with the consequences of his work and how it is received by people, and how you can\u2019t control how it\u2019s received by people no matter what your intentions are. Part of the reason we\u2019re talking about him is that the culture cares about Dave Chappelle. The question is, which Dave Chappelle do we care about?JW: And why? Because people want him to be a savior. He never signed up for that role. And I think what we\u2019re watching is someone back pedaling from that but still wanting that recognition. He\u2019s like pushing and pulling in a really interesting way. I mean, it\u2019s funny the way that show \u2014 I\u2019m talking about the Chappelle Show \u2014 is such a time capsule in so many ways. You\u2019re right, it was really rough around the edges. It wasn\u2019t perfect. The parts that were good were so good, but I was thinking about the racial draft skit, the first one, which is like so...diabolical and genius, and of course the racial draft skit was a recurring thing on the Chappelle Show where Dave Chappelle\u2019s responding to I guess multiculturalism and how everyone claims multiple identities. People like Tiger Woods, who try to create new racial identity categories. And he sets up a draft in the style of the NBA and the NFL, and lets racists choose who is going to be on their side and why.SKIT FROM THE CHAPPELLE SHOWJW: The brilliance comes out of it because everyone gets to laugh, and no one feels like they\u2019re being laughed at. It\u2019s a moment that in a way, it doesn\u2019t alienate white people, but also lets them into a little bit of, they\u2019re like, multiculturalism works in a way that they\u2019ve probably never experienced or had conversations about. But also, it doesn\u2019t center anyone\u2019s experience over anyone else\u2019s. It just complicates the ways in which we all coopt each other\u2019s identities, and what it means to do so in tandem. And it\u2019s the kind of thing that made that show so good.WM: And it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s also doing stuff like that amazing episode that turned Wayne Brady into a gansta. Let\u2019s play a clip from the Wayne Brady is a gangsta episode of that show.SKIT FROM THE CHAPPELLE SHOWWM: You know, in a lot of ways, black people, we aren\u2019t fair to each other about what blackness even is. I mean, we\u2019re talking about, what about Wayne Brady is any less black than any \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s obvious what those things are. I mean, he seems to be carefree. His demeanor is very show biz white. He\u2019s a game show host. He\u2019s not a brotha. Do you know what I mean? And the idea that you would take somebody who...does not meet neither the culture\u2019s standard definition of a black person or like, the average black person\u2019s definition of a black person, and you do something, you make him ultra black is, is so funny, and it\u2019s funny that we\u2019re sitting here talking about it, but you just get the joke in 30 seconds.JW: Immediately, immediately. And it\u2019s also, I mean, it\u2019s a way that I think that show was so brilliant speaking to both black audiences and white audiences in a double coded language. Whereas, if you\u2019re a white viewer, you just maybe are like, this is a hilarious new side of Wayne Brady I\u2019ve never seen, and it\u2019s great and enjoyable on that level. And if you\u2019re a black viewer, you\u2019re like, you\u2019re really thinking about the ways in which black people can turn on each other when it comes to something like what is a black identity because it\u2019s something we\u2019re told isn\u2019t valuable, but then it becomes the most valuable thing that you\u2019re so protective over, and for people who don\u2019t fit into it, they become pariahs in a way. And so you have someone who is sort of seen as that pariah being reclaimed by Dave Chappelle, and also given an opportunity that Wayne Brady\u2019s never had in mainstream show business. Maybe he always had them inside of him \u2014 and it clearly came out of a late night Hennessy conversation. Dave ran into Wayne Brady at a hotel bar, and he was like, what\u2019s up, man?WM: You know what? I feel like a lot of us are Wayne Brady in that we are perceived as being these...vegan, vegetable broth, no soul having black people, and maybe it is true. I mean, there are obvious examples of people we still think have that kind of blackness. The thing that he\u2019s talking to Oprah about is really, as much as there are black people who are like that, like on the Real World spoof, that is also so much of how black people are shown to white people that in some ways, it reaffirms \u2014JW: What they already think.WM: And I think that is a lot of what was driving him mad about the response from white fans of the show to the show. It was the catchphrases, it was the impersonations. It was the sort of failure to appreciate all the life and love \u2014 in the Prince impersonation, for instance. Or the Rick James impersonation.JW: Frankly \u2014 he was doing it with an added layer of satire that was lost on some of the viewers, and I think that was the thing that unhinged him.WM: He and the show were way more sophisticated, I think, than a lot of the people that were watching it.JW: And the network. The network was not equipped to handle that degree of satire.WM: No. They wanted to keep profiting off of it without really understanding what it might cost the person responsible for conjuring it up. He was in a kind of racial draft. Like black fans trying to claim him versus white fans trying to claim him. And I think that can also kind of make you crazy too, because you are just a person practicing your art form, and all the sudden you get into a kind of a turf war or, or, or territorialism over where you should go on the comedy map. That becomes fraught too, because in his case, not only is there art involved, there\u2019s money involved. There\u2019s livelihood involved. There\u2019s personal happiness involved. And it probably was better for him to just...just jump through the trap door.JW: Well, it\u2019s not like the bones of Hollywood isn\u2019t littered with the bones of black entertainers who couldn\u2019t hang. So it\u2019s not that he was, it\u2019s not just that he couldn\u2019t figure out which side he belonged on, but he couldn\u2019t even make the thing he was trying to make without worrying about how it would be interpreted, and how it was going to get parceled out, apparently.WM: Yep. I think now, to have him back, there are terms for his return. One of the terms, of course, is that you surrender your phone when you go see him in a big venue like Radio City Music Hall. What we basically watched him do was dig himself out of a hole that he dug for himself. But instead of digging his way out, he didn\u2019t acknowledge that he dug a hole, he just built a soap box on top of the hole that he dug. So that there\u2019s a kind of righteous indignation he can perform because it\u2019s not his fault that trans jokes didn\u2019t joke. It\u2019s our fault. It\u2019s trans people ruining his comedy by complaining that he doesn\u2019t have a right to represent them. And I think what he\u2019s trying to figure out how to do in the show we saw versus what he did in the first Netflix special was putting himself more at the center of this trans routine, so that it gives him more agency and the trans community less...less to objectively object to, right. Like, these stories aren\u2019t about the problems with being trans, as we discussed before. They\u2019re more about the problems that Dave Chappelle is having with \u2014 clearly having with himself and his interest in trans people. We\u2019re not making him bring this up. It\u2019s like you said, like nobody is making him talk about this stuff.JW: It\u2019s just what\u2019s on his mind.WM: It\u2019s what\u2019s on his mind. And it\u2019s such a X ray of where he is, of where his psyche is. So, let\u2019s just play something really quick from Killing Them Softly, his special from 2000. It was on HBO. Dave Chappelle is about 27 or 28 when this aired. And this is him talking about learning, like he\u2019s performing, learning about the police abuse of black people.DC: I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t like police. I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m just scared of them. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Sometimes, we want to call them too. Somebody broke into my house once. This is a good time to call, but mm. Mm. House is too nice. It ain\u2019t a real nice house, but they\u2019ll never believe I live in it. It\u2019ll be, he\u2019s still here! Oh my God. Open and shut case, Johnson. Just sprinkle some crack on him and get out of here.WM: So, I mean, this was the Dave Chappelle that was taking off in 2000. And a guy who had a sort of razor sharp sense of injustice \u2014JW: Social justice, yeah.WM: But a sense of like what was unjust in terms of how black people were treated.JW: But I mean also in a way that he wanted to use his comedy to expose that injustice. Man, this happened to me. Man, this is messed up. Because he could be telling stories about his own experiences with the police, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s using comedy again as this like...WM: There is a joke in his special about his own weird experience with the police, but it\u2019s all through the perspective of being in a car with a white person. And so, I think what\u2019s also very clever about Dave Chappelle and the way that he thinks about race is that different whitenesses were implicated in the racism. Like it wasn\u2019t just, he did a lot of Confederate/KKK oriented jokes and sketches on the show, but also, it\u2019s just like normal white liberals, too. The kind of people who may hold a silent auction on their daughter\u2019s black boyfriend in the backyard of the house one day.JW: This should be his moment to shine. But in your show, when you saw him at Radio City, did he say what he said at mine? Which was \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say he apologized for Trump, but he really didn\u2019t take him to task. It came up a few times, and he was just kind of like, we\u2019re going to outlast him because change is moving forward. Like a really milquetoast, you know, like, we\u2019ll be fine, which all signs are pointing to, idk about that.WM: I actually love the mess of his comedy, right. I love that it\u2019s not clean and you might lose a limb on the way out of a joke.JW: I felt that way too.WM: But you\u2019re mostly still in tact, and people like me are going to sit around and think about \u2014 I mean, because that\u2019s what I do. Why is this funny? Like why am I about to urinate on myself? And I think that if you can get most of the mess, if you can make a mess and yet convey some degree of what you feel is inappropriate and there is some justice in that, I think there is certain collateral damage that a joke is going to commit to get you there. And I think that is where Dave Chappelle thinks comedy ought to be, and I think that\u2019s where he thinks comedy audiences no longer are willing to be. And I think his perception is we don\u2019t understand how comedy works, and I would say that those audiences would say, well, there shouldn\u2019t be collateral damage in a joke. I don\u2019t see why the disabled and trans people should have to suffer, or like be made fun of for you to make some other joke about injustices committed against black people. There are people who just want a clean kind of comedy that doesn\u2019t offend anybody. And I don\u2019t know if, I mean, that comedy exists, and it can be funny, but I also think that the reason Dave Chappelle is a star is that he became one before the era that we currently live in. I don\u2019t think \u2014 we\u2019re at this place of quality agnosticism, right. Like it doesn\u2019t, it might not matter whether Dave Chappelle is good or not. It only matters whether or not people\u2019s feelings get hurt. And I think that he wants, he doesn\u2019t want to practice that kind of comedy, but he\u2019s also just as much interested in safe spaces as the people who go to his shows.JW: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s the inherent irony is that Dave wants a safe space to do his work, but also, in asking for that, he\u2019s also asking that people not be critical of the things that he\u2019s saying, which you don\u2019t get it both ways. You actually don\u2019t get it both ways. And I think \u2014WM: But do we get it both ways? Because I feel like can an audience \u2014JW: I don\u2019t know that Dave is in line with how audiences have evolved or changed. It\u2019s true the culture has changed. It\u2019s true that we\u2019re having much more in depth and much more vocal and much more...harder to ignore conversations about cultural identities and the politics of identities and the politics of language in particular and who...gets to laugh at whom. And comedy is supposed to be about making people uncomfortable in the hopes that you get somewhere more interesting and add some levity to this thing called life, and we all get to look at the stuff that we take too seriously or not seriously enough or for granted and laugh at it. That\u2019s kind of my, the way I think about the point of standup and live comedy is supposed to do. But Dave cannot \u2014 it seems like he hasn\u2019t been able to adapt to the reality that not everybody likes him, and he\u2019s not as universally revered. He doesn\u2019t have a chorus of yes men telling him he\u2019s a genius anymore, because the internet exists now. Do we still need a Dave Chappelle? Yes. Do we need Dave Chappelle? Not necessarily.WM: But I think that the question is what do we need from him?JW: Watching someone who does not understand the world in 2017 try to make peace with that and get somewhere different, I think there has to be space for.WM: That\u2019s our show.JW: That\u2019s our Chappelle show.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s the Golden Age of TV. And Writers Are Reaping the Rewards and Paying the Toll.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Kirk A. Moore\u2019s sleeping pattern had landed him in the hospital.The result: a panic attack that sent him to the emergency room.\u201cI remember I was at urgent care, working on my script because I was on deadline and I didn\u2019t want to tell them I was sick,\u201d he said of an episode he wrote for \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201d \u201cSo I finished it there.\u201dMr. Moore\u2019s hospital stay may be an extreme manifestation of the stresses of the TV writing life, but the profession\u2019s possible pitfalls are willingly accepted by a growing number of men and women who arrive in Southern California each year, armed with ideas, scripts and unbridled enthusiasm, looking for success in an industry famous for chewing up and spitting out talent. They are enticed by the increased prestige of writing for a medium long disdained as a vast wasteland, in the era of Peak TV, when streaming services do battle with the broadcast and cable networks to win the allegiances of audiences. A record 455 original scripted series aired last year, and by the time 2017 comes to a close that tally is expected to top 500.Though opportunities abound, the transition has presented additional challenges. Here, three writers discuss the nontraditional career trajectories, long hours, substance use (and abuse) and uneven returns that can come from working in the golden age of a continually shifting creative field.Growing up in Greenwich Village, she dreamed of a future stage career. In the 1990s, while in her early 20s, she hung around the Malaparte Theater Company, which was run by Ethan Hawke and Ms. Queller\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Jonathan Marc Sherman (\u201cSophistry,\u201d \u201cThings We Want\u201d). \u201cI came up with these crazy talents,\u201d said Ms. Queller. \u201cPeter Dinklage and Sam Rockwell and Philip Seymour Hoffman \u2014 and Calista Flockhart and Cara Buono, both of whom remain my two best friends.\u201dBut, unlike her peers, success eluded her. \u201cI was the Salieri of the Mozart story: \u2018I am so passionate about the theater! I\u2019ve read everything, seen everything!\u2019 But I just [couldn\u2019t] get cast at the Roundabout and on Broadway, where my friends were.\u201dSo in 1997 she went to Los Angeles to audition for pilot season. There, a light bulb went off: Why not try writing instead?\u201cAll my boyfriends had been writers \u2014 I revered writers and storytelling, and had the epiphany around the age of 30. \u2018Oh, maybe I don\u2019t want to marry a manic-depressive alcoholic writer, maybe I just want to be one,\u2019\u201d she recalled, laughing. \u201cI had this little voice inside of me going, \u2018I think I could do that.\u2019\u201dMs. Queller then burrowed for two years, writing at night and sleeping during the day. She eventually secured a job, her first, on \u201cFling,\u201d the ill-fated show from Glenn Gordon Caron (\u201cMoonlighting\u201d). The show was canceled by Fox in 2001 before an episode was televised. But the credit did lead her to a gig on \u201cFelicity\u201d and the writing niche that has determined her career ever since.\u201cHere I am, 47 years old, still writing for teenagers and early 20s [viewers],\u201d said Ms. Queller, who has also worked on \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d which ran on the WB and CW.It was advice from an agent \u2014 one she met because her mother\u2019s best friend\u2019s son-in-law was the man\u2019s tennis teacher \u2014 that set her on this path. Upon hearing that she was writing a spec script for the David E. Kelley show \u201cThe Practice,\u201d the agent told her to choose a lane.\u201cIt was easier for me to say \u2018I know everything about what it means to be a struggling young woman\u2019 than it was for me to say \u2018I know what it means to run a law firm in Boston,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe advice wasn\u2019t necessarily bad \u2014 it was a bit limiting \u2014 but it worked, because I did become the go-to person for those types of shows as I was trying to establish a career.\u201dFor those lucky enough to secure a job, maintaining it can take its own toll.Before his first staff writing gig on \u201cAmerican Crime,\u201d Mr. Moore worked a night shift in customer service at a psychic advice company. But in 2014, the Houston native was accepted into NBC Writers on the Verge, which trains aspirants from diverse backgrounds and introduced him to the peculiarities of writing for television. The image of the lone scribe, sweating over the Great American Novel or the next \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d does not translate to television writing. Collaboration is integral to the profession, and the work of more junior writers is ultimately subservient to the vision of the showrunner (not to mention the desires of the companies bankrolling the project).\u201cI had to be comfortable letting go of something that I knew was just a draft,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s TV. You go through a writers\u2019 draft, then a studio draft and then a network draft.\u201dHe also had to learn to be rigorously disciplined. \u201cI never thought I was a fast writer until I got into the program,\u201d said Mr. Moore, now 37. \u201cIt showed me that I really had to be structured: \u2018O.K., Kirk, you have to sleep at this time, you have to work at this time, you have to write at this time.\u2019\u201dUnfortunately, Mr. Moore\u2019s all-nighters, poor eating habits and self-medication would catch up with him during the third season of \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201d \u201cI was so stressed out and not getting sleep, it just compounded \u2014 and then I was in the hospital,\u201d he said.There may be more television shows than ever, but the spoils aren\u2019t necessarily trickling down to the writers. Between 2013 and 2016, the overall median earnings of writer-producers decreased by 25 percent, according to the Writers Guild of America West.Mr. Moore considers himself fortunate, finding his experience on \u201cCrime\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d to be, long hours aside, comfortable and inclusive. \u201cI\u2019ve been on shows where they actually respect my opinion, whether I\u2019m a staff writer or whether I\u2019m a producer,\u201d he said, before echoing the \u201cCrime\u201d creator John Ridley\u2019s approach: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t care about your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I care about what you can bring to my story and the show I want to tell.\u2019\u201dAfter his stint in the hospital, though, Mr. Moore knew he would have to make lifestyle changes to keep producing quality work. \u201cI had to stop drinking, I stopped drinking caffeine,\u201d said Mr. Moore, who is working on the second season of \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d (\u201cAmerican Crime\u201d was canceled in May by ABC.) \u201cThat\u2019s taking some time to get used to. But I learned from my mistakes. I want to do this for a long time.\u201dFor many television writers, like A\u00efda Mashaka Croal, the ultimate goal is running one\u2019s own show.Ms. Croal, currently a writer and co-executive producer on \u201cMarvel\u2019s Luke Cage,\u201d originally dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon while growing up in Vancouver, British Columbia, and her parents\u2019 native British Guiana. But her time at Stanford, studying under the playwright Anna Deavere Smith, steered her toward writing and eventually, in 2003, to the ABC Daytime Writers\u2019 Program.But while she\u2019s toiled on soap operas (\u201cOne Life to Live\u201d), sci-fi shows (\u201cSanctuary\u201d) and historical dramas (\u201cTurn: Washington\u2019s Spies\u201d), it\u2019s \u201cLuke Cage,\u201d about a black superhero in Harlem, where she feels most at home.\u201cWhen I looked at television, I thought every single show was about a white man doing something, and I felt like, \u2018I have to fit my stories into that narrative in order to be hired,\u2019\u201d Ms. Croal, 42, said. \u201cIt created a sense of insecurity: Well, what do they really want to see? What do they really mean? And I would kind of psych myself out about it, so it was nice to have somebody say, \u2018What we really want to see is what we really have to say.\u2019\u201dHer role on \u201cCage\u201d has also prepared her for her next mission: her own series. A show she co-created for AMC in 2016 did not get the go-ahead \u2014 she declined to divulge details, but said that it ran up against a similar show that came to fruition more quickly. (That show has since been canceled.) Nonetheless, Ms. Croal remains undaunted. \u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a couple of opportunities out there, and we will see very shortly which dream will come true.\u201d\u201cI think all industries go through phases of expansion and contraction, as well as periods of stasis,\u201d he said,Mr. Landgraf may be unsure about the timing of that decline, but he does have one piece of advice if, or when, that day arrives: \u201cWhen an industry contracts, it\u2019s just better not to be in the bottom third in terms of talent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to really preserve your longevity is to continue to grow, and retrain and get better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Efforts to increase the representation of women in the industry were discriminatory in a way, he said, that was \u201cunfair, divisive and bad for business.\u201dThe memo was rebuked by other employees, but it has become a rallying cry for others outside the company, particularly conservatives and the alt-right, who are concerned about a stifling of debate in Silicon Valley.Eric Weinstein, a managing director at Thiel Capital, an investment firm run by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and supporter of President Trump, said Google was sending the wrong message to women.It also has threatened Fox\u2019s $15 billion bid to acquire full ownership of Sky, a European satellite giant.At a mediation proceeding last month, the lawyer Douglas H.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: High-Visibility Golf Balls", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationI took up golf in a time of personal crisis. Last summer, after I moved back into my parents\u2019 house in western North Carolina, I was overcome with a malaise so severe that I couldn\u2019t do anything but get in bed and stay there. As listless days turned into listless months, it became clear that I was in the throes of a mental breakdown. The experience was akin to a perpetual hangover of the soul, which I tried to defeat not with ibuprofen and Netflix but with a lot of lying down and contemplating the futility of getting up.For me, there was a point when my melancholy lifted, almost as a fever does, and my sorry state stopped feeling like a dead end and started feeling like a backhanded chance for a fresh start. I went to a local physician whom I\u2019d been seeing since middle school, and he told me three things. One, I needed to go on medication; I was seriously depressed. Two, I needed to go to psychotherapy to ensure that this sort of thing wouldn\u2019t happen again. Three, I needed to get some exercise in the hope of speeding along the recovery process.In the face of that third directive, I decided to take up golf. I\u2019d played a bit as a teenager, and there was a course near my folks\u2019 place that offered unlimited access for about $50 a month. \u2018\u2018I am a golfer now,\u2019\u2019 I told myself as I teed up for the first time in a decade. \u2018\u2018I leave the course. I come back. I golf.\u2019\u2019 I was awful, but to my utmost surprise, I immediately fell so in love with the game that I even loved being terrible at it.After a few lousy rounds peppered with hooks, slices, whiffs, shanks, chili-\u00addips, skied drives and skulled chips, I came to view my poor play as the very avatar of my depression. Yes, things were bad. But by dedicating myself to the game, there was no question of whether I would get better, only of when it would happen. It would take a lot of time and a lot of work, but as long as I kept showing up and trying, I figured, both my game and my mind would have to improve. Most important, if I ever wanted to hit a better shot than the one that came before it, I\u2019d need to be able to see where my ball had actually gone.I was losing balls constantly: in water hazards, in deep rough, in clusters of trees where errant shots rattle around as if on a Plinko board. So I started using high-\u00advisibility golf balls as a matter of practicality. In golf, these are all but taboo. No one disputes that the little neon orbs, which typically come in luminescent shades of yellow, orange, red and pink, are easier to follow in the air than conventional white balls, or that they\u2019re easier to find. It\u2019s just that when players square up behind a ball that\u2019s visible from an airplane, they might as well be pulling out a bullhorn and announcing to the entire course that they suck at golf, or that they\u2019re very old, or both.Manufacturers are well aware of their products\u2019 lowly reputation, but every time a company tries to resuscitate their esteem, it only manages to make high-\u00advisibility golf balls even more garish. Callaway recently introduced the Truvis, which comes in white overlaid with a red pentagonal soccer-\u00adball pattern (it also comes in eye-\u00adgouging black-\u00adon-\u00adyellow). While I appreciate its counter\u00adaesthetic charms, the Truvis has so much going on that it\u2019s impossible for me to line up a putt with one. I prefer the offerings from Volvik and Bridgestone, whose soft matte covers don\u2019t reflect light but instead seem to produce it from within, as if they contained bits of radioactive waste. A few rounds ago I somehow managed to impart backspin on a yellow Bridgestone e6 Soft with a fairway wood, so there\u2019s no telling what\u2019s in those things.At first, I played about as well as I felt. Every dinky yellow ball I hit seemed to mysteriously veer left at the apex of its trajectory, so I widened my stance. It turned out that I\u2019d overcorrected, and my hook became a slice. When I was losing balls, it was all too easy to simply drop another one and take a mulligan. But with the clarity the high-\u00advisibility balls provided, I felt compelled to deal with my wayward shots, to seek them out and to understand what I\u2019d done to send them there. As I tinkered with my swing, I focused on which tweaks produced, if not better results, at least different ones. I was comforted by the knowledge that at last I was working toward a balance.For weeks, this cycle of error and compensation became the norm, but at least, for the first time since my depression began, I was doing something. Rather than isolating myself from life and its complications, I\u2019d submitted myself to them; I was once again an agent in a cycle of cause and effect. It was a glorious proc\u00adess of experimentation, one in which the results mattered less than the realization that the will my depression had robbed me of was slowly returning.Lots of people suck at golf, of course \u2014 most do, really. It\u2019s just that many prefer to confront their ineptitude aspirationally, shelling out hundreds of dollars for all sorts of space-\u00adage clubs that promise longer drives, straighter shots and miraculously generated backspin. It\u2019s amusing that the only guaranteed game enhancer, whose utility is explained in its very name, is one that far too often languishes in the pro shop, overlooked and unloved. Best of all, high-\u00advisibility golf balls help you do the work of self-\u00adbetterment all by your lonesome, allowing you to identify your problems so that you can fix them yourself. At this point, my game has improved to the point that my blinding yellow Bridgestones have begun to feel like training wheels. But there\u2019s a part of me that isn\u2019t quite ready to let them go. They gave me a little bit of light when things were at their darkest.Drew Millard is a writer who lives in North Carolina.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Doubles Down on Threats Against North Korea as Nuclear Tensions Escalate", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 President Trump escalated his war of words with North Korea on Thursday by declaring that his provocative threat to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d might not have been harsh enough, as nuclear tensions between the two nations continued to crackle.Rejecting critics at home and abroad who condemned his earlier warning as reckless saber-rattling, Mr. Trump said North Korea and its volatile leader, Kim Jong-un, have pushed the United States and the rest of the world for too long.\u201cFrankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d he told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201dAsked if that was a dare, Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a dare. It\u2019s a statement. Has nothing to do with dare. That\u2019s a statement. He\u2019s not going to go around threatening Guam and he\u2019s not going to threaten the United States and he\u2019s not going to threaten Japan, and he\u2019s not going to threaten South Korea. No, that\u2019s not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program has recently accelerated faster than expected.Mr. Trump made his latest comments on North Korea during a pair of televised media events that covered a dizzying array of topics. He assailed Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, for not passing his legislative priorities, calling it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the party\u2019s health care plan failed by one vote and hinting that the leader should step down if he cannot do better. Mr. Trump also said he would declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency and defended his decision to bar transgender people from the armed forces, saying he was \u201cdoing the military a great favor.\u201dIn his first response to Russia\u2019s decision to force the United States to slash its diplomatic staff in half, the president said he would thank President Vladimir V. Putin for helping him trim payroll costs. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, whose house was raided last month by law enforcement agents as part of an investigation into Russia ties, calling him \u201ca very decent man.\u201d He said he was not considering firing Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.After nearly a week of his working vacation here, the president was in an expansive mood and seemingly eager to talk and take on all issues. While his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, held a sign in the back of the room saying \u201cone more question,\u201d Mr. Trump kept plowing ahead, taking one after another until he was satisfied.Joining him at the club were Vice President Mike Pence and several aides, including Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, who has been under fire from the alt-right media after purging his staff of several hard-liners thought to be close to Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist. Mr. Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had confidence in General McMaster.Democrats complained that the president was inflaming the confrontation and called for diplomacy instead. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s escalatory rhetoric is exactly the wrong response to dealing with North Korea\u2019s provocative behavior,\u201d said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s East Asia Subcommittee. \u201cIt unnecessarily heightens the risk of miscalculation and creates the very fog that can lead to war.\u201dMore than 60 House Democrats sent a letter on Thursday to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson asking him to restrain the president. \u201cThese statements are irresponsible and dangerous, and also senselessly provide a boon to domestic North Korean propaganda, which has long sought to portray the United States as a threat to their people,\u201d the letter said.Former President Jimmy Carter, who has visited North Korea three times as a private citizen, added his voice to the criticism. \u201cIn addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries, especially China and Russia,\u201d he said in a statement. He added that all parties must assure the North Koreans that they would forgo \u201cany military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.\u201dFor all the bellicose words, Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he was open to negotiations, as Mr. Tillerson has urged. But the president expressed skepticism that talks would lead to a reasonable outcome, given the experiences of his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, none of whom was able to resolve the issue through negotiations.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll always consider negotiations,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been negotiating now for 25 years. Look at Clinton. He folded on the negotiations. He was weak and ineffective. You look what happened with Bush, you look what happened with Obama. Obama, he didn\u2019t even want to talk about it. But I talk. It\u2019s about time. Somebody has to do it.\u201dMr. Trump likewise said he doubted that sanctions passed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council last weekend would ultimately succeed. But he again suggested that he would bargain with China by backing down from a planned trade war if Beijing did more to resolve the North Korea impasse.\u201cWe lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know how I feel. It\u2019s not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade.\u201dHe was vague about exactly where the line would be if North Korea did not back down, and refused to say whether he would consider a pre-emptive military strike without an attack by Pyongyang.Asked what would be \u201ctougher\u201d than \u201cfire and fury,\u201d he demurred. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see.\u201dStress within the administration over North Korea again spilled over and into public view on Thursday. Speaking with reporters en route to Seattle, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the president was entitled to use whatever language he thought appropriate. \u201cI was not elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people elected the president.\u201dBut asked about his own equally tough but less colorful statement about North Korea, issued on Wednesday, Mr. Mattis said, \u201cThe rhetoric is up to the president. This is my rhetoric.\u201dA White House aide, meanwhile, said no one should listen to Mr. Tillerson on military matters related to North Korea after the secretary of state said he saw no imminent likelihood of war and urged Americans to sleep soundly.That drew a sharp retort from Mr. Tillerson\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cHe\u2019s a cabinet secretary,\u201d Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick.\u201dAdvertisement"}
