{"Headline": "How This U.S. Tech Giant Is Backing China\u2019s Tech Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Chinese government develops drones, the American technology giant Qualcomm is helping. The same goes for artificial intelligence, mobile technology and supercomputers. Qualcomm is also working to help Chinese companies like Huawei break into overseas markets in support of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands.Qualcomm is providing money, expertise and engineering for Beijing\u2019s master plan to create its own technology superpowers.Big American companies fiercely protect their intellectual property and trade secrets, fearful of giving an edge to rivals. But they have little choice in China \u2014 and Washington is looking on with alarm.To gain access to the Chinese market, American companies are being forced to transfer technology, create joint ventures, lower prices and aid homegrown players. Those efforts form the backbone of President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious plan to ensure that China\u2019s companies, military and government dominate core areas of technology like artificial intelligence and semiconductors.Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are working with Chinese companies to develop server chips, creating rivals to their own product. Intel is working with the Chinese to build high-end mobile chips, in competition with Qualcomm. IBM has agreed to transfer valuable technology that could enable China to break into the lucrative mainframe banking business.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of unease in Washington,\u201d said James Lewis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThe defense, intelligence agencies and others are concerned that advanced chip-making capabilities are going to China.\u201dQualcomm declined to comment, as did Intel.Qualcomm is caught in the middle.The world\u2019s dominant mobile phone chip maker, Qualcomm ran afoul of the Chinese government, getting hit in 2015 with a record $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior. To get back in Beijing\u2019s good graces, the company agreed to lower its prices in China, promised to shift more of its high-end manufacturing to partners in China, and pledged to upgrade the country\u2019s technology capabilities.The extent of Qualcomm\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government \u2014 and the complications for American tech giants \u2014 is seen in a low-slung office building in the southwest part of the country. There, a team of engineers is developing leading-edge microchips to compete with the finest made by Intel. The chips will help power a huge data and cloud center with the potential to strengthen the country\u2019s computing capabilities. No longer content to rely on buying the chips that go into cellphones, computers and cars, China now wants to design and build the brains that drive much of the digital world.The government is providing land and financing to the start-up formed with Qualcomm, called Huaxintong Semiconductor. Qualcomm has provided the technology and about $140 million in initial funding.\u201cQualcomm has a balancing act,\u201d said Willy Shih, who teaches at Harvard Business School. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s PCs are made in China, and most of the world\u2019s smartphones too, so they have to play along. It\u2019s a fact of life.\u201dQualcomm was early to break into China.In the mid-1990s, as China\u2019s economy began to boom, President Bill Clinton pressed the country\u2019s leaders to open to American technology companies.Members of the Clinton administration, including Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce, were dispatched to Beijing to hammer out the details. They pushed for one company by name: Qualcomm.\u201cAt the time, they were the only U.S. show in town,\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said.\u201cBill Daley and I pushed the Chinese hard on accepting the U.S. standard for wireless technology,\u201d she added, \u201cand that was Qualcomm.\u201dMobile phone adoption was taking off globally, largely backed by a European wireless standard called G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications. Qualcomm had a competing American standard called C.D.M.A., or Code Division Multiple Access.Irwin M. Jacobs, a founder of Qualcomm, spearheaded an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington and Beijing, promoting the technology\u2019s potential to transform wireless communication markets.\u201cWe knew China would be important, and they didn\u2019t have their own system,\u201d said Perry LaForge, a former Qualcomm executive. \u201cWe also told them this system would give them an opportunity to manufacture their own handsets, and not rely on buying them from other countries.\u201dWhen Qualcomm first entered China in the late 1990s, it was slow to gain traction. The company struggled to find Chinese partners to produce mobile phones that worked with its network. China also tried to develop its own wireless standard.Qualcomm eventually won out, helping write the standards for next-generation mobile technology, 3G and 4G service. The standard championed by European telecom providers faded rapidly. And China\u2019s homegrown technology struggled.By 2013, virtually every wireless device around the world was reliant on either Qualcomm\u2019s chips or its patents \u2014 enough to provide some of the technology industry\u2019s fattest profit margins.With its dominance rising, global brands like Apple and Samsung began complaining to regulators around the world, citing \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d pricing practices and high royalty fees. In China, a trade group made up of the country\u2019s major handset makers complained about patent holders levying \u201cexorbitant licensing fees.\u201d\u201cThese days a smartphone is covered by about 250,000 patents,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational center based in Honolulu. \u201cA Chinese smartphone maker needs to negotiate license agreements with companies like Qualcomm that own the essential patents.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese government was worried about this,\u201d he added. \u201cThat all these costs could constrain Chinese companies.\u201dThe raids began at dawn, in late November 2013. Investigators descended upon Qualcomm\u2019s offices in Beijing and Shanghai, questioning the staff and hauling away laptops and documents.At the time of the raids, the San Diego-based company\u2019s senior managers were at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York, attending an investor conference. The executives were planning to talk about the company\u2019s strategy. Instead, they began fielding frantic phone calls from China.The China business, which accounted for more than half of its global revenue, was in trouble.A week later, one of the country\u2019s most powerful regulatory agencies, the National Development and Reform Commission (N.D.R.C.), announced that it was looking into whether Qualcomm had abused its power in the sale of mobile phone chips. \u201cQualcomm came to control so much of the chip market in China,\u201d said Louie Ming, a former Qualcomm executive in China. \u201cIt was clear they were eventually going to run into antitrust problems.\u201dWhile Qualcomm agreed to fully cooperate with the investigation, some senior executives appealed to the Obama administration, pressing the White House to raise the issue with China\u2019s senior leaders, according to a former administration official.Qualcomm\u2019s troubles went beyond China. The company was also under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the European Union and South Korea, as well as by the United States Federal Trade Commission.China didn\u2019t back down. The head of the N.D.R.C. branded Qualcomm a monopoly.In February 2015, after a 15-month-long investigation, Qualcomm settled allegations in China that it had charged unfairly high prices for its chips and patents. The company agreed to pay the $975 million fine \u2014 about 8 percent of its annual revenue in China \u2014 and to lower the prices for chips sold in the country.\u201cWe are pleased that the resolution has removed the uncertainty surrounding our business in China, and we will now focus our full attention and resources on supporting our customers and partners in China,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.Qualcomm then went into business with the Chinese government.There was a $150 million investment fund to help Chinese start-ups; new research and design facilities set up with Chinese companies such as Huawei and Tencent; and a partnership with a Beijing-based company called Thundersoft to develop drones, virtual reality goggles and internet-connected devices.Qualcomm is also helping the Chinese government develop supercomputers, a technology the United States government has discouraged American companies from supporting overseas. In May, Qualcomm agreed to form a joint venture with other state-backed firms to design and sell mass-market smartphone chips. And to help make Chinese chip manufacturing more competitive, Qualcomm has pledged to shift more of its high-end production \u2014 long done by outside contractors in Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 to China.\u201cThis is what China does better than anyone else,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank focused on technology policy that has conducted studies detailing the Chinese government\u2019s pressure on technology companies.\u201cThey have a large carrot and a large stick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have a market no C.E.O. can walk away from.\u201dQualcomm\u2019s biggest new venture is taking shape in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou Province. Determined to leap into advanced technology, China has designated a large parcel of land in the provincial capital of Guiyang as the home of a new industrial park for supercomputing, data centers and cloud computing. The country\u2019s large state-run telecom operators and its internet behemoths, including Alibaba and Tencent, are moving in, to build massive server farms. The region offers lower energy costs and abundant supplies of water, necessary to cool server farms.A year ago, Qualcomm set up a joint venture with the Guizhou government and pledged to invest about $140 million for a minority stake in the business, situated in a development zone that has also attracted the interest of Microsoft and Dell. Qualcomm says it received American government approval for the deal.The new Qualcomm joint venture, Huaxintong Semiconductor, broke ground on the site in 2016, and now operates in a 46,000-square-foot design and engineering center. A major test of the partnership will come when the joint venture\u2019s first server chips are released \u2014 helping Qualcomm and the Chinese government stake out new ground. The Chinese government will control the chips and reap most of the profits.In late March, Qualcomm\u2019s president, Derek K. Aberle, flew to Guizhou to meet a powerful local government leader, Chen Miner, a confidant of the Chinese president. Seated in a government hall, before an enormous landscape painting, Mr. Aberle pledged to \u201ccontinually cooperate\u201d with the Chinese government.A headline last Sunday with an article about Qualcomm\u2019s efforts in China misidentified the location of the company\u2019s headquarters. It is based in San Diego, not Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, it made some headway, resolving a dispute with the luxury goods giant Kering.They said in a statement that they would establish a task force to share information and work with law enforcement to protect Kering\u2019s brands. The companies will also make use of Alibaba\u2019s technology to seek out fakes.Unlike Amazon, much of Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce site is dominated by marketplaces run by third-party vendors. The company has argued that it can be tricky to perfectly police such a bewildering number of small online shops, selling all manner of goods. Its situation is also made difficult by the widespread prevalence of fake goods in China more generally.Alibaba has said it is using increasingly sophisticated technology, including artificial intelligence, to track down fakes. In a report submitted to the United States trade representative last year, the Chinese company said that its systems could scan 10 million product listings a day. These checks had led it to take down 380 million suspect listings, it said, in a 12-month period.Advertisement"}

Now, the companies are in a very public fight.The lawsuit came as a surprise to Uber\u2019s directors, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.The battle has caused other technology investors to question Benchmark\u2019s tactics.The new Silicon Valley may be in China.Alibaba and Tencent are among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, with market capitalizations twice as big as the longtime tech leaders Intel, Cisco and IBM.They have joined an elite club of tech companies worth $400 billion and up that has been dominated by American businesses: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where China has finally caught up with the U.S. in the internet space,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at the venture capital firm GGV Capital.Alibaba and Tencent have grown to prominence by dominating e-commerce and online life in China, the world\u2019s largest internet market. Their growth has come as Western companies, such as Facebook, have been blocked by the country\u2019s tight internet controls.This week, Alibaba and Tencent reported financial results that were well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations and point to the growing influence of technology on the Chinese economy.Tencent is expected to soon become the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than a billion users, while Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. The Chinese companies\u2019 revenue also grew at a faster pace in the past three months than at Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These included Jack Welch, the retired leader of General Electric, and W. James McNerney Jr., the former head of Boeing, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak about it.Their reasoning was a combination of patriotism and the hopes of salvaging a pro-business agenda.They did not succeed in persuading their peers, and the council disbanded in protest over comments by President Trump equating the actions of far-right hate groups with protesters opposing them, after a violent confrontation in Charlottesville, Va.The episode has highlighted the varied approach companies have taken in response, and the outside pressures leaders of public companies face.\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}

Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn.The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts.Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues.Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon\u2019s cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall.While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale.

Is it for buying booze? Subverting the state? Many simply want to play a game on their phones.But the game\u2019s popularity among the young has alarmed Chinese officials. In response, Tencent has added restrictions that limit those under age 12 to an hour of play a day, and those between 12 and 18 to two hours a day.As savvy Chinese internet users have done for years, many players have found workarounds.One is Min Jingxi, a 17-year-old student. She plays the game as many as five or six hours a day during her summer vacation \u2014 often as a character named Wang Zhaojun, a famous beauty from Chinese history \u2014 thanks to a fake identity she has established online.\u201cIf you don\u2019t do real-name verification for your new accounts, the system has no way to know how old you are, so there won\u2019t be any limits,\u201d Ms. Min said. \u201cI have two accounts, and most of my friends also do this to bypass the restrictions.\u201dHonor of Kings offers swashbuckling sword-and-sorcery action through characters familiar to Chinese players. The game pits one team of up to five players against another in a magical land. Adding to its addictive gameplay, friends can fight with or against one another in private rooms and see each others\u2019 scores on social media.So it goes with Honor of Kings.Xianyu, an online secondhand trading platform, carries listings that offer to sell adult IDs for as little as $2, and tutorials on more ways to circumvent the restrictions. Game accounts started by others can sell for $30 to $500, depending on how powerful and well-equipped the accounts are.Tencent said in a statement that it was seeking to stop workarounds by younger players. \u201cWe are going to continue to cooperate with the government and make a joint effort to tackle this problem,\u201d the statement said.Xianyu is owned by the Alibaba Group, China\u2019s e-commerce giant.A representative for Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment.Tencent so far has borne the brunt of official pressure, but experts say the Chinese government and the internet industry should work together to develop ratings systems and other methods to help govern how much time children spend playing the games.\u201cMere restrictions through technical means aren\u2019t sufficient to prevent game addicts, but can actually be counterproductive and increase its social influence instead, bringing more publicity and interests to the game,\u201d said Tian Feng, the deputy director of the Juvenile and Social Problems Department at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Honor of Kings caters to Chinese sensibilities. Players can take the guise of figures from China\u2019s past or its legends. Like many games, players can use real-world money to make their characters more powerful. Players can connect through WeChat, Tencent\u2019s social-messaging and e-commerce app, which it says has nearly a billion users.The game presents Chinese parents with a question well known in other countries: How much screen time should their children be allowed?\u201cNow it\u2019s summer vacation, so I think my son can play a bit more because almost all of his classmates are playing,\u201d said Ma Hong, mother of a third-grade student in Beijing. \u201cYou certainly don\u2019t want your son to be left out in his social life at school.\u201d\u201cIt used to be a Western-games dominated world,\u201d Mr. Jiang said, \u201cbut I hope China will have more games like the Honor of Kings in the future.\u201dCarolyn Zhang reported from Shanghai and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his. I proposed that I escort him in the game. Soon after that, we had the contract signed.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong. Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Sprint, Looking to Get Bigger to Survive, Weighs Deal-Making", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reason is clear. Sprint, controlled by Mr. Son\u2019s SoftBank, has long lagged behind the two titans of American wireless, Verizon and AT&T, each of which has more subscribers than Sprint and T-Mobile combined. Mr. Son has never let go of the idea that Sprint needs to get bigger to survive, and has had on-again, off-again discussions with T-Mobile.Now, SoftBank is busy exploring a complex takeover of Charter Communications, the cable giant whose empire stretches from New York City to Los Angeles.During a quarterly earnings call last week, Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, said that a final announcement about any deal \u201cshould be coming in the near future.\u201d He did not elaborate.Sprint has had to acknowledge that it would have a tough time thriving on its own. From the company\u2019s perspective, combining with Charter would make sense.Broadband providers have been eager to find other ways to drive up revenue, and wireless has been one avenue that cable operators have dived into. Charter and Comcast formed an alliance this spring to explore wireless opportunities. Already, Comcast has begun offering its subscribers mobile service through Verizon, with Charter expected to follow suit.From Sprint\u2019s perspective, a cable company would help give the telecom company the wired backbone it needs to upgrade its wireless service to 5G. While Verizon and AT&T have been investing billions into bolstering their networks, Sprint has had far fewer resources to do so.\u201cThe potential additional synergies that you have in doing a strategic transaction will always be significantly better than having a stand-alone entity,\u201d Mr. Claure said on the earnings call.But Mr. Son does face some hurdles, starting with a recalcitrant Charter. The cable operator\u2019s chief executive, Tom Rutledge, holds options that come into the money when his company\u2019s share price reaches $564. Right now, Charter trades at about $385, meaning that SoftBank would need to pay dearly to bring him to the table.And even with banks willing to lend to SoftBank to finance a deal, the amount of debt involved would be breathtaking. Sprint carried roughly $34.5 billion of long-term debt on its books as of March 31, while Charter had $63 billion. SoftBank itself held some $135 billion in long-term debt.Then there is Comcast. Under the terms of the pact between the two cable operators, each must assent to a deal that the other strikes with a wireless company.Craig Moffett, a research analyst at MoffettNathanson, warned that, ultimately, Sprint\u2019s repeated and public attempts to make a deal could prove costly if it doesn\u2019t end up with a partner.\u201cLike an unsold house that has sat too long on the market, an asset that has been shopped too often without success\u201d takes on an unsavory air, he wrote in a research note last week. \u201cEquity investors might reasonably ask why each company that has had access to even a cursory due diligence has so quickly said \u2018no\u2019 and moved on.\u201dAn article on Monday about deals being considered by Sprint misstated the timing of two statements about possible deals. Charter Communications said last week \u2014 not this week \u2014 that it had no interest in buying Sprint. And Sprint\u2019s chief executive also said last week \u2014 not this week \u2014 that an announcement on any deal could be coming in the near future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Washington Tries to Protect Tech, China Could Fight Back", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration moves to take on China over intellectual property, Washington will find it has limited firepower. Beijing has a strong grip on American technology companies, and global trade rules could favor China.But China can play a strong defense. The country has broad latitude, under special rules it negotiated with the World Trade Organization, to maintain restrictions within its market.\u201cThe problem is that U.S. trade negotiators agreed to provisions allowing China to limit market access for U.S. companies unless they engaged in joint ventures,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which Congress created to monitor the relationship between the two countries.\u201cPotential Chinese partners demand the family jewels,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies can say no, but too many give in to Chinese pressure to make a quick buck.\u201dThe current trade frictions trace back to the Clinton administration.When China was entering the W.T.O. in 1999 and 2000, American negotiators gave Beijing some leeway, a position later supported by the administration of George W. Bush. As a developing country, China was allowed extra protections, such as requirements that companies in critical industries work with Chinese partners. China, in return, promised to shed the extra rules gradually as its economy matured.But Beijing did not open up, even as China evolved into an economic powerhouse. Quite the opposite has happened under President Xi Jinping, who has pursued a more nationalistic agenda than his reform-minded predecessors.China now sees the technology sector as a critical piece of its industrial policy \u2014 a policy that Beijing is aggressively enlisting American tech giants to support and that the leadership will most likely go all out to protect.Beijing\u2019s demands have been partly driven by security concerns, particularly after disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, of electronic spying by the United States on China\u2019s rapid military buildup.China has also been explicit about its economic motives, seeking to dominate fast-growing global industries that could create millions of well-paid jobs for a generation of increasingly well-educated young Chinese.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.In several cases, China\u2019s strategy to control technology approaches the kind of oversight most countries reserve for industries serving the military or government.In the chip sector, a major initiative intended to lift Chinese capabilities has drafted America\u2019s biggest makers of the electronic brains that run everything from smartphones to driverless cars. Over the past four years, America\u2019s largest chip companies have entered into a dizzying network of partnerships unlike anything they have anywhere else.Qualcomm works with a company in southwest China to develop server chips. In 2014, Intel signed agreements with two Chinese chip makers, Spreadtrum and Rockchip, to give it a leg up in the market for China\u2019s smartphones and tablets. Last year, Intel agreed to a partnership with the influential Tsinghua University in China as part of a bid to make server chips that match local specifications.American technology companies can find themselves at a serious disadvantage in China unless they agree to cooperate with government-linked Chinese businesses.Take cloud computing, the fast-growing business of leasing computer power to companies. Chinese laws require foreign companies to join with local partners and allow them only a minority stake. International businesses are also blocked from branding such services under their own names.Both Microsoft and Amazon, dominant forces in cloud computing in the United States, have local partnerships in China. By contrast, China\u2019s e-commerce giant Alibaba operates two data centers in the United States without any partner.Another rule calls for data about Chinese consumers or business operations to be stored in China. Apple and Amazon recently set up data centers in China, again with local partners, to store more customer information in the country.Against that backdrop, the call for trade action is attracting bipartisan support.China can make its own play under global trade rules. Beijing can quickly demand binding arbitration \u2014 and could have a good chance of winning. China was allowed into the W.T.O. with very few limits on its ability to regulate services or foreign investment, two categories in which China was fairly weak when it entered the organization in 2001.If China did win a W.T.O. case, it would then have the right to restrict American exports to the same extent that the United States restricts Chinese imports.China consistently exports four times as much to the United States as it imports. Even so, China could penalize American companies like Apple and Starbucks that have very large operations that produce and sell in China with minimal imports from the United States.\u201cU.S. negotiators, I think, basically dropped the ball,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a longtime trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to the rules on services that were negotiated when China entered the W.T.O. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think China was very important.\u201dOn Twitter follow Keith Bradsher, @KeithBradsher, and Paul Mozur, @PaulMozurPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Online Giants Back $12 Billion Deal to Shake Up State Firm", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Some of China\u2019s biggest technology players are backing a plan to invest nearly $12 billion in one of the country\u2019s telecommunications giants, the latest move in a broader government push to shake up the country\u2019s bloated state-run companies.But it is an effort that, so far, has left experts unimpressed.Chinese leaders hope more private investors will push the leaders of state-run companies to pare down wasteful businesses and shift to more productive ways to make money. It would also put experienced managers in boardrooms and spur more professional practices.Since the plan was announced, under the firm guidance of Beijing, some state-run companies have sought out investments from private firms as well as state-run companies from other industries.In the case of China Unicom, the country\u2019s three biggest internet companies are investing: Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant; Tencent Holdings, which runs China\u2019s most popular social-messaging service; and Baidu, the online search company that is sometimes called the Google of China. The biggest new shareholder would be China Life Insurance, a state-run firm, which would have about a 10 percent stake, China Unicom said.\u201cThere is an immediate, serious problem with this initiative in that the best outcome is more competition, not cooperation\u201d between state companies and private firms, said Derek Scissors, a China-focused resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.\u201cIt still could be an improvement over the current situation, if private firms are permitted to genuinely change S.O.E. practices,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. He added, however, \u201cThere\u2019s been no evidence of this yet.\u201d\u201cIt seems for the last two-and-a-half years the tide has been moving toward state capital at the expense of private capital,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a partner at Gavekal, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not very encouraging.\u201dStill, China Unicom\u2019s deal has the potential to be different because some successful private companies are involved, Mr. Kroeber said.\u201cThis can be fairly interpreted as a signal that there\u2019s a fairly serious effort to restart this mixed ownership reform in more or less the format that was originally planned,\u201d he said.China\u2019s technology firms have quickly outmaneuvered state-run telecom businesses, with social-messaging apps that replaced text messaging and by building their own e-commerce networks. While state-owned firms have built the highways, private companies have learned how to go the fastest.Martin Lau, president of Tencent, told investors on an earnings call on Wednesday that the deal represents a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in China\u2019s economic overhaul effort, and added that Tencent does not expect the deal to result in more regulatory pressure on the company. An Alibaba spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other companies involved include JD.com, which like Tencent is an Alibaba rival, suggesting the new shareholders may not always have the same agenda.Under Wednesday\u2019s deal, the company that is China Unicom\u2019s immediate shareholder will sell new and existing shares to the new owners. The largest shareholder of that company will remain China United Network Communications Group, China Unicom\u2019s state-controlled ultimate parent.Paul Mozur contributed reporting in Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, SoftBank Tries, Tries Again", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSoftBank\u2019s Indian shopping spree is venture capital with a kick.The Japanese conglomerate\u2019s Vision Fund is investing $2.5 billion in the online retailer Flipkart, effectively rendering worthless an earlier bet of nearly $1 billion on a rival start-up, Snapdeal. The investment ranks as the largest private bet on an Indian tech company. But it also shines a light on the SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s big-ticket investment flops.Mr. Son\u2019s company was the largest investor in Snapdeal, making bets at valuations worth up to $5 billion. But Snapdeal fell behind in India\u2019s e-commerce race. It was worth less than $1 billion by the time Mr. Son tried and failed to force a merger with Flipkart, which is now worth at least $12 billion. The decision to invest directly in Flipkart implies the Japanese company has given up on recovering value from the smaller company.The Vision Fund, a $90-billion-odd investment vehicle managed by SoftBank, will now have a large but noncontrolling stake in Flipkart. It is Amazon\u2019s main domestic rival in the battle for dominance of India\u2019s online retail market, which Forrester Research reckons will be worth $64 billion in annual sales by 2021. But Mr. Son may lack the influence to guide Flipkart to a merger with the retail unit of Paytm, another Indian start-up that is backed by Alibaba, the Chinese giant partly owned by SoftBank.Earlier this week, Mr. Son talked about the need to have a \u201cblood kind of relationship\u201d with companies in which SoftBank invests. But Snapdeal represents the second time he has lost control of the founders of a prominent Indian start-up. The first was at Housing.com, which fired its co-founder and chief executive after he pledged to give away his entire stake in the company to employees and attacked the board as intellectually incapable. The Japanese company ended up taking a back seat when Housing.com merged with a rival earlier this year.The mess in India vividly illustrates the conventional wisdom that most start-ups fail. But the sheer size and high-profile nature of Mr. Son\u2019s exploits make the misses more astonishing. This is venture capital, but on an epic scale.Advertisement"}
