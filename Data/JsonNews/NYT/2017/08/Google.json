I\u2019m Worried for My Students.", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHOUSTON \u2014 I\u2019m sitting in a bedroom in my friend\u2019s house in southwest Houston, terrified for my city. The rain has poured down nonstop since Friday. I\u2019m lucky to be safe and dry, but I worry for the thousands of others who are not as fortunate \u2014 particularly many of my students.One of my students was being evacuated when I called to check up on her. I can only imagine what she and other kids are going through right now.We should be making lesson plans and study schedules. Now we\u2019re worried about students who don\u2019t have shelter or enough food.My phone has been buzzing for days with alerts about tornadoes and flash floods. My friends and I text one another images of the roads we once drove on that are now under water or have collapsed. Heartbreaking photos of friends and students who need to be rescued are circulating on Facebook and Instagram.My experience of the storm started when I came home on Thursday from work, where I\u2019d been preparing for the coming school year. A carefully folded letter from my apartment complex\u2019s managers had been slipped into the gate to my patio:\u201cWe are asking you to begin thinking about preparations,\u201d it read.My stomach dropped.\u201cIf an evacuation order is given by government officials, we encourage you to follow their recommendations as we will,\u201d the letter went on. \u201cAs a result, our team members are unable to access the community, so you will need to be prepared to go several days without assistance of our management/maintenance team.\u201dI felt a rush of feelings, but particularly residual trauma from the tornadoes and the storms I had already endured back home in Alabama, especially Hurricanes Katrina and Ike.I steeled myself and immediately went to gather supplies. I knew the Walmart on Westheimer would be packed, so I headed for the Family Dollar store on Dairy Ashford Road. All of the shopping carts were gone, so I got a bucket from the cleaning section.There was fear and determination in the air. People hurried through the aisles to get the things they most needed. They exchanged stories about surviving storms like this before. The line to check out grew with every passing moment as I made my way from one section to the next.I was baffled by the sight of people buying charcoal and barbecue grills until I heard one woman say to another, \u201cGirl, if the lights go out, I can still try and cook for my kids.\u201d I bought the second-to-last grill left on the shelf. We were all making a way out of no way.Later that night, the school district sent out a notice that schools would be closed Friday. I still felt safe enough in my split-level apartment in the Alief area, in West Houston, since a colleague who had lived there for about six years was also staying. We could at least keep each other from going stir-crazy.But when I took out my trash Friday morning, my colleague was packing up her car to head to her brother\u2019s house in North Houston.With that, my safety net was gone. I was terrified and I felt trapped. My ground-floor patio had already flooded, so I started making phone calls to take people up on their offers to stay with them. And I wasn\u2019t alone. I had a pregnant houseguest who\u2019d also recently gotten a teaching job in Houston. She\u2019s staying with me until she can move her family from Alabama. I needed a place where we could both be safe, but many of the people I called said they couldn\u2019t take the two of us.On Friday afternoon, I finally got a yes from a friend in Missouri City, just southwest of Houston. We\u2019ve been here in her two-bedroom apartment since then.All the while, I\u2019ve been reaching out to my students to make sure they\u2019re all right. Their lives matter to me. I hope they will all be able to recover from this. Our students\u2019 safety is paramount, but the state must get the kids back in school as soon as possible.Teachers in Houston are willing to do just about anything to support their education. We\u2019ll call, Google chat or Skype students if that\u2019s what it takes to have class. We\u2019ll help to build a makeshift school so our students can continue to learn.Meanwhile, it just keeps raining.Lisa Lyne\u00e9 Daniels is a high school history teacher.Advertisement"}

The company, which lets folks upload songs to the cloud while others congregate and comment on the tracks, has grown immensely popular over the years. But it has that one big problem that seems to catch up with all Silicon Valley companies: It needs to build itself a viable, long-term business.It appears they\u2019ve come to a compromise. The company will raise another pile of money, on the condition that they bring in a new C.E.O. in a move which, I assume, means bringing in an \u201cadult\u201d to grow the business.It\u2019s not really uncommon among Valley companies, I\u2019d say. Everyone always points to Eric Schmidt or Sheryl Sandberg coming in to help the founders of Google and Facebook, respectively, with building a viable long-term company. And it worked!I do wonder, though, about SoundCloud\u2019s chances. The music industry is particularly brutal. Go ask Pandora, Rdio and Spotify.Moving on, Bitcoin is surging to record highs on a near daily basis. On Friday, it was at well over $3,500 per single Bitcoin, which is being compared to the volatility of the gold markets. Perhaps people have decided to diversify their portfolios in light of the looming threat of nuclear escalation? Risk-aversion in the time of war is funny to me, if not terribly ironic.At this point, nothing surprises me about what\u2019s going on over there. But where do you stand on this? This is certainly not common among Silicon Valley company boards, right?If you haven\u2019t been paying attention, last weekend a Google employee\u2019s 10-page memo on Google culture went viral internally and created quite a controversy with some of its assertions, which included specious reasoning around why women were not as prevalent in engineering positions at the company.The way this played out has been extraordinary and yet predictable, a narrative in which corporate culture has been highly politicized because of the current divisive tenor of American cultural discourse.I\u2019m just curious for your perspective on it, and where you think it may head from here.Thanks, Katie, see you soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spain, a Leader in Foiling Attacks, Falls Victim to One Anyway", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than a decade, Spain seemed immune to the steady eruptions of Islamist violence that rocked other European countries where radicalized young men, often from poor immigrant backgrounds, carried out devastating bomb, gun or vehicular attacks.Spain\u2019s security forces carved out a reputation as some of Europe\u2019s most dogged counterterrorism operators, fighting an intense battle beneath a deceptively placid surface in a country whose long Mediterranean coastline, just across from Morocco, makes it an inviting entry point into Europe for jihadists.But the illusion of a Spanish haven was shattered Thursday when a van swerved down Las Ramblas, Barcelona\u2019s famous pedestrian boulevard, leaving behind a trail of bodies including 13 dead and about 100 injured. Another person was killed in a second attack at a nearby seaside resort that ended when the police shot dead five suspected assailants.Now, the authorities are rushing to answer how a group that included teenagers was able to carry out a well-planned and coordinated attack in a country that has parried danger for so long, despite being such a tempting and symbolic target for Islamists.\u201cFor the jihadis, Spain is still very much a front-line country,\u201d said Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University professor who has advised the American government on terrorism.\u201cThe Spanish authorities are at the top of the game in Europe,\u201d said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \u201cMy sense is they have been extremely successful in identifying and disrupting attacks.\u201dGalvanized by the 2004 Madrid attacks in the same way the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks served as a wake-up call for Americans, the Spaniards built on their decades of experience in fighting ETA, the Basque separatist movement, and introduced a raft of laws that helped to disrupt radical cells.But counterterrorism is partly a matter of luck, and on Thursday Spain\u2019s ran out with a plot whose size and complexity offered a sobering reality check.Some of the young men involved in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils were teenagers, and investigators believe they had lived double lives as they planned the attacks for a year at a house in Alcanar, a sleepy town 120 miles down the coast from Barcelona.The economic boom in Catalonia, home to just over a quarter of Spain\u2019s almost two million Muslim residents, has attracted large numbers of Muslim migrants from Morocco, Algeria and South Asia. But many struggled to integrate and were drawn to clusters of radical Salafi mosques that sprang up around a handful of smaller towns.As far back as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, investigators found themselves scrutinizing the area.But Spain does not loom as a primary focus for Islamist militants. Although a staunch NATO ally, the country has been a marginal player in the United States\u2019 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even as they aggressively intercepted terrorist cells, Spain\u2019s leaders have prided themselves on their efforts to integrate Muslims into mainstream Spanish society.Despite an economic crash and high unemployment since the 2008 financial crisis, Spain has not seen the emergence of hard-line, anti-Muslim political movements as elsewhere in Europe.Around 200 Spanish residents are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the fighting there \u2014 a fraction of the hundreds who have gone from countries like Britain and France.Yet Spain cannot escape its symbolic attraction for Islamists that is rooted deep in its history. Between the eighth and 15th centuries a large part of the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by Muslim caliphs, and extremist websites often speak fancifully about a return to the era of Al-Andalus, as medieval Spain was known.And despite its efforts at integration, Spain has struggled with extremist currents inside its Moroccan communities, in much the same way as British officials deal with Pakistani communities or the French with residents of Tunisian or Algerian descent.That problem is linked to Spain\u2019s close, if sometimes testy, historical relationship with Morocco, which accounts for much of the country\u2019s Muslim migration.Over 1,600 Moroccans have joined the Islamic State in Syria and Libya, according to Morocco\u2019s Interior Ministry, and security experts believe there are hundreds of sympathizers inside the country.Spanish counterterrorism relies heavily on cooperation with the Moroccan security forces, who have successfully penetrated migrant communities across Europe through a strong network of informants, despite concerns from human rights groups about their methods, Mr. Amrani said.While it has cut costs in other areas, the Spanish government raised both the staff numbers and the budget this year for its intelligence services. Toughened antiterrorism legislation has allowed the authorities to arrest suspects at an earlier stage of attack planning than in Britain and elsewhere.Until this week\u2019s spate of attacks, 54 people had been arrested this year on suspicion of terrorist activity in Spain, where the threat of returnees from Syria is deemed relatively small.But like so many intelligence agencies in Europe, the Spanish are overwhelmed by the volume of potential terrorism plots they are trying to monitor, said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corporation.\u201cThey\u2019re totally swamped with leads,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way they can cover all their current open cases.\u201dAida Alami contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dramatic Rescues Unfold All Across Waterlogged Houston", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The rain had begun to fall again on Sunday afternoon when there was a roar over Interstate 610. A Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter was hovering overhead, a rescuer and a resident joined together by a harness and arms.The men touched down in an emptied traffic lane. They unhooked from each other. Seconds later, the rescuer and his helicopter were off again.And Robert Durbin, 33, was left to find his wife, Danielle, who had been airlifted in her pajamas minutes earlier. Shoeless, he ran through the parking lot that had sprung up on the interstate, searching, his eyes scanning the cars and vans. He soon found her in a television crew\u2019s vehicle.They had been on the roof of their home since about 8 a.m., and they expected all of their possessions, except those in the attic, would be lost. \u201cThat was insane,\u201d Mr. Durbin said of his family\u2019s ordeal.The Durbins, whose first task after being reunited was to retrieve their daughters, who were at a relative\u2019s house, were hardly alone in being plucked to safety. Houston Sunday was a study in desperate improvisation, streets and highways turned into rivers, boats and helicopters more useful than cars, and dramatic rescues taking place virtually everywhere one looked.The National Guard and a flotilla of private boat operators swarmed Houston in search of residents in distress, many of whom had been frantically calling the authorities for help all day long. Stranded residents mounted the backs of some soldiers, who waded through thigh-high waters to take evacuees to trucks that would drive them to safety.During a break from Sunday\u2019s rain, the unflooded stretch of interstate near the Meyerland Plaza shopping center in southwest Houston became an impromptu staging area for emergency responders and volunteers offering up powerboats, kayaks and rafts.On the highways, some motorists, stalled themselves, got out and tried to push others to safety. People searched their phones for traffic alerts and safe passages. Even National Guard soldiers traveling in civilian vehicles were left to consult Google Maps.Once residents were rescued, whether by emergency officials or volunteers, they were typically unsure of where they would spend Sunday night and beyond.National Guard soldiers used a Chevrolet van to ferry rescued passengers across still more flooded water to another dry area, where they would be relocated once again.\u201cThey\u2019re going to take you from there to a shelter or something like that,\u201d Maj. Randy Stillinger of the Texas Army National Guard told some of his passengers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s better than being here.\u201dHe added, \u201cI wish I could do so much more for you.\u201dDuring one ride, a woman asked if she would be safe in her eventual destination: \u201cIt\u2019s high enough that we\u2019re not going to drown?\u201dThe rescues and searches played out all day.Raoul Njobi earlier in the afternoon had shouted to the men launching a small motorized boat into a flooded out section of interstate. Begging for help, he explained that his sister was trapped in her car. He thought she was nearby, but her phone\u2019s battery had gone dead.\u201cShe\u2019s got a Ford Fiesta, white,\u201d Mr. Njobi said as the men tried to back their boat into the floodwaters.\u201cThere\u2019s people stranded left and right,\u201d said the pilot of the boat where Mr. Njobi made his plea. \u201cThere\u2019s kids and pregnant women all over.\u201dMr. Njobi, in what looked like a swimsuit, anxiously told his tale.\u201cI was talking to her, but now the communication doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cHer phone is dead, and we aren\u2019t able to communicate.\u201dThe last time the two spoke, Mr. Njobi said, the water had begun to come into his sister\u2019s car.\u201cI told her to stay on the top of the car and wait and wave so people can see her,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on exactly.\u201dThe men in the boat listened, then backed the boat off the trailer and into the water on what is ordinarily an exit lane for South Post Oak Road. Then they floated off in the direction Mr. Njobi pointed, as Mr. Njobi stood on a patch of dry land and watched.At midday Sunday, nine National Guard vehicles were parked along the stretch of interstate. Soldiers in life jackets and camouflage pants were scrambling into a boat to make rescues in a nearby area, and they expected to be kept busy for hours.Beatriz Abelenda sat in the front seat of a National Guard van, her poncho dry and the vehicle\u2019s emergency flashers clicking. Her home, close to Interstate 610, had not flooded. But she could not get to it.\u201cI was just trying to get home, and here we are,\u201d said Ms. Abelenda, whose son had managed to get to the house around lunch time and reported that it was still on dry land.Ms. Abelenda, who has lived in Houston for her entire life, said that even in Harvey\u2019s early assault on Houston, she had never seen a storm so bad. Not Tropical Storm Alison in 2001. Not Hurricane Ike in 2008.\u201cI would say it\u2019s the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s just going to get worse. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to get any better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For one, I rarely get lost now that I always have a GPS device in my pocket. After lots of practice with your camera, I\u2019ve become a decent photographer. And I\u2019m more punctual and responsive thanks to constant access to my calendar and email.\u201cPeople spend hours on it every day, so they can justify paying more for what they believe to be the best device,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who has studied Apple for years and called the company\u2019s positioning of the iPhone \u201cunique.\u201dMany eyes are now on Apple\u2019s 10th anniversary event for the iPhone, which is expected to be held next month. There, Apple is set to introduce major upgrades for the next iPhones, which could stoke our appetites again for the gadget. Or not.Chief among the changes for the new iPhones: refreshed versions, including a premium model priced at around $999, according to people briefed on the product, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apple made room for a bigger screen on that model by reducing the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Other new features include facial recognition for unlocking the device, along with the ability to charge it with magnetic induction, the people said.Here\u2019s a look back at the last 10 years of why the iPhone still has us in its grip \u2014 so much that people keep coming back for more.The role of Apple stores in keeping people loyal to iPhones cannot be overstated. The Apple stores include the so-called Genius Bar for getting repairs, so when things go wrong with an iPhone, you can simply schedule a repair appointment at the nearest location.Security experts agree that the iPhone\u2019s operating system is architecturally more secure than Android. The main reason is that Apple\u2019s iOS can only run apps that Apple approved to be distributed in the App Store. By contrast, Android phones are capable of running software from outside of Google\u2019s official app store, and apps from unauthorized sources are more likely to carry malware.The trade-off for stronger security, of course, is flexibility. Android users are free to tinker with their devices using custom software, while iPhone customers can only use apps that play by Apple\u2019s rules.\u201cThe iPhone is still arguably the best phone for regular people who just want their device to work without having to worry about lots of technical settings or malware,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research.Software updates are another factor in security. Apple issues its own software updates, making it easy for iPhones to get the latest security enhancements. By contrast, Android device makers have to coordinate software updates with carriers, making the process more complicated and time consuming.IPhones work well with other Apple devices like Macs and the Apple TV. Once you invest in other Apple products, it\u2019s tough to leave the ecosystem. The Apple Watch makes it especially tough: It requires an iPhone to work properly. So if you were to switch to Android, prepare for your smart watch to transform into a dumb watch.Less sticky is Apple\u2019s ecosystem of apps and web services. For every major Apple app, including Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple Photos, there are alternatives like Google Maps, Spotify and Google Photos. It\u2019s difficult to resist using iMessage, Apple\u2019s default text messaging service. But there are plenty of alternatives like WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Signal.Mr. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein said Apple had created a \u201cbrand halo\u201d for the iPhone by positioning it as a premium product with easy-to-use software and high-quality features, components and capabilities.Notably, among current iPhone customers surveyed by 451 Research, 91 percent of those who planned on buying a new smartphone in the near future said they intended to buy another iPhone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Contentious Memo Strikes Nerve Inside Google and Out", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After leaving Harvard\u2019s doctorate program in systems biology to join Google as a software engineer in 2013, James Damore joked on his Facebook page that he knew he had made the right move as he enjoyed a morning smoothie with oats. It was the type of workplace perk that is standard for Google employees.That initial assessment of Google seemed far removed from the contentious memo written by the 28-year-old Mr. Damore last week that has enraged advocates of greater diversity in the technology industry. The memo has also served as a rallying cry for conservatives and the alt-right who view Google \u2014 and Silicon Valley \u2014 as a bastion of groupthink where people with different opinions are shamed into silence.The memo was originally posted on an internal mailing list and was shared widely inside the company and throughout Silicon Valley. It struck a nerve and was harshly criticized inside a company and an entire industry struggling to explain why women are underrepresented in key engineering ranks and are often underpaid when compared with their male peers.In a short email exchange on Monday after his firing, Mr. Damore, who was a senior software engineer in Google\u2019s search division, said he had not expected this type of reaction when he shared his missive last week.\u201cAs far as I know, I have a legal right to express my concerns about the terms and conditions of my working environment and to bring up potentially illegal behavior, which is what my document does,\u201d he said. Mr. Damore said he would probably take legal action against the company.Like many new hires at Google, Mr. Damore boasted an impressive academic background. A competitive player of chess and computer strategy video games, he studied molecular and cellular biology at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, according to an online r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He conducted research in computational biology at Harvard, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining a Ph.D. program at Harvard. He dropped out before completing the program.In a footnote for his memo, Mr. Damore said he considered himself a \u201cclassical liberal,\u201d an ideology associated with advocacy of free market economics and libertarianism.\u201cDespite what the public response seems to have been, I\u2019ve gotten many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up those very important issues which they agree with but would never have the courage to say or defend because of our shaming culture and the possibility of getting fired,\u201d Mr. Damore wrote in an addendum to his original memo. \u201cThis needs to change.\u201dOthers outside the company came to Mr. Damore\u2019s defense. Eric Weinstein, a managing director at Thiel Capital, an investment firm run by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and supporter of President Trump, said Google was sending the wrong message to women.\u201cIt\u2019s insidious and it\u2019s all around the culture,\u201d Ms. Smith said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.The flap over Mr. Damore\u2019s criticism of Google\u2019s diversity efforts comes as the company has tangled with the Labor Department over its pay practices. The department has not charged Google with any wrongdoing, but a department official said there was evidence that the company systematically paid women less than men. Google denies this is the case.Mr. Damore\u2019s comments also raised another issue around Google\u2019s peer-review system. Employees at the company are expected to judge their colleague\u2019s work in a peer-review process that is essential to deciding whether someone gets promoted. By expressing certain beliefs \u2014 such as that women are more prone to anxiety \u2014 the concern was that he could no longer be impartial in judging female co-workers.For a company steeped in a rich history of encouraging unconventional thinking, the problem was not that he expressed an unpopular opinion, but a disrespectful one, according to Yonatan Zunger, who left Google last week after 14 years at the company to join a start-up.\u201cWe have a long history of disagreement over everything from technical issues to policy issues to the most mundane aspects of building management, and over all, that has been tremendously valuable,\u201d Mr. Zunger said in an email. \u201cThe problem here was that this was disrespectful disagreement \u2014 and there\u2019s really no respectful way to say, \u2018I think you and people like you aren\u2019t as qualified to do your job as people like me.\u201dWesley Chan, a venture capitalist at Felicis Ventures and an early Google employee who left the company in 2014, said Google had no choice but to fire Mr. Damore.\u201cIt\u2019s not about free discourse,\u201d said Mr. Chan. \u201cIt\u2019s about advancing a fringe viewpoint which is hurtful to a large population of the company.\u201dThe legal argument for Mr. Damore\u2019s dismissal is more complicated. On one hand, there may be a way to argue that the memo and its recommendations \u2014 such as \u201cstop alienating conservatives\u201d \u2014 constitute a \u201cconcerted activity\u201d to aid and protect his fellow workers, which may be protected under federal labor law. However, Google can argue that his memo created a hostile workplace for women.\u201cThere\u2019s no free speech in the private sector workplace,\u201d said Katherine Stone, a labor and employment law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cClearly, the company was concerned that he was making the environment difficult for people to do their jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Dionne Searcey, The Times\u2019s West Africa bureau chief based in Dakar, Senegal, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What does the technology landscape looks like in West Africa? How is internet connectivity? Do people use Facebook and Google?Even just a few years ago, reporters needed to carry a BGAN, a portable satellite modem the size of a hardcover novel. I rarely take one. When I arrive in a new city, I always buy a SIM card with a data plan. But pretty much any cafe or restaurant will hand you a Wi-Fi password if you ask for it, and even small hotels in out-of-the-way places seem to manage to rig some kind of Wi-Fi system. One hotel in Maradi, Niger, about 400 miles outside the capital, had routers taped to the ceiling all over the hallways.And, yes, people are huge users of social media like Facebook and to some extent Instagram. Nigerians in particular are very active on Twitter. Besides business people, many others do not have a laptop. In urban areas, a lot of people have smartphones, especially young people, and if they don\u2019t have one, they desperately want one.What kind of role does tech play in many of these developing African countries?A lot of people in more-rural areas cannot afford TVs, and even if they can, in many areas electricity is highly unreliable, so mobile phones are a major source of news.Phone credit is expensive and calls across providers cost extra. Some people have created an ingenious system called \u201cflashing\u201d \u2014 they call you and hang up so you dial them back and pick up the tab. I thought I was getting prank calls before I caught on.Mobile money \u2014 using a mobile phone to transfer payments \u2014 is also mainstream in many places and is a lifesaver for people who don\u2019t have the option of bank transfers.What tech is most important for you to do your job there?Internet connectivity, by whatever means possible. Phone networks are often so bad that I make most of my calls using WhatsApp. People are really into it, so sources are more inclined to respond to messages on that platform than emails or regular phone calls. Business people and aid workers like Skype.How do you overcome connectivity issues?Both cell and internet networks can be elusive, but they work well enough that when they don\u2019t, I\u2019m emotionally crushed or, more often, maddeningly annoyed.I usually can\u2019t stream video or download big files anywhere but in major cities, and even that is a challenge sometimes. The networks get really crowded, especially at night. WhatsApp and Skype calls are wonderful and clear but cut out a lot. Just dialing phone numbers sometimes takes five or six tries to get a clear line. It\u2019s frustrating explaining to colleagues in New York that if they can\u2019t reach me on the first try, just keep dialing and eventually they\u2019ll get through.What role does tech play in combating issues like police abuse or corruption?Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life?My kids \u2014 a middle schooler and two elementary-aged kids \u2014 like to post regular kid stuff to their private accounts, like photos of their friends and the occasional oversize snail or colorful lizard. It\u2019s fun to see how these Brooklyn kids are viewing their life here through their own eyes.We also created an account for the Senegalese street cat we adopted that when awake is vicious, but likes to sleep in absurd poses on his back.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Jobs Fair Sends Clear Message: Now Hiring Thousands", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROMEOVILLE, Ill. \u2014 Brandon Williams arrived at an Amazon fulfillment center here, about an hour outside of Chicago, around 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, one of thousands across the country who turned up for the company\u2019s first Jobs Day. While he appeared to wilt slightly during the five hours he waited before an M.C. summoned him for a tour, his enthusiasm did not wane.\u201cWhat\u2019s not great about a company that keeps building?\u201d he said, seated in a huge tent the company erected in the parking lot as a kind of makeshift waiting room.The event was a vivid illustration of the ascendance of Amazon, the online retail company that, to a far greater extent than others in the tech industry, has a seemingly insatiable need for human labor to fuel its explosive growth.Like other tech giants, Amazon is recruiting thousands of people with engineering and business degrees for high-paying jobs. But the vast majority of Amazon\u2019s hiring is for what the company calls its \u201cfulfillment network\u201d \u2014 the armies of people who pick and pack orders in warehouses and unload and drive delivery trucks, and who take home considerably smaller incomes.The event on Wednesday, held at a dozen locations including Romeoville, Ill., was intended to help fill 50,000 of those lower-paying positions, 40,000 of them full-time jobs.Those high-low distinctions did not seem to bother the attendees of the jobs fair, many of them united in the conviction that Amazon represented untapped opportunity \u2014 that a foot in the door could lead to a career of better-compensated, more satisfying work, whether in fulfillment, I.T., marketing or even fashion.Mr. Williams, a military veteran studying computer network security at a nearby community college, said he hoped to eventually work his way up to an I.T. job with Amazon. But even those whose ambitions were more in line with the vast majority of available jobs could not hide their excitement.Victor Salgado, who makes $9 per hour with no benefits doing maintenance at an aerosol company and spent three years before that grouting floors, said he was attracted by the promise of an upgrade in pay and benefits. He said he would be willing to \u201cdo anything\u201d at Amazon.\u201cA record-breaking 20,000 applications were received on this day alone,\u201d said John Olsen, an Amazon human resources vice president, \u201cwith thousands of job offers extended to candidates and more to come in the next few days.\u201dAmazon has said its wages and benefits are attractive. Five years ago, it introduced a program called Career Choice that pays tuition costs for employees seeking training to join higher-paid professions, like airline mechanics, medical lab workers and computer-aided design technicians.Jack Chasteen, who recently finished high school and is still living at home, said he had been planning to seek a job as a pizza deliveryman but that his parents urged him to turn up at Jobs Day instead.\u201cThey said it would be a good building block for stuff in the future,\u201d he said, citing Amazon\u2019s tuition assistance program, which he hoped might help him pursue a nursing degree.Arun Sundararajan, a professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Amazon\u2019s employment needs are unique among tech companies.\u201cTheir business has always been a meld of the digital and physical,\u201d he said. \u201cRetail is very different from digital products or music or social networking. The other tech platforms are, at their core, selling tech products.\u201dBut there are questions about how long Amazon\u2019s fulfillment jobs will exist, as robots and other forms of automation become more capable at doing the jobs that now require humans.Amazon is more aggressively using robots to help make the operations inside its warehouses more efficient. For now, the company said machines are not replacing people. Instead, they mostly move large shelves of merchandise to stations where orders are manually picked.When those technologies are perfected, the employment picture inside Amazon\u2019s warehouses could look very different. That day could be a decade or more away, though.\u201cWhile the digital disruption is destroying the traditional retail business model,\u201d Dr. Sundararajan said, \u201cthe Amazon model that replaces it will continue to live in the physical world and require human labor for the foreseeable future.\u201dAs for Mr. Williams, he later sent a text message to say that he was not hired on the spot on Wednesday, a possibility that Amazon had dangled before workers. On the plus side: he was told there was still a chance to get a job at the center through a temporary staffing company.An article on Thursday about Amazon\u2019s Job Fair misstated the hourly pay that one of the event\u2019s attendees, Victor Salgado, makes at an aerosol company. It is $9 per hour, not $10.75.Noam Scheiber reported from Romeoville, Ill., and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

Jerry Brown suggested he was unhappy with the measure as is.The renewed scrutiny of the measure, which would further limit cooperation between local police and immigration agents, comes amid rising tensions between California and the Trump administration.\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda depends on coercing local law enforcement to be their force multipliers,\u201d said Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants\u2019 rights for the A.C.L.U. of California. \u201cThis bill says that in California, \u2018We are not going to be those force multipliers.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to find them wherever they are,\u201d Mr. Salzillo said. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the jail you don\u2019t have this potential for collateral impacts on other persons.\u201dOn Sunday, Mr. Brown said California\u2019s approach needed to strike a balance between people who arrived in the state illegally years ago and created productive lives, and others who had committed serious crimes.He rejected the word \u201csanctuary\u201d to describe that aim.\u201cAs a former seminarian, I have a very clear image of the sanctuary,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. \u201cIt\u2019s in a church.

{"Headline": "The Accounting Tack That Makes PayPal\u2019s Numbers Look So Good", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameExceeding analysts\u2019 estimates \u2014 \u201cbeating the number,\u201d in Wall Street parlance \u2014 is crucial for any corporate leader interested in keeping his or her stock price aloft. Even the smallest earnings miss can send shares tumbling.Examining how a company meets or beats analysts\u2019 estimates, therefore, can be illuminating.PayPal\u2019s stock has been on a tear this year, up almost 50 percent since January. At a recent $59, its shares are trading at over 40 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates. It is clearly an investor darling, providing all the more reason to dig into its numbers.Naturally, many factors contributed to PayPal\u2019s second-quarter earnings. But one element stands out: the amount the company dispensed to employees in the form of stock-based compensation.How could stock-based compensation \u2014 which is a company expense, after all \u2014 have helped PayPal\u2019s performance in the quarter? Simple. The company does not consider stock awards a cost when calculating its favored earnings measure. So when PayPal doles out more stock compensation than it has done historically, all else being equal, its chosen non-GAAP income growth looks better.Accounting rules have required companies to include stock-based compensation as a cost of doing business for years. That\u2019s as it should be: Stock awards have value, after all, or employees wouldn\u2019t accept them as pay. And that value should be run through a company\u2019s financial statements as an expense.Consider the practice at Facebook, a company PayPal identifies as a peer. In its most recent quarterly income statement, Facebook broke out the roughly $1 billion in costs associated with share-based compensation that it deducted from its $9.3 billion in revenues.Back in the 1990s, technology companies argued strenuously against having to run stock compensation costs through their profit-and-loss statements. Who can blame them for wanting to make an expense disappear?They lost that battle with the accounting rule makers. But then they took a new tack: Technology companies began providing alternative earnings calculations without such costs alongside results that were accounted for under GAAP, essentially offering two sets of numbers every quarter. The non-GAAP statements \u2014 called pro forma numbers or adjusted results \u2014 often exclude expenses like stock awards and acquisition costs. And the equity analysts who hold such sway on Wall Street seem to be fine with them.As long as companies also showed their results under generally accepted accounting rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission let them present their favored alternative accounting.PayPal is by no means the only company that adds back the costs of stock-based compensation to its unconventional earnings calculations. Many technology companies do, contending, as PayPal does, that their own arithmetic \u201cprovides investors a consistent basis for assessing the company\u2019s performance and helps to facilitate comparisons across different periods.\u201dStill, some technology leaders are dumping the practice. In addition to Facebook, Alphabet said this year that it would no longer present results that excluded the costs of stock-based compensation.Dave Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, told investors on a May conference call that the company would report results that include share-based compensation because it\u2019s a true cost of running the business.PayPal takes the opposite approach. And look at what it does to its results.Under generally accepted accounting principles, PayPal reported operating income of $430 million in the second quarter of 2017. That was up almost 16 percent from the $371 million it produced in the same period last year.But under PayPal\u2019s alternative accounting, its non-GAAP operating income was $659 million in the June quarter, an increase of almost 25 percent from 2016.So what\u2019s to account for the added $230 million in operating income under PayPal\u2019s preferred calculation? Most of it \u2014 $192 million \u2014 was stock-based compensation PayPal dispensed to employees in the June quarter and added back to its results as calculated under GAAP.That was a big jump \u2014 57 percent \u2014 from the $122 million PayPal handed out during the second quarter of 2016. And back in 2015, PayPal reported just $89 million in stock awards.I asked PayPal why it has been ratcheting up its stock-based compensation. Amanda Miller, a PayPal spokeswoman, declined to discuss why the company was raising its stock-based pay, and the role the increase played in the company\u2019s recent results. She provided this statement: \u201cWe pay for performance and align our compensation with how shareholders are rewarded. We believe our treatment of stock-based compensation is broadly consistent with our peer group.\u201dBut this isn\u2019t accurate, according to the companies PayPal lists as peers in its proxy filing. At least four of those companies \u2014 Alphabet, Facebook, Mastercard and Visa \u2014 do not exclude stock-based compensation from their earnings calculations as PayPal does.In a telephone interview, Mr. Maurer was critical of how the company accounts for stock-based pay. He said that as a percentage of PayPal\u2019s non-GAAP operating income, stock-based compensation has risen to 29 percent this year from 17 percent in 2015.\u201cThey are literally taking a cost out of their income statement, moving it to a different line and backing it out of results,\u201d Mr. Maurer said in an interview. \u201cAnd you can see that it\u2019s adding significantly to their ability to meet earnings expectations. If you backed out the difference between what we were expecting on stock-based comp in the quarter versus what they reported, it was 2 cents of earnings.\u201dIn other words, the increase in stock-based compensation made a big contribution to PayPal\u2019s results versus what analysts had been expecting.PayPal\u2019s stock-based compensation practices have another noteworthy effect: They drive executive pay higher at the company. Here\u2019s how.The company says it has three main metrics for calculating its managers\u2019 performance pay each year. One of those measures, its proxy shows, is non-GAAP net income. So, as PayPal awards more and more stock to its executives and employees, non-GAAP net income shows better growth. And the greater that growth, the more incentive pay the company awards to its top executives.For PayPal insiders, at least, that\u2019s one virtuous circle.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

The way it was disconnected \u2014 the digital tether that connected its service to the rest of the internet was severed \u2014 suggested more than a mere technical outage, according to the leader of the firm\u2019s technology team, who requested anonymity for himself and the company for fear of reprisals.Chinese officials did not comment on the test, and there was no indication that they would use the system again. But if they do, it may not be a total surprise.The shift \u2014 which could affect a swath of users from researchers to businesses \u2014 suggests that China is increasingly worried about the power of the internet, experts said.\u201cIt does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense, but the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been,\u201d said Emily Parker, author of \u201cNow I Know Who My Comrades Are,\u201d a book about the power of the internet in China, Cuba, and Russia. \u201cBeijing\u2019s crackdown on the internet is commensurate with the power of the internet in China.\u201dChina still has not clamped down to its full ability, the experts said, and in many cases the cat-and-mouse game continues. One day after Apple\u2019s move last week, people on Chinese social media began circulating a way to gain access to those tools that was so easy that even a non-techie could use it. (It involved registering a person\u2019s app store to another country where VPN apps were still available.)Still, Thursday\u2019s test demonstrates that China wants the ability to change the game in favor of the cat.A number of Chinese internet service providers said on their social media accounts, websites, or in emails on Thursday that Chinese security officials would test a new way to find the internet addresses of services hosting or using illegal content. Once found, these companies said, the authorities would ask internet service providers to tell their clients to stop. If the clients persisted, they said, the service providers and Chinese officials would cut their connection in a matter of minutes.The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment.China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has presided over years of new internet controls, but he has also singled out technology and the internet as critical to China\u2019s future economic development. As cyberspace has become more central to everything that happens in China, government controls have evolved.It is difficult to figure out the extent of the new efforts, since many users and businesses will not discuss them publicly for fear of getting on the bad side with the Chinese government. But some frequent users said that getting around the restrictions had become increasingly difficult.One student, who has been studying in the United States and was back in China for summer vacation, said that her local VPN was blocked. She said she had taken the period as a sort of meditation away from social media and left a note on Facebook to warn her friends why she was a \u201cgone girl.\u201dA doctoral student in environmental engineering in at a university in China said it had become harder to do research without Google, though his university had found alternative publications so that students did not always need the internet. He has since found a new way to get around the Great Firewall, the student said, without disclosing what it was.Close observers of the Chinese internet said some VPNs still work \u2014 and that China could still do a lot more to intensify its crackdown.\u201cWe do think that if the government has decided to do so, it could have shut down much more VPN usage right now,\u201d said a spokesman for VPNDada, a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs that work.\u201cIf the government had sent more cats, the mice would have a tougher time,\u201d said the spokesman, who declined to be named because of sensitivities around the group\u2019s work in China. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t do so because they need to give some air for people or businesses to breathe.\u201dMuch like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complicated and often imperfect political process. Government ministries feel pressure ahead of the party congress to show they are effective or can step in if a problem appears, analysts said.\u201cSo it\u2019s definitely not an apocalypse for VPNs,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cJust a more complex environment for users to navigate, and new capabilities and approaches give China better ability to shut off some delta of VPN use at a time and place of Beijing\u2019s choosing,\u201d he said.China\u2019s population is learning to deal with those difficulties at a younger age. Earlier this summer, China\u2019s internet giant Tencent began limiting the time that people under 18 were allowed to play the popular online game Honor of Kings to an hour a day for those under 12, and two hours for those age 12 to 18.So Chinese youths have taken to an age-old solution: getting a fake ID.\u201cYour Honor of Kings being limited?

{"Headline": "Why Jeep Ought to Be for Keeps", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSelling Jeep would leave Sergio Marchionne nowhere to hide.The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief executive advocates using mergers to stop carmakers wasting precious capital. Offloading the company\u2019s top brand to the Great Wall Motor Company, whose president has indicated interest, could raise billions of dollars. But it would leave an emaciated rump.With a market value of some $15 billion, Great Wall may struggle to secure financing or Beijing\u2019s approval for a deal larger than itself. Even if it succeeded, the Trump administration and Congress are likely to balk at allowing such a large and iconic American brand to end up in Chinese hands.Fiat Chrysler, though, does need to do something. It is already the earnings straggler among the major automakers. Its pretax margin last year, at 2.8 percent, was the lowest of the group. Ford Motor and General Motors both cranked out just over 7 percent.Things are improving as Mr. Marchionne shrugs off more of the debt that resulted in part from taking over Chrysler after the United States government-backed bankruptcy exit in 2009. But Fiat Chrysler is the only one of the top 12 that Wall Street analysts reckon will fail to earn more than a 6 percent pretax margin in each of the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.The $23 billion a Jeep sale might bring, according to Morgan Stanley, could be tempting, whether Great Wall or another carmaker ends up the buyer. It would clean up the balance sheet. Deep-pocketed players like Google, Apple and Intel are new rivals in the race toward autonomous driving. Lacking investment firepower, Mr. Marchionne has stayed largely on the technological sidelines, though last week he took his company into the Intel-Mobileye-BMW alliance.Yet handing the keys to Jeep to a new owner would combust even the modest earnings that are currently anticipated. The brand may account for almost three-quarters of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization next year, reckons Morgan Stanley. Ram trucks, Maserati and three captive parts makers are still profitable, but Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Chrysler are in the red. On top of that, the company still has more than $5 billion of both net debt and unfunded pensions.Mr. Marchionne is expected to step down next year to concentrate on running Ferrari. A radical move like selling Jeep would certainly leave a mark. But it would set up his last lap at what remained of Fiat Chrysler to be a dismal one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Damaging Myth of the Loner Genius Nerd", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmotional IntelligenceMany scientists have said he got the biology wrong. But the job requirements of today\u2019s programmers show he was also wrong about working in tech.In fact, interpersonal skills like collaboration, communication, empathy and emotional intelligence are essential to the job. The myth that programming is done by loner men who think only rationally and communicate only with their computers harms the tech industry in ways that cut straight to the bottom line.The loner stereotype can deter talented people from the industry \u2014 not just women, but anyone who thinks that sounds like an unattractive job description. It can also result in dysfunctional teams and poorly performing products. Empathy, after all, is crucial to understanding consumers\u2019 desires, and its absence leads to product mistakes.She added, \u201cBut not everyone is the same, and that\u2019s where empathy and broader diversity really help.\u201dIt\u2019s true that programming can be a solitary activity in college computer science classes or entry-level positions. But soon after, it\u2019s impossible to avoid teamwork \u2014 with the business or legal departments, but also with other engineers.Yet that was never an accurate description of the job. It was social from the beginning, in university computer labs and, later, Silicon Valley garages, he said. The social circle just didn\u2019t include women.\u201cFor a lot of these young men, a certain computer culture becomes an expression of masculinity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who aren\u2019t doing physical labor, aren\u2019t playing professional sports. But they can express their masculinity by intense competition, playing pranks on one another, demonstrating their technical prowess, in ways that don\u2019t translate well to mixed-gender environments.\u201dEarly on, children who are less comfortable with social interaction \u2014 particularly boys, who are more likely to be socialized that way \u2014 are channeled toward science and engineering, he said. Teachers generally focus on the technical aspects and not the interpersonal ones. The result is a field filled with people who dislike social interactions and have been rewarded for it.In the tech industry, the lack of interpersonal skills has become a weakness and a liability.\u201cYou might have ideas in your head, but unless you communicate them, no one\u2019s going to understand,\u201d he said.Technical skills without empathy have resulted in products that have bombed in the market, because a vital step to building a product is the ability to imagine how someone else might think and feel. \u201cThe failure rate in software development is enormous, but it almost never means the code doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem that actually exists, or it imagines a user completely different from actual users.\u201dWith Google Glass, for example, it was a technical feat to make a tiny computer you could wear as a pair of glasses. But the product wasn\u2019t one that typical people needed, or wanted.When Apple introduced its Health app, it tracked sleep, exercise, food, medications and heart rate, but not menstrual cycle. Yet period trackers are one of the most used health tools for women. (The app now includes it.)Google Plus, the company\u2019s social network, initially required that users make public their name, photo and gender. There was a technical argument for including gender \u2014 to construct sentences like \u201cShe shared a photo with you\u201d \u2014 but it also exposed women to online harassment.\u201cThe team that made this decision was entirely male,\u201d said Mr. Zunger, who was the chief architect of social networking at Google at the time. \u201cIt was a really clear case of getting things wrong, for the simple reason that the people in the room weren\u2019t diverse enough to notice an obvious problem.\u201dEmpathy also affects which products are built in the first place \u2014 why, for example, Silicon Valley has spent more time building apps for expensive food delivery than for decreasing hunger.When engineers build products with empathy, it can seem like magic: Technology seems to predict what people want before they know they want it. That was part of Steve Jobs\u2019s genius. Just look at the number of people connected to their phones, or a child using an iPhone for the first time.One way to develop empathy at companies is by hiring diverse teams, because people bring different perspectives and life experiences. But the more widespread the stereotypes like those in the Google memo, the harder it becomes.\u201cThat nerd identity is really damaging to women,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also damaging to minorities and to a lot of men who don\u2019t want to subsume their identity in that.\u201dThat\u2019s why the consequences of the Google memo could reach far beyond the particular case, influencing which young people choose to go into technology, and which products they make that affect every aspect of our lives.Advertisement"}

Benchmark asserts that he did so through \u201cmaterial misstatements and fraudulent concealment\u201d of information and his \u201coverarching objective is to pack Uber\u2019s board with loyal allies in an effort to insulate his prior conduct from scrutiny and clear the path for his eventual return as C.E.O. \u2014 all to the detriment of Uber\u2019s stockholders, employees, driver-partners, and customers.\u201dThe lawsuit says Mr. Kalanick deliberately hid problems at Uber and fraudulently obtained the right to select three new board seats when the board expanded to 11 directors in 2016.After he stepped down, Mr. Kalanick left the board seat designated for the chief executive, but immediately reappointed himself to one of the three seats he controlled, the lawsuit asserts. He has since refused to give up control of the other two board seats, according to the lawsuit.A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.\u201d The spokesman said Benchmark was acting in \u201cits own best interests\u201d instead of in those of Uber, and added that Mr. Kalanick \u201cis confident that these entirely baseless claims will be rejected.\u201dRelated ReadingAn index known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d surged from historically low levels on Thursday as markets declined.The VIX stayed in single-digit territory for many weeks this year, unusual for an index that had long traded around 20.\u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201d asked Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo.The company, which has become a bellwether for the struggling retail industry, saw its shares fall more than 10 percent as investors worried about traditional brick-and-mortar stores.The rise in e-commerce has hurt Macy\u2019s and other traditional retailers.

{"Headline": "Losing It in the Anti-Dieting Age", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "FeatureThe agonies of being overweight \u2014 or running a diet company \u2014 in a culture that likes to pretend it only cares about health, not size.Supported byChambers called Deb Benovitz, the company\u2019s senior vice president and global head of consumer insights. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re having one of the worst Januaries that anyone could have imagined,\u2019\u2019 she remembers him telling her. In the dieting business, January will tell you everything you need to know about the rest of the year. \u2018\u2018Nothing like we had anticipated.\u2019\u2019 Chambers and Benovitz knew that people had developed a kind of diet fatigue. Weight Watchers had recently tried the new marketing campaign, called \u2018\u2018Help With the Hard Part,\u2019\u2019 an attempt at radical honesty. No one wanted radical honesty. Chambers told Benovitz that they needed to figure out what was going on and how to fix it before the February board meeting.Benovitz got to work. She traveled the country, interviewing members, former members and people they thought should be members about their attitudes toward dieting. She heard that they no longer wanted to talk about \u2018\u2018dieting\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018weight loss.\u2019\u2019 They wanted to become \u2018\u2018healthy\u2019\u2019 so they could be \u2018\u2018fit.\u2019\u2019 They wanted to \u2018\u2018eat clean\u2019\u2019 so they could be \u2018\u2018strong.\u2019\u2019If you had been watching closely, you could see that the change had come slowly. \u2018\u2018Dieting\u2019\u2019 was now considered tacky. It was anti-feminist. It was arcane. In the new millennium, all bodies should be accepted, and any inclination to change a body was proof of a lack of acceptance of it. \u2018\u2018Weight loss\u2019\u2019 was a pursuit that had, somehow, landed on the wrong side of political correctness. People wanted nothing to do with it. Except that many of them did: They wanted to be thinner. They wanted to be not quite so fat. Not that there was anything wrong with being fat! They just wanted to call dieting something else entirely.The change had been spurred not just by dieting fatigue but also by real questions about dieting\u2019s long-term efficacy. In Weight Watchers\u2019 own research, the average weight loss in any behavior-modification program is about a 5 percent reduction of body weight after six months, with a return of a third of the weight lost at two years. There were studies that appeared to indicate that the cycle of weight loss and weight gain could cause long-term damage to the metabolism. Those studies led to more studies, which suggested that once your body reaches a certain weight, it is nearly impossible to exist at a much lower weight for an extended period of time. Even more studies began to question whether or not it\u2019s so bad to be fat in the first place; one notably suggested that fatter people lived longer than thin ones.Diet companies suffered for being associated with dieting. Lean Cuisine repositioned itself as a \u2018\u2018modern eating\u2019\u2019 company, not a diet company. In fact, Lean Cuisine went so far in their pivot that in 2016 they introduced a Google Chrome extension that would filter mentions of the word \u2018\u2018diet\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018dieting\u2019\u2019; it apparently did this to show that just because it was called Lean Cuisine, that didn\u2019t mean it was a diet company. You can\u2019t be held responsible for what your parents named you!Weight Watchers saw all this happening and concluded that people didn\u2019t have faith in diets. The company decided that what it offered was not a diet program but a lifestyle program. It was a behavior-modification program. (For the sake of expediency here, I will call its program a diet because it prescribes amounts of food.) When Deb Benovitz returned from her travels with news of dieting\u2019s new language changes, the company realized that something had to change more than its marketing approach.Weight Watchers\u2019 chief science officer is Gary Foster, a psychologist \u2014 the first in that position, which previously had been held by dietitians. What he and his team realized from Benovitz\u2019s research was that dieters wanted a holistic approach to eating, one that helped really change their bodies, yes, but in a way that was sustainable and positive. He got to work creating a new approach that would become known as Beyond the Scale: He used all available mind-body research to try to figure out a way for members to appreciate benefits of the program besides weight loss. This would help them stay on the program during setbacks and beyond their weight-loss period and allow the program to infiltrate their lives beyond mealtime and beyond plain old eating suggestions.The company would move away from giving its members goal weights. It expanded its cognitive-behavioral strategies, which taught members to challenge unhelpful thinking and to respond to their emotions with reason, as opposed to with food or despair. It developed workshops that used meditation and qigong and didn\u2019t once mention food or weight. It updated its apps and introduced a social-media program, Connect. It became as holistic-minded as the people told Benovitz they wanted a program to be.But Weight Watchers was still a company called Weight Watchers, and it had to figure out a way to communicate all of this change to the public. People had too many associations with the brand. It needed someone other than the usual celebrity spokesdieter, a fat famous person who could be paid somewhere between $250,000 and $2 million to do the talk show circuit and People covers for a year. It needed someone who could fast-track the message that it was worth taking a new look at Weight Watchers.When the company called Oprah Winfrey in July 2015, she was standing on the lawn of her home in Maui with a sprained ankle, an injury she sustained while hiking in the mountains. In the month since her convalescence began, she had gained 17 pounds. Her struggles with weight were, at this point, a cultural meme. How could you explain the failure of someone so goal-oriented and successful \u2014 someone so successful that her name was invoked as a symbol of success as often as it was ever used to summon her? Weight Watchers had reached out to her in the past, but she politely declined. This time she bought a 10 percent stake in the company for $43 million, and Weight Watchers stockholders rejoiced.But the verbal changes around dieting had indicated something deeper than just a marketing issue; they pointed straight back to the fatigue that was hurting Weight Watchers in the first place. So, yes, many people celebrated the new partnership. But others \u2014 meaning, anyone who for a majority of their lives had been watching Oprah cycle up and down through different sizes \u2014 felt a little confused by the move. What was Oprah, a person whose very brand meant enlightenment and progress, doing on another diet? It was hard not to suspect that she was trapped, like so many of us are, in a culture that says one thing about fatness and means something very different.Its frankness seems like an anachronism now, but you have to consider that at the time, this kind of straight talk was a glass of cold water in the desert for many fat people, who privately wondered why it was so hard for them to reduce the size of their bodies when it seemed so effortless for the people who walked around thin. Nidetch lost her weight in her late 30s, after a lifetime of self-loathing and embarrassment; the last indignity was the time someone asked when her baby was due when she was definitively not pregnant. She went to a city-run obesity clinic, and when she left the program, she kept the diet it gave her. She mimeographed it and handed it out to people whom she had gathered to spread the word about how weight loss could provide freedom and hope. (The diet would evolve from an eating plan to a more democratic system of balanced exchanges to an absolute laissez-faire system of points, as the company realized that the more autonomy and the less deprivation people experienced in their dieting \u2014 limitless choices, if not limitless amounts \u2014 the more likely they\u2019d be to stay on the diet.) But Nidetch knew that it wasn\u2019t just the food that was the problem; it was the problem that was the problem. What fat people needed was one another. They needed a space in which they could talk openly about the physical struggles and daily humiliations of walking around in a fat body, and just how much that sucked.These same ideas were articulated more starkly a few years later, but with a different prescription. In 1967, a fat man named Lew Louderback unleashed an essay in The Saturday Evening Post arguing that the wisdom around thinness could be applied only to thin people \u2014 that fat people suffered physically and psychologically when trying to maintain thin-person weights, and that this maintenance seemed to be temporary at best and largely destructive emotionally.He went on to write a book called \u2018\u2018Fat Power,\u2019\u2019 which helped give birth to what would become known as the fat-acceptance movement. That movement has varying degrees of militancy, but generally asks the public to put aside its bias and learn something new \u2014 to not think of fat people as lazy; to not deny them medical care; to not exclude them from their basic rights. It suggests that we re-examine what we think we know about fatness, that we consider trying to love and care for our bodies at whatever size they are now.There were more books and more essays and more challenges to the status quo in the decades to come. In 2008, Linda Bacon, a researcher who holds graduate degrees in physiology, psychology and exercise science with a specialty in nutrition, wrote a seminal fat-acceptance book, \u2018\u2018Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,\u2019\u2019 which used peer-reviewed research to bolster these ideas. She gave seminars to doctors on fat phobia and weight bias in an effort to help them understand how their views on obesi\u00adty were hurting their patients and not allowing them to examine fatness neutrally. For example, there is evidence that stress and discrimination play a strong role in the insulin resistance and diabetes and heart disease for which weight typi\u00adcally takes the blame.With the rise of social media, the movement began to infiltrate the culture in other ways, too. Fat-acceptance and body-positivity activists began posting pictures of themselves on Instagram \u2014 just regular pictures, defiant for their lack of apology. There were intuitive-eating workshops and body-positivity training camps. There were bloggers and authors asking exactly how much of your life you were willing to put off in pursuit of a diet, or until you got to a certain weight, even temporarily. Normal, nonmilitant, nonactivist people began asking themselves if it was that bad to be fat \u2014 if it was that unhealthy, or that ugly, to be fat. And yet the most telling thing about the way the fat-acceptance movement is received in our society may be that its Wikipedia entry contains two quotes from people criticizing it before it mentions even one person who espouses it. In this world, we are witness to a moment when the word \u201coptimal\u201d is used in conjunction with the word \u201cbody,\u201d when people are trying to mold themselves into high-performance, precision machines. The idea of a fat machine makes no sense when you are easily fueled and refueled on Whole Foods and Soylent.In other words, all this activism didn\u2019t make the world more comfortable with fat people or dieting. Society doesn\u2019t normally change the words for things unless we\u2019re fundamentally uncomfortable with the concepts beneath them. Consider the verbal game of chicken we\u2019ve played with the people all this affects: Fat people went from being called fat (which is mean) to being called overweight (a polite-seeming euphemism that either accidentally or not accidentally implies that there is a standard weight) to being called zaftig/chubby/pleasingly plump (just don\u2019t) to curvy (which seems to imbue size with a sexuality and optimism where it should just be sexually and emotionally neutral) and back to fat (because it\u2019s only your judgment of fat people that made it a bad word in the first place, and maybe being fat isn\u2019t as bad as we\u2019ve been made to believe). It bears mentioning that Weight Watchers doesn\u2019t have a standardized word for its demographic, but Foster uses the term \u2018\u2018people with overweight.\u2019\u2019As the ideas that sprang from the fat-acceptance movement began to trickle into the mainstream, fat people began to wonder what it might be like to put all this aside and just live their lives. Some asked themselves if they thought they could figure out a way to not want to be thin; some began to ask themselves if they actually liked the way they looked. They began to wonder if there was even a proven and effective way to become and stay thin anyway. They began to ask themselves if they should be dieting at all.Maybe that\u2019s true. Most mainstream sources agree on this, but there are definitely some researchers who don\u2019t; there are some who think that people who end up fat have different physiologies, and that fatness is just one component of them. Consider the \u2018\u2018uptick,\u2019\u2019 as Foster calls it, that comes after two years on a diet when, say, the person who lost 5 percent of her weight has gained a third of it back. Think about those numbers. If you weigh 300 pounds, you will lose 15 pounds in six months. You\u2019ll keep it off for a year or two, maybe. Five pounds is likely to return. Of course, these are people who don\u2019t stay on a diet-maintenance plan; but the average dieter certainly doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s worth it to ask why a person wouldn\u2019t stay on a program that offered such rewards. Is it because they couldn\u2019t? It\u2019s worth it to ask if the programs are right and all these humans trying very hard at them are wrong. And also, where are the 300-pound people who want to lose just 15 pounds in the first place? I haven\u2019t met those people. But mainly, what it comes down to is this: Weight Watchers is designed to be successful only if you can stay on Weight Watchers forever.And there were also questions about dieting\u2019s long-term effects on the body. A study done by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The study followed contestants who had appeared on the eighth season of \u2018\u2018The Biggest Loser,\u2019\u2019 all of whom had normal resting metabolisms for their size when the season began. As the contestants experienced radical, sweeps-week weight loss, their metabolisms slowed, and stayed slow afterward. To maintain his weight loss, one contestant\u2019s resting metabolism now required 800 calories fewer per day than a man of his size. It might be that when you have been fat, your body doesn\u2019t behave the way a thin body does, even when you become thinner.Foster shook his head at that one. He hears about the \u2018\u2018Biggest Loser\u2019\u2019 study a lot, but he doesn\u2019t think it conveys accurate information. It uses a very small sample under extreme conditions. He cited his own and others\u2019 studies examining the metabolic rate, fat distribution and psychological state of people before they lose weight, after they lose weight and after they regain the weight. \u2018\u2018Nothing is changed,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good outcome or something we should celebrate \u2014 but this idea that the act of managing your weight and losing weight has somehow set you up to be in a worse spot just isn\u2019t borne out by the science.\u2019\u2019Here is the thing about this particular debate at this particular moment: Everyone has much the same data, but there are plenty of people who would interpret the data differently from the way Foster does. I\u2019ve spoken to countless (I literally stopped keeping count) obesity researchers and dietitians and biologists and doctors. The answer becomes one of point of view: Is fat inherently bad, or can it be neutral?We can\u2019t answer that yet. There is still too much debate. So in the meantime, a fat person has to consider the data she has access to \u2014 meaning studies, yes, but also her own experience and the experience of her fat peers \u2014 and ask: Do you believe that you, a fat person, can ever be meaningfully thinner for a meaningful amount of time? Is a diet successful if it stops being successful once you\u2019re done with it? I\u2019ve interviewed Foster before. Back in 2011, when he was at Temple, he published a study about the efficacy of different kinds of diets. They all led to similar losses, and they all led to similar rates of recidivism. When I spoke with him back then, I asked him why we should continue dieting if the outcomes were so bad. He was concerned that I would suggest to my readers that dieting wasn\u2019t worth it. He told me that people didn\u2019t need that kind of discouragement. This attitude is what makes him so credible to me \u2014 his message was the same long before he worked for a corporation \u2014 but it\u2019s also what makes this so depressing.I do not recommend being a fat person at Obesity Week. Over the years, the event has become a week long, and it contains a robust trade show. After Foster left me to go to a meeting, I walked the trade-show floor and saw all the products being shown to the obesity specialists in attendance. I watched a video of a new kind of retractor that will more easily hold open belly skin while part of a stomach is cut out and sewn up, because you can\u2019t eat as much if your stomach is made smaller. I watched a person showing a model of a balloon you\u2019d insert into the stomach of a patient that would take up volume so that she wouldn\u2019t be so hungry, to be removed later once her behavior had been modified. I drank a smoothie with a superfood ingredient I can\u2019t pronounce or remember while someone told me that my readers would really be interested in their something-metrics plan for hydration and portion control. I narrowed my eyes thoughtfully because it felt rude to be drinking this guy\u2019s smoothie without taking him seriously. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no such thing as magic, Taffy,\u2019\u2019 the smoothie man was saying. I nodded in solemn agreement.Before he left me, I told Foster that Obesity Week made me sad. First, it was the profusion of educated people in the room studying me and my people as if we were problems to solve. But second, it was because if you have this many hundreds of smart and educated people trying to figure this out, and nobody has anything for me but superfood and behavior modification and an insertable balloon and the removal of an organ, it must be that there is no way to solve fatness.Foster doesn\u2019t see it that way, he told me. \u2018\u2018I look around this room,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018and I see hope.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018In Brooklyn?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, when I was in high school.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018In Los Angeles?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, right before I was married.\u2019\u2019 I stopped her before she could go on. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re all me.\u2019\u2019By then I was all in, as if I ever hadn\u2019t been. When I arrived at the Union, N.J., meeting at 8 a.m. on a Saturday, it was a few weeks before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is marketed as a fun, festive holiday of family gathering, but everyone at that meeting knew the truth: Thanksgiving is an existential threat. Thanksgiving is a killer.The year leading up to Thanksgiving hadn\u2019t been much better for this group. There had been family deaths and illness. There had been foreclosures and unemployments and high-school reunions, and someone\u2019s daughter was always baking sticky buns; someone\u2019s husband wanted to know where his steak was; someone\u2019s son wanted to know why the meatloaf tasted different; someone\u2019s co-worker was always leaving doughnuts and bagels on the communal table at the office. The people, mostly women, in the folding chairs had one rule, though: No matter what happened during the week, you showed up. \u2018\u2018This is my church,\u2019\u2019 a woman named Donna told me. A few months before, she buried her mother on a Friday; on Saturday she came to the meeting.Dayna, the group leader, stood at the head of the room. How could you not love Dayna? She took such care with her appearance \u2014 she wore tall boots and wrap dresses and makeup, even on Saturday mornings when everyone else wore sweatpants at best (or leggings; leggings weigh less). She gave them star-shaped stickers off a large roll when they lost weight or when they had acted in their best interests over the week. She remembered their names, even the ones who hadn\u2019t shown up in months; she gave them hugs.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m so frickin\u2019 aggravated,\u2019\u2019 she said. She asked me how I did. I shrugged and told her I had lost three pounds. \u2018\u2018But I just started, so, .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019\u2019 I said. I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad. Another woman, Amy, whispered to me, \u2018\u2018You never want to say \u2018I only lost, .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019 because then everyone will go, \u2018Oh, jeez.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019I asked the women there, most of whom were repeat joiners as well: Shouldn\u2019t we be moving toward acceptance? Here we all were \u2014 smart, accomplished, successful women (and one man) \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t maintain what was proved to be the most effective diet you could ever try. If we couldn\u2019t stay on this, could we stay on anything? What if the flaw wasn\u2019t in us but in the system?They furrowed their brows and shook their heads and gave me funny looks. What was I talking about? How could a fat person not want to be thin? Donna\u2019s sisters were all on diabetes medication, and she wasn\u2019t. Her back had hurt until about 20 pounds ago, and now she could crawl on the floor with her grandson as if it were nothing.I couldn\u2019t counter very hard. Each time I came to a meeting, I was seduced by the possibility, by the clean, Calvinist logic, that if you ate less you would weigh less, that your body would feed on itself and its fat reserves until you became smaller and smaller and more pleasing to the world and its standards \u2014 until you practically disappeared (we are a culture that fetishizes something called Size 0). I looked forward to these meetings, feeling as if these people were the only ones who seemed to truly understand my predicament. But my optimism and motivation didn\u2019t survive my walk out the door. By the time I got to my car, I had no idea what to do. I knew that if this could be done, I would have done it, and yet I didn\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t do it. Just eat less, right? It\u2019s so simple!I went to an intuitive-eating class \u2014 intuitive eating is where you learn to feed yourself based only on internal signals and not external ones like mealtimes or diet plans. Meaning it\u2019s just eating what you want when you\u2019re hungry and stopping when you\u2019re full. There were six of us in there, educated, desperate fat women, doing mindful-eating exercises and discussing their pitfalls and challenges. We were given food. We would smell the food, put the food on our lips, think about the food, taste the food, roll the food around in our mouths, swallow the food. Are you still hungry? Are you sure? The first week it was a raisin. It progressed to cheese and crackers, then to cake, then to Easter candy. We sat there silently, as if we were aliens who had just arrived on Earth and were learning what this thing called food was and why and how you would eat it. Each time we did the eating exercise, I would cry. \u2018\u2018What is going on for you?\u2019\u2019 the leader would ask. But it was the same answer every time: I am 41, I would say. I am 41 and accomplished and a beloved wife and a good mother and a hard worker and a contributor to society and I am learning how to eat a goddamned raisin. How did this all go so wrong for me?They tried to soothe me. They told me that hatred of fat was a societal construct, but I never understood why that should comfort me. I live in society. I hurt my ankle playing tennis, activating an old injury, and an internist I was seeing for the first time, without taking any medical history or vital signs \u2014 my blood pressure is pristine, just so you know \u2014 told me he couldn\u2019t do anything for me until I lost weight and gave me a rusty photocopy about food exchanges. (Another doctor prescribed three months of physical therapy, and now my ankle is fine.) I was in Iceland, for a story assignment, and the man who owned my hotel took me fishing and said, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not going to insist you wear a life jacket, since I think you\u2019d float, if you know what I mean.\u2019\u2019 I ignored him, and then afterward, back on land, after I fished cod like a Viking, he said, \u2018\u2018I call that survival of the fattest.\u2019\u2019 A woman getting into a seat next to me on a plane said, \u2018\u2018Looks like this will be a cozy ride,\u2019\u2019 and a Manhattan taxi driver told me he liked to watch my \u2018\u2018jelly\u2019\u2019 shake, by which I can only presume he meant a part of my body. I have been asked if it was my first time taking Pilates at a studio where I\u2019m on my fifth 10-pack. I have been told at a yoga class that I have \u2018\u2018a really great spirit\u2019\u2019 and it\u2019s important that I \u2018\u2018just keep coming.\u2019\u2019 (I\u2019ve been taking yoga for 12 years.) I was told by a seamstress that she had never seen a bride not lose weight for her wedding until she met me. A crazy man tried to give me candy outside the Met, and when I politely declined he screamed at me that of course I didn\u2019t want it, I was fat enough, and my sister asked me why I was so upset, clearly that guy was crazy, and I said, \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re skinny,\u2019\u2019 and on and on forever. (By the way, I am writing this despite the myriad degradations that I know will appear in my inbox and in the comments section when it is published. I am someone who once wrote a body-image essay for a women\u2019s magazine in which a comment in the margins from an editor read, \u2018\u2018Why doesn\u2019t she stop eating so much?\u2019\u2019)Back in Union, Dayna stood at the front of the room. The conversation had shifted to Thanksgiving foods, how sons home from college depend on the stuffin\u2019 muffins, how husbands will know if there\u2019s no butter in the mashed potatoes. Donna makes an Easter pie with more kinds of pork than there are pigs roaming the Earth. Really, the group members were worried that despite their weight loss, they would forget that they were really fat people on the inside. Thanksgiving is a killer.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s just one day,\u2019\u2019 Dayna said. And all those around her heaved heavy sighs.When Oprah called me, she was on the same mountain in Hawaii where she sprained her ankle two years ago. After a monthslong search, Weight Watchers had hired a new C.E.O., Mindy Grossman, formerly of the Home Shopping Network. In her office, Grossman had talked to me about personalizing the company\u2019s mobile app and creating greater moments for connection. She is tan and very blond, with pink lipstick; she looks like the second coming of Jean Nidetch. Weight Watchers had found its business leader. She was joining the company after its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth because it had finally found its spiritual one.On the release day of the commercial in which Oprah told the world she loved bread and was excited to be able to eat it every day and still lose weight, the graph line shot up tall and straight at Weight Watchers. But a lot of us wondered if maybe Oprah had finally fallen out of touch. She said in one commercial, \u2018\u2018Inside every overweight woman is a woman she knows she can be,\u2019\u2019 saying she\u2019d been buried in her weight to the point where she couldn\u2019t recognize herself, and the internet did not love this sentiment, asking exactly why Oprah thought that women were worthless if they weren\u2019t thin. They asked if she was \u2018\u2018disempowering women.\u2019\u2019 They said her investment in Weight Watchers was \u2018\u2018bad news for women everywhere.\u2019\u2019 One blogger wrote that she was \u2018\u2018disappointed that she is choosing to participate in and endorse a company whose sole purpose is to tell women that they are not enough.\u2019\u2019 The journalist Melissa Harris-Perry gave a five-minute \u2018\u2018Letter of the Week\u2019\u2019 on MSNBC saying: \u2018\u2018But, O! You are already precisely the woman so many are striving to be,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018there is not one thing that you have done that would have been more extraordinary if you\u2019d done it with a 25-inch waist.\u2019\u2019 Oprah\u2019s $43 million investment was now worth $110 million. Maybe that\u2019s what this was all about in the first place.Oprah sounds like Oprah when you talk with her \u2014 she sings your name, \u2018\u2018Taffy!\u2019\u2019 and her voice registers in you in a way that is as familiar to your body as your mother\u2019s voice. She told me she doesn\u2019t care if she\u2019s never skinny again. She cares that she feels as if she has control. For her whole life, she said, her only goal has been to find a higher level of consciousness, to remain more in the moment than she has ever been in any other moment. She had never felt stress, even during all those years when she was doing three shows a day. She just ate instead. She had bags of potato chips, and people would say, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you get stressed?\u2019\u2019 and she\u2019d think, What\u2019s stress? She had seen the cultural changes for years. She knew that you were no longer supposed to say that you wanted to diet or be thinner. You had to want \u2018\u2018fitness\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018strength\u2019\u2019 and just general health. But this thinking was a prison. So was the one where you just accept yourself and move on. \u201cThis whole P.C. about accepting yourself as you are \u2014 you should, 100 percent,\u201d she said. But it was that thinking that made her say yes to Weight Watchers. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a mechanism to keep myself on track that brings a level of consciousness and awareness to my eating. It actually is, for me, mindful eating, because the points are so ingrained now.\u2019\u2019 Meaning, Oprah wasn\u2019t interested in ceding to a movement. She was wondering how to finally make this work.\u2018\u2018In the particular moment in time that I got the call,\u2019\u2019 she told me, \u2018\u2018I was desperate: What\u2019s going to work? I\u2019ve tried all of the green juices and protein shakes, and let\u2019s do a cleanse, and all that stuff. That doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t last. What is going to be consistent, keep me conscious and mindful?\u2019\u2019But this thing about acceptance? Why couldn\u2019t accepting herself mean not accepting her weight? Why wasn\u2019t it an act of love to use any available means to avoid her genetic predisposition to diabetes? Sure, she could have abandoned her efforts. She could have gone hard on acceptance. A million people would have bought \u2018\u2018Oprah\u2019s Guide to Body Acceptance.\u2019\u2019 But she couldn\u2019t get there. \u2018\u2018For your heart to pump, pump, pump, pump, it needs the least amount of weight possible to do that,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSo all of the people who are saying, \u2018Oh, I need to accept myself as I am\u2019 \u2014 I can\u2019t accept myself if I\u2019m over 200 pounds, because it\u2019s too much work on my heart. It causes high blood pressure for me. It puts me at risk for diabetes, because I have diabetes in my family.\u2019\u2019I nodded into the phone because I didn\u2019t want Oprah to hear me crying. I wanted to quit dieting, but had come to realize that dieting was all I had. I was completely perplexed by food \u2014 food! Stupid food! That\u2019s what this was about! I dieted because I wanted to maintain hope that I could one day manage my food intake, because my bewilderment around the stuff was untenable. When I didn\u2019t have that hope, I was left with too much worry about pain, about how much my knees hurt now and how much more they would in just a few years. I could be enlightened about my body. I could have acceptance. But nobody would tell that to the people who saw me as a target; nobody would tell that to my knees.And yet, I told Oprah, in admitting this, I couldn\u2019t stop feeling as if I were betraying everyone I knew who was out there trying to find peace with herself. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking that nothing would change in the world until there was a kind of uprising.\u2018\u2018Oh, my God, Taffy,\u2019\u2019 Oprah said. \u2018\u2018I have to have a talk with you. I used to say this to my producers all the time. We are never going to win with this show looking back to see what other people are doing on their shows.

I didn\u2019t know if she meant \u2018\u2018you\u2019\u2019 as in my body or \u2018\u2018you\u2019\u2019 as in me, and it occurred to me that she could mean both, that some people think of those two things as the same thing. I treated my body with such contempt, but my body wasn\u2019t different from me. There were no two of me to put on a magazine cover, just the one of me.Weight isn\u2019t neutral. A woman\u2019s body isn\u2019t neutral. A woman\u2019s body is everyone\u2019s business but her own. Even in our attempts to free one another, we were still trying to tell one another what to want and what to do. It is terrible to tell people to try to be thinner; it is also terrible to tell them that wanting to lose weight is hopeless and wrong.I don\u2019t know if diets can work in the short term or the long term. For the first time, I began to think that this was something worth being made crazy over. Our bodies deserve our thoughts and our kindness, our acceptance and our striving. Our bodies are what carry our thoughts and our kindness and our acceptance and striving.Eileen, a lifetime member who sat next to Donna at every meeting, had bought her a plastic tiara. Donna wore leggings this time, not sweatpants as usual, with her traditional Uggs and a fleece, and someone pointed out that you could finally see her shape. She passed around some old pictures; she was unrecognizable in them, if you could find her behind all the other people in the picture.\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel like a thin person,\u2019\u2019 Donna said. Her hope is that she\u2019ll continue to at least look like one.Dayna, near sobbing, gave her a bunch of star stickers off her roll. \u2018\u2018My heart just feels so happy today,\u2019\u2019 she said.We all cheered for Donna, and when I left, I walked around outside. A skinny woman was eating a cupcake and talking on her phone, tonguing the icing as if she were on ecstasy. Another skinny woman drank a regular Dr Pepper as if it were nothing, as if it were just a drink. I continued walking and stopped in front of a diner and watched through the window people eating cheeseburgers and French fries and talking gigantically. All these people, I looked at them as if they were speaking Mandarin or discussing string theory, with their ease around their food and their ease around their bodies and their ability to live their lives without the doubt and self-loathing that brings me to my arthritic knees still. There\u2019s no such thing as magic, Taffy. I shook my head at the impossibility of it all, and sitting here writing this, I still do.Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "California Today: The Dominating Dodgers", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from James Wagner, who covers baseball for The Times.The baseball season is a six-month slog: 162 games played over 183 days, many over the hot summer months. More than anything, it is a battle of attrition. Last year, teams used an average of 25 pitchers and 45 hitters to make it through the season. That is a lot of bodies.Winning about 54 percent of a season\u2019s games is often enough to earn a postseason berth in the modern playoff format. Winning 60 percent is an accomplishment. Winning 70 percent? Nearly unheard-of.The record for most wins in a season is 116, achieved only twice in baseball history, by the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 2001 Seattle Mariners. In fact, only six teams have ever won 110 or more games in a season. The most recent was the 1998 Yankees, who won 114 regular season games and the World Series that year.What makes this team special, as die-hard Dodgers fans know, is the composition of the group. At $256 million, the Dodgers have the largest payroll in baseball, but they also possess a deep minor league system of prospects, which seems almost unfair to the competition.Sure, the Dodgers have the star starter Clayton Kershaw signed to a $215 million deal and the talented closer Kenley Jansen inked to a $80 million contract, but they are also supplemented by young stars who will be with the Dodgers for years to come.There is shortstop Corey Seager, who was named last season\u2019s National League Rookie of the Year. And now there is first baseman Cody Bellinger, a front-runner to win that award this season because of his 32 (and counting) home runs. This season may just be the beginning.Last week, the Dodgers pulled off a stunning trade with the Texas Rangers for starter Yu Darvish, among the most talented pitchers in baseball. It felt like excess for baseball\u2019s best team, but he will pair nicely with Kershaw atop the Dodgers\u2019 rotation during the playoffs.History has shown that the teams with the best records do not always win the World Series. The first two rounds of the playoffs are a five-game series, followed by a seven-game series \u2014 an entirely different animal than the six-month marathon of the regular season.Regardless of what happens in October, the Dodgers have provided baseball fans at home and across the country a daily dose of wonderment.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The average start time for middle and high schools is about 8:07 a.m. Under the new bill, they could start no earlier than 8:30 a.m.We asked readers if that was a good idea. Opinions ran the gamut.A sample:\u201cI\u2019m for the possible 8:30 a.m. rule. In high school, my daughter was run ragged by long school hours and excessive homework.

Staying up too late is still a big problem as is parents relying on their kids to get up and get to school on their own.\u201d\u2014 Mary D\u2019Agostino\u201cThis is a decision that should be made by local school districts. Could be that the best start time in Tuolumne County is not the same as in San Francisco County.\u201d\u2014 Barrett Giorgis\u201cAs a mom of a high school freshman, I think a later start could benefit kids. Teens need rest and shouldn\u2019t be seen as just future grist for the work mill.\u201d\u2014 Patricia DiRubbo\u201cThe argument presented that some parents just want to put themselves before their kids is unfair and aimed at promoting guilt.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Fifty Inventions\u2019 Falls Short of Its Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryTim Harford\u2019s Undercover Economist persona has been dissecting the economics of everyday life for over a decade.His efforts, initially through a column that continues at The Financial Times, provide a trans-Atlantic parallel to those of the wildly successful Freakonomics franchise established by the University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and the journalist Stephen J. Dubner.Both \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d became best-selling books in 2005 and both spawned successful sequels and multimedia spinoffs. Mr. Leavitt and Mr. Dubner have an NPR podcast and even a \u201cFreakonomics\u201d movie, and Mr. Harford\u2019s podcast and video appearances have been sponsored by the BBC.In this era of increasing global acrimony, I am happy to report that far from producing another intercontinental rivalry, the Freakonomists and Undercover Economist have developed something of a mutual admiration society. They contribute to each others\u2019 blogs and favorably review each other\u2019s books.The effective interpretation of complex economic research for a general reader is an important journalistic function. The decision-makers who apply research results in ways that have significant social impact are far more likely to be general readers than academics. Mr. Harford\u2019s achievements over this period are all the more impressive by virtue of the fact that he is both the economist and the journalist producing the translation of the technical ideas.Mr. Harford\u2019s latest book (his sixth follow-up to \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d) is a different kind of translation: a reimagining of his popular 2016 podcast from the BBC World Service, \u201cFifty Things That Made the Modern Economy,\u201d as a book.The subtle name change from podcast to book \u2014 \u201cFifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy (Riverhead: 2017)\u201d \u2014 reflects an emphasis on humility. Mr. Harford repeatedly emphasizes that he is not trying \u201cto identify the 50 most economically significant inventions.\u201dUnfortunately, Mr. Harford\u2019s clarity about what the book isn\u2019t is not matched by comparable clarity about what the book is.This is not to say that there isn\u2019t plenty to savor in \u201cFifty Inventions.\u201d After all, the podcast was popular for a reason, and much of the book is a verbatim transcription of that series. The issue is that the insistence on making the book be about something more than the individual tales often becomes a distraction instead of a benefit. Organizing the podcasts by theme is sometimes forced, the cross-referencing of the stories uneven and the promised payoff \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to draw these lessons together and ask how we should think about innovation today\u201d\u2014 never really comes.Take the first invention grouped under the first theme: the gramophone as an example of the phenomenon that \u201cnew technologies almost always create winners and losers.\u201d Mr. Harford argues that the availability of recorded music \u201cled the way toward a winner-take-all dynamic in the performing industry.\u201dHe provides an engrossing account of the English soprano Elizabeth Billington, who prompted a mad bidding war among opera houses and was the highest paid solo singer of the early 19th century. Yet those financial spoils represented, in today\u2019s dollars, less than 1 percent of what Elton John pulls in. The availability of recorded music, Mr. Harford argues, has not only enriched the handful of Elton Johns but has been costly to those who fail to achieve superstardom because \u201cwhen you can listen at home to the best performers in the world, why pay to hear a merely competent tribute act in person?\u201dCiting an influential 1981 article on superstar economics, Mr. Harford then asserts that across many industries in which technology has radically expanded the market, the result has been that \u201cthe only-slightly-less-good went from making a comfortable living to struggling to pay their bills.\u201d He particularly argues that satellite television \u201chas been to athletes what the gramophone was to musicians.\u201dThe trouble with this narrative, as any American sports fan knows, is that it is false. Even the weakest players in any of the major sports leagues should have few challenges in obtaining life\u2019s necessities. For example, during the 50 years since Marvin Miller negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement for the Major League Baseball Players Association \u2014 precisely the period over which Mr. Harford predicts that slightly-less-good athletes should have been financially devastated \u2014 the minimum salary has grown 20,000 percent. The average player currently makes over $4 million and the minimum is over half a million.Part of the challenge faced by Mr. Harford is simply one of space. The economics is right, but the complexities of the industry structures often require a more nuanced story line. Fifty compelling stand-alone yarns in under 300 pages would challenge the most accomplished economic journalist. Adding a discussion of seven overarching themes (not to mention the need to compare and contrast and deliver on the anticipated concluding lessons) and the burden of integrating these into the individual narratives is more than can be reasonably achieved.The less than five pages devoted to Google search highlight both the structural challenge and the need for nuance. In pressing the theme of winners and losers Mr. Harford emphasizes that, with the rise of Google, newspaper advertising \u201chas fallen off a cliff.\u201d This is an unsatisfying on two fronts. First, the more fundamental challenge to newspaper advertising predated Google, with the introduction of Monster, Craigslist, eBay and the slew of other online marketplace businesses that eviscerated the core newspaper classified profit engine. Second, the bigger impact of the Google advertising monolith is the extent to which it has swallowed a disproportionate slice of the growth in digital advertising generally, relegating many once promising and highly popular ad-based online businesses to the dustbin of history.More troubling is the perfunctory history of AdWords, the core monetization engine that underpins Google\u2019s financial success. Mr. Harford correctly points out that the brilliant search algorithm in itself, although wildly useful, was not financially viable on its own. Mr. Harford, however, gives no context for how the pay-per-click advertising lifeline represented by the auction-based AdWords product came to be.Some of the most interesting parts of \u201cFifty Inventions\u201d are Mr. Harford\u2019s discussion of the complex role of government generally and intellectual property rights particularly in both fostering and hindering innovation. Yet he fails to mention that Google paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit by the originator of pay-for-click technology. An interested reader might expect, at a minimum, some perspective on whether this key episode in digital history reflected an example of intellectual property overreach or the value of government protection of ideas.Early on in \u201cFifty Inventions,\u201d Mr. Harford notes he has studiously avoided producing \u201ca book-length listicle.\u201d But given Mr. Harford\u2019s prodigious skills as an economic storyteller, there are few as well positioned to produce precisely that. There are, after all, reasons that listicles are so popular \u2014 indeed those reasons would make a great \u201cUndercover Economist\u201d column.If Mr. Harford had simply embraced our love of listicles rather than set himself an inherently unachievable task, the resulting book would have yielded more pleasures and fewer frustrations.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThrough Aug. 20. New Release Gallery, 60 Mulberry Street, Manhattan; 212-571-2400, newreleasegallery.com.The quietude begins with a shoji screen by Mr. Childress that blocks off the gallery\u2019s front window, its lightweight frame reiterating the six basic lines of the hexagram structure. The screen\u2019s structure and softening effects are echoed at the back of the gallery in the atmospheric yet geometric blacks and grays of a painting by Mr. Childress. In the middle of the space, Siebren Versteeg\u2019s \u201cSunyata\u201d \u2014 the Buddhist concept of emptiness or voidness \u2014 gives you a notion of chance in action: Resembling a glowing glass coffee table with a modernistic lamp, it is actually a large LCD monitor laid horizontal and outfitted with a webcam arcing over it. Together they form a tight feedback loop: Anything captured by the camera appears on the screen, but in varying states of ghostly flux \u2014 a s\u00e9ance-like effect \u2014 thanks to a computer program that incorporates a live Google search.Leah Shirley and Matt Gliva mix nonelectronic mediums, combining paintings that evoke icons with offerings or altars. On three small but substantial cantilevered platforms, Matthew J. Stone presents delicate objects carved in contrasting woods. His efforts and Aviva Rowley\u2019s assertive black ceramic vessels might both be intended for ceremonial uses. The asymmetry of Kate Casey\u2019s \u201cOffset Bench\u201d may make you look twice to discover its balance and, in its details, its symmetry. Lena Schmid\u2019s large, carefully textured landscape on paper might be a pictorial response to Hexagram 62\u2019s invocation of \u201cThunder Over the Mountain.\u201d That it is a monotype and not, as it first appears, a charcoal drawing somehow makes it stranger. Next to it, Katy Fischer\u2019s magical \u201cShards 9\u201d may inspire a similar double take: What seem to be found ceramic fragments in irregular shapes are in fact carefully formed and glazed objects, suggesting the evolution of language and tools in a universe in which every different thing is perfect.In the resonating oppositions and agreements of these works, Mr. Childress\u2019s show resembles a well-made puzzle, perhaps a kind of hexagram. And behind its otherworldly mood pulses an implicit resistance to the world as it is.ROBERTA SMITHThrough Aug. 18. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com.For the occasion, the artist Vincent Fecteau and the curator Jordan Stein have chosen six artists associated by birth or residency with Northern California. Whether this was a nod to the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, I don\u2019t know, but it works. All are individualists operating outside any mainstream, past or present.Jack Mendenhall\u2019s photorealistic paintings of mirrored, 1970s and \u201980s middle-class interiors have an air of precision-built chaos, which is also found in Robert Strini\u2019s two wood sculptures made from what looks like disassembled designer furniture.If Tisa Walden\u2019s small photographs of San Francisco look as if they might have been snapped on a laid-back stroll, Isabella Kirkland\u2019s oil paintings of marine-life specimens, lined up like hors d\u2019oeuvres on a tray, have a scientific clarity, and more than that, a sense of mescaline-washed wonder. So do ink drawings by the totally interesting filmmaker-mystic Jordan Belson (1926-2011); each one is a controlled explosion of fervid line.The Belson drawings date from the 1950s, when beatnik was heading toward hippie, and those cultural impulses would seem to merge in a video by the writer Joanne Kyger (1934-2017). This is the only video that Kyger \u2014 a poet, a practicing Buddhist, briefly a Yippie, and a lifelong back-to-the-lander \u2014 ever made. In it, she recites her own adaptation of Descartes\u2019s \u201cDiscourse on Method\u201d and turns it into a personal and spiritual statement, from which the title of the show is drawn. Witty, moving, intellectually lucent, and quite far out, it instantly makes you want to know her better, and it more than justifies a visit to this show.HOLLAND COTTERThrough Sept. 4. Austrian Cultural Forum New York, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan; 212-319-5300, acfny.org.A thrumming drone emits from what is described as an \u201cacoustic monument\u201d and remnants of other minimalist-type sculpture \u2014 some of which was hacked up at the exhibition\u2019s opening \u2014 occupy this spare gallery space. Two humming automated vacuum cleaners move across the floor, bumping into walls and corners. These disk-like objects are making appearances in many artists\u2019 works these days and they draw links between mass-produced ready-mades, like Jeff Koons\u2019s vacuum cleaners encased in plexiglass in the \u201980s, and the uncanny nature of clean and sterile spaces.In creating this installation, however, Mr. Salzmann addresses one of contemporary art\u2019s greatest conundrums: Can art installed in an antiseptic, corporate space like this one tackle gritty and ambitious subjects? (Interestingly, Brian O\u2019Doherty, who wrote the seminal critique of white cube spaces, \u201cInside the White Cube: The Ideology of the Gallery Space\u201d in 1976, had a colorfully disruptive installation in the same gallery last year.) What Mr. Salzmann might suggest is how this type of space can be its own form of grueling interrogation: It may be banal, yet the invisible and immaterial output leaves deep marks on the psyche.MARTHA SCHWENDENERAdvertisement"}

Then, if the bills are passed in October and November, the tax legislation can get to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk before December.But there are still divisions on how the tax code would be revised:And members of both parties are already objecting to the administration\u2019s proposal to eliminate the deduction that Americans can take on their state and local taxes.Last week, the coffee giant bought out its local partner.

The deal also brings an expected $350 million in cost savings.Wall Street, however, was not convinced \u2014 Discovery\u2019s stock price plunged on Monday.And it\u2019s a setback for SoftBank, which has been on a run of deal-making recently.SoftBank is the biggest investor in Snapdeal, but said it respected Snapdeal\u2019s decision.Both Snapdeal and Flipkart have been losing ground to Amazon, which arrived in India in 2014.Related SoftBank Reading \u2022 Speaking of seed funding: Despite a surge of interest from wealthy individuals looking to invest in technology start-ups, such financing appears to be drying up.Some in Silicon Valley worry that investors are becoming concerned about overinflated valuations of start-ups. Others think that existing technology giants like Facebook and Google are so powerful that they can quickly squelch newborn competitors.The expiration of the first so-called \u201clockup period\u201d meant that roughly 400 million shares held by early investors and company executives could be sold.But analysts said that the event had been priced into the stock. Snap\u2019s shares went down as much as 5 percent before whipsawing throughout the day, and closed at $13.67.The next moment of potential drama is likely to be at the end of August, after Snap reports its latest quarterly earnings \u2014 and the second phase of the lockup expires.Snap\u2019s stock price is now down nearly 20 percent from its initial offer price.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Speedier Way to Catalog Human Cells (All 37 Trillion of Them)", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterThere are some questions in biology that you\u2019d think were settled long ago. For instance: How many types of cells are there in the human body?\u201cIf you just Google this, the number everyone uses is 200,\u201d said Jay Shendure, a geneticist at the University of Washington. \u201cBut to me that seems absurdly low.\u201d A number of scientists like him want to build a more complete catalog.Yet there are an estimated 37 trillion cells in the human body. The traditional ways to identify cell types \u2014 such as carefully tracing the shape of individual cells under a microscope \u2014 are too slow and crude for the job.Although still at an experimental stage, the method may become an essential tool for cataloging every cell type in the human body, experts said.\u201cIt\u2019s a really important piece of work,\u201d said David M. Miller, a cell biologist at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWith this approach, you can do more for a whole lot less work, and a whole lot less money.\u201dIn the laboratory, scientists easily discern the difference between, say, a muscle and a nerve cell. But these broad categories encompass many different types of cells.A muscle cell might be a skeletal muscle cell, the kind you use to walk or lift a cup. Or it might be a smooth muscle cell lining your small intestines, making it ripple with contractions. Our hearts are built of special muscle cells all their own, known as cardiomyocytes.Even these come in different types. Some contract the chambers to pump blood, for example, while others conduct electric impulses around the heart.Genetically speaking, all cells in the body are identical. They all carry the same 20,000 or so protein-coding genes. What distinguishes each type is the particular combination of genes the cell uses to make proteins.The first step in this process is making a copy of the gene in the form of a molecule called RNA. The cell uses the RNA molecule as a template to build a protein.Dr. Shendure and his colleagues reasoned that the distinctive collection of RNA molecules floating around inside a cell could provide clues about the cell\u2019s type. To measure that RNA, they developed a kind of molecular \u201cbar coding.\u201dIn the first step, the researchers pour thousands of cells into hundreds of miniature \u201cwells.\u201d Each well contains molecular tags that attach themselves to every RNA molecule inside the cells.The process is repeated two or more times until each cell ends up with a unique combination of tags attached to its RNA molecules. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues then break open the cells and read the sequences of tags at once.The \u201cbar codes\u201d allow the scientists to see which genes are active in each cell. Cells of the same type should share many of those genes in common.\u201cWe came up with this scheme that allows us to look at very large numbers of cells at the same time, without ever isolating a single cell,\u201d said Dr. Shendure.He and his colleagues call their method sci-RNA-seq (short for single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). To test it, they set out to classify every cell in a tiny worm, Caenorhabditis elegans.Scientists know more about C. elegans\u2019s cells than any other animal\u2019s. In the 1960s, the biologist Sydney Brenner made it a model for investigating biological development.Dr. Brenner and later generations of scientists tracked the worm\u2019s growth from a single cell to about 1,000 cells at maturity, classifying them into types with a microscope. Eventually, scientists plucked individual cells from the worm\u2019s body and painstakingly measured their DNA activity.Dr. Shendure and his colleagues decided to see how results from sci-RNA-seq compared to those from decades of research.They raised 150,000 C. elegans larvae and then doused them with chemicals that broke them apart into individual cells. (Each larva has 762 cells, not counting the cells that will become eggs or sperm.) They then tagged all the RNA in the cells.With the new method, the researchers were able to identify 27 cell types that had been identified in previous studies. But the team also was able to break them down into smaller groups, each with a slightly different pattern of gene activity.They identified 40 different kinds of neurons, for example, including very rare types. In few cases, only a single such neuron develops in each worm.\u201cI was excited because it worked extremely well \u2014 they uncovered results that will be valuable for me and for the whole field,\u201d said Cori Bargmann, an expert on C. elegans at the Rockefeller University.Yet for now, sci-RNA-seq falls far short of capturing the full complexity of cell types, even in such a simple animal.Dr. Shendure and his colleagues could not match some of their clusters of neurons to a known type of cell, and they did not find most of the 118 different types of neurons that earlier studies have documented.\u201cWe don\u2019t consider this a finished project,\u201d said Dr. Shendure.Dr. Bargmann and her colleagues are already trying to match Dr. Shendure\u2019s results to neurons in the worm. \u201cOf course, there is more to do, but I am pretty optimistic that this can be solved,\u201d she said.Sarah A. Teichmann, a cell biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who was not involved in the new study, said the report illustrated how fast the field of cell-typing has moved.Dr. Teichmann\u2019s fellow atlas leader, Aviv Regev, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute and MIT, said that differences between the human body and that of C. elegans would require some different strategies.For one thing, humans are huge compared to C. elegans. The researchers certainly will not try to dissolve human bodies into 37 trillion loose cells and analyze them all at once.\u201cThe human cell atlas initiative will work through organs, tissues and systems,\u201d Dr. Regev said.And C. elegans follows a tightly controlled genetic program to build its body. Its cells always end up in the same place, in the same numbers. Humans are a lot more flexible in how they develop: the locations of cells vary from one person\u2019s body to the next.\u201cThe trick is to relate cells to the place they came from,\u201d Dr. Regev said.Nevertheless, sci-RNA-seq may well become a useful tool for work in humans. \u201cThe major benefit is that it could scale to capture many more cells in one experiment,\u201d Dr. Teichmann said. \u201cIt\u2019s an elegant and potentially very powerful approach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Maddeningly Simple Way Tech Companies Can Employ More Women", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI am the co-founder of a company that helps clients find ways to diversify their work force. We recently set up an interview at a major company for a senior African-American woman software engineer. After meeting with the hiring panel, she withdrew her application, telling us she felt demeaned by the all-white male group that failed to ask her any questions about her coding skills. She described how one of the men had made it clear to her that she wasn\u2019t a cultural fit and that therefore they didn\u2019t need to proceed with technical questions.I hear stories like this regularly, as I work with companies in Silicon Valley and beyond who want to bring more women onto their tech teams. Higher-ups declare their intention to hire more women. But the actual hiring is still all too rare.There\u2019s a continuing debate about the reasons for the lack of diversity in the tech sector, including candidate pools that are mostly male, and stubborn, superficial notions of what it means to be a \u201ccultural fit\u201d for an organization \u2014 the template for which is often based on young white men. But at least one small component of this problem is immediately solvable: Many companies are alienating the qualified women who want to work for them, and who they want to hire, during the interview process itself.When my company is approached to help diversify some of America\u2019s most gender-unbalanced tech teams, here\u2019s how it usually goes in the introductory meeting: A well-meaning executive boasts that his company has been financially supporting a number of nonprofit coding organizations that aim to train female engineers. He tells us he\u2019ll have a booth at the Grace Hopper conference, the largest annual gathering of women in tech. He complains about how hard it is to \u201cmove the needle\u201d on diversity numbers, especially when a staff is in the thousands.But what the executives don\u2019t give as much thought to are some of the simplest determinants of how successful a company will be in hiring diverse candidates. Will women have any input in the hiring process? Will the interview panels be diverse? Will current female employees be available to speak to candidates about their experiences? Many times, the answer to each of these questions is no, and the resistance to make simple changes in these areas is striking.My colleagues and I often see companies work to make themselves appealing to candidates by emphasizing perks like Ping-Pong tables, retreats and policies that let employees bring their dogs to work. Those things can be appealing to candidates of any gender. But one size doesn\u2019t fit all: We have to tell these companies to talk just as proudly about their parental-leave policies, child-care programs and breast-pumping rooms. At the very least, they need to communicate that their workplaces have cultures where women are valued. They need to show they\u2019re not places where attitudes like that of the now-infamous Google engineer who wrote a memo questioning women\u2019s fitness for tech jobs dominate.At first, the executives balk at my suggestions and even wonder if explicitly talking about the place of women is sexist. But I remind them that when it comes to gender, they have to play catch-up, after long histories of eroding trust by grilling women about how they\u2019ll be able to do the job with children at home and years of negative stories in the press with tales of how women are mistreated at tech companies. Candidates rightfully want assurances about whether the companies have improved \u2014 or whether they even care. Treating everyone the same won\u2019t accomplish that.Silicon Valley companies are in love with themselves and don\u2019t understand why the love isn\u2019t always returned by the few women to whom they extend employment offers. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so proud of so-called boomerangs \u2014 candidates who have left a company for reasons that may or may not be related to how it treats women and, after advancing their careers elsewhere, return. Executives hope these employees will add to their diversity numbers and provide evidence that the company has evolved. But even potential boomerangs are looking for hiring-process hints that they\u2019ll be able to thrive. They want to know, what policies have changed for us? Is the environment more inclusive? Can I have a family without compromising my career? When tech firms in Silicon Valley and beyond decide to proactively answer those questions as part of their regular processes, they have a chance to successfully recruit and hire more women.I\u2019m often asked which companies are getting diversity and inclusion right in Silicon Valley and across the country. Most aren\u2019t. But some are seeing small successes. Last year, we worked with a company that set a goal that women would make up 50 percent of the engineers on one of its teams. They did it by holding a webinar led by female employees, with 100 female candidates who asked questions about how the organization was changing to become more inclusive to women. They asked recruiters to follow up with the candidates to offer fuller responses and address other concerns. The company realized it needed to take extra time to convince women that it truly valued them.It worked. The women hired through that effort are all still at the company. Now we\u2019re working with it to bring in even more female engineers. When the next round of candidates show up for interviews, this is one place in tech that will have a story about an inclusive culture that it\u2019s proud to tell.Katharine Zaleski is the president and a co-founder of PowerToFly.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Survive in Tough Times, Restaurants Turn to Data-Mining", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe early diners are dawdling, so your 7:30 p.m. reservation looks more like 8. While you wait, the last order of the duck you wanted passes by. Tonight, you\u2019ll be eating something else \u2014 without a second bottle of wine, because you can\u2019t find your server in the busy dining room. This is not your favorite night out.The right data could have fixed it, according to the tech wizards who are determined to jolt the restaurant industry out of its current slump. Information culled and crunched from a wide array of sources can identify customers who like to linger, based on data about their dining histories, so the manager can anticipate your wait, buy you a drink and make the delay less painful.It can track the restaurant\u2019s duck sales by day, week and season, and flag you as a regular who likes duck. It can identify a server whose customers have spent a less-than-average amount on alcohol, to see if he needs to sharpen his second-round skills.So Big Data is staging an intervention.Both start-ups and established companies are scrambling to deliver up-to-the-minute data on sales, customers, staff performance or competitors by merging the information that restaurants already have with all sorts of data from outside sources: social media, tracking apps, reservation systems, review sites, even weather reports.They have an eager audience. The NPD Group, a market research company, is predicting \u201cflat\u201d growth in 2017 restaurant traffic, with a 2 percent decline among full-service restaurants and no growth for quick-service restaurants. A 2016 National Restaurant Association survey reported that four out of five restaurateurs believed that business would improve if they embraced technology, and a third worried that they were lagging in those efforts.In the old days, restaurateurs used ledgers to track sales, and scribbled notes about their customers\u2019 preferences or idiosyncrasies. Then along came point-of-sale software and reservation services that provided more sophisticated records and analysis, but created a tech tower of Babel, with most systems speaking their own dialect.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.These new tools make a paradoxical promise: that they can take restaurants back to the good old days, before the business grew so big.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201cis to leverage the technology to do what we would do if we had one little restaurant and we were there all the time and knew every customer by name.\u201dMr. Oberholtzer and his two partners opened the first of two dozen cafeteria-style restaurants in Culver City, Calif., in 2006, and plan to open an equal number in the Northeast by 2020. Every new Tender Greens will rely on what he calls \u201ca whole rebuild of technology,\u201d because the 11-year-old system it uses is about as up-to-date as a beeper.\u201cIt gives us ways to recognize people who\u2019ve been in regularly, or haven\u2019t been in for a while or have specific preferences,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said.A regular diner who always orders the ni\u00e7oise salad will get a message on the app about the halibut special. A diner who always orders vegetarian options will not get the message about the summer hog roast. \u201cWe want to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201csometimes before they even mention them.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t know that someone\u2019s going to become a regular, so you don\u2019t necessarily keep track of those people,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cBut the system does.\u201d It also tracks the top 100\u2019s dining companions when they split the check. Upserve sends a list of credit card numbers, dates of visits and items bought; the restaurant matches each number to a name, and a search on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn provides a face to go with it.\u201cWe\u2019re sure to recognize them\u201d the next time they come in, so the staff can welcome them back by name, Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn\u2019t make the reservation themselves.\u201dEven the type of credit card contributes to the dossier. If a customer pays with an airline card, a server might mention travel. If a customer is a sports fan, he will most likely get a server who is as well.Customers who find the mining of personal data invasive can opt out, up to a point, but it requires effort: To avoid detection, they have to pay cash and not make reservations. Those who participate actively in the process get more information in return.In June 2015, the online reservation service OpenTable, which represents 43,000 restaurants worldwide, started to provide customized recommendations, just as Netflix and Amazon suggest programs or products based on a customer\u2019s history.If users sign up for the company\u2019s app and allow OpenTable access to their GPS, they receive recommendations for restaurants in the United States and several foreign countries, said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing.And if data can help a customer find a restaurant, it can also help a restaurant find its customers. To pinpoint potential locations in the Northeast that best reach what Mr. Oberholtzer calls Tender Greens\u2019s \u201cpsychographic\u201d \u2014 the college-educated diner who cares about health and locally produced food \u2014 he starts with data from a customer analytics firm that specializes in site selection.He refines that list with Google searches like \u201cplant-forward lifestyle,\u201d he said, and looks at where delivery systems like Uber and DoorDash do a lot of business.\u201cYou overlay and look for redundancy,\u201d he said, \u201cand that begins to tell the story of where you want to be.\u201dThe scorecard ranks servers on multiple criteria, which makes it easier for Ms. Williamson to identify the right waiter, for example, for a large party with children. She might not pick the server who sells the most. The more appropriate match could be a server who ranks higher in tip percentage than in sales, thanks to grateful families who tend to order less alcohol.Start-ups aspire to create even more streamlined software, but it isn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe\u2019re making a moon shot here,\u201d said Mr. Chowdhury of Salido, which originally set an August deadline for \u201ca fully operational stack\u201d of features but is only about three-quarters of the way there. The company has extended its deadline to early 2018, as development work continues with 64 existing clients.Still, some early adopters approach the new systems warily. Mr. Guidara, who also uses Avero at Eleven Madison Park, thinks technology is great for a fast-casual operation that emphasizes volume and delivery, and for the business side at a fine-dining operation. It has no place, he said, when it comes to service at Eleven Madison Park or the NoMad, where he and Mr. Humm rely on traditional methods of high-end hospitality: expertise, eye contact and a hair-trigger response to a diner\u2019s every need.\u201cWhen I worked as a controller, in accounting capacities, we used it quite often,\u201d Mr. Guidara said. \u201cBut from an experiential, guest-facing point of view, we don\u2019t use it. That\u2019s never been how we approach things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pushed constantly about these new systems,\u201d Mr. Kinch said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s all about the guest? I think that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I place a tremendous value on direct eye contact and a genuine smile.\u201dAt Oriole, the Sandovals have left sake on the menu despite data showing that it doesn\u2019t sell well. \u201cWe go by our gut,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt pairs well with a lot of the courses, it\u2019s very versatile, and it speaks to how we\u2019re willing not to go the traditional route.\u201dThe sheer glut of new restaurant data systems can be overwhelming, even to those who embrace them.\u201cAt least once a week, I get something about a new start-up with a new gadget that\u2019s going to make our lives so much better,\u201d said Sisha Ortuzar, Mr. Colicchio\u2019s partner at \u2018Wichcraft. \u201cThey\u2019re distractions.

{"Headline": "When the Prescription Is a Recipe", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe doctor\u2019s office is moving into the kitchen.After years of telling patients to skip junk food and prepare homemade meals, a growing number of doctors and medical groups are now going a step further and teaching them how to cook. Some are building teaching kitchens or creating food pantries right next to their practices. Others are prescribing culinary education programs in hopes of improving their patients\u2019 nutrition and overall health. Some medical schools have even introduced culinary curriculums to train more doctors to talk to patients about food.\u201cI needed to do more than just give patients a pamphlet. I had to have a kitchen in my office,\u201d Dr. Fernando said. \u201cI try to give a lot of prescriptions that are just recipes to see if we can fix an issue with food.\u201dDr. Fernando said she has learned that poor food choices can be the root of many seemingly unrelated issues.\u201cSometimes parents say their kids have symptoms of anxiety and are wetting the bed and they feel their child needs to see a counselor or needs medication,\u201d Dr. Fernando said. But when she asks about diet, it may be that the child is not eating enough fiber, which leads to constipation. And constipation, in turn, can aggravate the bladder, causing bed-wetting. \u201cThat\u2019s when you can connect the dots and see how food is often intertwined in their symptoms.\u201dA perk of having a kitchen right next to her office, Dr. Fernando said, is that she can take patients right in and demonstrate something she wants them to try, such as how to grind flaxseed. That costs the patients nothing. But patients pay out-of-pocket for cooking classes, which vary in cost depending on the length. For example, a five-day \u201cfood adventure\u201d camp for 7- to 12-year-olds costs $125. A popular class on how to make nutritious baby food costs $17.50.Claudia Castro of Stafford, Va., and her daughter Michelle, 14, began taking lessons in Dr. Fernando\u2019s kitchen after a blood test showed that Michelle was prediabetic.One of the first recipes Michelle and her mother learned to make in Dr. Fernando\u2019s kitchen was for bean burgers.\u201cDr. Fernando took the time to tell us and then show us how to make the food she wants Michelle to eat to be healthy,\u201d Mrs. Castro said. \u201cWe also now drink almond milk, we have vegetables and salads, very little red meat. Even when we eat out, we eat healthier.\u201dMichelle lost 10 pounds in a month and is down one dress size.Dharti Patel enrolled her 10-year-old son, Rishi, in the program.\u201cMost doctors would just hand me some paperwork with advice on what to eat and what not to eat,\u201d Mrs. Patel said. \u201cThey would tell me to just follow what\u2019s on the chart. But it did not help.\u201dIn the CHEF program, her son learned how to cut up vegetables and fruit and how to make simple chicken and fish dishes, salads with homemade dressing, tostadas and yogurt parfaits for dessert.Ms. Patel said her son now reads nutrition labels when they shop at the supermarket. \u201cWhenever Rishi eats, now he looks for how many colors we added to the plate,\u201d she said. \u201cNow he wants to help us at home when we cook. He was surprised that he liked vegetables after all.\u201dDr. Julie La Barba, CHEF\u2019s medical director and also a pediatrician, said the program was formed out of the concept that \u201cfood could be seen as medicine,\u201d especially in children.Dr. Timothy Harlan, executive director of the Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University, hopes that future doctors see the benefits of adding nutritional education to their treatment arsenal. The center\u2019s curriculum has been licensed and is being used at 28 other medical schools.\u201cWhat we teach here is how to have a discussion with one\u2019s patient about food that can have a substantive impact,\u201d Dr. Harlan said. \u201cPhysicians will tell you that they have never gotten enough nutrition education. So we sometimes feel underprepared when it comes to nutrition.\u201d\u201cI would love for teaching kitchens to become as commonplace as gyms, and for access to them to be part of our organized health system,\u201d Dr. Eisenberg said.Allison Righter, the coordinator of the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, said it was formed to bring teaching kitchens across varying organizations together to learn about one another\u2019s facilities and programs and share best practices.Boston Medical Center, a member of the collaborative, has a \u201cpreventive food pantry,\u201d the first of its kind when it opened in 2001. Doctors can write \u201cprescriptions\u201d for patients to visit the pantry, which gives them access to healthful food and addresses issues of nutrition-related illness. It also allows low-income patients access to healthy food.\u201cThere are a lot of conflicting impulses out there regarding food,\u201d said Dr. Christine Pace, an internist at Boston Medical Center. \u201cWe live in a culture that has access to incredibly unhealthy food for very little money.\u201d\u201cOne would hope that on any medical visit, a doctor would look for an opportunity to see what people are doing around their diet and whether they want additional support in making dietary changes,\u201d Dr. Ross said.For patients with diagnoses like diabetes or hypertension, a cooking class is billed as an intermediate office visit. Nonpatients can take a class for $60.\u201cI see patients who want to use lifestyle measures to control and treat chronic conditions: obesity, heart disease and high cholesterol. I see people who generally have seen everybody else and are persuaded and motivated that lifestyle \u2014 especially nutrition \u2014 has a great deal to do with their well-being,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler Joins BMW in Race to Make Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFiat Chrysler Automobiles will cooperate with BMW to develop self-driving cars, the companies said Wednesday, as traditional automakers look to defend their turf against cash-rich Silicon Valley giants eager to upend the industry.Autonomous vehicles are expected to transform the auto industry within the next decade. The new technology pits established carmakers, with their decades of experience and global supply chains, against the likes of Google and Apple, which have much greater financial resources as well as greater expertise in the software that will be crucial to the development of driverless vehicles.Fiat Chrysler has struggled more than most carmakers to compete in this new world because of meager profits. The company has largely stayed on the sidelines while rivals like Volkswagen or General Motors moved into technology-oriented businesses like car sharing or digital mapping.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cThere was an expectation Fiat Chrysler was resigned to being a hardware manufacturer for Apple or Google,\u201d said James Hodgson, a senior analyst at ABI Research. \u201cThis is a sign that they are going to take a more active role.\u201dSince last year, BMW has been working with Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes cameras, sensors and software used in self-driving vehicles. Intel acquired Mobileye in a deal that closed last week, in what was seen as an attempt by the chip maker to catch up with its rival Nvidia in self-driving technology.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Fiat Chrysler is not likely to bring much self-driving know-how to the alliance, Mr. Hodgson said. But, he noted, its experience producing less expensive, mass market vehicles will complement BMW\u2019s strong position in the high end of the car market.Still, it will be a huge challenge for established carmakers to remain relevant. They are experts in manufacturing vehicles that run on internal combustion engines in large numbers for affordable prices. But that skill will become less relevant if, as expected, battery-powered cars become ubiquitous. Electric vehicles have fewer parts than their conventional counterparts and are easier to manufacture.In addition, the financial resources of the Silicon Valley companies dwarf those of the automakers. Apple is worth 40 times as much on the stock market as Fiat Chrysler. Indeed, if they chose to, Apple or Google could acquire a carmaker for sums that, by their standards, would amount to pocket change.Mr. Hodgson said it was possible for established carmakers to be able to defend their positions, but, he added, \u201cYou should not underestimate the challenge facing them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Culture Wars Have Come to Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe culture wars that have consumed politics in the United States have now landed on Silicon Valley\u2019s doorstep.Silicon Valley\u2019s politics have long skewed left, with a free-market\u2019s philosophy and a dash of libertarianism. But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore\u2019s firing has now plunged the nation\u2019s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country.Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Mr. Damore\u2019s comments carried additional weight to people on either side of the political spectrum because he was an engineer at Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.Alongside other giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Apple, these companies \u201care seen as pillars of our society,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cControversy and statements that emanate from these employees take on a different heft.\u201dThe technology industry has long marched in lock step on issues such as supporting immigration and diversity, even though their companies remained largely male, white and Asian. But last year\u2019s election of Mr. Trump \u2014 with his broadsides against political correctness, his coarse language toward women and his actions to restrict immigration and deny climate change \u2014 seemed to threaten many of those ideals.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s words may have made dissenters in the tech industry more comfortable about speaking out.\u201cTrump, in a sense, licensed people to express what some people would call politically incorrect thoughts,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Business School. \u201cThen there\u2019s the other force that a lot of Trump\u2019s policies go against the inclusive ideals these companies espouse.\u201dMr. Damore\u2019s memo and dismissal transformed him into a hero on right-wing news sites like Breitbart, which has long criticized the political leanings of the tech industry.\u201cGoogle drives a big sector of tech into the arms of Trump: fires employee who wrote memo about women in tech jobs,\u201d Dr. Pinker wrote.One of the most outspoken supporters of Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley has been Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who has since faced derision from other people working in tech for his political stance. In a sign of how deep that ill feeling runs, Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings warned Mr. Thiel last August, a few weeks after Mr. Trump had accepted the Republican nomination for president, that he would face consequences for backing Mr. Trump.\u201cI see our board being about great judgment, particularly in unlikely disaster where we have to pick new leaders,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote in the email to Mr. Thiel, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \"I\u2019m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from \u2018different judgment\u2019 to \u2018bad judgment.\u2019 Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Hastings declined to comment through their spokesmen; neither challenged the authenticity of the email. Both of the men remain on Facebook\u2019s board.Mr. Luckey, through mutual agreement with his employer, stayed away from the Oculus offices to let the controversy die down, according to three people with knowledge of the episode who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. In December, before returning briefly to the office, he told colleagues he was committed to staying at the company, according to a copy of a message he posted on an internal discussion board, which was reviewed by The Times.But by the end of March, Oculus said he was no longer working there.A Facebook spokeswoman reiterated an earlier company statement saying that Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure was unrelated to his political views. Mr. Luckey declined to comment on his departure from Facebook.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Trip or Vacation? Travel Start-Ups Try to Blur the Line", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesPlanning a vacation? Chances are you\u2019ll think about it differently than you do that business trip you\u2019re also arranging.For the vacation, you may scroll through hotel reviews before deciding where to stay, not just to compare prices but also to consider the amenities offered.For the business trip, on the other hand, you may be inclined to book a hotel that offers rewards for frequent guests instead of the one with the lowest nightly rate. It is company money you\u2019re spending, after all.Leisure travelers are naturally more selective and cost conscious than business travelers. But a new breed of start-ups that caters to corporate travelers and focuses on user behavior may be making those distinctions obsolete.\u201cI came up with the concept in 2012, but it wasn\u2019t really my idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stumbled onto Google\u2019s approach,\u201d which has been in place at least a decade. The Google method includes drawing up a budget for airfare and hotels before every trip. If employees come in under budget, they earn credits that can be redeemed for travel upgrades in the future. The approach is different from \u201cgamified\u201d booking tools that encourage certain behavior, like using a preferred carrier, but generally do not let employees share in the savings.Mr. Ruch calls the system \u201cincentivized behavioral change,\u201d and he said it was either the most radical concept in corporate travel, or the most obvious.\u201cThere\u2019s such an enormous amount of inefficiency in business travel,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your company\u2019s policy allows business class on flights over six hours, it is not expected behavior to fly coach. If your policy allows five-star hotels, it is not expected behavior to stay at a three-star hotel or to stay with a friend.\u201dPeople are naturally drawn to comfort, Mr. Ruch said, meaning that unless they know they will be rewarded for cutting corners, they will indulge their inclination to make business travel as cushy, and as expensive, as possible.\u201cThere was really no incentive to save,\u201d he said. Once Rocketrip and its \u201cBudget to Beat\u201d formulas were adopted, Mr. Mintman said, AAF employees started to save the company 15 to 20 percent, or roughly $133, per trip. Travelers see how much they can earn for each cost-saving option \u2014 staying with a friend instead of staying at a hotel, for example \u2014 through Rocketrip\u2019s online booking tool.Rocketrip, like other start-ups applying a carrot-and-stick approach to travel, also gives reports to company managers about how much was saved and which action \u2014 settling, say, for a cheaper hotel or a coach seat \u2014 caused the savings on each trip, Mr. Ruch said. If an employee goes over the \u201cbudget to beat\u201d figure, management sees that, too.Mr. Mintman said that working with Rocketrip had helped AAF determine what was reasonable for a travel budget. \u201cNow, we can go back to someone\u2019s proposed spending on a trip and see how well it lines up with what Rocketrip has come up with,\u201d he said.TripActions, which gives users who save their companies money \u201cTripBucks\u201d redeemable for gift cards, upgrades and vacations, claims it can cut travel costs as much as 30 percent per trip. (Mr. Ruch said the average Rocketrip user saves the company 24 percent.)The TripActions app lets users specify airplane seat preferences, loyalty club memberships and other personal details before booking. It also allows for last-minute itinerary changes and features a chat line, should complications arise.\u201cI\u2019m leaving for a trip on Monday, so I know I\u2019ll get a call from them on Sunday afternoon letting me know my flights are still on schedule,\u201d he said. He also likes the TripBucks, which accrue the more you travel and the more you save. Mr. Rowley said he had earned $1,700 in rewards and had saved Jive $7,500 since the company started using TripActions at the end of last year. He cashes in his TripBucks for Amazon gift cards.\u201cMy daughter is getting married, so I\u2019m using TripBucks to buy things for her wedding,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve learned from using TripActions that travel really is a behavioral thing. I used to wait until the last minute if I needed to go somewhere. Like, I\u2019d book my tickets late so I could get into a certain hotel. But now I book months in advance because I\u2019m looking to save some money and earn some rewards.\u201dUpside, a third venture developed with the goal of getting business travelers to think like consumers, bypasses travel managers and works directly with employees.Kurt Hosna, global communications director at a Boston human resources management company, said he had used Upside since it started. So far, he has redeemed roughly $1,000 in rewards, much of it for gear for his cycling hobby.Before he and his colleagues started using Upside, Mr. Hosna said, they tried to be good sports about not overspending on travel. His company\u2019s pat-on-the-back approach to acknowledging their conscientiousness was nice, he said. But Upside\u2019s gift cards have been nicer. \u201cGiving people real rewards just makes sense,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Far Right Plans Its Next Moves With a New Energy", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome were making arrangements to appear at future marches. Some were planning to run for public office. Others, taking a cue from the Charlottesville event \u2014 a protest, nominally, of the removal of a Confederate-era statue \u2014 were organizing efforts to preserve what they referred to as \u201cwhite heritage\u201d symbols in their home regions.Calling it \u201can opportune time,\u201d Preston Wiginton, a Texas-based white nationalist, declared on Saturday that he planned to hold a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d march on Sept. 11 on the campus of Texas A&M \u2014 with a keynote speaker, Richard B. Spencer, who was featured at the Charlottesville event.The far right, which has returned to prominence in the past year or so, has always been an amalgam of factions and causes, some with pro-Confederate or neo-Nazi leanings, some opposed to political correctness or feminism. But the Charlottesville event, the largest of its kind in recent years, exposed the pre-existing fault lines in the movement.Some hard-line conservatives beat Mr. Trump to the punch, apparently concluding that the marchers had gone too far and that their aggressiveness and messages could hurt the movement. Mike Cernovich, an influential right-wing media figure who is hardly shy of controversy, posted a Twitter message on Saturday afternoon, attacking what the self-proclaimed alt-right, parts of which use Nazi imagery and racist language, had become.\u201cThe alt-right will now be made up of losers with nothing to lose,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis sets ceiling on numbers while also attracting loons and terrorists.\u201dWell before the gathering in Charlottesville, Mr. McInnes had planned to hold a \u201cFree Speech\u201d rally in Boston on Saturday, but it remained unclear whether it would take place after civil rights groups on Monday asked the city\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, to revoke the rally\u2019s permit. Mr. McInnes, in an unusual move, said he hoped the event would be canceled.\u201cIt\u2019s a lose-lose situation,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf we have a permit and we don\u2019t go, it would show that antifa\u201d \u2014 or anti-fascists \u2014 \u201ccan shut us down whenever they want. But if we do go, it will look like we\u2019re fighting for Nazis we don\u2019t like.\u201dOn Monday night, officials at Texas A&M announced that they were canceling Mr. Wiginton\u2019s event. But he pushed back, saying he would fight the university in court. \u201cIt seems like the First Amendment doesn\u2019t apply to white people,\u201d he said.\u201cEvery city needs to watch out,\u201d Mr. Mosley said. \u201cWe are everywhere.\u201dMr. Mosley added that he had no concerns about the president\u2019s remarks and that they would have no effect on the movement\u2019s future plans.\u201cThe president is being advised by people who don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Mosley added. \u201cHe\u2019s essentially going off of false information. We\u2019re not in any way worried about moving forward.\u201dMr. Heimbach echoed that notion, saying that the president\u2019s remarks would not stop him or his colleagues. \u201cI expected him to backtrack,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have Republicans and Democrats united in the purpose of genociding our people. With the pressure put on Mr. Trump, I\u2019m not surprised he made those comments.\u201dLike other white supremacists, Mr. Spencer has called for \u201ca white homeland\u201d in North America. But he, too, can often seem less interested in policy than in headlines.At his news conference, he referred \u2014 cheekily, it seemed \u2014 to the throngs in Charlottesville who marched by torchlight in an echo of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201cThe idea that the K.K.K. had a monopoly on torches,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is not the case.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about plans for additional marches by white supremacists and right-wing extremists referred incorrectly to the conservative lawyer running for Senate from Florida who attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va.

{"Headline": "Google Doesn\u2019t Want What\u2019s Best for Us", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionGoogle processes more than three billion search queries a day. It has altered our notions of privacy, tracking what we buy, what we search for online \u2014 and even our physical location at every moment of the day. Every business trying to reach mass-market consumer demand online knows that Google is the gatekeeper.The fact that it is a monopoly, with an almost 90 percent share of the search advertising business, is a given that we have all come to accept. It\u2019s Google\u2019s world; we just live in it. So it matters how this company works \u2014 who it hires, who it fires and why.When a company is dominant enough, it sets the tone for an entire era. In the fall of 1985, I was working as a vice president in the media mergers and acquisitions group at Merrill Lynch in Los Angeles. I would occasionally have to show up for a meeting at 5 a.m. in the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert. I would do this because Mike Milken, the king of junk bonds at Drexel, would demand it \u2014 once the trading day started at 6:30 a.m., he was unavailable.Executives were terrified that Drexel would start a raid on their companies. Politicians would seek Mr. Milken\u2019s counsel and his money. His \u201cwho\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d attitude was the perfect libertarian credo for the Reagan era of deregulation. Drexel gave us culture, too \u2014 \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d and Gordon Gekko in \u201cWall Street\u201d telling us that \u201cgreed is good.\u201d But Drexel flew too close to the sun. Mr. Milken went to prison and Drexel is no more.Today, the great fortunes are not made at companies like Drexel but at companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon. And the rules set by Google are the rules we all abide by.\u201cPortions of the memo violate our code of conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote in a companywide email.It\u2019s impossible to believe that Google or other large tech companies a few years ago would have reacted like this to such a memo. In 2011 when CNN filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the workplace diversity data on big tech companies, Google, among others, asked the Department of Labor for its data to be excluded. The company said that releasing that information would cause \u201ccompetitive harm.\u201d It was not until 2014 that Google began to disclose statistics showing that only 17 percent of its technical work force was female.If women should not even have the vote, why should we worry about gender diversity in the engineering ranks?Today Google is under growing scrutiny, and the cognitive dissonance between the outward-facing \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d stance and the internal misogynistic \u201cbrogrammer\u201d rhetoric was too extreme.Google had to fire the offending engineer, James Damore, but anyone who spends time on the message boards frequented by Valley engineers will know that the \u201cbro\u201d culture that gave us Gamergate \u2014 an online movement that targeted women in the video game industry \u2014 is much more prevalent than Mr. Pichai wants to acknowledge.The company canceled a planned all-hands meeting on Thursday, citing concern about harassment.The effects of the darker side of tech culture reach well beyond the Valley. It starts with an unwillingness to control fake news and pervasive sexism that no doubt contributes to the gender pay gap. But it will soon involve the heart of Google\u2019s business: surveillance capitalism. The trope that \u201cif you are not paying for it, you aren\u2019t the customer \u2014 you\u2019re the product\u201d has been around for a while. But now the European Union has passed the General Data Protection Regulation, which will go into effect next May. This regulation aims to give people more control over their data, so search engines can\u2019t follow them everywhere they roam online. It will be an arrow to the heart of Google\u2019s business.We have an obligation to care about the values of the people who run Google, because we\u2019ve given Google enormous control over our lives and the lives of our children. As the former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris points out, \u201cWithout realizing the implications, a handful of tech leaders at Google and Facebook have built the most pervasive, centralized systems for steering human attention that has ever existed, while enabling skilled actors (addictive apps, bots, foreign governments) to hijack our attention for manipulative ends.\u201dThe future implications of a couple of companies\u2019 having such deep influence on our attention and our behavior are only beginning to be felt. The rise of artificial intelligence combined with Google\u2019s omnipresence in our lives is an issue that is not well understood by politicians or regulators.America is slowly waking up both culturally and politically to the takeover of our economy by a few tech monopolies. We know we are being driven by men like Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos toward a future that will be better for them. We are not sure that it will be better for us.As George Packer, writing in The New Yorker in 2011, put it, \u201cIn Thiel\u2019s techno-utopia, a few thousand Americans might own robot-driven cars and live to 150, while millions of others lose their jobs to computers that are far smarter than they are, then perish at 60.\u201dSomehow the citizens of the world have been left out of this discussion of our future.

It has not been easy.\u201cHe knows people are trying to serve him,\u201d said Teresa Ploesser, who works for Encore Process Service, which the Southern Poverty Law Center hired to find Mr. Anglin. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing. To avoid service, you\u2019ve got to be a step ahead.\u201dSince April, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy and civil rights group, has tried to track down Mr. Anglin for a lawsuit claiming that he used his website to inflict emotional distress on Tanya Gersh, a Jewish real estate agent in Montana. The fruitless search for him exemplifies the challenges that online harassment cases sometimes encounter.Mr. Anglin is considered a \u201cprestige figure\u201d in the white nationalist movement and is most likely hiding among his community, said Keegan Hankes, an analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center.Mr. Anglin\u2019s lawyer, Marc Randazza, said that the editor should be easy to find and that no one had looked hard enough. Mr. Anglin has written on The Daily Stormer that he is in Nigeria.Asked in an email about Ms. Gersh\u2019s lawsuit, Mr. Anglin wrote: \u201cI\u2019m a serious person and I only deal with serious reporters,\u201d adding an anti-Semitic epithet to describe The New York Times.Ms. Gersh\u2019s lawsuit stems from events last spring in Whitefish, Mont. There, Ms. Gersh, a real estate agent, encouraged Sherry Spencer, to disavow her son, Richard Spencer, a white supremacist, and donate to human rights causes. As tensions in the community grew, Ms. Gersh offered to sell a building in town owned by Ms. Spencer.Mr. Anglin told his followers that Ms. Gersh was extorting Ms. Spencer and encouraged them to write anti-Semitic messages to Ms. Gersh. She and her son, who was 12, soon received thousands of phone calls and emails, including a message encouraging her son to crawl into an oven.In April, Ms. Gersh and the Southern Poverty Law Center sued The Daily Stormer, accusing it of orchestrating a \u201ctroll storm.\u201d The case could set a precedent on how online harassment is treated under the law.But the suit has stalled. The four-person team at Encore Process Service in Columbus, Ohio, visited seven addresses to find Mr. Anglin and returned some 15 times. To Jeffrey A. Cremeans, who runs Encore Process Service and has served notice of lawsuits for 25 years, Mr. Anglin became a case that still haunts him.\u201cSometimes you take it personal,\u201d Mr. Cremeans said.Ms. Ploesser, who specializes in investigations for the firm, added: \u201cWe found fictitious offices. Things were always closed.\u201dMs. Ploesser believes Mr. Anglin barricaded himself in one of his Ohio addresses. But after a little over a week of searching in April, the team had exhausted its options.Afterward, the Southern Poverty Law Center began the byzantine process of trying to move the lawsuit forward without Mr. Anglin. The court clerk sent papers to his known addresses through certified mail; those were returned undeliverable. Then the papers were sent through regular mail; they were also returned undeliverable.If Mr. Anglin cannot be served notice in person, the last step is to put a public notice for six consecutive weeks in a local newspaper. Ms. Gersh\u2019s lawyer at the Southern Poverty Law Center, David Dinielli, expects to do so this month.\u201cThe circumstances in which these steps are normally taken is someone owed $7,000 on their credit card bill,\u201d Mr. Dinielli said. \u201cThis is not what happens in nationally prominent civil rights litigation.\u201dWhen Mr. Randazza, Mr. Anglin\u2019s lawyer and a First Amendment advocate, was asked whether his client was avoiding being served, he said: \u201cWould you say that touchdowns are avoiding being scored in a shutout football game? Or would you say that the offense is not scoring them?\u201dMr. Randazza said that what Mr. Anglin wrote was protected speech, and he connected the lawsuit with the broader political climate. \u201cThere\u2019s this belief among the modern left that free speech is for me but not for thee,\u201d he said.Mr. Dinielli called Mr. Anglin a \u201ccoward.\u201d He said Mr. Randazza had been avoiding his calls and emails. Mr. Randazza said he did not know Mr. Dinielli and had not ignored any calls or messages from him.For Ms. Gersh, Mr. Anglin\u2019s failure to respond to the suit is a display of hypocrisy. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s allowed to hide,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that he won\u2019t stand up for himself now after being so willing to blast people and steal their lives and hurt them is shameful.\u201dMs. Gersh said the violence in Charlottesville also reminded her of what Mr. Anglin\u2019s movement was capable of doing.\u201cPeople didn\u2019t know my story was real because it was just online, as if online isn\u2019t real,\u201d Ms. Gersh said. \u201cI want the world to know this is a very, very important site.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Whatever it Takes", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Today\u2019s puzzle by John E. Bennett and Jeff Chen is a good reminder that, in the face of adversity, we need to persevere. The answers to a puzzle like this one might not fall right away, but with enough stick-to-itiveness, we shall triumph. By any means necessary.That might sound a bit stronger than I meant it to sound, but if you\u2019ve solved the puzzle, you understand why I\u2019m so enthusiastic. Mr. Bennett and Mr. Chen are our life coaches today, and they advise you not to go down without a fight.This is not your average-looking grid, is it? What are those J-shaped black square patterns? You won\u2019t find out until you solve the circled squares, and even then you will need to solve the revealer at 55A. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.First, we find out at 17A that we are going to solve this puzzle ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, and I say we drive that point home with the queen of 1970s New Wave, Debbie Harry:THE THING IS, that might not be enough inspiration. Some of us might need more than that to finish a tricky Thursday puzzle.To help get you there, our constructors and editors have hooked a FISH (39A) and shepherded a LAMB (34A) with a shepherd\u2019s crook to demonstrate the other revealer, BY HOOK OR BY CROOK.I like how the grid is made, considering the visual constraints here. We have to have our long entries in the Downs (other than the two revealers), but that\u2019s not so bad once in a while, especially if it is in service to an interesting theme. I liked PANDORA\u2019S BOX and we see the re-emergence of AGORAPHOBIA in the puzzle.\u25a0 26A: If a clue like \u201cFirst name of the second vice president to resign from office\u201d makes your heart sink, work those crossings diligently. I\u2019m a history geek and had to look this up, because the word \u201csecond\u201d tripped me up. In 1832, John C. Calhoun became the first vice president to resign his office, because of disagreements with President Andrew Jackson, and SPIRO Agnew was the second.\u25a0 40A: I\u2019ve attached my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and links to my work on job applications, but I\u2019ve never been asked for a BIO until I started the job. Maybe I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u25a0 44A: CLONK sound more like a sound of wooden impact than metallic. I imagine that to be more of a \u201cclang,\u201d and that\u2019s what I had first.\u25a0 47A: Misdirection alert! \u201cIt might prevent you from drifting off\u201d is not coffee or amphetamines, but an ANCHOR, to keep your boat from drifting away.\u25a0 63A: \u201cSeat of Christianity?\u201d is not where it began, but is where you put your behind when in church. That would be a PEW.\u25a0 1D: Hi, kids! Are Big Men on Campus (B.M.O.C.) even a thing anymore? I tend to doubt it. Back in the day, even before this writer\u2019s time, a college campus \u201cstar\u201d like the captain of the football team, would have been referred to as a B.M.O.C.\u25a0 11D: I had O _ _ O for this and confidently wrote in OTTO, because there were, in fact, Roman emperors named OTTO. Unfortunately for me, the one who \u201coverthrew Galba\u201d was OTHO, with an H. Luckily, I knew the Blondie song at 17A, so that straightened things out for me.\u25a0 18D: Great misdirection. \u201cSpent the most?\u201d gets you thinking about spending money, doesn\u2019t it? Today, however, it\u2019s about being physically spent. So the one who is \u201cSpent the most?\u201d is the WEARIEST.\u25a0 25D/50D: I like these directional clues. \u201cDon\u2019t open it!\u201d is wise advice if you find yourself in front of PANDORA\u2019S BOX. Similarly, \u201cDarn it!\u201d if you have a HOLE in your sock.This puzzle, even though rejected on its first review by Will and Joel, did receive generally positive attention for theme and design. The negative commentary had to do with too much weak fill and a block layout that was overly closed through the center section between the \u201chook\u201d and \u201ccrook.\u201d I struggled mightily with the next version, and found that opening the center by shortening the \u201chook\u201d and \u201ccrook\u201d by one square did not help: The fill was still troublesome and the graphic was starting to be compromised. The second version was shot down also, even though Will left the door open a crack for another try.That\u2019s when I decided to call in the cavalry in the form of my crosstown friend, Jeff Chen! I was really excited that Jeff wanted to invest time in saving this puzzle as a collaboration, and I know that if it weren\u2019t for his expertise and input, this puzzle would never have gotten New York Times ink.The first thing I did was to switch the order of the themers \u2014 Jeb had BY HOOK OR BY CROOK first, and I felt like it\u2019d give away the game too quickly. Easy to swap them.Then, I tried to rebuild around more theme \u2014 how cool would it be if there was something thematic running through the two themers? It took a lot of searching, but I finally came up with something I liked: the GREAT OUTDOORS. Perfect!Well, maybe not perfect, but a nice, descriptive phrase that tied LAMB and FISH together \u2014 it could be clued with respect to a meadow and a fishing hole. So I spent maybe eight hours coming up with a grid around that.Jeb\u2019s response: \u201cNeat grid! But how is GREAT OUTDOORS related to the theme?\u201dNot perfect indeed.Come back again, you two. By any means necessary.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "36 Hours in Granada, Spain", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementLike Agra, India, and the Taj Mahal, the Andalusian city of Granada in southern Spain is so well known for a single monument \u2014 the Alhambra, a walled fortress housing magnificent 13th- to 15th-century Moorish palaces and gardens \u2014 that the city itself is sometimes overlooked. With more than two million visitors descending on the Alhambra, a Unesco World Heritage site, every year, the city\u2019s tourism industry had settled into a somewhat formulaic routine of shuttling visitors in and out of the city in about 24 hours. But recently some other ancient structures have been restored, and the region\u2019s distinctive gastronomy has come into its own. The city that was home to the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, the painter Jos\u00e9 Guerrero and the composer Manuel de Falla has deep cultural roots, but now a new crop of small foundations and independent exhibition spaces has revived its arty buzz. Let the Alhambra wait a bit while getting seduced by the city that has grown up around it.\nExplore the map and find things to do in Granada.\nNow for the daytime Alhambra visit. Taken as a whole, the complex is perhaps the most emblematic vestige of the highly refined and astonishingly luxurious lifestyle achieved by the Moorish rulers in medieval Spain. Tickets range from 7 to 21 euros. If you want to include the Nasrid palaces, note that visitors are given a specific time for entry.Named after the British author Gerald Brenan\u2019s book about his life in an Andalusian village, Al Sur de Granada is among the best places in the city to snap up delicious souvenirs. The shelves are lined with organic wines and olive oils, local honey and jam, craft beers and traditional almond-based sweets made in nearby convents. Breakfasts are simple, delicious and fortifying: yogurt and homemade muesli or toasted peasant bread rubbed with tomato, drizzled with fragrant olive oil and topped with succulent slices of jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Vibrant Turnaround for a Neglected Charleston Neighborhood", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 On Sunday mornings about a decade ago, shortly after he moved here, Stephen J. Zoukis used to ride his bike around a ramshackle neighborhood a couple of miles north of the city\u2019s celebrated historic district and wonder why no one had built anything of note there.The neighborhood, known in the 1850s as Cool Blow Village and now as the Upper Peninsula, was dotted with small houses, warehouses and metal sheds; had only a few sidewalks; and was infused with an air of neglect. Even with easy access from an interstate ramp, the neighborhood \u201clacked an economic pulse,\u201d he said.Surveying the unprepossessing landscape of Charleston\u2019s Upper Peninsula, Mr. Zoukis imagined that it could be so much more.\u201cWe saw a big opportunity for our kind of money,\u201d said Mr. Zoukis, who, flush with cash from the sales of most of the New York properties, was unencumbered by the need to seek financing from banks. He joined forces with a Charleston partner, Michael L. Wooddy, who holds 10 percent of Mr. Zoukis\u2019s position, and in 2012 began snapping up all the available lots they could find, ultimately more than 20.\u201cIt was really before people realized what was happening, so the pricing was very different than it is now,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said, referring to a recent boom in Charleston\u2019s commercial and residential sectors. \u201cYou looked at a map of the city and clearly people had to move up the peninsula because there was no place else to go.\u201dWorking under their new shingle, the Raven Cliff Company, the partners initially sought to build a \u201cshrunken\u201d version of the Chelsea Market, the highly successful assemblage of food vendors and retail stores in Manhattan. \u201cBut we determined that you can\u2019t really just scale these things down that way,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said, noting the chasm between a place like New York\u2019s Fulton Fish Market, which \u201ccleans a million pounds of fish a day,\u201d and \u201csomeone who\u2019s starting an artisanal pickle company.\u201dA fresh option was suggested by Charleston\u2019s budding tech sector, which has since grown to about 250 companies in the metro area, according to the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. Many were downtown and had little room to expand there. That inspired the two Raven Cliff partners \u2014 eventually joined by two others, Martin Skelly and Christian Sullivan \u2014 to step in.\u201cI knew that we could get the tech companies to fill these places,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said of his Upper Peninsula properties. He and his partners spent more than $70 million, including construction costs and the land purchases, to create two architecturally striking office park developments to accommodate not only tech companies but businesses that could provide goods and services to the companies\u2019 workers, as well as to the public.\u201cWe saw them as places to not just impress your clients, like a law office, but to impress your employees,\u201d Mr. Zoukis said while sipping a cortado in a gleaming, white-tiled coffee and pastry shop at one of the two developments, Pacific Box & Crate, which covers 131,000 square feet in three buildings.In January, Pacific Box & Crate opened to its first tenant, BoomTown, which employs 250 people and creates software for real estate brokerage firms. \u201cThis suited our needs,\u201d said Nina Magnesson, whose business card describes her as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for \u201ccitizenship and social innovation.\u201dThe space BoomTown occupies, all 56,854 square feet of it, was designed in the \u201cindustrial chic\u201d style and built for the company from what had been \u201ca disaster of a warehouse,\u201d Ms. Magnesson said. \u201cWe were the first to sign on here. We\u2019d been in a little old grocery store downtown.\u201dOther tenants at Pacific Box & Crate \u2014 named after previous industrial tenants on the property \u2014 include PhishLabs, which helps companies and organizations fight cyberattacks; the crowdfunding company CrowdReach; Twelve South, which makes tech accessories; and the Harbor Entrepreneur Center. There are also Bad Wolf Coffee; Reverb Yoga; Edmund\u2019s Oast Brewing Company, set to open on Sept. 14; and a 9,970-square-foot food court, called Workshop, that functions as a \u201cfood incubator\u201d for aspirant restaurateurs.\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t love this space?\u201d asked Suzie Rybicki, a vice president for talent management at PhishLabs, as she surveyed the company\u2019s stark, efficiently laid out, two-story headquarters. \u201cIf you think about what\u2019s been developed up here, with the restaurants, etc., it\u2019s a very different scene.\u201dA few blocks away, Raven Cliff\u2019s other development, Half Mile North \u2014 its name an allusion to the site\u2019s distance from the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge \u2014 has been in business since April 2013. Its 12 buildings, which add up to 90,583 square feet, house several tech companies, including Blue Acorn, which calls itself a \u201cpremium ecommerce agency\u201d; the \u201cautomated bookkeeping\u201d firm Ceterus; SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, an expense management firm; and Integral Solutions Group. There are also three restaurants, a cheese store, an architecture firm and a shop that sells decorative hardware.\u201cSteve has taken a unique approach,\u201d said Kristopher B. King, the executive director of the Preservation Society of Charleston. \u201cHis strategy gets these neighborhoods functioning, which is a huge positive. It\u2019s putting these properties back on the tax rolls, creating jobs and bringing vibrancy to an area that quite honestly, 10 years ago, really needed it.\u201dIn addition, the two developments appear to have helped raise the cost of nearby properties.\u201cWhen we initially started buying land, values were in the $500,000 to $800,000 range per acre,\u201d Mr. Wooddy said. \u201cNow, purportedly, there are some tracts of land under contract for as much as $4 million per acre. Undoubtedly, land values have skyrocketed on the Upper Peninsula since we started to work in this area.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Wooddy said, rents for office space there have doubled since 2013.Rising prices are also a factor elsewhere in Charleston and its periphery. A wave of real estate investment, much of it from Europe, is beginning to change the landscape in all but the city\u2019s protected core.\u201cWe\u2019re talking to outside entities every month \u2014 that\u2019s a new phenomenon,\u201d said Michael J. Graney, a vice president for global business development at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. \u201cIt used to be that people thought we were talking about Charlotte,\u201d he went on, referring to the larger city in North Carolina, \u201cbut the recognition factor has dramatically increased. Many of the investors we talk to have already been here as tourists.\u201dThe boom in Charleston is already running up against a shortage of options.\u201cLack of readily developable land in the Charleston region is a real challenge,\u201d said Stephanie L. Yarbrough, a lawyer who represents companies looking to set up industrial plants, distribution centers or offices in the area. \u201cOne of our hurdles is finding them a place that is ready to go.\u201dLong a magnet for tourists, Charleston has taken decades to evolve from a placid, picturesque Southern town, replete with historical significance, into something resembling a 21st-century city.\u201cWe\u2019re in the awkward adolescent period of growth,\u201d said Josh Martin, a senior adviser to Charleston\u2019s mayor, John Tecklenburg. \u201cThis happened very quickly, and we\u2019re trying to grow up.\u201dA photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified a project that Stephen J. Zoukis helped develop. He is one of the developers of Pacific Box & Crate in Charleston, S.C., not BoomTown, which is a tenant at Pacific Box & Crate.An article on the Square Feet page on Wednesday about the Upper Peninsula neighborhood in Charleston, S.C., misidentified a company located in the Half Mile North development in the city.

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. Pick, Dara Khosrowshahi, Steps Into Brighter Spotlight", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s family immigrated to the United States from Iran in 1978, when their country was convulsed by revolution. They were not particularly welcomed in America, and were broke.\u201cEvery one of us cousins had a chip on our shoulders, having lost everything to the new Iranian government,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, a cousin of Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s. \u201cWe had a desire to build anew as entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi, 48, is on the threshold of becoming one of the world\u2019s most prominent entrepreneurs. On Sunday night, he was selected to be chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing company that is the world\u2019s most valuable start-up. The deal is almost official, according to the travel reservations site Expedia, which Mr. Khosrowshahi currently runs.His task will be to repair the internal culture, which had moved beyond gung-ho start-up to a company known for its divisiveness and tolerance for harassment. He will have to build Uber\u2019s business while preparing it for a self-driving future that competitors hope to dominate themselves. Sooner or later he will likely take Uber public.There is also the wild card of Mr. Kalanick, who might seize on any trouble to mount a comeback. And finally, he will have to manage all this under a much brighter spotlight than he has worked under before.Mr. Khosrowshahi was a long-shot candidate whose name did not become public until he had the job. Expedia is based in Bellevue, Wash., which makes him a Silicon Valley outsider. He had not commented on his new job as of Monday afternoon.His parents, Lili and Gary (short for Asghar) Khosrowshahi, were prosperous members of the Iranian elite in the 1960s and 1970s. Gary was an executive at an industrial conglomerate, where he worked with relatives. They fled as the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed.Four years later, Gary went back to Iran to take care of his ailing father, and he was detained for six years before he could return. Lili raised three children alone.\u201cHis mom raised him to be direct with people,\u201d said Mr. Partovi, the cousin. \u201cBy far the biggest challenge he faced, which is what all of us faced, was having to come to a new country and assimilate. Being an Iranian in America in the 1980s was not pleasant. People were singing \u2018Bomb bomb bomb Iran.\u2019 \u201dBut the tense environment also pushed them to succeed.Mr. Partovi and his twin brother Ali were early investors in Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb and, as it happens, Uber; Dara\u2019s brother, Kaveh Khosrowshahi, is a managing director at the investment firm Allen & Company; another cousin, Farzad \u201cFuzzy\u201d Khosrowshahi, played a major role in the creation of Google Docs; yet another cousin, Amir Khosrowshahi, is an executive at Intel; and Avid Larizadeh Duggan, also a cousin, is a general partner at Google Ventures.Mr. Khosrowshahi, in addition to running Expedia since 2005, joined the board of The New York Times Company in 2015.His route to success took him to the investment firm of Allen & Company, where he spent most of the 1990s as an analyst. Barry Diller was a client, and Mr. Khosrowshahi eventually went to work for the media mogul.In 2001, Mr. Diller acquired Expedia, a travel booking site founded by Microsoft. Four years later, Mr. Khosrowshahi became Expedia\u2019s chief executive. The site has flourished, acquiring three major competitors in 2015 alone. Shares in the company, which is now publicly traded, have risen 35 percent over the last year, despite competition from Priceline on one flank and Airbnb on another.\u201cIf Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing \u2014 he\u2019s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a note to Expedia employees on Monday.Uber, like Expedia a decade ago, has enormous promise but also faces enormous challenges. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s supporters believe he can fix the problems.\u201cHe\u2019s a global travel executive \u2014 he understands competitive dynamics, geopolitical challenges, and the operating challenges of running a sprawling global travel company,\u201d said Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, an investor in Uber as well as Expedia.Under Mr. Kalanick, some Uber executives were considered untouchable, which contributed to a poisonous atmosphere. Shana Fisher, who worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi at Mr. Diller\u2019s IAC and is now a venture capitalist, said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t get an excuse with Dara. They have to be good and good. Good and good.

{"Headline": "Senate Crackdown on Online Sex Trafficking Hits Opposition", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate\u2019s latest effort to crack down on online sex trafficking is designed for success. Proposed legislation has an unassailable title, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017, and bipartisan support. And it targets websites that knowingly facilitate the work of sexual predators online.But the bill is running into vigorous opposition from technology companies and digital rights groups alarmed at the potential infringement of online speech.So far, the bill, which would amend the Communications Decency Act, is sponsored by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and a group of 26 other senators, including eight Democrats.It follows the culmination of a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website notorious for prostitution and trafficking ads.In federal and state investigations, Backpage has successfully cited as a defense Section 230 of the decency act, which says that websites cannot \u201cbe treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201dIf passed, the Portman bill would clarify that Section 230 cannot shield a website from federal trafficking laws. It would also impose liability for knowingly assisting and facilitating online sex trafficking, and allow civil suits related to sex trafficking.The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which praised the bill in a letter to senators this week, reported that 73 percent of reported sex trafficking was traced through advertisements on websites like Backpage.However, some lawyers and members of the technology community say that while they support the policing of websites that knowingly encourage sex trafficking, the broad language of the bill opens other online entities to new legal challenges. With the potential for lawsuits, there is concern that websites would begin to actively and pre-emptively delete and police users\u2019 posts and videos.A similar bill introduced in the House in April, which would not only modify the decency act but create harsher penalties for providers found to have had knowledge of sex trafficking, has been criticized for being even broader than the Senate bill.\u201cIt would be good for the drafters of the bill to engage seriously with the nontrivial objections that are meant to support freedom of expression online, and it\u2019s not freedom of expression to sex traffic,\u201d said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor of internet law at Harvard, emphasizing that critics were not arguing against prosecuting websites like Backpage.\u201cThey are worried about sites that don\u2019t resemble Backpage at all running into trouble if the immunity is lifted,\u201d he said. Like many other critics of the bill, Mr. Zittrain said he would prefer narrower language or the chance to prosecute websites under current legislation, including the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015.And despite the strong bipartisan support in Congress, the bill will have to overcome dissent from other lawmakers and Silicon Valley executives concerned about freedom of speech on the internet.But Senate staff members involved in the bill\u2019s development said that they had made an effort to work with tech companies concerned about modifying the decency act. \u201cWe did our due diligence, met these folks on a bipartisan basis for months, and yet they offered no constructive feedback,\u201d said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that they\u2019d oppose a narrowly crafted, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who was partially responsible for the inclusion of Section 230 in the decency act while serving in the House, said the bill was \u201cyet another example of the technical ignorance of Congress threatening the jobs, lives and economic opportunities of millions of Americans.\u201d\u201cThis bill will make it less likely that tech companies help the victims this bill is meant to protect,\u201d he said Tuesday in a statement.Mr. Portman said such criticism of the bill\u2019s language was unfounded. \u201cIt seems like a stretch to me,\u201d he said, adding that he felt the bill clearly targeted companies complicit in trafficking.\u201cThe alternative is not to do nothing and allow these girls and women to continue to get thwarted in every effort they make to seek justice,\u201d he said.In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday night, Mr. Portman argued that the bill preserved the decency act\u2019s \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d provision, which protects websites that regulate their content.\u201cThis provision simply protects good actors who proactively block or screen for offensive material and thus shields them from any frivolous lawsuits,\u201d he said.For Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, the bill\u2019s language \u2014 in particular phrases like \u201cassist, support or facilitate sex trafficking\u201d and \u201cconduct violates federal criminal law\u201d \u2014 are too vague in defining what constitutes facilitation and violation. While she supports modest change to the statute, she said she would rather see the courts re-evaluate their interpretation of the law\u2019s specific language.Critics also say the bill opens up websites to potential prosecution by states, a change that could force sites to make costly modifications to meet state laws or expose them to expensive litigation if a law is changed or accidentally ignored, said Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties online.It is a cost that tech giants like Google, YouTube and Twitter can handle, but that would likely stifle the development of new and smaller websites.\u201cI worry about the next Google, the next Twitter, the next emerging platform that we would grow to love,\u201d Ms. McSherry said, \u201cbut it\u2019ll never exist because that platform, that business would never get off the ground.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And the persistence of this music \u2014 a genre sometimes called hatecore \u2014 points to the difficulties that online media platforms have in policing their content, and to the frustrations of activists and the mainstream music industry in trying to bar hate speech from the most popular online channels.In a statement, Spotify said that it did not tolerate content that \u201cfavors hatred\u201d or incites violence on the basis of race, religion or sexuality, and added that it \u201ctakes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention.\u201dThe problem is more complex when it comes to YouTube, which lets users upload material themselves and relies on users to flag offensive content for removal.

That money helped to establish New America as an elite voice in policy debates on the American left and helped Google shape those debates.The statement disappeared from New America\u2019s website, only to be reposted without explanation a few hours later. But word of Mr. Schmidt\u2019s displeasure rippled through New America, which employs more than 200 people, including dozens of researchers, writers and scholars, most of whom work in sleek Washington offices where the main conference room is called the \u201cEric Schmidt Ideas Lab.\u201d The episode left some people concerned that Google intended to discontinue funding, while others worried whether the think tank could truly be independent if it had to worry about offending its donors.Ms. Slaughter told Mr. Lynn that \u201cthe time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways,\u201d according to an email from Ms. Slaughter to Mr. Lynn. The email suggested that the entire Open Markets team \u2014 nearly 10 full-time employees and unpaid fellows \u2014 would be exiled from New America.While she asserted in the email, which was reviewed by The New York Times, that the decision was \u201cin no way based on the content of your work,\u201d Ms. Slaughter accused Mr. Lynn of \u201cimperiling the institution as a whole.\u201dMr. Lynn, in an interview, charged that Ms. Slaughter caved to pressure from Mr. Schmidt and Google, and, in so doing, set the desires of a donor over the think tank\u2019s intellectual integrity.\u201cGoogle is very aggressive in throwing its money around Washington and Brussels, and then pulling the strings,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cPeople are so afraid of Google now.\u201dGoogle rejected any suggestion that it played a role in New America\u2019s split with Open Markets. Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, pointed out that the company supports a wide range of think tanks and other nonprofits focused on information access and internet regulation. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with every group 100 percent of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group\u2019s independence, personnel decisions and policy perspectives.\u201dNew America\u2019s executive vice president, Tyra Mariani, said it was \u201ca mutual decision for Barry to spin out his Open Markets program,\u201d and that the move was not in any way influenced by Google or Mr. Schmidt.\u201cNew America financial supporters have no influence or control over the research design, methodology, analysis or findings of New America research projects, nor do they have influence or control over the content of educational programs and communications efforts,\u201d Ms. Mariani said. She added that Mr. Lynn\u2019s statement praising the European Union\u2019s sanctions against Google had been temporarily removed from New America\u2019s website because of \u201can unintentional internal issue\u201d unrelated to Google or Mr. Schmidt.Ms. Mariani and Ms. Sciuto said Google is continuing to fund New America.Hours after this article was published online Wednesday morning, Ms. Slaughter announced that the think tank had fired Mr. Lynn on Wednesday for \u201chis repeated refusal to adhere to New America\u2019s standards of openness and institutional collegiality.\u201dIn the run-up to that conference, Ms. Slaughter and New America\u2019s lead fund-raiser in emails to Mr. Lynn indicated that Google was concerned that its positions were not going to be represented, and that it was not given advanced notice of the event.\u201cWe are in the process of trying to expand our relationship with Google on some absolutely key points,\u201d Ms. Slaughter wrote in an email to Mr. Lynn, urging him to \u201cjust THINK about how you are imperiling funding for others.\u201dSome tech lobbyists, think tank officials and scholars argue that the efforts help explain why Google has mostly avoided damaging regulatory and enforcement decisions in the United States of the sort levied by the European Union in late June.The Open Markets\u2019 statement that drew Mr. Schmidt\u2019s ire praised the fine, and called on United States regulators to more aggressively enforce antitrust rules against Google, Amazon and \u201cother dominant platform monopolists.\u201dGoogle\u2019s willingness to spread cash around the think tanks and advocacy groups focused on internet and telecommunications policy has effectively muted, if not silenced, criticism of the company over the past several years, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. His group, which does not accept corporate funding, has played a leading role in calling out Google and other tech companies for alleged privacy violations. But Mr. Rotenberg said it is become increasingly difficult to find partners in that effort as more groups accept Google funding.\u201cThere are simply fewer groups that are available to speak up about Google\u2019s activities that threaten online privacy,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said. \u201cThe groups that should be speaking up aren\u2019t.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Casts a Wary Eye at an iPhone Cash Cow, the App Store", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In China, where Western-owned online services like Facebook and Google have long been blocked, Apple\u2019s app store is a lucrative exception. Apple offers gaming, dining and dating apps in a country where most rivals are locally owned \u2014 and where it can reap big fees from iPhone users.That business is now facing a number of threats.The latest came this week, when a law firm representing more than two dozen app developers asked the Chinese authorities to investigate whether Apple\u2019s app store policies violated local pricing and antitrust laws.While it is not clear whether the government will respond, the call follows several other developments that have put a spotlight on the software and content that Apple offers in China. They include tighter regulations from the country\u2019s censors and a high-profile public spat with a powerful and deeply connected Chinese internet giant, Tencent Holdings.\u201cApple has been more successful in China than any Western tech company because their business model \u2014 selling devices that integrate software and hardware \u2014 couldn\u2019t be copied and couldn\u2019t be blocked,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an analyst who runs the website Stratechery.\u201cDevices are sold once,\u201d Mr. Thompson added, \u201cbut services are delivered over time, which means they can be interrupted or held hostage at any time.\u201dGreater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is one of Apple\u2019s largest markets after the United States. Its mainland app store has been a crucial part of its success. In June, the app store in the mainland accounted for almost a third of Apple\u2019s worldwide app store revenue, according to App Annie, a firm that tracks metrics for apps.While China has many locally owned app stores that sell software for phones running Google\u2019s mobile operating system Android, Apple has the business for its iOS platform to itself. As in other markets, Apple makes money from services bought over the platform, including purchases made within apps themselves.A statement from Dare & Sure Law Firm, a Beijing-based firm that said it had filed the complaint on behalf of 28 app developers, said, \u201cSteve Jobs and Apple\u2019s \u2018American dream\u2019 have inspired the people. So why are these young Chinese software developers who also want to pursue the \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019 of becoming entrepreneurs and improving their families\u2019 quality of life through honest work any different?\u201dLin Wei, a lawyer at Dare & Sure, said the firm had not received a response from either the National Development and Reform Commission or from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the two government agencies with which the complaint was lodged. Neither agency responded to multiple telephone calls on Thursday seeking comment.Apple said in a statement that, \u201cWe continue to expand our local developer relations team in China and are working hard to help developers be successful on the App Store,\u201d adding that its guidelines applied \u201cequally to all developers in every country where we operate.\u201dWhether any official action will be taken is unclear. China\u2019s antimonopoly law is less than a decade old, and experts are still waiting to see how it will be implemented. But according to Hu Gang, secretary general of the research center of the Internet Society of China, a Beijing-based organization backed by the Chinese government, the authorities are likely to pursue the complaint.\u201cApple took advantage of its position of unilateral dominance to set unfair conditions for its competitors, and collected a huge commission in the process of doing so,\u201d Mr. Hu said. \u201cThis kind of operation is not tenable according to typical business logic.\u201d\u201cThe relevant departments will definitely accept the complaint,\u201d Mr. Hu added. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201dThe complaint follows the recent tussle between Apple and Tencent Holdings, which brought the American company\u2019s position in China into sharp relief.Tencent owns the messaging service WeChat, which is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese smartphone owners to communicate, shop and pay bills, among many other services.In January, Tencent gave users the option to open \u201cmini-apps\u201d in WeChat, essentially allowing iOS users to bypass Apple\u2019s app store.Then, in April, Apple ordered Tencent to shutter its popular \u201ctipping\u201d function, which allowed WeChat users to reward content generators like emoji creators or bloggers with small monetary gifts using WeChat\u2019s in-app payment system. Apple said in a statement at the time that WeChat could still permit users to tip, as long as the function used Apple\u2019s purchase system.The American company has since moved to cool those tensions. In a conference call last week, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, praised Tencent and said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

And though the Soderbergh style has evolved and transformed, all of his work is bound by a common intelligence and unfailing craftsmanship. These are some of the highlights of his vast filmography.Soderbergh\u2019s feature debut not only announced the arrival of a major new talent; it gave birth the fruitful 1990s United States independent film scene. Many of its practitioners followed the blueprint he established here: low budget, minimal locations, small cast and a script emphasizing nuanced characters and garrulous dialogue. But within those confines, Soderbergh worked wonders, creating an intelligent, delicate, and downright riveting study of sexual dysfunction, marital infidelity and fleeting intimacy. And he immediately displayed his unerring nose for new talent, providing breakout roles for James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo.Soderbergh\u2019s feature debut not only announced the arrival of a major new talent; it gave birth the fruitful 1990s United States independent film scene.

But the filmmaker brought the experiments in structure and style of those films to this 1998 adaptation of Elmore Leonard\u2019s crime novel, a frisky, funny and sexy story of an escaped con (George Clooney) aiming for one last score, and the federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) who can\u2019t decide whether to hunt him down or seduce him. The picture\u2019s playful scrambling of chronology and colorful supporting characters betray its \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d influence, but this is no rip-off; it has an energy and electricity all its own. And it not only returned Soderbergh to the mainstream, but it also began his fruitful partnership with Clooney, who would star in five more films for the director over the next nine years.Soderbergh stumbled a bit with his post-\u2018sex, lies, and videotape\u2019 efforts.

The film combines fractured timelines, stream-of-consciousness editing and even clips from an earlier Stamp performance (in Ken Loach\u2019s \u201cPoor Cow\u201d). In doing so, Soderbergh turns what could\u2019ve been a \u201cDeath Wish\u201d remake into a thoughtful, mournful, elegiac meditation \u2014 on family, on forgiveness, on the past in general and the \u201960s in particular.On the heels of \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d Soderbergh further fused art-house experimentation and genre storytelling in this tale of a revenge-seeking ex-con (Terence Stamp, in a career-best performance).

That said, this is no typical action movie: He uses wide shots and long takes for his action sequences, forgoing the incoherent compositions and rapid-fire edits of too many bone-crunching blockbusters, to better showcase the skills and athleticism of the star Gina Carano. And the script, by Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cThe Limey\u201d collaborator Lem Dobbs, is a crisp, lean piece of work, in which a black-ops soldier (Carano) takes the fall for a mission that goes sideways, only to meticulously track down and take out the men who set her up. Brisk, witty and just plain fun, it\u2019s the female James Bond movie you\u2019ve always wanted.Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t exactly the first person you\u2019d think of to helm a globe-trotting action movie featuring a mixed martial arts champ, but he\u2019s never really been one for easy categorization.

Yet the immediacy of Soderbergh\u2019s direction keeps it from feeling like a musty period piece; this is a hard-edge, fast-moving show, and one whose preoccupations with race, class, and gender have proven anything but antique.Soderbergh took a four-year sabbatical from feature directing between 2013\u2019s \u201cBehind the Candelabra\u201d and \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d but he kept himself busy by producing several projects, helping out with the 2015 \u201cMagic Mike\u201d sequel and writing.

Asked by his bosses at Paramount to crank out a quickie release for the summer of 1960, Lewis delivered the Tati-esque \u201cThe Bellboy,\u201d playing a mostly mute Miami hotel employee named Stanley (in a homage to comedian Stan Laurel) who fumbles through a series of densely packed slapstick scenarios with his wealthy guests. Anyone who wonders why Lewis is hailed as a genius should start here, a movie filled with skilled pantomime, fluid camerawork and unexpectedly sophisticated humor.As a director, Lewis took inspiration from silent-era gods like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, as well as whimsical foreign filmmakers like Jacques Tati.

Anyone who wonders why Lewis is hailed as a genius should start here, a movie filled with skilled pantomime, fluid camerawork and unexpectedly sophisticated humor.Lewis, a showbiz lifer, went on stage in vaudeville with his folks as a boy, and quickly developed a comic persona based on jumping around and making funny faces. He joined up with the laid-back Italian-American crooner Dean Martin in the mid-40s, and constructed an act in which his reckless anarchy would ruffle his partner\u2019s cool. The team became even bigger stars in movies, and with the help of director Norman Taurog they told a version of their own story in 1952\u2019s \u201cThe Stooge.\u201d Martin plays a failing nightclub singer who starts drawing a crowd when he hires a bumbler as comic relief. The emphasis on irresolvable personality conflicts predicts the duo\u2019s own eventual breakup; but the movie also features healthy helpings of the original Martin/Lewis show, which is still sidesplittingly wild.Lewis, a showbiz lifer, went on stage in vaudeville with his folks as a boy, and quickly developed a comic persona based on jumping around and making funny faces.

But he learned a lot from director Frank Tashlin, a former Warner Bros. animator, about constructing perfectly timed, visually precise gags onscreen. The eye-popping 1955 musical \u201cArtists and Models\u201d is the peak of their collaboration, following a juvenile dope and his struggling painter buddy. The movie is wall-to-wall inventive, packed with one-of-a-kind sequences like Lewis pretending to play the piano on an empty drafting board and Martin duetting with himself in the bathroom mirror.Lewis made most of his best films almost entirely on his own, as a star, director, writer, and producer.

When Lewis went solo, he donned the uniform a couple of times \u2014 most notably in 1959\u2019s entertaining \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up the Ship,\u201d where he plays a sailor explaining in flashback how he lost a destroyer.

The 1960 favorite \u201cCinderfella\u201d flips a well-known fairy tale, with Lewis playing a stressed stepson enchanting a princess.

{"Headline": "Google Fires Engineer Who Wrote Memo Questioning Women in Tech", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google on Monday fired a software engineer who wrote an internal memo that questioned the company\u2019s diversity efforts and argued that the low number of women in technical positions was a result of biological differences instead of discrimination.In a companywide email, Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said portions of the memo had violated the company\u2019s code of conduct and crossed the line \u201cby advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201dThe memo put the company in a bind. On one hand, Google has long promoted a culture of openness, with employees allowed to question senior executives and even mock its strategy in internal forums. However, Google, like many other technology firms, is dealing with criticism that it has not done enough to hire and promote women and minorities.One female Google engineer posted on Twitter upon reading the memo that she would consider leaving the company unless the human resources department took action.In an email titled \u201cOur Words Matter,\u201d Mr. Pichai said that he supported the right of employees to express themselves but that the memo had gone too far.\u201cThe memo has clearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote. \u201cOur co-workers shouldn\u2019t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting, they have to prove that they are not like the memo states, being \u2018agreeable\u2019 rather than \u2018assertive,\u2019 showing a \u2018lower stress tolerance,\u2019 or being \u2018neurotic.\u2019\u201dJames Damore, the software engineer who wrote the original memo, confirmed in an email to The New York Times that he had been fired. Mr. Damore had worked at Google since 2013. He said in his memo that he had written it in the hope of having an \u201chonest discussion\u201d about how the company had an intolerance for ideologies that do not fit into what he believed were its left-leaning biases.Mr. Damore, who worked on infrastructure for Google\u2019s search product, said he believed that the company\u2019s actions were illegal and that he would \u201clikely be pursuing legal action.\u201d\u201cI have a legal right to express my concerns about the terms and conditions of my working environment and to bring up potentially illegal behavior, which is what my document does,\u201d Mr. Damore said.Before being fired, Mr. Damore said, he had submitted a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board claiming that Google\u2019s upper management was \u201cmisrepresenting and shaming me in order to silence my complaints.\u201d He added that it was \u201cillegal to retaliate\u201d against an N.L.R.B. charge.Mr. Pichai said he would be cutting short a family vacation to return to Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to deal with the matter.

White nationalists are on the march.Amid this turbulence, a surprising group of Americans is testing its moral voice more forcefully than ever: C.E.O.s.After Nazi-saluting white supremacists rioted in Charlottesville, Va., and President Trump dithered in his response, a chorus of business leaders rose up this past week to condemn hate groups and espouse tolerance and inclusion. And as lawmakers in Texas tried to restrict the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms, corporate executives joined activists to kill the bill.These and other actions are part of a broad recasting of the voice of business in the nation\u2019s political and social dialogue, a transformation that has gained momentum in recent years as the country has engaged in fraught debates over everything from climate change to health care.In recent days, after the Charlottesville bloodshed, the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, called on people to \u201ccome together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us \u2014 tolerance, inclusion and diversity.\u201dJamie Dimon of JPMorgan said, \u201cThe equal treatment of all people is one of our nation\u2019s bedrock principles.\u201dWalmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, criticized Mr. Trump by name for his handling of the violence in Charlottesville, and called for healing.The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years \u2014 the swelling confidence of a torch-bearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement \u2014 is \u201ca seminal moment in the history of business in America,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at PepsiCo.\u201cIn this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThese C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.\u201dThis transformation didn\u2019t happen overnight. Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within \u2014 from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\u201cNot every business decision is an economic one,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks, who was one of the country\u2019s first company leaders to proactively address social issues. \u201cThe reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.\u201dCompanies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth\u2019s desegregated.Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including General Motors and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. Apple, Disney and Xerox extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\u201cWhen I went to business school, you didn\u2019t see anything like this,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cNobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.\u201dNow, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected \u2014 to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders \u2014 than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\u201cC.E.O.s wield economic influence,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cNobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.\u201dThe business community\u2019s triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. Martin Winterkorn, a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company\u2019s emissions scandal.But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief of Disney, resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week\u2019s revolt.\u201cThe C.E.O.s of big public companies don\u2019t walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. \u201cBut today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.\u201dLast weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president\u2019s response. Among those watching was Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president\u2019s stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president\u2019s remarks \u2014 in which he blamed the violence on \u201cmany sides\u201d \u2014 were too much to bear.On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump\u2019s manufacturing council. \u201cAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u201d he wrote.The president took to Twitter, lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of Under Armour and Intel had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country\u2019s biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\u201cWhat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u201d the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\u201dAll week, the business world\u2019s actions went beyond the donations to charity and pledges to plant trees that once defined corporate social responsibility.\u201cFor a long time, corporate social responsibility was a buzzword marketing tool, walled off within an organization,\u201d said Alan Fleischmann, president of Laurel Strategies, an executive advisory firm. \u201cNow it has to be central for the C.E.O., part of their everyday responsibility and leadership.\u201dKevin Plank, the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, the athletic apparel maker, built a brand that celebrates diversity, sponsoring athletes like the basketball player Stephen Curry and artists like the ballerina Misty Copeland. Yet when asked to serve on the president\u2019s manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.His star sponsors made their displeasure known. \u201cI strongly disagree with Kevin Plank\u2019s recent comments in support of Trump,\u201d Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of Under Armour.\u201cThe leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,\u201d said Mr. Walker of the Ford Foundation. \u201cBut speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.\u201dBecause companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\u201cThe confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House,\u201d Mr. Carney wrote. \u201cThe battle lines are clear.\u201dThose executives who go out on a limb know the risks. \u201cWe all recognize that with every decision we make, there is a group of people that are not going to agree with us,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cBut you must define your core purpose for being. We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.\u201dDiversity \u2014 of opinions, ideologies and religions \u2014 is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity \u2014 of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force \u2014 that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. \u201cBusiness leaders aren\u2019t threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cBusiness leaders are bullish on diversity.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations \u2014 it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. \u201cOur employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,\u201d said Mr. Benioff of Salesforce. \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for affecting change.\u201dIf the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.The black chief executive of a $172 billion company \u2014 a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president \u2014 Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\u201cOur country\u2019s strength stems from its diversity,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u201dThe C.E.O.s had found their voice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Charlottesville, Even Dating Apps Are Cracking Down on Hate", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Silicon Valley companies that make money off social media and online services have started to enact strong measures against extremism, barring white nationalists, white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others who follow creeds they deem racist and hateful.Most remarkably, perhaps, the efforts have even spread to the free-wheeling world of dating apps, where users have for years been welcome to screen potential lovers based on everything from height to religious beliefs.But OKCupid officials said they already had enough evidence to ban Mr. Cantwell for life from the dating service. After being contacted by the user, they worked to verify that the man was indeed Mr. Cantwell, and on Aug. 17, the site tweeted, \u201cWithin 10 minutes, we banned him for life.\u201d\u201cWe do not tolerate anyone who promotes racism or hatred \u2014 it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Elie Seidman, OKCupid\u2019s chief executive, in an email to The New York Times. \u201cAt OKCupid, our mission is to connect people based on substance \u2014 based on their shared sensibility. The privilege of being in our community does not extend to Nazis and supremacists.\u201dThe moves are \u201ca consequence of the increased political polarity,\u201d said John Drew, an assistant professor of digital media at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y.He added, \u201cSome companies, especially ones that cater to younger, urban audiences \u2014 like Bumble \u2014 are no doubt considering the contemporary moment as a potential opportunity to cash in politically and win over users.\u201dIndeed, even PayPal has joined the fray, electing to cut off the white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s organization. On his blog, Mr. Cantwell also complained about his PayPal account being shut down.\u201cCompanies and C.E.O.s have an obligation \u2014 maybe even a moral obligation \u2014 to stand up for values,\u201d PayPal\u2019s chief executive Dan Schulman said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cWe have an acceptable use policy \u2014 any site that promotes hatred, violence or racial intolerance, we shut down.\u201dBut experts warned that once online services start banning users because of their views, they risk tumbling down a slippery slope. OKCupid may have had several good reasons to ban Mr. Cantwell, said Jeremy Littau, an associate professor in the department of journalism and communication at Lehigh University. But \u201conce they start policing peoples\u2019 beliefs offline,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not unreasonable to ask why they allow people who have other beliefs or behaviors that are repugnant.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Cantwell complained in an interview before his arrest this week that in the days since the march and rally in Charlottesville, he had also been kicked off Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Match and Tinder.\u201cI can\u2019t even watch the Vice video on YouTube because it\u2019s age-restricted and I can\u2019t log in,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said.Spokeswomen for Facebook, Instagram, and Google (which owns YouTube) confirmed that Mr. Cantwell\u2019s profiles and channel were disabled because of hate speech. A Twitter spokeswoman would not comment on individual accounts, but said that the site\u2019s rules prohibit violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct. Officials with Tinder and Match, which like OKCupid are owned by Match Group , did not respond to emails.Mr. Seidman, the OKCupid C.E.O., said the need to remove Mr. Cantwell was clear and noted that the company\u2019s terms and conditions give officials full discretion to do so.Still, he acknowledged that \u201cas any person who has ever been on a date can understand,\u201d some cases are not as \u201cobviously cut and dry\u201d as Mr. Cantwell\u2019s.All harassment flags are reviewed by human moderators who review so-called fringe cases, Mr. Seidman said. One question he said moderators consider during a review: Did the user\u2019s action make the recipient feel unsafe or violated?\u201cWe, of course, always veer on the side of caution,\u201d Mr. Seidman said.Like most dating sites, OKCupid allows its members to filter their search for companions by age, location, race and religion. Paying members can even refine their results by attractiveness, body type and their answers to specific questions such as: \u201cWould you consider dating someone who has vocalized a strong negative bias toward a certain race of people?\u201d and \u201cDo you believe that there exists a statistical correlation between race and intelligence?\u201dAsked if that type of filtering posed a contradiction, Mr. Seidman said, \u201cWe do not believe that there is a slippery slope between banning white supremacists on OkCupid to policing other beliefs.\u201d\u201cWhite supremacy and Nazi ideology perpetuate oppression, hate, violence, terrorism,\u201d he wrote, and they \u201care in a league of their own. We will not trade a neo-Nazi\u2019s ability to espouse hate and murderous ideology at the cost of many people\u2019s freedom to date without fear and hatred.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting, and Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Play to Rattle Whole Foods Rivals: Cheaper Kale and Avocado", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The era of Whole Paycheck, the derisive nickname for Whole Foods, may be drawing to a close. Amazon, which takes control of the upscale grocer on Monday, intends to slash prices the same day.The significance of the move goes well beyond the price of organic avocados, baby kale and rotisserie chickens, all of which will cost less on Monday than on Sunday. Rather, it is an outsize way for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, to announce his plan to shake up the grocery industry and take on competitors like Walmart and Kroger.\u201cThis is how Amazon operates,\u201d said Michelle Grant, head of retailing at Euromonitor, a market research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s all about speed, speed, speed.\u201dMr. Bezos has always been willing to lose money, disappoint shareholders and start discount wars in his efforts to challenge and inflict pain on competitors. In the 23 years that Amazon has been in business, he has done it again and again \u2014 with books, diapers and now groceries \u2014 fundamentally changing entire retail categories.\u201cI absolutely think it\u2019s putting the rest of the market on notice,\u201d Bob Hetu, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm, said of Amazon\u2019s announcement on pricing.Investors drove Kroger shares down more than 8 percent on Thursday; shares of Walmart, the nation\u2019s biggest grocer, fell about 2 percent. Both companies\u2019 shares also fell sharply when the deal was announced in June.Amazon plans to weave together its online business and physical stores by turning its Prime membership program into a Whole Foods rewards program, providing additional savings to customers. Amazon Prime is a $99-a-year service that gives customers faster free shipping, video streaming and other benefits.Whole Foods\u2019 private-label products will be available through Amazon\u2019s online services and Amazon lockers that will be installed in some Whole Foods markets. Customers will also be able to return online orders to Amazon through the lockers.\u201cWe\u2019re determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone,\u201d Jeff Wilke, the executive who runs Amazon\u2019s consumer businesses, said on Thursday in an announcement about the changes. \u201cEverybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality.\u201dDiscounts are not the only reason shoppers use Amazon \u2014 selection and convenience are others \u2014 but Mr. Bezos has never been shy about starting price wars that inflict pain on rivals. In the 1990s, the company tussled with Barnes & Noble to see which could discount books the most. Amazon and Walmart have been in an on-and-off price war in a variety of categories for years.In its battle with Quidsi, a start-up that owned Diapers.com, Amazon put so much pressure on the company that it eventually agreed to be acquired by Amazon rather than by Walmart.Ever since Amazon made the surprise announcement in June that it was acquiring Whole Foods for more than $13 billion, competitors have expected it to shake things up at the grocer, which has struggled in the face of competition from Costco, Walmart and others that have wooed customers with a growing selection of organic produce and kitchen staples. (Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, is the chairwoman of Whole Foods.)Still, the speed with which Amazon completed the acquisition and embarked on a price-cutting campaign is stunning. Amazon completed the purchase in under three months \u2014 unusual for a multibillion-dollar transaction. The Federal Trade Commission approved the deal on Wednesday.Amazon did not say how much it would cut prices in Whole Foods stores, 460 of which are spread across the United States, Canada and Britain. It promised that there would be further cuts in the future. People who have studied Whole Foods\u2019 struggles in the marketplace said the reductions would have to be substantial to compete with other stores.\u201cI believe what we will see is Amazon and Whole Foods becoming aggressive on price,\u201d said Brittain Ladd, a strategy consultant who previously worked for Amazon on its grocery business. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if some prices are lowered 15 percent to as high as 25 percent in some categories.\u201dMr. Wilke of Amazon said in his statement that lowering prices would not compromise the quality of products at Whole Foods, the brand\u2019s main selling point. The items the company said it would drop prices on include bananas, butter, crunchy almond butter, organic large brown eggs, responsibly farmed salmon and tilapia and organic Fuji apples.A number of groups, including members of Congress and representatives of organized labor, have raised concerns about how the acquisition may affect competition in the grocery business, but the Federal Trade Commission had no trouble with it.Antitrust lawyers noted that Amazon and Whole Foods were relatively small players in the grocery business and in different corners of the market \u2014 Amazon in online grocery delivery and Whole Foods in physical retailing.Those arguments will probably not assuage a growing chorus of Amazon critics who believe it is developing too powerful a grip on retail spending, at least on the internet. Yet Amazon\u2019s announcement of immediate price reductions on groceries underscores how the company has managed, so far, to stay on the right side of regulators.\u201cAt the end of the day, the F.T.C. is in the business of watching out for the consumer,\u201d said Brendan Witcher, a retail analyst at Forrester Research.It remains to be seen whether the deal will revive Whole Foods\u2019 fortunes or become a costly move into an industry that Amazon has so far failed to master. Amazon has offered its own internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but has had little impact on the habits of consumers, who overwhelmingly prefer buying their groceries in stores.Amazon is experimenting with automation technologies that could save costs in physical stores by eliminating cashiers, but it has vowed not to use those technologies at Whole Foods to lay off workers. But sharp price cuts on items in stores will put pressure on Amazon to find cost savings elsewhere at Whole Foods, analysts said \u2014 for example, by making the logistics network that delivers goods to stores more efficient.After the companies combine, Amazon\u2019s competitors in the grocery business will still be vastly larger. Walmart has more than 4,600 stores and last year started making a multibillion-dollar investment in lowering grocery prices. Walmart has also significantly increased its investment in online shopping through acquisitions to better compete with Amazon on its main turf.\u201cWe feel great about our position with our network of stores around the country and fast growing e-commerce and online grocery businesses,\u201d said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart.Local grocers expressed some trepidation about Amazon\u2019s aggressive entry into their business, but said it was part of a long history of upheavals and competition.Stew Leonard Jr. is the chief executive of Stew Leonard\u2019s, a chain of six grocery stores in New York and Connecticut that focuses on fresh produce. There are several Whole Foods close to his stores, and Mr. Leonard said he had been watching the Amazon deal closely.\u201cI\u2019ve been in retail since I was a kid, and I\u2019m always nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cCostcos were opening, then Walmarts, then Whole Foods. But at the end of the day, you just have to try and get the freshest corn out there on the sidewalk.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and David Gelles from New York.

{"Headline": "\u2018Cortana, Open Alexa,\u2019 Amazon Says. And Microsoft Agrees.", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "In an unusual partnership, Amazon and Microsoft are working together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants.Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The crowded pack of voice-controlled digital assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana \u2014 are good at numerous things. They can help people play music, set up calendar appointments and check the weather.They can even get two rival tech executives, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to join hands in a rare partnership.For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year.It is unusual for big tech companies to cooperate on important new technologies that they want to stand out from the competition. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and nearly every other big tech company is pouring huge amounts of money into making digital assistants that are smarter and can do more, seeing them as a new way for people to interact naturally with devices and online services.But Mr. Bezos and Mr. Nadella are concerned that keeping assistants from working together could hold them back. The way they see it, each assistant has unique strengths that could benefit the other assistants.In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon\u2019s Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants \u2014 also called \u201cA.I.s,\u201d for artificial intelligence \u2014 the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.\u201cI want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible.\u201d Mr. Bezos said.As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer \u2014 for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss?Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say \u201cAlexa, Open Cortana\u201d followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say \u201cCortana, Open Alexa.\u201dThe Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft\u2019s CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said.It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company\u2019s \u201cworking backward process.\u201d Through that exercise, Amazon\u2019s teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code.In a phone interview, Mr. Nadella compared digital assistants like Cortana and Alexa to competing web browsers that provide access to the same pools of online information. \u201cThe personality and expertise of each one will be such that if they interoperated, the user will get more out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat resonated for me and for him, and then that\u2019s what led to the teams working.\u201dMr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to.\u201cI\u2019d welcome it,\u201d he said.\u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll be inspired by it,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cAt least that would be my hope.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people\u2019s experiences with its iPhones and iPads.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason Google or Apple would offer it because they\u2019re trying to drive their own ecosystems,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, a technology research firm.By contrast, Alexa is mostly used on Echo speakers that sit around a home, and Cortana is largely used on PCs. Amazon says it has sold millions of Echo devices, accounting for around 70 percent of the market for smart speakers, according eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft says there are 145 million active monthly users of Cortana through Windows 10.The two companies have struggled in the smartphone business, which makes it hard to get people using Alexa and Cortana outside homes and offices. Amazon and Microsoft are cutting deals with carmakers to integrate their assistants directly into vehicles. While Amazon and Microsoft have released digital assistant apps for mobile devices running Google and Apple software, the apps are not as widespread and using them is usually not as effortless as the ones Apple and Google build into their devices.Eventually, Mr. Bezos predicted, the primary assistant on a device will be smart enough to automatically route a person\u2019s request to whichever assistant is best equipped to answer, without needing a verbal introduction between the two.\u201cIn my view of the world, because that would be best for the customer, that\u2019s probably what eventually happens,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P. Morgan) and $275 (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).As for other large multinationals and the broader market indexes, Mr. Arone sees no immediate threat to further gains. None of the warning signs he looks for \u2014 more-frequent market corrections, higher interest rates and widening credit spreads \u2014 have yet materialized. \u201cNone is flashing red,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even yellow.\u201d While conceding the bull market \u201cis getting long in the tooth,\u201d he said, \u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Are you Mr. Office Dweller now?As The Journal noted, Apple is starting way behind Netflix and Amazon, which have huge stables of original movies and TV shows they\u2019ve been producing for some time. Sure, Amazon has \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMoonlight,\u201d but will it have \u201cPlanet of the Apps 2: Social Media Marketing\u201d?Seriously, though, I hope Apple hires some good content executives from places like Netflix and Amazon. Bring in Ted Sarandos, chief content officer from Netflix, who seems to have a good eye for spotting at least some hit shows. Or someone from high up at HBO. Or heck, just buy Netflix outright! Isn\u2019t Apple sitting on a zillion dollars in cash somewhere?Anyway, I think Apple needs a real breakout hit, just like Facebook and its big video push. I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.Then, one of Uber\u2019s largest shareholders sent an open letter to all of Uber\u2019s employees. The shareholder is Benchmark, which last week sued Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former C.E.O., to get him off the board. The letter included an intimation that there was more damning information that could leak if Kalanick didn\u2019t back down from a fight.In sum, it\u2019s like watching a slow-motion car wreck, where no one seems to have escaped unscathed.Some went even beyond that. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.There was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.I understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.To me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.What do you think?Let me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201dIsn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?Maybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon.

{"Headline": "Short Answers to Hard Questions About Health Threats From Hurricane Harvey", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey in Houston has brought a host of health questions from residents of the area and concerned relatives and friends. Here are some answers to common questions showing up in Google searches and on Facebook.Yes. Some Texas public health officials expect an increase in gastrointestinal problems from bacteria breeding in stagnant floodwaters that can contain Escherichia coli (E. coli), Shigella, and Vibrio vulnificus. The latter, which is present in the Gulf of Mexico, can cause terrible infections that can lead to amputations. It is harmful if swallowed or if it comes into contact with a cut.If you have walked through floodwaters, it is best to throw out the clothes and shoes you wore, said Winifred J. Hamilton, director of the environmental health service at Baylor College of Medicine.Dr. David E. Persse, Houston\u2019s chief medical officer, does not anticipate any big outbreaks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a lot of people with those after other storms,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif you look at other floods, you don\u2019t see a lot of hepatitis. In poor countries, you see cholera, but we don\u2019t have it here.\u201dAlso, Houston \u2013 unlike New York and some other cities \u2014 has separate pipes for storm water and house sewage. \u201cOur storm sewer system was overwhelmed, but our sanitary system did not get breached,\u201d he said. \u201cThat water flows into treatment plants, and they did not get flooded or lose power that I know of.\u201dHouston health officials said there have been no breaches to the city\u2019s main public water supply, and that the drinking water is fine. But, they have warned residents who rely on small municipal water systems of potential contamination and have urged them to boil their water.If you\u2019re among the hundreds of thousands of Houston-area residents who rely on private wells, you are on your own. If flood water has gotten into your well, you need to get the water tested. Use bottled in the meantime.\u201cIf you\u2019re on a well, you are your water system,\u201d said Professor Marc Edwards, a drinking water expert at Virginia Tech. \u201cThat is why we have a special outreach effort, a collaboration with Louisiana State University, trying to get information to people who have private wells.\u201dNo.Not so good. In most cases the toxic air pollution given off by the refineries and chemical plants during emergency shut downs won\u2019t cause severe problems right away. But older adults, those with asthma and the immune-compromised may develop inflammations and other ailments. Long-term risks won\u2019t be known until health officials figure out what, exactly, has been spewed into the air.Residents going back to their houses will have to rip out wallboard that has developed mold, which is also a health risk. And be careful when tearing out cabinets or walls: Houses may have asbestos and those built before 1978 are likely to have lead paint. You don\u2019t want to expose yourself or your children.At the moment, the risk is lower than normal. Floods and high winds whisked billions of mosquitoes and their larvae to their doom in the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cWhen the water is raging and surging, everything\u2019s washed away,\u201d said Mustapha Debboun, chief of mosquito control for Harris County, which includes Houston.But once the waters settle, there will be countless low spots, old tires, flowerpots and the like where mosquitoes can begin rebuilding their populations.After Labor Day, Dr. Debboun said, he will send teams out to see how many land on an arm in a minute. If the situation gets bad enough, he said, he will start aerial spraying and probably ask for help from the federal agencies.To spread Zika or dengue, mosquitoes would have to pick up the virus from the blood of humans who recently returned from areas with outbreaks. Throughout most of the Western Hemisphere, Zika cases are down by more than 90 percent from last year\u2019s peaks, according to the Pan American Health Organization. However, Mexico is having a modest uptick this year, including cases in the state of Tamaulipas, which is just across the border from Texas\u2019s southeast coast.West Nile virus is endemic in the United States and outbreaks are triggered by several factors, including the concentrations of culex mosquitoes, humans who are not immune, and birds who are not immune. (The virus builds up to higher concentrations in bird blood than in human blood, so mosquitoes tend to pick it up from them to give to humans.) Birds were also probably driven away from coastal Texas by Hurricane Harvey\u2019s winds.In 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, there was initially no increase in cases of West Nile virus or St. Louis encephalitis, which is also spread by mosquitoes, noted Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But a year later, there was a surge in dangerous \u201cneuroinvasive\u201d West Nile disease in the affected regions of Louisiana and Mississippi: Cases of encephalitis and meningitis more than doubled. Researchers from Tulane University\u2019s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine speculated that more people were bitten that year because they were outside doing reconstruction work or living inside partially-destroyed houses that mosquitoes could invade easily.\u201cThe big thing I\u2019m worried about is norovirus,\u201d said Dr. Persse, Houston\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cThat\u2019s the \u2018cruise ship virus\u2019 \u2013 with a lot of people in a small space, it can spread really quickly.\u201dThe disease causes vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. It is not normally fatal to otherwise healthy people, but severe dehydration can kill frail older adults.In shelters, it can be hard to control. Health officials try to stop outbreaks by quickly taking the sick to separate rooms where they are given food and entertainment, there is no wait for toilets and the floors are washed frequently with bleach.Dr. Persse\u2019s medical teams are walking through shelters now looking for people vomiting. Shelter populations are thinning out as people return home or find other places to stay, so the danger is decreasing.After Hurricane Katrina, 200,000 refugees ended up in 750 shelters in 18 states, and there were scattered outbreaks of various diseases, the C.D.C. said.About 1,000 cases of diarrhea in more than 20 shelter clusters were reported. One Dallas-area shelter had 30 skin infections with MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant form of staphylococcus bacteria.Officials worried about tuberculosis transmission, one new case was found in a shelter. Health authorities were able to trace about 70 percent of the patients they knew had previously been on TB treatment so they could be kept on it, the C.D.C. said. TB patients who are taking their antibiotics are usually not infectious.That is not likely, but dead bodies may leak feces that will contaminate the water and could lead to gastrointestinal infections.First, make sure that your electrical system is safe and there are no gas leaks. Check for structural damage.Once inside, there is likely to be toxic sludge. Throw out any food that has come into contact with floodwaters, unless it\u2019s well packaged in metal, waterproof glass or hard plastic containers. Even then, wash it off first.Don\u2019t run gas-powered electrical generators indoors or use gas or charcoal grills indoors. These can cause carbon monoxide to build up and kill you.\u201cMany people are already back into their homes that have been flooded with two or three feet or more of water,\u201d said Winifred J. Hamilton, director of the environmental health service at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cWe are already seeing piles of carpet and sofas on the curb.\u201cAs the water dries,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are going to have mold spores made airborne.\u201dShe advised anyone who has asthma, respiratory disease or is immune-compromised not to take on the cleanup. \u201cYou should get someone else to do it if possible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wear personal protection equipment so that you are not breathing in toxins.\u201dYes, watch out for snakes. Humans aren\u2019t the only creatures who were seeking dry ground.Denise Grady contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Can Ease Your Summer Travel", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThe relaxation you crave from summer vacation can quickly deteriorate into anxiety when things go awry, especially when traveling to an unfamiliar place.At the airport, rummaging through your luggage for your boarding pass is no fun. On a road trip, how annoying is it to miss an exit because you had a hard time following a map on your smartphone screen? Even before you leave, there\u2019s stress in trying to book a flight for the right price.When you\u2019re rushing to catch a flight, digging around for your itinerary or boarding pass is a major time waster. Paper printouts are easy to lose, and emailed itineraries can easily be swallowed by your inbox.Between the two apps, I preferred TripIt because it was less cluttered and showed my trip information in a timeline that is easy to read; Google\u2019s app is crammed with extra features like coupons and recommendations for things to do.A major caveat for both apps: They regularly scan your inbox to find travel-related emails. So if you are paranoid about privacy, create a separate email account just for travel documents and forward all your itineraries and booking confirmations to that address.When traveling overseas, the idea of a digital detox sounds romantic, but a smartphone is handy for retrieving maps or finding places to eat nearby. There are several options for taking your mobile phone abroad.For Verizon and AT&T users, a simple but pricey option is to sign up for an international data pass, which costs $10 a day on top of the rates for their normal plans. For example, if you have an individual plan that costs about $100 a month and you want to use your smartphone for a 14-day trip to France, you would pay an extra $140, bringing your bill to $240 that month.When on the road, your top priority should be driving safely, your second priority should be finding the most efficient route to your destination, and your third priority is probably keeping yourself from going crazy by listening to your favorite songs and podcasts.A vacation can easily be ruined by a subpar hotel or the feeling that you overpaid for a flight. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no quick fix: Booking the best flight and hotel requires a number of tools and some research, and there are many travel-deal apps on the market catering to people\u2019s special preferences.Booking the right hotel is trickier because people have different preferences and reviews are so subjective. I recommend using a combination of TripAdvisor and Yelp for reading customer reviews, and Kayak and Priceline for finding the best prices. If you are feeling spontaneous, you could use the app Hotel Tonight to look for a same-day booking at a reasonable price.Everyone has heard horror stories about luggage misplaced by an airline \u2014 and one day that bag could be yours.If you\u2019re having trouble finding your suitcase at the baggage carousel, use the app to get the Tile to ring. Or if the luggage has vanished, you can tap the \u201cNotify me when found\u201d button in the Tile app, and if any Tile customer comes near your Tile, you will be alerted with its approximate location on a map.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Catskills Art Scene Makes a Splash With Free Curry", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet if you were to drive there on a Saturday this summer, you would hardly recognize or perhaps even believe what\u2019s there now: a fashionable throng in designer caftans and polo shirts milling around a courtyard, drinking French ros\u00e9 and sitting at beer-garden-style tables.Ranging in age from toddler to 70-something, the crowd on a recent evening dined on cucumber gazpacho, short ribs, local vegetables and free curry, in a stylishly bohemian scene that is part community kitchen, part social experiment and part art gallery, where the food plays a key role.But lest you go fantasizing that a mob of Brooklyn foodie hipsters has taken over some poor unsuspecting town, remember: This is the Catskills, which has long offered New Yorkers a low-key, low-maintenance alternative to the high-profile, high-priced playgrounds of the Hamptons. Here in Delaware County, which is larger than all of Long Island, four people is a scene.This anti-Hamptons feel was very much the original appeal for Mr. Brown, who bought a 700-square-foot cabin just south of central Hancock in the hamlet of Lordville, N.Y., in 2005. The place didn\u2019t have electricity or running water, which was a plus, he thought. And it was right on the Delaware River. He added some solar power in 2008, which became even more essential after he married the artist Hope Atherton in 2012 and the couple had a daughter, Feroline.\u201cIt was purely the \u2018for sale\u2019 sign,\u201d Mr. Brown said, explaining where the idea came from. As for the idea guiding it thereafter? \u201cWe were scared that no one would come.\u201dMr. Brown is no stranger to using food as an art medium. Mr. Tiravanija, one of the artists he represents, is a godfather in the art movement known as relational aesthetics, in which the social act of serving and eating food purposely blurs the line between art and viewer. (In one of Mr. Tiravanija\u2019s best-known works, \u201cUntitled (Free),\u201d which was recreated at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012, he converted a gallery into a kitchen and served rice and Thai curry.)While the 1960s-style DaBrescia Motors sign still hangs over the facade at Unclebrother, the L-shaped building bears little resemblance to the former car dealership. The showroom now houses an open, industrial-grade kitchen, bar and dining room. The mechanics\u2019 main garage is an art gallery, currently showing an exhibition of ceramics curated by Mr. Tiravanija. A grassy courtyard has replaced the gas pumps.On summer weekends the restaurant serves essentially one menu, for $25. Overseen by Mr. Tiravanija\u2019s longtime lieutenant Glorimarta Linares, the kitchen uses local ingredients for Americana entrees like country fried steak, pork tacos and beef short ribs, accompanied by salads, desserts and vegetarian dishes \u2014 as well as by Mr. Tiravanija\u2019s famous curry and rice, still free.But as hurting as downtown Hancock was for a spark of life, not everyone was convinced this arty boat was seaworthy.\u201cI thought it was a bit of a stretch, honestly,\u201d said Victoria Bartlett, a New York fashion designer who has a weekend house just across the Delaware River in Equinunk, Pa. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would work in that environment. But they\u2019ve accepted Gavin there. I think it really helps that he\u2019s not some New Age, hippie-dippie person from the city. They like his pomp. He\u2019s a bit arrogant, and I think they respect that.\u201dIndeed, as Unclebrother comes to the end of its second full summer, it has proved not only a draw for art-world fans, but also for some longtime residents of Hancock.Another full-time resident, Steve Dungan, the husband of Marie Dungan, a ceramist with work in Unclebrother\u2019s summer exhibit, looked around nostalgically. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, I used to pump gas right there,\u201d Mr. Dungan said.\u201cWhat we do is a little like \u2018Cheers,\u2019 if John Waters made it,\u201d said Ms. Barton, who uses a loose hand in guiding the various projects at the center. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a mix between the local population here and people coming up from the city.\u201dOne would think it would be a rare act of culture making that can appeal to both denizens of New York\u2019s high-art landscape and citizens of small towns like Hancock. But Unclebrother has struck a balance, coming to the table with neither the slick wit of today\u2019s big-selling art nor the dour obscurantism that makes so much city art feel hard to engage with.\u201cIt\u2019s not social sculpture in the Beuysian proposition,\u201d said Yasmil Raymond, an associate curator at the Museum of Modern Art and a longtime fan of Mr. Tiravanija. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not socialist in the Marxist way. It\u2019s a socializing piece \u2014 if only we could conjugate it like that.\u201d\u201cI often think about Derrida\u2019s idea of absolute hospitality, in which you don\u2019t ask questions,\u201d Ms. Raymond added. \u2018You just welcome the other without attitude or ambiguity, and I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201dGerald daBrescia, a lifelong Hancock resident and retired insurance broker, whose family owned the car dealership from 1941 to 2014, echoed those sentiments. \u201cI\u2019m not a food aficionado or an art aficionado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s so neat is seeing the effect on people of being in Gavin\u2019s place. I\u2019m 72 years old, and I\u2019ve never had that sensation I had being there.\u201dHe said that the closest thing he could think of was in the early \u201950s, when Hancock was a bustling town with eight restaurants and DaBrescia Motors was a hub of activity. \u201cIt was a socializing place,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in a way this feels like old times. The irony is that they\u2019re putting in a bar area now, and my uncle was a pretty good boozer.\u201dOddly enough, one of the people most ambivalent about the place\u2019s success is Mr. Brown himself. \u201cI had a much quieter life here before this,\u201d he said, looking around the dining room. \u201cI thought about one thing when I was up here: I was into the river.

{"Headline": "Why Apple Is Experiencing Another Growth Spurt", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At 41 years old, Apple is a respected elder of the tech industry. But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201dFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.In the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.The iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.In a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201dMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.Even Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.Apple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201dBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.Still, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.The risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said.Advertisement"}

Google, Mr. Schmidt and his family\u2019s foundation are the principal funders of that think tank.But as the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog discovered in February 2009 when it investigated Google\u2019s handling of consumer privacy, the funding from Google comes with strings attached. As the group noted on its website, Google\u2019s director of policy communications, Bob Boorstin, emailed the Rose Foundation (a major funder of Consumer Watchdog) complaining about Consumer Watchdog and asking the charity to consider \u201cwhether there might be better groups in which to place your trust and resources.\u201d Mr. Boorstin later apologized for his attempts to cripple a Google critic, but there is no evidence that the use of this kind of tactic has ended.So when these supposedly neutral organizations weigh in on issues that involve Google, you should take their advocacy with a grain of salt. In the coming months, privacy legislation put forward by Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, and modifications to the Safe Harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act advocated by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, will come before Congress. Google does not want either of these laws to pass, and you can be sure that papers from major think tanks will be part of the policy discussion.Perhaps more important, the discussion that is beginning to take place on both sides of the political aisle on whether companies like Google and Amazon are too big will continue. The role of the think tanks in this debate will be important. What we don\u2019t need are more Google shills.Jonathan Taplin is director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I\u2019m a White Man. Hear Me Out.", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m a white man, so you should listen to absolutely nothing I say, at least on matters of social justice. I have no standing. No way to relate. My color and gender nullify me, and it gets worse: I grew up in the suburbs. Dad made six figures. We had a backyard pool. From the 10th through 12th grades, I attended private school. So the only proper way for me to check my privilege is to realize that it blinds me to others\u2019 struggles and should gag me during discussions about the right responses to them.But wait. I\u2019m gay. And I mean gay from a different, darker day. In that pool and at that school, I sometimes quaked inside, fearful of what my future held. Back then \u2014 the 1970s \u2014 gay stereotypes went unchallenged, gay jokes drew hearty laughter and exponentially more Americans were closeted than out. We conducted our lives in whispers. Then AIDS spread, and we wore scarlet letters as we marched into the public square to plead with President Ronald Reagan for help. Our rallying cry, \u201csilence = death,\u201d defined marginalization as well as any words could.So where does that leave me? Who does that make me? Oppressor or oppressed? Villain or victim? And does my legitimacy hinge on the answer?To listen to some of the guardians of purity on the left, yes.That reception was wrong. I said so. And a reader responded: \u201cI don\u2019t need one more white male criticizing young people of color.\u201d Other readers also homed in on my race \u2014 or on the professor\u2019s: \u201cWeinstein will be fine. He\u2019s white.\u201d That automatically and axiomatically made him a less compelling actor in the drama, a less deserving object of concern, no matter his actions, no matter his argument.Many people disagreed. Good. But what too many took issue with was, well, his identity. \u201cWhite men: stop telling me about my experiences!\u201d someone later scrawled on a poster that was put up to advertise a talk, \u201cIdentity Is Not Politics,\u201d that he gave at Wellesley College.\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t talking about their experience or my experience,\u201d Lilla pointed out when I spoke with him recently. \u201cI was talking about an issue.\u201dAnd where are the bridges?Race, gender, sexual orientation, class: All of this informs \u2014 and very often warps \u2014 how we see the world. And for much too long, this country\u2019s narrative has been scripted by white men, who have also dominated its stage and made its rules. Our advantage, as a class, is real and unearned.But she worries that awareness disclaimers and privilege apologies have ferried us to a silly, self-involved realm of oppression Olympics. They promote the idea that people occupying different rungs of privilege or victimization can\u2019t possibly grasp life elsewhere on the ladder.In her book she mocks the inevitable juncture in a certain kind of essay \u201cwhere the writer (probably a cis White Lady, probably straight or bisexual, probably living in Brooklyn, definitely well educated, but not necessarily well-off) interrupts the usually scheduled programming to duly note that the issues she\u2019s describing may not apply to a trans woman in Papua New Guinea.\u201dThat kind of thinking fosters estrangement instead of connection. Lilla noted that what people in a given victim group sometimes seem to be saying is: \u201cYou must understand my experience, and you can\u2019t understand my experience.\u201d\u201cThey argue both, so people shrug their shoulders and walk away,\u201d he said.Across a range of American institutions, we need more diversity. We need it to expunge and guard against the injustice that Bovy mentioned, and we need it because it\u2019s indeed a portal to broader knowledge and greater enlightenment. That means that white people \u2014 men in particular, even Google engineers \u2014 must make room in that narrative and space on that stage.But I question the wisdom of turning categories into credentials when it comes to politics and public debate. I reject the assumptions \u2014 otherwise known as prejudices \u2014 that certain life circumstances prohibit sensitivity and sound judgment while other conditions guarantee them. That appraises the packaging more than it does the content. It ignores the complexity of people. It\u2019s reductive.At the beginning of this column I shared the sorts of personal details that register most strongly with those Americans who tuck each of us into some hierarchy of blessedness and affliction. So you know some important things about me, but not the most important ones: how I responded to the random challenges on my path, who I met along the way, what I learned from them, the degree of curiosity I mustered and the values that I honed as a result.Those construct my character, and shape my voice, to be embraced or dismissed on its own merits. My gayness no more redeems me than my whiteness disqualifies me. And neither, I hope, defines me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OpenTable Began a Revolution. Now It\u2019s a Power Under Siege.", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost 20 years ago, a new company came on the scene promising to revolutionize the tedious and often frustrating chore of securing a restaurant reservation.No more waiting on the phone and pleading with snooty receptionists. With just a few clicks of a mouse, a diner could secure a table at prime times in the hottest dining spots. Who you were or knew would no longer matter. Restaurants would benefit, too, handing off the job of juggling tables and recording reservations in a bulky book.The company was called OpenTable, and, since its genesis in 1998, it has come to dominate the field it created. Today, it says it seats more than 23 million diners a month in 43,000 restaurants across the globe.And for all the diners they do seat, neither OpenTable nor its competitors have yet loosened the telephone\u2019s grip on reservations, roughly two-thirds of which are still made by phone, according to Yelp, which once partnered with OpenTable and is now a rival.\u201cEveryone is fighting to win over the handful of top restaurants in each market \u2014 and then what?\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a former chief executive of OpenTable who is now a venture capitalist. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the endgame.\u201dConsumers continue to have fundamental gripes about these services: chiefly, that they offer few or no tables during the peak dining hours. They make it difficult to book tables for large or odd-numbered parties, which is why diners like Jeff Day, a marketing executive in Austin, Tex., keeps no reservation apps on his phone.\u201cMy default way to make reservations is still to call,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess because my desire to speak to a human transcends the need to just make a reservation.\u201dReserve has managed to attract those restaurants because, like many of other new reservation services, it is paying more attention to meeting their needs. After all, the restaurants are paying monthly fees for the service.But winning over restaurateurs, many of whom have accumulated a long list of gripes against what they perceive as cookie-cutter approach to their reservation woes, is still a challenge.\u201cThese kinds of technologies have been a boon for the diner,\u201d said David Barber, an owner of Blue Hill in New York City and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s delivered this great efficiency to the restaurant business is kind of a myth, especially for fine-dining restaurants.\u201dOpenTable is not just standing by as others invade its turf. While it has been slow to move in the past, last spring it upgraded its flagship GuestCenter package for restaurant managers, improving its ability to handle large parties and better juggle servers\u2019 shifts, among other things.Restaurateurs can now see what\u2019s happening with their reservations in real time and even on their Apple Watch. And OpenTable offers consumers points that can earn benefits like access to special wine tastings or menus at various OpenTable restaurants.\u201cCompetition for our business is not new,\u201d said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing. \u201cIt makes us faster and more innovative.\u201dLeslie Cafferty, a Priceline spokeswoman, said OpenTable is profitable and bigger than it was then. She said Priceline had bought the company based on a strategic plan that was in place at the time but has since changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some changes in leadership in OpenTable and in the Priceline Group,\u201d Ms. Cafferty said. \u201cWhen we got caught up and looked at where OpenTable was, it was basically different than when we bought it.\u201dHighly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.Resy, now used by roughly 1,000 restaurants in 80 cities across the country, has seated more than 25 million diners since its inception, and the number of meals served to those using its system quadrupled in the year that ended in May, Mr. Leventhal said.\u201cIn fine dining, you have the cost of business going up, the notion of fine dining evolving rapidly, a lot of restaurants being forced to rethink their formats and business models,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to make sure every table is working for you, and restaurants are finally embracing technology that can help them do that.\u201dMany restaurants that use Resy, for instance, require diners making a reservation to enter a credit-card number, in an effort to discourage no-shows and cancellations; about 1 percent require a down payment. Resy follows up to remind diners when a reservation they made is imminent.Users can also put themselves on a waiting list at some restaurants, which makes it much easier to ensure that all tables will be filled, since most cancellations happen within 24 hours before the reservation time. As a result, Resy says, it has brought no-shows down to under 4 percent on average; the usual rate is as much as 15 percent, the company said.Perhaps the company\u2019s biggest coup, though, was winning over Union Square Cafe when that perennially popular New York restaurant reopened in December. Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, was on the OpenTable board for almost two decades and one of its best ambassadors.In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Meyer was working to open his second restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, he tried starting a similar system himself. He didn\u2019t even think about using it to allow customers to make reservations online; rather, it was to be an answer to a perennial problem.\u201cI was tired of this recurring problem we had in the restaurant, where people would always be yelling up and down the stairs, saying, \u2018Who\u2019s got the reservation book?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cOne time a fraternity brother of mine pulled a prank and took the book out of the restaurant entirely \u2014 it was not a nice prank.\u201dSo when he opened Eleven Madison Park in 1998, OpenTable was taking the reservations. When Blue Smoke opened in 2002, the only way to make a reservation was via OpenTable; a phone line was discontinued. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAn online blog called Daily Candy announced that step and within hours, we had filled the entire restaurant for a month.\u201dBut OpenTable had its limitations. Until recently, for instance, it would not link the reservation systems at the Union Square group\u2019s restaurants. A free-spending diner who patronized Union Square Cafe for years could show up at Gramercy Tavern for the first time, and the host would not know him.Mr. Meyer said that, to some extent, OpenTable had been criticized unfairly. After all, it still seats far more diners in restaurants like his than any other service, and serves all the Union Square group restaurants except Union Square Cafe and the new Martina, which doesn\u2019t take reservations. Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthe latest round of assaults from start-ups looking to eat their lunch is more than they\u2019ve ever faced before.\u201dThe rivals have easily identified OpenTable\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: the fees it charges restaurants every time someone books a table using its system. For reservations made on OpenTable, the restaurant pays $1 for each diner. Even if reservations are made on the restaurant\u2019s website, OpenTable charges 25 cents a diner. And if they don\u2019t show up, the restaurant recoups none of those fees, several restaurateurs said. (OpenTable, however, says it charges fees only for guests who do show up.)That galled Anjan Mitra, proprietor of Dosa, a popular Indian restaurant with locations in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif. Many of his diners are repeat customers, he said, coming two or three times a month and using OpenTable to make reservations.\u201cI don\u2019t mind paying OpenTable for new customers, but OpenTable was charging me for customers I already had and knew well,\u201d Mr. Mitra said.He said he paid as much as $50,000 to OpenTable in fees on top of the $295 a month for use of its technology. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t know this,\u201d Mr. Mitra said. \u201cThey just love the convenience, and I understand that.\u201dYelp says more than 4,000 restaurants now use its service for reservations. The company doesn\u2019t need to attract marquee dining spots to entice users, who are already coming to it for reviews, giving it a major advantage.Yelp Reservations charges a restaurant $249 a month, and, in exchange, a reservations option is added to the top of its page on the Yelp app and website. \u201cMany people planning to make a reservation for dinner are already opening Yelp to figure out where they want to go, and now they can see whether there\u2019s a table waiting for them or not,\u201d said Vishwas Prabhakara, the general manager of Yelp Reservations.He said the flat-monthly-fee model used by most of the new reservation services helped discourage a restaurant practice that infuriates customers: holding back tables during prime hours. Some restaurants do that because they know they can fill the tables on their own at those times, and they like to seat valuable guests who show up at the last minute.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to hold tables back because you\u2019re not having to pay for each reservation,\u201d Mr. Prabhakara said.\u201cPeople in the restaurant business have moved from fear of change to a recognition that OpenTable was built in 1998,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really kept up innovation-wise, and part of that is because of the architecture of their technology.\u201dHe said that, until this summer, OpenTable gave restaurants only \u201cone blank box on the screen\u201d to enter a wide range of information on a diner \u2014 such as dietary restrictions, preferred nights of the week and wines ordered \u2014 instead of separate fields that made it easy to see if a customer, say, has lactose intolerance.\u201cNot to be creepy, but instantaneous and easy-to-read customer data is the best way we have to give the customer the best service,\u201d Mr. Kokonas said. \u201cIt lets us know that the last time you were here, you finished with a special spiced tea that you liked, and we can make that happen again and easily.\u201dMr. Jampol of OpenTable said that his company also compiles piles of similar data on customers that restaurants could use \u2014 but that they rarely want it. \u201cRestaurateurs have a lot of things to keep track of every day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as much as they say they want data, they\u2019re often too busy to dive into it.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Kokonas and others see an opportunity to do it better. Tock, which was co-founded by Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google engineer, spent roughly two years building its system, testing different components with restaurants and getting feedback. It is web-based rather than app-based, because that makes it easier for restaurants to log in and configure Tock to their needs.Other new reservation services are also looking to please restaurants. Reserve has adopted an \u201copen data model\u201d that allows its restaurants to see what diners are looking for, and, since it tweaked it service in May, it is adding more than 100 restaurants a month (for a total of 850), said Peter Esmond, its vice president for customer success.Say a potential customer is seeking a table for four at 7:30 p.m., and a restaurant is showing nothing available at that time. If it has a table available then that it has held back, it can quickly add it to its Reserve page in an effort to attract the booking.Thus, more control over how reservations are made is put in the hands of restaurants, rather than the reservation app.At Blue Hill, Reserve worked with Mr. Barber to tailor its product to his needs. And that, Mr. Barber said, is why a monolithic reservation titan like OpenTable may be a thing of the past.\u201cTrying to build ubiquitous software that will meet all the needs of high-, middle- and low-priced restaurants and make consumers happy, that\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a baseline product that comes close to what OpenTable does and then allows some customization, that\u2019s what the restaurant business wants \u2014 and then customers will really start to see the benefit of these things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because of American sanctions against the country, the company\u2019s iPhones are not legally available for sale here, and Apple does not offer a version of its App Store in the country.That has not stopped Iranians from snapping up millions of iPhones smuggled in from places like Dubai and Hong Kong. Nor has it kept Iranian app developers from creating thousands of apps for local users and offering them through App Stores outside Iran.In a message to Iranian developers whose apps were affected by the ban, Apple said, \u201cUnder the U.S. sanctions regulations, the App Store cannot host, distribute or do business with apps or developers connected to certain U.S. embargoed countries.\u201dAn Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, confirmed the message\u2019s authenticity. He declined further comment.Mahdi Taghizadeh, a founder of DelionFoods, an online food delivery service, said his app was among those taken down.\u201cWe work so hard, and have to fight all the time, and now this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNo one with an iPhone can download any of the popular apps any more. Imagine if in the U.S. you wouldn\u2019t be able to get Uber on your phone.\u201dIn addition to blocking Twitter, the Iranian government has long blocked Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube service.When it comes to technology, American sanctions against Iran over its nuclear weapons program are complicated. The Obama administration eased restrictions on American tech companies that offered internet services in Iran as a way of encouraging a free flow of information, especially among younger Iranians.The Trump administration has modified the overall sanctions, and President Trump signed a new sanctions bill into law this month. It is unclear whether the administration meant to impose new restrictions on technology companies.European countries lifted all sanctions against Iran after the 2016 nuclear agreement was reached.\u201cThe full removal of Iranian apps by Apple means our work will be much more complicated,\u201d said Mr. Taghizadeh.

{"Headline": "On Croatia\u2019s Coast, Uber Takes Its Ride-Hailing App to the Seas", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPLIT, Croatia \u2014 Checking Google Maps during a sun-baked holiday on the Dalmatian Coast, K. J. Gunnarsson and Eydis Osk, a couple from Iceland, happened upon an ad for something called UberBOAT. Soon they were enjoying a private three-hour cruise complete with snacks, drinks and sparkling turquoise water.The couple enjoyed the jaunt but, back on shore, were stunned at the price tag: 2,300 Croatian kuna, or almost $370.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were getting ourselves into, really,\u201d said Mr. Gunnarsson, a flight engineer. \u201cIt was our fault not to look into it more deeply.\u201dDavor Tremac, Uber\u2019s general manager for Southeast Europe, declined to provide specific revenue and ridership figures for UberBOAT, saying only that \u201cseveral hundred people\u201d used the service in its first six weeks. Depending on the success in Croatia, he said, boat service could soon be available in Greece, Spain, Thailand and the Caribbean.Visitors to the Croatian coast can access the boats through the Uber app. Customers can choose from a menu of one way, point-to-point trips, or opt for an \u201cadventure,\u201d which essentially means renting craft and crew for a cruise whose destination and duration are up to the client.Mr. Tremac said that there were usually about 60 skippers online, waiting for customers, and that the goal was to have boats meet customers within 15 minutes of all requests. He would not say how often that goal had been met.Recent figures show Croatia attracting 16 million tourists a year, mostly in July and August. There are regular ferry services to the most popular of its 1,200 islands, like Hvar and Brac, and a flotilla of boats for rent or for set tours can be found along the harbor front in Split and other coastal resorts.UberBOAT is aimed at people who want a more personalized, on-demand service \u2014 and are willing to pay for it.For example, a one-way Uber trip to Hvar from Split on an eight-seat boat cost 2,600 kuna (about $416, or $52 per person); ferry tickets run about $16. Uber Adventures cost a minimum of 330 kuna (about $53) plus $5.75 per kilometer and 50 cents per minute.UberBOAT will also take visitors directly from Split\u2019s waterfront airport to Hvar, about an hour\u2019s journey, for about $480 for up to eight passengers, or $600 for up to 12. That would replace a half-hour $35 taxi ride from the airport to the line for the $16 ferry \u2014 where the wait for the next boat can be up to four hours and the water journey itself lasts two hours.Mr. Tremac said the service was for people more concerned about saving time than money, noting that tourists spend an average of three and a half days in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a premium service,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to drive an Uber car from point A to B,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more risks on the sea. I\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to get these local guys with no experience to work for them.\u201dMr. Tremac said skippers must have the license Croatia required of yacht captains, $1 million in insurance and a boat with at least a 150-horsepower engine and 25-knot cruising speed.When UberBOAT quietly went live on June 28, Mr. Tremac said, he and his colleagues \u201csat back and waited to see how long it would take\u201d for the first customer to order a boat.About 20 minutes. There was a request for a transfer to Brac from Split, a trip of about 45 minutes, then one to Brac from Dubrovnik, 120 miles away.The service started with four routes and has expanded to 30, based on customer demand.\u201cWe have people out on their sailboats arranging for UberBOAT to pick up their friends at the airport and bring them out to the boat,\u201d Mr. Tremac said.There have not yet been similar flare-ups on the shoreline.Damir Djelmic, 43, owns a pair of rigid-hulled inflatable boats capable of carrying 12 passengers each, and employs four skippers, offering both group excursions and point-to-point trips from Split\u2019s harbor. He decided to sign up with Uber as a way of filling idle hours.Unlike Uber\u2019s land service, UberBOAT pays skippers for online waiting time, though that could change if enough sign up to ensure there are enough boats on duty to meet customer demand. So, Mr. Djelmic figures, he can take passengers to Hvar, and wait a few hours to see if anyone wants to go the other way. A return customer is like found money; if no one appears, the waiting fees are enough to offset fuel and labor costs.If UberBOAT continues next summer, he said, he might buy more boats and dedicate one or more exclusively to the service.That would have been appreciated by Mr. Gunnarsson, the Icelandic flight engineer who had a bit of sticker shock after his three-hour tour.The private tour cost nearly triple what the couple would have paid at one of the kiosks along the Split waterfront to join a group for a half-day trip to the same lagoon. Still, Mr. Gunnarsson said, it was nice to have their own captain and set their own course.\u201cWe would definitely do it again,\u201d Mr. Gunnarsson said. \u201cIf the price was better.\u201dJoseph Orovic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fidget Spinner and the Fall of the Well-Managed Fad", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyA fad changed Osborne\u2019s life, much for the better, shortly after she opened her original toy store, named Wonder Works, in the 1990s. In those early days, Osborne tried selling board games and science kits, but she was struggling to find customers. Then, in 1994, a family visiting from Chicago walked through her doors and asked if she had any Beanie Babies.Osborne had never even heard of them. But almost immediately, she started hearing about nothing else. Later that week, someone called asking if she had Quackers the Duck. The next day someone inquired about Happy the Hippo. Osborne quickly learned that Beanie Babies were stuffed animals that, truth be told, weren\u2019t all that distinguishable from other stuffed animals. But for some reason, they had become playground must-haves. \u2018\u2018And that\u2019s when I knew,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me, \u2018\u2018if we could just get our hands on Beanies, it would be our ticket.\u2019\u2019Talking to her suppliers, Osborne eventually figured out that Beanie Babies were made by Ty, a company in Westmont, Ill. Ty didn\u2019t actually manufacture Beanie Babies \u2014 that was outsourced to China \u2014 but it did everything else. The previous year, Ty\u2019s executives began an extensive campaign to identify the nation\u2019s most influential specialty gift and toy stores. Then, rather than advertise Beanie Babies to the public, executives quietly distributed small numbers of them to these retailers, often extracting a promise they would not sell more than a few Beanies to any single customer.Ty fiercely controlled retailers\u2019 inventory of Beanies based on a complicated formula that was updated with each day\u2019s sales and trends. If a store degraded the Beanie brand by discounting the toy or employing unfriendly salespeople, Ty would cut them off. As particular animals \u2014 like Peanut the Elephant \u2014 became popular, Ty ceased manufacturing them altogether. When Wal-Mart and Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us asked to carry Beanie Babies, Ty refused.Osborne was accustomed to toy manufacturers begging her to carry their products in her store. With Beanie Babies, everything was reversed. Osborne tracked down a Ty sales rep named Joyce and pleaded with her. \u2018\u2018I started in with the charm,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me. \u2018\u2018I would telephone nearly every afternoon and tell her we would do anything to get some stock.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, Joyce relented, and Wonder Works began earning thousands of dollars a week from Beanie Baby sales.But as the months passed and the women continued talking, Joyce began asking for favors of her own. Ty\u2019s executives wanted to know Osborne\u2019s opinion on her customers\u2019 tastes. Did they respond to primary colors? To sparkly bows? Why was Manny the Manatee so popular, but Darling the Dog a bust? Based on such conversations with Osborne and countless other toy-store owners, Ty\u2019s executives made hundreds of tiny shifts in their manufacturing, marketing and distribution over the years, turning what began as a fad into a perennial best-seller, one that earned hundreds of millions of dollars each year and helped Ty employ thousands of people. As for Osborne, she used her Beanie profits to expand Wonder Works to four locations. Today, more than two decades later, Beanie Boos, one of Ty\u2019s latest iterations, are still among her top-grossing items.For fidget spinners, as Osborne well knew, no one was going to manage the buzz, strategize about inventory and plan marketing the way Ty had for Beanie Babies. \u2018\u2018Now, in less than half a year, spinners are done,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m moving on to squishies\u2019\u2019 \u2014 squishable toys that are also (questionably) marketed as attention aids. \u2018\u2018I think they\u2019ll last at least a few months.\u2019\u2019Within economics, this transition to direct selling \u2014 of cutting out sales reps like Joyce in lieu of websites like DHgate.com \u2014 is known as disintermediation, and it\u2019s one of the defining characteristics of the internet age. Companies like Uber, Amazon and Priceline have succeeded by disintermediating enormous industries (taxi dispatchers, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel agents). The logic of disintermediation seems self-evident: By putting factories directly in contact with stores, by helping customers order directly from manufacturers, by letting riders coordinate with drivers, you cut out a needless source of waste and inefficiency. Middlemen (and middlewomen), so this theory goes, have simply been gobbling a slice of the pie they never really deserved.In reality, though, all these middlemen were often crucial to ensuring that the pie was baked at all. As Osborne learned when she started selling Beanie Babies, middlemen like Joyce are often the ones who turn a fad into a sustainable business that creates jobs. You might think a company\u2019s main function is to make stuff. But that\u2019s usually wrong. Making stuff is often the easiest part of what a company does. It\u2019s everything else \u2014 marketing and defending intellectual property, coming up with distribution strategies and knowing when to stop manufacturing Peanut the Elephant \u2014 that\u2019s the hard part. That\u2019s what middlemen do.Or, at least, it\u2019s what they did, before the digital economy made their jobs disappear. Take, for instance, the travel industry: As Youcheng Wang of the University of Central Florida notes, the industry as we know it was built, over decades, by hundreds of thousands of middlemen at travel agencies, tour operators, hotels and airline bucket shops. \u2018\u2018There were layers of jobs and experts,\u2019\u2019 Wang says. \u2018\u2018They convinced people to visit new places and helped resorts find new customers.\u2019\u2019 Today, however, many of those jobs and experts are gone, replaced by disintermediators like Trip\u00adAdvisor (3,000 employees) and Priceline (18,500 employees), which are built on what middlemen created, but which employ far fewer people. And the impact of losing all those jobs will have ripple effects that we can\u2019t even predict. Who, in the absence of those middlemen, is today persuading travelers to dream bigger about their vacations, to open their wallets to support off-the-beaten-track destinations, to help new hotels find their clienteles? \u2018\u2018Without intermediaries,\u2019\u2019 Wang points out, \u2018\u2018it can be difficult to get discovered.\u2019\u2019It was a fun idea, retailers said. It could probably help fidget spinners make the transition from a fad into a sustainable product. If it worked, it would create jobs and help toy stores prosper. But Osborne and others cautioned Zing against making the investment. It would take at least six months to design and manufacture the new item, and by then, the fidget spinner craze would most likely be over. So Zing shelved the idea \u2014 and the new hiring it would have triggered.\u2018\u2018Now a fad is just a fad,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018And that makes things harder for all of us.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How A.I. Is Creating Building Blocks to Reshape Music and Art", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In the mid-1990s, Douglas Eck worked as a database programmer in Albuquerque while moonlighting as a musician. After a day spent writing computer code inside a lab run by the Department of Energy, he would take the stage at a local juke joint, playing what he calls \u201cpunk-influenced bluegrass\u201d \u2014 \u201cJohnny Rotten crossed with Johnny Cash.\u201d But what he really wanted to do was combine his days and nights, and build machines that could make their own songs. \u201cMy only goal in life was to mix A.I. and music,\u201d Mr. Eck said.\u201cIt\u2019s about creating new ways for people to communicate,\u201d he said during a recent interview inside the small two-story building here that serves as headquarters for Google A.I. research.The project is part of a growing effort to generate art through a set of A.I. techniques that have only recently come of age. Called deep neural networks, these complex mathematical systems allow machines to learn specific behavior by analyzing vast amounts of data. By looking for common patterns in millions of bicycle photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a bike. This is how Facebook identifies faces in online photos, how Android phones recognize commands spoken into phones, and how Microsoft Skype translates one language into another. But these complex systems can also create art. By analyzing a set of songs, for instance, they can learn to build similar sounds.As Mr. Eck says, these systems are at least approaching the point \u2014 still many, many years away \u2014 when a machine can instantly build a new Beatles song or perhaps trillions of new Beatles songs, each sounding a lot like the music the Beatles themselves recorded, but also a little different. But that end game \u2014 as much a way of undermining art as creating it \u2014 is not what he is after. There are so many other paths to explore beyond mere mimicry. The ultimate idea is not to replace artists but to give them tools that allow them to create in entirely new ways.Much as a neural network can learn to identify a cat by analyzing hundreds of cat photos, it can learn the musical characteristics of a bassoon by analyzing hundreds of notes. It creates a mathematical representation, or vector, that identifies a bassoon. So, Mr. Eck and his team have fed notes from hundreds of instruments into a neural network, building a vector for each one. Now, simply by moving a button across a screen, they can combine these vectors to create new instruments. One may be 47 percent bassoon and 53 percent clavichord. Another might switch the percentages. And so on.For centuries, orchestral conductors have layered sounds from various instruments atop one other. But this is different. Rather than layering sounds, Mr. Eck and his team are combining them to form something that didn\u2019t exist before, creating new ways that artists can work. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next film camera,\u201d Mr. Eck said. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next electric guitar.\u201dThe tools are new, but the attitude is not. Allison Parrish, a New York University professor who builds software that generates poetry, points out that artists have been using computers to generate art since the 1950s. \u201cMuch like as Jackson Pollock figured out a new way to paint by just opening the paint can and splashing it on the canvas beneath him,\u201d she said, \u201cthese new computational techniques create a broader palette for artists.\u201dA year ago, David Ha was a trader with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. During his lunch breaks he started toying with neural networks and posting the results to a blog under a pseudonym. Among other things, he built a neural network that learned to write its own Kanji, the logographic Chinese characters that are not so much written as drawn.Then, you ask them to, say, draw a pig with a cat\u2019s head, or to visually subtract a foot from a horse or sketch a truck that looks like a dog or build a boat from a few random squiggly lines. Next to NSynth or DeepDream, these may seem less like tools that artists will use to build new works. But if you play with them, you realize that they are themselves art, living works built by Mr. Ha. A.I. isn\u2019t just creating new kinds of art; it\u2019s creating new kinds of artists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Teaches Autonomous Gliders to Make Decisions on the Fly", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAWTHORNE, Nev. \u2014 As the glider turned and flew south, four men gave chase in a sport utility vehicle below, rolling through the Nevada desert.Soon, the glider took another turn. It gently circled an invisible column of rising hot air while climbing slowly skyward. \u201cIt\u2019s soaring,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said, pointing at the glider as it spiraled higher and higher on a stream of warm air. \u201cIt found a thermal.\u201dLast week, in the desert valley surrounding Hawthorne, Nev., 130 miles south of Reno, Mr. Kapoor and his fellow Microsoft researchers tested two gliders designed to navigate the skies on their own. Guided by computer algorithms that learned from onboard sensors, predicted air patterns and planned a route forward, these gliders could seek out thermals \u2014 columns of rising hot air \u2014 and use them to stay aloft.Led by Mr. Kapoor, who is an artificial intelligence researcher and a licensed pilot, the project was part of a growing effort to build aircraft, automobiles and other machines that can make decisions on their own when faced with uncertainty \u2014 an essential skill for any machine trying to navigate the world on its own.But that only gets them so far. To navigate the world on their own, they must also mimic the way humans intuitively predict what will happen next and adjust their behavior accordingly. Projects like those at Microsoft, Google and Berkeley are reaching in that direction.It was also a way of pushing the boundaries of the mathematical techniques that control a machine in a relatively safe but still very real environment. \u201cWith a glider, you can test these algorithms with minimal risk to people and property,\u201d Mr. Kochenderfer said.In building their algorithms, Mr. Kapoor and his team relied on techniques that date back decades \u2014 something called Markov decision processes. Essentially, this is a way of identifying and responding to uncertainty.The approach is like the one you take when looking for change in a backpack crammed with random stuff. If you just stick your hand in the bag and start rummaging around, you face enormous uncertainty. You don\u2019t know where to grab. But if, first, you remove the larger items like books and pencils that you know aren\u2019t coins, the change falls to the bottom and the task gets easier. That is what Microsoft\u2019s algorithms do \u2014 in a mathematical sense. They work to limit uncertainty, to reduce the scope of the problem.When he joined Microsoft\u2019s research group four years ago, Mr. Kolobov fed these ideas into the company\u2019s Windows operating system and its Bing search engine. Back then, he was dealing with uncertainty in the digital world. Now, he\u2019s applying them in the physical world. \u201cThe number of applications where these methods are used is growing,\u201d Mr. Kolobov said.In the Nevada desert, the team launched its two gliders with help from a hand-held remote control. Once airborne, the gliders \u2014 or sailplanes \u2014 were left to their own devices. They were forced to fly with help from the wind and other air patterns.Through those onboard algorithms, the gliders could analyze what was happening around them and then change directions as need be. They could learn from their environment, and although they could never be completely sure what would happen next, they could at least make educated guesses. Because it is dependent on phenomenon it has no control over, the glider must reason and plan in advance, Mr. Kolobov said.The gliders planned their own paths to locations that could provide lift, and then they worked to exploit this lift, to ride those columns of rising air. When Mr. Kapoor pointed skyward from his Jeep, this is what happened. The math worked.Still, these aircraft were far from perfect. Using a fiberglass glider with a 16-foot wingspan, the team hoped to set a record for autonomous flight time by a sailplane \u2014 more than five hours aloft. But after two days of trial and error, thanks to problems with radios and other equipment, that didn\u2019t happen.That researchers can improve on these sorts of learning algorithms has become an imperative to improving autonomous vehicles. To navigate the real world on their own, machines must mimic the way humans intuitively plan for their next action and deal with events they\u2019ve never before experienced.\u201cThe core problem for robotics is uncertainty,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a professor at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThis is what differentiates robotics from a game like Go or chess.\u201dThat\u2019s the big reason Microsoft is building autonomous gliders. As Mr. Kolobov put it: \u201cThe A.I. systems of tomorrow will face all the same challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Smartphone\u2019s Future: It\u2019s All About the Camera", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We all know the drill. For the last decade, smartphones have gotten thinner and faster and thinner and faster and, well, you get the picture.But it\u2019s too soon to write off our smartphones as boring. The gadgets are still evolving with new technologies. And for a clue as to what the smartphone of the future might look like, turn your attention to the device\u2019s cameras and the software and sensors that make them tick.Here\u2019s a peek into how the camera may come into play: As soon as you pick up your gadget, it will see you and know you are the owner and unlock the screen. Overseas, you will be able to point the camera at a restaurant menu to translate items into your native language. When shopping for furniture, you can point your phone camera at your living room floor and place a virtual rendering of a coffee table down to see how it looks and move around and peek underneath it.Some of this futurism is already starting to happen.\u201c2018 will be the year where the smartphone camera takes a quantum leap in technology,\u201d said Philip-James Jacobowitz, a product manager for Qualcomm, a chip maker that provides components to smartphone makers.Mr. Jacobowitz added that emerging camera technologies would be the key to stronger security features and applications for so-called augmented reality, which uses data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.Here\u2019s a rundown on what this all means for how your next smartphone will work.For the last few years, we have become accustomed to unlocking our smartphones by scanning our fingerprints or entering a passcode. But when Apple shows its new iPhones next month, including a premium model with a starting price of $999, the company will introduce infrared facial recognition as a new method for unlocking the device.How would the new iPhone do that exactly? Apple declined to comment. But Qualcomm\u2019s Spectra, a so-called depth-sensing camera system, is one example of how face scanning works.The Spectra system includes a module that sprays an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. If the dots are smaller, then the object is farther away; if they are bigger, the object is closer. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the contours of the head \u2014 it\u2019s not just the front of the face as you\u2019re typically thinking about,\u201d said Sy Choudhury, a senior director of product security for Qualcomm.Because of the uniqueness of a person\u2019s head shape, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with the incorrect face is 1 in a million, he added. That compares with a false acceptance rate of 1 in 100 for previous facial recognition systems, which had very poor security.There are, however, limitations to infrared-scanning technologies. For example, objects that you wear, like a hat or a scarf, might throw off the camera, according to Qualcomm. In addition, experts said infrared light can get drowned out by bright sunlight outdoors, so face scanning might work less reliably on the beach.It remains to be seen how exactly face scanning will work in the next iPhone. But Apple is well acquainted with depth-sensing camera technologies. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a depth-sensing camera system that let Xbox players control games using body movements. Analysts expect some rendition of PrimeSense\u2019s technology to appear in future iPhones.Depth-sensing cameras may be crucial to enhancing augmented reality, a jargony industry term that probably makes your eyes glaze over. But bear with me for one moment: Augmented reality will have major implications for future mobile apps.It\u2019s no secret that Apple is bullish about augmented reality. In a recent financial earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called augmented reality \u201cbig and profound,\u201d with major implications for gaming, entertainment and business products. This fall, Apple will release iOS 11, its next mobile operating system that includes support for applications made with ARKit, a tool kit for app developers to easily create augmented-reality applications.ARKit uses a combination of the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensors, including the accelerometer and gyroscope, to let people lay digital objects on top of the real world and interact with them with precise movements.I got a demo of ARKit from Ikea, the furniture maker, with its coming app Ikea Place. I placed an Ikea bed on the floor and was able to move around and look underneath it. This type of application would be useful for getting a sense of how an item looks and fits alongside other furniture in a space before placing an order.\u201cThis is like a real application that real people can use to make real-life decisions,\u201d said Michael Valdsgaard, the head of digital transformation at Ikea.But the limitations of the Ikea Place app underscore what\u2019s missing from ARKit. For placing virtual objects, the app can detect horizontal surfaces, like a table surface or the ground, but it cannot yet detect walls.Vertical planes like walls are trickier to detect because they are not as smooth as floors \u2014 with doors, windows and picture frames getting in your way. Depth-sensing cameras make wall detection much easier for future iPhones, said Blair MacIntyre, a research scientist who is working on augmented reality for Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser.Mr. MacIntyre said augmented reality has huge potential when it matures. He envisioned people being able to take a tour of a natural-history museum, pointing their smartphone cameras at a fossil exhibit to bring a dinosaur back to life.But he said that augmented reality on smartphones was a stopgap to the inevitable: wearing data in front of your face at all times through some kind of headset.\u201cIf you look at science fiction, a lot of it has this characteristic of being always on and serendipitous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot closer to that when you get a head-mounted display.\u201dUntil that happens, smartphones are about to become much smarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Daily\u2019 Transcript: Interview With Former White Nationalist Derek Black", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEREK BLACK: Yeah, I was born into one of the most prominent white nationalist families in the country.MICHAEL BARBARO: Wow.D.B.: My godfather for lack of any other word was David Duke, who was married to my mother before I was born \u2026 and then my father started the largest white nationalist website .. Stormfront \u2026 it was the first white nationalist website on the internet, and it has been the largest one ever since. So I grew up with the leadership of the white nationalist movement, all coming over to the house, and when I got older, we\u2019d go to conferences and it was my life.M.B.: Derek Black grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida, across from the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago mansion and he used to drive past it almost every day in a red pickup truck with a confederate flag sticker on the back window. His father is Don Black, once a grand wizard of the K.K.K.M.B.: It sounds like what you\u2019re describing is like you\u2019re the First Child of American white nationalism?D.B.: [Laughs.] Yeah \u2026 I knew everybody, I knew everybody who was involved in it, and I knew all the different organizations, and I expected that it would be my life\u2019s work to try to advance this. I thought it was the right thing. \u2026M.B.: How did you process these ideas of your godfather and your father and your mother and this entire movement as a child, what is white nationalism through the eyes of a child?D.B.: It\u2019s a really tight knit movement of people. It\u2019s important to understand the context that in my family pioneering white nationalism on the web was my dad\u2019s goal. That was what drove him from early \u201990s from beginning of the web, and so growing up \u2026 we had the latest computers, first people in the neighborhood to have broadband because we had to keep Stormfront running, and so technology and connecting people on the website, long before social media and the way the web is set up now was his driving purpose, so we were very connected to everybody in the white nationalist movement to everyone in the world. When I was a little kid, I would get on chat rooms in the evening \u2026 and I had friends in Australia who I would talk to at a certain hour ... I had friends in Serbia I would talk to at a certain hour.M.B.: And what would you be saying to each other?D.B.: In the late \u201990s, I was talking to a white nationalist kid, and he was explaining to me the Smerican invasion of Serbia and how it tied to Jewish control of American military.M.B.: Wow \u2026 not the conventional understanding of the U.S. military action which was to spare people genocide.D.B.: Absolutely, yeah. I started a kid\u2019s website on Stormfront on my dad\u2019s website and so, from the time I was 12, would constantly get death threats and emails.M.B.: So you started your own kind of white nationalist website for children?D.B.: Yeah.. when \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what age \u2026 11 or 12 or something I set up pretty basic little web page on there, and posted some essays that I was writing at the time. In some ways \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 that brings people together, I know it brought my family together, fact that you have media coming over as I went on television and newspapers, which were usually coming over to talk to my dad \u2026 and then we\u2019d get really bad stories about us, but we\u2019re all working toward a cause \u2026 so the fact that everybody is so opposed to something we know is so right really brought us together.M.B.: At this point in your life, when you\u2019re a young man and you saw an African-American or you saw a Jewish person, what was going through your mind? What kind of things were you thinking or saying to yourself?D.B.: I think my family made a distinction between individuals and big groups \u2026 that there\u2019s many opinions on this among white nationalists, there are people who say, \u201cOh you can\u2019t be friends with anyone who\u2019s not white.\u201d And my family was generally a bit more cosmopolitan ...although I think they\u2019ve gotten more extreme in the last couple of years \u2014M.B.: I have to pause and tell you the notion of a cosmopolitan white nationalist is a little tricky. But I\u2019m going to go with it.D.B.: [Laughs.] When you zoom in on it, and it becomes the whole world that you\u2019re viewing \u2026 then all the different factions take on a bigger role. So yeah, I think my family \u2014 usually, at least, it was definitely my attitude by the time I got to college that individuals are one thing. You talk to people and everybody can be anything and their race is not going to predict an individual\u2019s life or anything about them. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re talking about millions of people that this becomes a defining aspect of humanity.In reality it is white supremacy. It\u2019s just that they wouldn\u2019t see it that way. I never saw it that way. My dad \u2014 I genuinely believe, who I know very well \u2014 does not believe that he is doing something bad to other people. That does not make it untrue, but a lot of these people don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re actually hurting other people by their policies.M.B.: He instead believes what that he\u2019s doing something for himself?D.B.: He believes that for white people to exist and live and have a country like America was before 1950, everybody needs to be the same color and be together because, race is a real, genetic thing that predicts all this stuff like intelligence and ability, that race is so real that every race in the world should be separated. Saying this and living as I do now sounds delusional, but it is possible for somebody to believe and think that it makes sense.M.B.: Derek, can you take me to 2008 and President Obama\u2019s election? I don\u2019t know exactly how old you were at that moment but do you remember where you were and what you were doing around that time?D.B.: In 2008, I was 19 and at the same time as Obama was heading to winning the presidency I had also submitted my name for this local Republican executive committee election which was county level, and I won that. I got 60 percent of the vote.After he won, David Duke, my godfather, organized a conference for I think it was the weekend after the election. And I went up there \u2026 and it was pandemonium. I knew people who were sobbing, and saying that now there\u2019s never going to be another white president again, and that the country is lost, thinking they had to make contingency plans. The thinking of white nationalist leaders at the time was that Barack Obama has won, but now that he\u2019s won, you\u2019re going to have a huge white backlash against this. And so it became this meeting to try to figure out how to make the movement bigger while he\u2019s president.I had just won that little Republican position, so I was very encouraged that if we told people all the white nationalist talking points, without necessarily saying that we\u2019re white nationalists, that we could win elections. Whether they\u2019re little county things like that or maybe even larger ones.M.B.: My whole talk was the fact that you could run as Republicans, and say things like we need to shut down immigration, we need to fight affirmative action, we need to end globalism, and you could win these positions, maybe as long as you didn\u2019t get outed as a white nationalist and get all the controversy that comes along with it.M.B.: So the Republican Party which had just lost to Barack Obama, your argument was that it could be the vehicle for the mainstreaming of white nationalism or white supremacy?D.B.: Yeah, my thinking at the time was that all this backlash, which we eventually did see of white people against having a black president, would have to go into the Republican Party. Because America is a two party system, and the Republican Party would become the white people\u2019s party.M.B.: Hmm.M.B.: Then you went to college, so tell me about that.D.B.: In 2010, I moved across the state and started college at this little liberal arts college in Florida, which was about three and a half hours from home and it was the first time that I had lived away from home. Nobody knew who I was and I did not volunteer who I was or anything about my background, I made friends, hung out with people and played my guitar on my balcony in my dorm. It was nice to come back from class and be able to talk about history or philosophy or whatever other subject and be around other people.M.B.: Hmm.D.B.: I\u2019d get up in the morning, and call into my dad\u2019s radio show \u2026 and talk about the news \u2026 and then go to class and hang out with people who were often strong social justice advocates, and trying to live both of those lives was terrifying because I knew that one day somebody was going to type my name into Google.There was this one really memorable moment where I was sitting in the cafeteria and talking to some people I knew, and one of them discovered this website Stormfront \u2026 which is the site that my dad ran and that I had a kid\u2019s page on and I that had run the internet radio on for years \u2014 and was still running while I was in school, even though I didn\u2019t have as much time for it.And guy sitting across from me found the Lord of the Rings section and showed everybody, and turned around and said, \u201cCan you believe these people are trying to get Lord of the Rings nerds into white nationalism? Isn\u2019t this insane?\u201dAnd I had founded that section because when movies came out I got super into it, and I figured you could get people who liked with such a white mythos, a few turned on by white nationalism, and more mundanely just wanted to talk about movies, so I had found that 10 years earlier, guy turned it around and I pretended I had never heard of it.M.B.: Huh, you just acted as if you had no role in itD.B.: I was like, \u201cWhat is that? what is Stormfront?\u201dM.B.: And so then of course \u2026 inevitably it happens. You\u2019re found out. The student forum explodes, and you\u2019re shunned on campus for a time. But then you get an invitation, right? Tell me about that.D.B.: I had a friend on campus who I had gotten to know during my first semester when nobody knew who I was, he was an observant Jew who had Shabbat dinners pretty regularly whenever he was in town on Friday night and he would invite people of atheists and all sorts of different religions. It was just a nice dinner. And so he actually invited me to one of the Shabbats, and I knew him, and so I brought wine.M.B.: Even after learning what he did about you?D.B.: Yeah, he did. He had read my posts on Stormfront going back years \u2014 even the stuff when I was a teenager \u2014 and he doubted that he was going to convince me of anything, he just wanted to let me see a Jewish community thing so that if I was going to keep saying these anti-Semitic things that at least I had seen real Jews.It was ultimately in private conversations with a person I met at the Shabbat dinners \u2026 we would talk about things. Not only white nationalism, but eventually white nationalism. And I would say, \u201cThis is what I believe about I.Q. differences, I have 12 different studies that have been published over the years, here\u2019s the journal that\u2019s put this stuff together, I believe that this is true, that race predicts I.Q. and that there were I.Q. differences in races.\u201d And they would come back with 150 more recent, more well researched studies and explain to me how statistics works and we would go back and forth until I would come to the end of that argument and I\u2019d say, Yes that makes sense, that does not hold together and I\u2019ll remove that from my ideological toolbox but everything else is still there. And we did that over a year or two on one thing after another until I got to a point where I didn\u2019t believe it anymore.M.B.: So as you and this friend are going around and around and your mind is changing about this, what\u2019s the definitive moment where you make a decision and do something about it?D.B.: It was really this letter over the summer of 2013, and I sent it to the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2026 which is an organization my entire life that had been the enemy. They had come after my mother, they had constantly written articles about my father, they had tried to get his website taken down \u2014 they had been one of the biggest opponents of my family for my entire life.M.B.: And then you turned to them as somebody who would disseminate this letter you wrote?D.B.: I did \u2026 I turned to them to publish my letter because I knew that their intelligence report was the most widely read thing in the white nationalist world \u2026 more so than any white nationalist publication, this was like the gossip mag that the white nationalist world turned to to find out what everybody else was doing. And by sticking my letter on their website, I knew that every white nationalist would see it and every anti-racist would hear about it. The audience was in a lot of ways my own family. I wanted them to know that I understood what we believed, and I was systematically disbelieving each point. And then I just sent it and they published it and when it came out \u2026 my dad called me up in the morning and said, \u201cI think you\u2019ve been hacked, I think your email was hacked and somebody sent this letter.\u201dM.B.: Wow, he didn\u2019t believe you\u2019d written it.D.B.: No, we hadn\u2019t talked about my beliefs changing. At first he was incredibly sad. He called me a few days after I had written the letter, it was the first time we talked since he first called to tell me he thought I had been hacked, and it was just this sad moment where he said, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it and it\u2019s really hurting me. I think it might not have been a good idea to have a son \u2026 if this is the pain that\u2019s going to come from it.\u201dM.B.: Whoa. He said that he wondered whether it was a good idea to have had a son because of the shame he felt because you had written the letter and rejected everything he stood for?And I could understand it \u2026 he called again later that day and said I shouldn\u2019t have said that I\u2019m sorry. And then we started talking bit by bit. I made the argument that family and political beliefs should not be the same thing and aren\u2019t the same thing. He came back at the time with the case that there is nothing in your life experience that would suggest that our family is not a political family, we believe these things. That is the basis of our family the idea that you could be anti white nationalist and that wouldn\u2019t affect your relationship to the family is not going to work. It was how we connected it\u2019s what kept us together.M.B.: Right. This sounds unbelievably painful.D.B.: It was.M.B.: When\u2019s the last time you spoke with him?D.B.: Not since before Charlottesville. Not since all this.My big revelation when I left this movement and no longer talked to anybody in the movement was that most people don\u2019t talk about race very often. And so I came to the conclusion that white nationalism is a fringe movement and everybody is aware that it should be a fringe movement, Barack Obama is the president he\u2019ll make sure that it stays, remains a fringe movement and I\u2019ll just try to quietly fade away and never talk about this again and the future will be fine.D.B.: So to begin with, I think it\u2019s very important to understand that from the perspective of white nationalists, it\u2019s basically the definition of the movement that you\u2019re working against the establishment. And that\u2019s what every white nationalist event is \u2014 it is very easy for the local politicians to condemn it and you expect them to condemn it and there\u2019s nothing else that you would dream might happen. It\u2019s something that people are proud of \u2026 that you are working even though everybody says you shouldn\u2019t. And so that\u2019s the context. And all the usual condemnations came from everybody else.People in Congress, governors, mayors \u2026 people who just wanted to get in their condemnations because everyone knows it\u2019s extremely easy to condemn a white nationalist rally. And then on Saturday it was weird that he didn\u2019t, everybody took that as a huge victory there were tweets, people commenting online, that\u2019s very new, but Tuesday just took my breath away. I was sitting in a coffee shop and I thought the news from this was done when I read that he had come back and he said there were good people in the white nationalist rally and he salvaged their message.M.B.: What do you mean when you say he salvaged their message?D.B.: The message they were trying to get out was that tearing down Robert E. Lee\u2019s statue is an assault on white culture, so if you think that tearing down Robert E. Lee\u2019s statue is the wrong choice, then these are your guys that these are the people who are willing to say it but then amidst all the violence and the chaos I think that got lost. You\u2019re not going to follow these people even if you believe that.And in his message saying that these were good people because they\u2019re fighting for something that a lot of people believe in, he salvaged the message that they wanted to spread which is that if you believe this too and maybe you\u2019re on the edge about whether this is a fringe movement or not, Donald Trump thinks we\u2019re fine. I don\u2019t think the whole world reads it that way but within the white nationalist movement and anyone who was thinking maybe this might be a movement for me, suddenly being at that that rally becomes a historical moment. // What they wanted to do is blow apart that context. To say that if you think Lee statue should stay up, there\u2019s no distinction between what you believe and what a white nationalist believes, and it felt like he was agreeing with them.M.B.: What do you think the impact of that is having the president in your words salvage their message and make all right what they were doing there in the broader sense?I think Tuesday was the most important moment in the history of the modern white nationalist movement.M.B.: Wow.D.B.: It\u2019s impossible to say what will happen in the future, like maybe nothing. But if you were on the fence about whether to get involved in this stuff or not, the president\u2019s O.K. is the biggest thing that\u2019s ever happened. I don\u2019t want to be an alarmist and say this is a movement that\u2019s going to take over the world. But it\u2019s more precarious now than any point in my life on whether this thing as a movement and as a dangerous ideology grows because we don\u2019t seem to be as clear as we once were that we have to keep this suppressed we cannot let this be who we are.M.B.: I usually have a set of normal reactions in these interviews \u2026 and my vocabulary kind of fails me a little bit \u2026 so I acknowledge that ...D.B.: Sure \u2026 no, I understand, I\u2019m in this weird position these days where I have this background, I understand what people at these events and rallies are thinking, but I also know what I know now my experiences and so I can see on one hand where something is horrifying, and on the other, I\u2019m looking at it and wondering why they organize the event like that, why they were so kind of gauche to have swastika flags flying \u2026 and weren\u2019t they worried about the messaging and then I come back and say, what is happening to my country\u2026 I have these two experiences, and I have a lot of trouble reconciling them sometimes. As I try to deal with events this week I wonder how much the fact that being in my family and other people I knew were willing to push to try to get people who were maybe on the fence or maybe thought they were being discriminated against or that they kids couldn\u2019t get into college because of affirmative action and try to push them a little bit more and try to get them a little but more angry. However much of an effect that had I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t know.M.B.: It sounds like you\u2019ve given some thought to your own role in this.D.B.: It\u2019s something I think about everyday, I think.M.B.: Derek, you know this I\u2019m sure, there are still pictures of you online as a child attending various far right white nationalist white supremacist conferences, and you\u2019ve got a little hat on. And you are in it. I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t go back and look, but what do you think when you look back at those images and that version of yourself?D.B.: I\u2019m always very conflicted \u2026 that I\u2019ve come to terms with myself, I\u2019m not too much filled with deep shame all the time. Because I don\u2019t know what else I could do. What I wanted to do what would have been more comfortable what I really wanted to do was just leave, never say anything again, disappear off the face of the earth pretend that I had never lived the life that I lived and didn\u2019t know anything about white nationalism and never be heard from again\u2026 and it was a few more tough conversations that convinced me that wasn\u2019t enough because I\u2019d actually done harm \u2026 I tried to follow the beliefs that my father has that if you think there is a danger to our society you should do something. And I don\u2019t want to be involved with this stuff but I just want to try to offer context sometimes because I think that is hard to understand what this movement is and how somebody could be a part of this movement and also offer that perspective of how you can realize you\u2019re doing something really bad.M.B.: Sounds like you\u2019re following your father\u2019s beliefs, just not the way he intended for you.D.B.: I don\u2019t know if he sees it that way, but sometimes I do.M.B.: Derek, Thank you very, very much I really appreciate that.D.B.: Thanks.M.B.: Bye.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Was the Alt-Right\u2019s Favorite Chat App. Then Came Charlottesville.", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThey posted swastikas and praised Hitler in chat rooms with names like \u201cNational Socialist Army\u201d and \u201cF\u00fchrer\u2019s Gas Chamber.\u201d They organized last weekend\u2019s \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Va., connecting several major white supremacy groups for an intimidating display of force. And when that rally turned deadly, with the killing of a 32-year-old counterdemonstrator, they cheered and discussed holding a gathering at the woman\u2019s funeral.For two months before the Charlottesville rally, I embedded with a large group of white nationalists on Discord, a group chat app that was popular among far-right activists. I lurked silently and saw these activists organize themselves into a cohesive coalition, and interviewed a number of moderators and members about how they used the service to craft and propagate their messages.I also asked Discord executives what, if anything, they planned to do about the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who had set up shop on their platform and were using it to spread their ideology. Several said they were aware of the issue, but had no concrete plans to crack down on any extremist groups.On Monday, Discord finally took action, banning several of the largest alt-right Discord communities and taking away one of the white nationalist movement\u2019s key communication tools.\u201cWe unequivocally condemn white supremacy, neo-Nazism, or any other group, term, ideology that is based on these beliefs,\u201d said Eros Resmini, Discord\u2019s chief marketing officer, in a statement announcing the bans. \u201cThey are not welcome on Discord.\u201dThe alt-right, as the loose constellation of far-right political groups that includes white nationalists and neo-Nazis is known, uses many mainstream tech platforms to distribute its message: Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube for recruiting and public broadcasting, Reddit and 4Chan for lighthearted memes and trolling, and, until Monday, Discord for private group communication. Many of these companies resisted efforts to cut off the activists, arguing that as long as their activities weren\u2019t illegal, they were simply using the tools as any others would.Partly, these are self-preservation instincts kicking in \u2014 no company wants to end up like Reddit, which has struggled to shake its reputation as a den of toxicity \u2014 but it is also indicative of an emerging consensus around the moral responsibilities of tech platforms.Like most platforms, Discord never meant to become a virtual home of the alt-right. It started in 2015 as a chat app for video gamers, where fans of games like World of Warcraft could form teams and talk about strategy. Over the next several years, as gamers invited their friends to the app, it became one of the hottest start-ups in Silicon Valley, growing to more than 45 million members and raising nearly $100 million from top tech investors.But Discord also attracted far-right political groups, whose members were drawn to the app\u2019s privacy and anonymity features. Discord allows users to form private, invitation-only chat groups invisible to those outside the app, and it allows a high degree of anonymity, making it an ideal choice for people looking to avoid detection or surveillance. Perhaps most importantly, it is largely self-policed \u2014 administrators of servers, as Discord\u2019s group chat rooms are known, set their own rules and are responsible for keeping their members in line.Leaders like Richard Spencer, who is credited with coining the term \u201calt-right,\u201d and Andrew Anglin, the editor of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, used Discord to discuss current events and debate movement strategy. These discussions were not always harmonious, and often featured infighting and disagreement over tactics and cooperation with older and less internet-savvy groups like the Ku Klux Klan and Vanguard America. But Discord became a private sounding board for the movement, and over time, Discord groups devoted to far-right politics \u2014 including one where newcomers were required to show proof of Caucasian skin before being given posting privileges \u2014 swelled to thousands of members.In the days leading up to the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, Discord proved that it could be an indispensable organizing tool. White nationalists used alt-right Discord servers to form car pools to Charlottesville and arrange local lodging. On the eve of the protest, one Discord user posted a poem written to commemorate the gathering, titled \u201cThe Fire Rises.\u201d (Sample stanza: \u201cA brotherhood of white man\u2019s will / against Jews and their disguises. / And we will march on Charlottesville / as the fire rises.\u201d) And on Saturday, after the protest had ended with three people dead and more injured, the moderator of one Discord server declared the rally a success, posting: \u201cHail victory! Hail our people!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s become a central communication interface for the white nationalist and neo-Nazi movements,\u201d said Keegan Hankes, an analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that studies right-wing extremist groups. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unavoidable to be a leader in this movement without participating in Discord.\u201dJosh Elman, a Discord board member and investor with Greylock Partners, told me before the Charlottesville rally that Discord was analogous to a chat app like Skype or iMessage, and said that it had fewer responsibilities to patrol for hateful content than a public-facing social network.\u201cIt\u2019s basically a private email group,\u201d he said.Reached after Discord\u2019s decision to ban alt-right groups, Mr. Elman said, \u201cI believe every communication channel \u2014 public or private \u2014 has a responsibility to investigate and take action on any reports of misuse including harassment, inciting violence or hate, and other abuse.\u201dSome white nationalists see Discord\u2019s actions as part of a greater \u201cno-platform\u201d movement, in which tech companies systematically take away the digital tools that activists use to generate attention and organize their activities. In response to being kicked off services like PayPal and Patreon, a crowdfunding site, several far-right groups have begun creating alternative platforms, where extreme views will be tolerated.One moderator of an alt-right Discord server that was banned on Monday, Nathan Gate, who goes by the username TheBigKK, told me that Discord users were \u201cleaving in droves\u201d in search of a more hospitable platform.\u201cDiscord started out as a great service but unfortunately it looks as though we will have to move,\u201d he said.Another right-wing Discord moderator, who goes by Based, said that his server, a large pro-Trump group called \u201cCentipede Central\u201d that is still active, would have to be more careful to police its users going forward.\u201cWe\u2019re a little on pins and needles,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause Discord has shown they\u2019re willing to nuke servers.\u201dModeration on the internet is an endless cat-and-mouse game, and it\u2019s a near-certainty that without Discord as a safe haven, white nationalists will organize themselves somewhere else. Just hours after Discord shut down their servers, several alt-right users were already attempting to form new rooms, and others were suggesting alternative chat apps that might be friendlier to their views.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Get Rich in Trump\u2019s Washington", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "FeatureHis presidency has changed the rules of influence in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and spawned a new breed of lobbyist on K Street.Supported byStryk, who owned a lobbying firm so small it didn\u2019t actually have an office, spent most of his time in California and owned a small vineyard in Oregon, and he had helped out the Trump campaign as a sort of informal West Coast hand. He was still reveling in Trump\u2019s upset win two nights later, over a bottle of wine on the patio of the Four Seasons in Georgetown, when a chocolate Lab padded over to his table to sniff his crotch. Stryk and the dog\u2019s owner got to talking about wine and cigars and finally, like most of the country, about Trump. It turned out that she worked for New Zealand\u2019s Embassy in Washington. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister still hadn\u2019t connected with the new president-elect, she told Stryk \u2014 a diplomatic and political embarrassment. Stryk cocked an eye across the table. \u2018\u2018What if I said I could get you the number of someone to call the president?\u2019\u2019 he asked her.The following afternoon, Stryk found himself in a cab, headed for a meeting with New Zealand\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser. Stryk was more than a little nervous. On the way over, he called a friend named Stuart Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran Trump\u2019s field operation during the Republican primary and spent election night with Stryk at Morton\u2019s. Jolly reached out to someone he knew in the Trump high command and delivered a cell number, but Stryk didn\u2019t know if it would actually work. At the embassy, Groser invited him in, uncorked a bottle of pinot noir and called the prime minister to pass along the number. A week later, President-elect Trump was finally able to accept a congratulatory phone call. But even before the call went through, plans and possibilities were blooming in Stryk\u2019s mind. \u2018\u2018I said to myself: \u2018This could be very, very interesting,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he told me when I first met him this spring. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The world\u2019s going to change.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Stryk, who grew up in Arizona, had bounced around the minor leagues of politics for most of his adult life. At 41, he has the frenetic energy of a serial entrepreneur and the motley r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to match. After dropping out of college to intern on Capitol Hill, Stryk wrote voter-contact scripts for a Republican P.R. firm, helped start a political job-listing website and eventually opened his own Beltway lobbying shop, Sonoran Policy Group. The firm almost collapsed in 2009, after Stryk tried to acquire a troubled Maryland-based security-guard business. Stryk decamped to California, owing thousands of dollars in back rent, and reinvented S.P.G. as a procurement and political-consulting business. He traded tequila shots with the California congressman Dana Rohrabacher, ran for mayor of a town in Napa Valley, handled P.R. for an arms dealer accused of smuggling weapons to Libya \u2014 the case was dropped last fall \u2014 and helped clients sell the government everything from flashlights to missile-guidance software. By the time he hooked up with the Trump campaign, Stryk had hustled his way to a good living, and he knew his way around Washington. But he was no one\u2019s idea of a Beltway insider.When the phone call to Trump went through, Stryk saw the geography of a new world forming before his eyes. Interests that spent millions of dollars studying Washington and shaping it to their liking had been taken totally by surprise by Trump\u2019s win. The rules had changed, and no one was sure what the new ones were. For Stryk, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for. As he saw it, the lobbying old guard \u2014 the guys that threw down black Amex cards at Joe\u2019s Crab and sent fat quarterly bills to clients they barely did any work for \u2014 were on the defensive. New people would have a chance. People like Stryk.New Zealand was a prime example. Groser and his staff had spent months researching Hillary Clinton, calculating who among her vast claque would win positions of power and influence in her administration. The main thing they knew about Trump was that he had sworn to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the complex 12-nation trade deal that Groser helped negotiate. Stryk, offering to work free, had a proposal. New Zealand would throw the biggest party of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Stryk would put the new administration\u2019s leading lights in the room; Groser would do the rest. \u2018\u2018It was about building brand recognition for New Zealand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk explained. \u2018\u2018If we can get them there, then forever, bad or good, Trump and New Zealand are a co-brand.\u2019\u2019In the tumult following Trump\u2019s win, Stryk was discovering that many of his old friends \u2014 most of them fellow Washington backbenchers, B-listers and understudies \u2014 had vaulted to positions of unexpected influence. A guy Stryk knew at the inaugural committee put out the word among Trump alums that New Zealand\u2019s party was the week\u2019s hot ticket. Stryk called a friend at Salem Media, the right-leaning media-and-talk-radio company, which signed on as a party sponsor. Another friend, the actor Jon Voight, agreed to attend as a special celebrity guest.Groser decided to hire Stryk full time. Not long after, Stryk pulled $250,000 out of his savings, moved his family to the Washington suburbs and started hiring.Over the decades, lobbying has evolved from a niche trade of fixers and gatekeepers to a sleek, vertically integrated, $3-billion-a-year industry. A good lobbyist doesn\u2019t go into a meeting asking for legislation; she or he already has the bill drafted, a coalition of businesses and trade groups poised to support it, a policy brief to hand out to reporters and to the officials positioned at dozens of decision points throughout the bureaucracy and relationships with advertising and polling firms to manage the public rollout. Everyone has a lobbyist \u2014 or three, or 50 \u2014 and the lobbyists know everyone. K Street is majestic and immovable, veined through Washington like fat through a prime steak.Like virtually every other candidate for president, Trump campaigned against this thicket of money and influence, positioning himself as an outsider who would \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 This pledge would soon prove more rhetorical than real, but it contained a grain of truth. Trump arrived in Washington with a relatively short baggage train of Beltway relationships and obligations. He didn\u2019t read policy briefs; he barely had policies. His inner circle was a hodgepodge of Breitbart alumni, nominally Democratic financiers, Trump Organization employees on loan, the odd reality-show star and Republicans who would have been unemployable in almost any other administration. The smart money in Washington \u2014 K Street and K Street\u2019s clients, the big corporations and trade associations \u2014 didn\u2019t quite know what to expect. But mostly, they didn\u2019t know whom to call.\u2018\u2018Many companies want to understand: What are the president\u2019s priorities?\u2019\u2019 Corey Lewandowski told me in February, a few weeks after the inauguration. \u2018\u2018But there are so few people in Washington who have a relationship or an understanding of him.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski, the president\u2019s former campaign manager, was happy to tell you that he was one of the few exceptions.Lewandowski\u2019s journey from obscure New Hampshire political operative to celebrity power broker was emblematic of how Trump\u2019s election scrambled Washington\u2019s hierarchies. Much like Stryk, Lewandowski had spent years in the lower ranks of conservative politics and lobbying. Being hired as Trump\u2019s campaign manager moved Lewandowski into the political big time, and being fired, midway through the race, did little to dislodge him. There were speaking gigs, a stint as a reliably pro-Trump pundit on CNN. At one point last year, Lewandowski even tried selling a book, tentatively titled \u2018\u2018Let Trump Be Trump\u2019\u2019; Stryk, introduced to Lewandowski by a mutual friend, helped him shop the proposal. \u2018\u2018Corey had a brand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me, and that brand was valuable. HarperCollins offered Lewandowski $1.2 million, an astounding figure for a campaign manager \u2014 though the deal evaporated when Lewandowski refused to show HarperCollins a copy of his nondisclosure agreement with Trump.Through it all, Lewandowski remained close to Trump and spoke to him often. But after the election, the White House job Lewandowski hoped for never quite materialized. Now Lewandowski, too, was on K Street. He had joined up with another former Trump aide, Barry Bennett, to start a lobbying firm called Avenue Strategies.Unlike other people on K Street, Lewandowski did not pretend to be an expert on the legislative calendar or the fine points of the Administrative Procedure Act. He was an expert on Trump. \u2018\u2018There are just so few people in Washington who know the president,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski told me in February. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a comparative advantage.\u2019\u2019 He was not shy about playing up their friendship. He sometimes tweeted from the White House grounds. When journalists or other visitors came to his office, on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House, he would point out his window to where, he claimed, he could see the president\u2019s bedroom.His mind-meld with Trump was what made him valuable to clients, Lewandowski explained to me. \u2018\u2018I think what I bring is a level of understanding of the president\u2019s thought process,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018only because I had the privilege of being next to him for so long.\u2019\u2019 He was doing as many as nine or 10 meetings a day: Chief executives, prominent Republicans, even other lobbying firms wanted his advice. He offered it freely, Lewandowski told me. He wanted to be helpful. \u2018\u2018You know what a guy said to me the other day?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You\u2019ve got a hot hand. Just remember, that hand\u2019s not going to be hot forever.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019One good source of business was the president\u2019s habit of calling chief executives to the White House for televised meetings. In January, when the chief executive of Whirlpool was summoned by Trump to discuss how to revive American jobs, the company asked Avenue Strategies to advise it. As one lobbyist who shared clients with Lewandowski put it to me, companies like Whirlpool needed to know the lay of the land inside the White House: How much sway did Wilbur Ross have? Was Steve Bannon for real? And what should the company do if Trump started dumping on it on Twitter?Everyone had seen what happened to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed, the federal government\u2019s single biggest contractor, is a powerful presence inside the Beltway. But through the winter, Trump had lashed out at the company over cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet. The company\u2019s shares dropped each time, taking Lockheed\u2019s value down by billions of dollars. These were the kinds of problems that Lewandowski believed others on K Street couldn\u2019t help with. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re a corporate C.E.O. and the president has tweeted at you and your stock has dropped 4 percent, you say: \u2018Why am I paying all these guys so much money?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said. The old model of Washington influence wouldn\u2019t work on Trump, he believed. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t know him, and they don\u2019t know any of his guys, and they don\u2019t understand how he thinks.\u2019\u2019 Eventually Lockheed, too, turned to Avenue.Over the course of a few conversations with the company\u2019s Washington office, Bennett told me, they advised Lockheed on how Marillyn Hewson, its president and chief executive, should approach conversations: \u2018\u2018Short, direct, honest answers,\u2019\u2019 as Bennett recounted it for me later. \u2018\u2018Feel free to educate the president. In the end, it\u2019s going to be transactional.\u2019\u2019 The next time Hewson met with Trump, a week before the inauguration, she came bearing gifts: a potential F-35 price cut and a promise to add jobs at a Texas plant.The Twitter attacks ceased. By the end of February, Trump was praising Lockheed. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve just announced eighteen hundred new jobs,\u2019\u2019 Trump told reporters after a meeting with Hewson and other manufacturing executives. \u2018\u2018I have to say this, Marillyn, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit because what you did was the right thing.\u2019\u2019The demand was so great that would-be Trump-whisperers were popping up in Washington like toadstools after a rainstorm. The former Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, a \u2018\u2018senior adviser\u2019\u2019 to the lobbying practice at Dentons, the world\u2019s largest law firm, was hawking a book titled \u2018\u2018Understanding Trump.\u2019\u2019 Established K Street firms were grabbing any Trump people they could find: Jim Murphy, Trump\u2019s former political director, joined the lobbying giant BakerHostetler, while another firm, Fidelis Government Relations, struck up a partnership with Bill Smith, Mike Pence\u2019s former chief of staff. All told, close to 20 ex-aides of Trump, friends and hangers-on had made their way into Washington\u2019s influence business.Beltway experience was not necessarily required. Squire Patton Boggs formed a \u2018\u2018strategic alliance\u2019\u2019 with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s self-described \u2018\u2018personal attorney\u2019\u2019 from New York, who had scant government experience. There was also Brad Gerstman, a brawny Long Island lobbyist and P.R. man who had done work for Trump in New York over the years. On election night, Gerstman was so sure Trump was going to lose that he got on a plane to Israel. As Gerstman tells it, his business partner called as soon as he landed. \u2018\u2018Why the hell are you in Tel Aviv?\u2019\u2019 his partner asked. \u2018\u2018We have an office to open in Washington.\u2019\u2019 Gerstman hung up and went to his hotel, where he looked out over the Mediterranean, put a cigar in his mouth and listened to the congratulatory messages piled up in his voice mail. In January, he set up an office in downtown Washington. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t want to sell ourselves as just the Trump guys,\u2019\u2019 Gerstman told me. \u2018\u2018But maybe that\u2019s what it takes for the first few years.\u2019\u2019Many of the Trump-connected lobbyists told me they were turning away as much business as they accepted. One person offered Lewan\u00addowski $250,000 just to get the president to tweet about him. A lobbyist who worked on Trump\u2019s inaugural committee told me of a billionaire who, within a week of the inauguration, offered a million dollars if the lobbyist could arrange for his picture to be taken in the Oval Office with the new president. \u2018\u2018You can make $2 million if you want,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me, sounding almost apologetic. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gold mine in Eastern Europe.\u2019 Or: \u2018My client is suing the I.R.S. \u2014 can you help?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Not all of the new arrivals affected to be part of a revolution. One day this spring, I met with Brian Ballard, a veteran Florida lobbyist and top-tier Republican fund-raiser. Ballard had recently opened an office in Washington just a few blocks from the new Trump International Hotel. He had known Trump since the 1980s, and he later started lobbying regulators and state officials on behalf of Trump\u2019s golf courses and his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, but he was practical about the realities of politics. Like most of Florida\u2019s Republican old guard, he started the 2016 campaign backing the state\u2019s former governor, Jeb Bush, before switching to the state\u2019s junior senator, Marco Rubio. Once it became clear that Trump would lead the Republican ticket, Ballard enthusiastically joined the campaign as Trump\u2019s Florida finance chairman.Ballard, who is 56, had a ruddy Florida tan that marked him as new in town, and the serene confidence of a man who saw no way he could lose. At his office, an attractive receptionist led us into a spotless conference room. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not an expert in Washington, D.C.,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me when we sat down. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m an expert in lobbying.\u2019\u2019 In Florida, Ballard had a blue-chip list of corporate clients: Google, pharmaceutical companies, Big Sugar. His business plan was simple: to sign up his Florida clients for Trump-related advice in Washington. \u2018\u2018When I was on the campaign, they didn\u2019t want to pitch in,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of his clients. \u2018\u2018And now they say: \u2018How do I figure out what is going on here?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019By the end of his first 100 days in office, it seemed, Trump had not so much drained the swamp as enshrouded it with a billowing fog of uncertainty. No previous president had changed his mind more often, or contradicted his cabinet so frequently, or permitted such vicious ideological combat under his White House roof. Many clients just wanted to know what they could safely ignore. \u2018\u2018White Houses are always somewhat opaque places of fascination, where you don\u2019t quite know who is up and who is down, or how decisions are ultimately reached,\u2019\u2019 said Bruce P. Mehlman, a prominent Republican lobbyist who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u2018\u2018The added complexity here was there was not a single consistent governing philosophy. It was not clear if the president saw trade the way that Gary Cohn sees it or the way Steve Bannon sees it.\u2019\u2019Moreover, some of the usual paths through the bog were now closed. Hundreds of senior administration jobs were going unfilled, as Trump\u2019s cabinet secretaries battled with his inner circle over potential hires from among the Republican regulars in Washington. One lobbyist at a well-regarded firm with numerous financial clients told me that his problem was less that he didn\u2019t know whom to call than that there was no one to call: Infighting and vetting problems had stymied so many appointments at the Treasury Department that many of the offices were empty.All of this had inadvertently created an entirely new business model for Trump\u2019s friends and former employees. In normal times, K Street did much of its business on Capitol Hill, where the churn of legislation offered unending opportunity to deliver goodies for clients. But the power vacuum in Trump\u2019s cabinet agencies, and the inexperience of his West Wing staff, seemed to offer a different kind of opening. It was easy to imagine that a single phone call, coming from the right person, could redirect a major policy initiative. Some of the old firms would do O.K., Lewandowski thought \u2014 the ones that had relationships in Congress, that understood the intricate ballet of lawmaking. But the real action, he was betting, would be at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018I think this particular administration is really going to be driving the agenda,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Not Congress.\u2019\u2019On a balmy spring day in April, I met Stryk and a few of his colleagues on a terrace at the Army-Navy Country Club, a sprawling and immaculate golf club near the Pentagon; S.P.G. still didn\u2019t have a proper office. Stryk wore cowboy boots and a T-shirt under a rumpled black sport coat. Most of K Street, he told me, was \u2018\u2018a washing machine. Money just goes from one firm to another. No one creates any new wealth.\u2019\u2019 Stryk\u2019s own politics leaned libertarian, he told me; despite his firm\u2019s ties to the Trump team, he didn\u2019t think of himself as particularly Trumpy. One of the new hires, a Democratic foreign-policy veteran, had been good friends with Paul Wellstone, the liberal senator who died in 2002. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re here for the opportunities,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Not for the ideology.\u2019\u2019Stryk was focusing not on nervous companies but on nervous countries. He and his new team had made a list of the governments S.P.G. wanted to work for \u2014 NATO allies mostly, nothing iffy like Ukraine or Pakistan \u2014 and with New Zealand as his calling card, they pitched S.P.G. as the go-to foreign lobbying and advisory firm in Trump\u2019s Washington. Historically, foreign lobbying has been a specialized business dominated by a few big firms. Stryk viewed them as he viewed the rest of the lobbying industry: as a cartel ripe for disruption. Stryk pitched his clients policy expertise, round-the-clock work habits and personalized service.Stryk believed his team could penetrate the uncertainty surrounding the White House. He wanted to be a \u2018\u2018calming resource for foreign countries and businesses,\u2019\u2019 he told me \u2014 and there was a lot of calming to do. Over the course of a few months, the new president had managed to start a trade war with Canada, picked a fight with the prime minister of Australia and hinted that the United States might need to pull out of NATO. He also wanted to slash the State Department budget, and through the spring and summer, many senior jobs at State would remain unfilled. Everyone, even close allies, was looking for Sherpas and back doors. R. Nicholas Burns, the veteran American diplomat, told me that Trump\u2019s denuded State Department had left diplomats from perhaps a hundred countries \u2014 most of them smaller nations \u2014 without their traditional liaison to the United States government. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s never been anything like this, ever,\u2019\u2019 Burns said.Trump\u2019s statecraft had a way of generating new business in other ways, too. The president of the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, was not a popular figure in Barack Obama\u2019s Washington: A right-wing populist who preached closer ties to Russia, he once banned the United States ambassador from Prague Castle, the Czech seat of government. Trump, naturally, invited him to Washington, and Zeman\u2019s government hired Stryk\u2019s firm to help plan the state visit. New Zealand needed to talk to the administration about a new bilateral trade agreement, now that Trump was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Korean trade association wanted help planning a conference in Washington but didn\u2019t know anyone in the Trump White House. Stryk\u2019s people got on the phone, cold-calling around the Commerce Department to find a senior official who would speak at the event. \u2018\u2018Most lobbyists are afraid of a \u2018no,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018A \u2018no\u2019 means you have no juice. I\u2019m not afraid of \u2018no.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019But Stryk\u2019s greatest coup was Saudi Arabia. Gulf-state oligarchs spend tens of millions of dollars a year lobbying in Washington and larding influential think tanks with grant money, and Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest spenders. The country\u2019s then-crown prince and minister of the interior, Mohammed bin Nayef, was an exception: He enjoyed deep ties to the American intelligence apparatus under President Obama and had never needed a lobbyist. This spring, however, Trump invited Nayef\u2019s chief rival \u2014 Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and the king\u2019s son \u2014 to a formal White House lunch. The lunch sent ripples through Riyadh. Did Trump favor Salman? Accidentally or on purpose, Trump had just waded into Saudi Arabia\u2019s treacherous succession politics. Nayef found himself in need of guidance.In May, S.P.G. signed a contract to provide \u2018\u2018congressional and executive branch brand engagement\u2019\u2019 to the Saudi Ministry of the Interior \u2014 Nayef\u2019s domain. Stryk did not want to reveal much about his work for the Saudis, but lobbying records show that the fee was $5.4 million, payable up front.That was the other thing about foreign lobbying: It paid even better than corporate lobbying. Inevitably, Stryk had competition.Basha was the young chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, the country\u2019s conservative party, which was looking to unseat the ruling Socialist Party in elections scheduled for June. Basha borrowed liberally from Trump\u2019s playbook; he had attacked the Socialists for being in bed with crime syndicates and, simultaneously, with George Soros, whose foundation was active in Albania. His slogan was \u2018\u2018Make Albania Great Again.\u2019\u2019 Now, according to Bennett, Basha wanted help beating the Socialists in June \u2014 and who better to advise him than a couple of Trump-campaign veterans? Bennett told me that it was a cordial meeting and that he later sent Basha a proposed contract. \u2018\u2018I told him we\u2019d love to be his political consultant,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said. (Through a representative, Basha declined to comment.)Through an intermediary, the Albanian Democrats also reached out to Ballard, who was making his own push into foreign lobbying. He had brought on board a couple of partners with experience in Eastern Europe and Latin America, including a former Democratic congressman and a former ambassador. \u2018\u2018They called me,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of Basha\u2019s party. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t know Albania in an atlas.\u2019\u2019 Ballard told them he couldn\u2019t help them. He was already working with the Albanian Socialists.When a friend referred the Socialists to him, Ballard told me, he had two questions. \u2018\u2018I asked: \u2018Is it a democracy?\u2019 Yes. \u2018Are they an ally of the U.S.?\u2019 Yes.\u2019\u2019 The Socialists had a story that was becoming increasingly familiar in Washington. After Trump won, most of the American diplomats their government had worked with seemed to vanish, and no one replaced them. One Albanian official, who asked not to be identified by name, told me his government felt that \u2018\u2018we had to increase our presence in Washington.\u2019\u2019 I asked him how his government picked Ballard. \u2018\u2018The internet makes it easy,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018You just Google.\u2019\u2019But as companies and countries vied for Trump\u2019s ear over the spring, the new Trump lobbyists found themselves competing with one another as much as with the established Washington firms. Ballard, for example, had explored working for members of the Venezuelan opposition. (\u2018\u2018I\u2019m no world-peace guy,\u2019\u2019 he told me, \u2018\u2018but I think I can help a little bit.\u2019\u2019) Lewan\u00addowski\u2019s firm, meanwhile, was pitching Citgo, the American subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company. (Avenue eventually signed Citgo, and in August the Trump administration would partly exempt the company from a new round of sanctions on the Venezuelan government.) Ballard was also working out a $1.5 million contract with Turkey \u2014 which put him up against Brad Gerstman, Trump\u2019s old New York guy. Gerstman\u2019s firm, Gotham Government Relations, had signed up a company linked to Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom the Turkish government blames for fomenting last year\u2019s failed coup.Not many lobbyists wanted to represent the Gulenists, partly because Trump appeared to have already picked a side. When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey won a widely disputed referendum in April granting himself expanded powers, Trump called to congratulate him. When Erdogan visited the White House some weeks later, Trump praised the bravery of Turkish soldiers and talked about beating ISIS together.I watched Erdogan and Trump\u2019s joint news conference on TV with Gerst\u00adman, who had been hired to spread the word about Erdogan\u2019s worldwide oppression of Gulenists. When Erdogan referred to the Gulen \u2018\u2018terrorist organization,\u2019\u2019 you could see Trump purse his lips during the translation, then nod a few times. It wasn\u2019t totally clear what the president was nodding about. Gerstman remained hopeful. \u2018\u2018Our view is that six months from now, everything is going to look different,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s fluid. It\u2019s dynamic.\u2019\u2019 He looked thoughtful. \u2018\u2018One thing we know about President Trump is he\u2019s not afraid to change.\u2019\u2019Stryk was having his own qualms. Lewandowski had beaten him on some pitches, Stryk was told by prospective clients, by promising that he could get Trump on the phone \u2014 a promise Stryk felt he could not make. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t sell access to Trump,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know Donald Trump.\u2019\u2019 He was increasingly impatient with the notion that he was simply providing entree to the new administration. He was in negotiations to acquire a small design and branding firm. He saw S.P.G. evolving into something bigger and more stable, a full-service \u2018\u2018advisory\u2019\u2019 company that could compete with the most sophisticated shops on K Street \u2014 and beyond. Stryk saw Lewandowski\u2019s firm, and some of the others associated with the new administration, as short-term plays. They could sell access or surf the disruption, but he aimed to outlast it. \u2018\u2018Do they have business outside of this Trump phenomenon?\u2019\u2019 Stryk mused. \u2018\u2018The talk around town is, how long does this last before the business goes back to the establishment?\u2019\u2019Among the new arrivals, Ballard, at least, was doing pretty well. After only a few months in Washington, he had signed up more than 30 clients: energy companies, insurers, Amazon, American Airlines. The new Washington office would soon be on track to make $15 million in 2017, almost as much as his firm reported making in Florida last year. Ballard, unlike some of his competitors, was at ease in the swamp. He didn\u2019t want to beat the Washington establishment; he was here to join it. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no big firm that should worry about us,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me. \u2018\u2018We augment other people, or they augment us. The Trump guys are not going to take over the town.\u2019\u2019If anything, the Trump guys were learning the downsides of proximity to the president. By spring, the Justice Department had appointed a special counsel to probe Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an investigation that would quickly reach into the president\u2019s inner circle. The various White House factions seemed to spend as much time planting negative press on one another as they did figuring out what the president should do. When the White House got involved in big legislative battles, like the Obamacare repeal effort, it tended to hurt, not help.Proximity was proving an especially mixed blessing for Lewandowski. A stream of news stories had detailed promises he was supposedly making to clients, which he mostly denied \u2014 not just phone calls with Trump but also visits with White House officials and even access to Trump\u2019s Twitter account. In late April, Politico reported that Lewan\u00addowski and Bennett also owned another, separate company called Washington East West Political Strategies. This new firm, a vehicle for overseas consulting, had circulated at least one written proposal promising to arrange meetings with Trump and other administration officials, seeming to undercut Lewandowski\u2019s earlier denials. I later obtained a copy of the proposal, which named the potential client: Edi Rama, Albania\u2019s Socialist prime minister. The new firm \u2014 or as Bennett later explained, a business associate in Europe, acting without authorization \u2014 had pitched opposing candidates in the same campaign.Official Washington professed itself to be aghast at Lewandowski, who did not bother to couch his sales pitches in the Beltway\u2019s customary euphemisms: He was what they pretended not to be. Ethics watchdogs cast him as living proof of the hollowness of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski disagreed. In his view, the swamp was the sprawling, unresponsive bureaucracy, not the people you paid to help you get your phone calls returned. Still, friends of Lewandowski\u2019s told me that White House officials had advised him to keep a lower profile.By that point, it was hard to know exactly how well Avenue was doing. As the summer recess drew near, the firm had disclosed fewer than 10 lobbying clients. Among them were a San Diego-based environmental consulting firm and an Ohio payday lender \u2014 valuable clients, but not quite blue-chip. For every Whirlpool that asked Lewandowski for help, his rivals told me, there was another big company that decided he was too radioactive. Lockheed never actually signed a contract with Avenue; when news leaked of Lewandowski\u2019s role in advising it on Trump, a Lockheed spokesman issued a carefully worded statement that \u2018\u2018Lockheed has not retained Lewandowski, or his lobbying firm.\u2019\u2019 In the same way that most big chief executives turned up their noses at Trump during the campaign but now hoped he would deliver tax reform and sweeping deregulation, they wanted Lewandowski\u2019s help without being too closely associated with him.Then, too, Lewandowski\u2019s clout wasn\u2019t always what he promised. Puerto Rico\u2019s government, for example, hired Avenue to help ease the island\u2019s fiscal crisis. But the job pitted Lewandow\u00adski against a coalition of hedge funds that owned much of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, and whose former lobbyist Trump had installed on his National Economic Council. The swamp\u2019s old guard prevailed: In late April, as Puerto Rican officials were begging Congress for more federal funding, Trump publicly dismissed their cause in his trademark fashion. \u2018\u2018Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars,\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2018\u2018Sad!\u2019\u2019In a sense, Lewandowski\u2019s biggest problem was the president himself. Lewandowski had bet that the White House would be the center of energy and action in Trump\u2019s Washington, but instead the Trump administration was being swallowed by its own chaos. Divided by factions and backbiting, unable to wield full control of the bureaucracy or execute on many of its own ambitions, the administration was in danger of becoming a minor player in the policy debates of the day. Many companies were coming to the conclusion that on complex issues like tax reform, their energies were better directed at lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2014 and their money better spent at the traditional lobbying firms stocked with ex-lawmakers and their former aides.Moreover, despite Trump\u2019s campaign pledges, many of the agencies he now oversaw had proved more than friendly to the legions of longtime Beltway lobbyists working for the energy, telecommunications and other industries. In many cases, Trump had hired them outright: By the summer, he had appointed more than 100 lobbyists to jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Federal Communications Commission and elsewhere. Their old clients didn\u2019t need much help from the new Trump guys on K Street. They already knew exactly whom to call.Perhaps that\u2019s why the traditional lobbying shops were doing just fine. As for protecting clients from Trump\u2019s Twitter howitzer \u2014 well, that had turned out to be easier than it looked, several lobbyists told me: Just show up in person, promise the president you\u2019ll create some jobs and publicly give him the credit. \u2018\u2018You make it about Trump and you link it to jobs, and you could be Russia or China and he will support you,\u2019\u2019 one told me. \u2018\u2018It is that unsophisticated.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There it is,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said, a little halfheartedly, pointing out the window. His day had not gotten off to a great start. That morning, Puerto Rico had filed for a territorial version of bankruptcy. A prominent watchdog group had sent a letter to the Justice Department asking officials there to investigate why Lewandowski had never registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a World War II-era law that imposes stringent disclosure requirements on Americans representing foreign governments in Washington. (Though Bennett and other Avenue employees had registered as lobbyists, Lewandowski insisted that most of his business was advising clients on strategy, not setting up meetings or contacting officials on their behalf, the kind of work that requires you to register.) Politico had struck again, revealing Avenue\u2019s Citgo contract. Technically, the United States-based company was owned by the left-wing government of Venezuela, whose vice president the Trump administration had accused of drug trafficking.Lewandowski told me he didn\u2019t work directly for foreign governments, notwithstanding the stories and documents. Not that he wouldn\u2019t be good at it \u2014 you know, if he wanted to. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t work for foreign governments, but if I were a foreign government, and I wanted to hire people who understood how to get to the president, there are a small number of people I would think of,\u2019\u2019 Lewan\u00addowski said. As he spoke, he seemed to recover his familiar brio. \u2018\u2018The establishment is so afraid of President Trump they will do anything. Which includes hiring individuals who have purported to be tied to the White House who really aren\u2019t.\u2019\u2019The next day, Lewandowski announced he was quitting Avenue. In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg, he explained that Bennett and their employees had been using his name to drum up business he didn\u2019t want, exposing him to criticism and sullying his reputation. He insisted he had never asked Trump for anything. \u2018\u2018People want to see me fail,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski grumbled.\u2018\u2018I feel bad for Corey,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me when I went to see him the following week. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But he\u2019s a lightning rod.\u2019\u2019 Bob Dole, he pointed out, had just signed a $500,000 contract for work on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a violence-racked country run by a kleptocratic strongman. But no one in Washington gave Bob Dole a hard time.\u2018\u2018He thought he could go in\u2019\u2019 \u2014 into the White House \u2014 \u2018\u2018during the second wave,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said of Lewandowski. K Street was just a way station for him, Bennett suggested, while he waited for the only job he truly wanted \u2014 the one he could picture when he gazed out his window, down Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018Looking back on it, he probably should never have owned a chunk of a lobbying firm. In the media\u2019s mind, every client we had was Corey\u2019s client.\u2019\u2019 But even with Lewandowski gone, Bennett said, there was plenty of work. \u2018\u2018All of K Street is doing well right now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Chaos is good for everyone\u2019s business.\u2019\u2019Not long ago, Stryk opened a proper Washington office, right in Georgetown, a stone\u2019s throw from the Four Seasons. The new space was undecorated and unmarked, and there wasn\u2019t much there yet but a couple of laptops. But Stryk was buoyant. He was about to sign two more big foreign lobbying clients, the governments of Afghanistan and Kenya, along with a pharmaceutical firm. Saudi Arabia had canceled its S.P.G. contract after Stryk\u2019s client, the crown prince, was deposed in a palace reshuffle, and New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry had decided that its embassy no longer needed Stryk\u2019s services. But in Stryk\u2019s view, these were just hiccups. Competitors around town \u2014 big firms that had never given him the time of day \u2014 were starting to ask around about S.P.G., wondering who they were and how they were getting so much business.In about a month, Trump\u2019s ham-handed defense of white nationalists and white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville would prompt most of the chief executives serving on White House advisory councils to quit in protest. It would cost the chief executives something, losing their face time with this impressionable, transactional president \u2014 and their loss would be K Street\u2019s gain. Those same companies would now just rely more on their lobbyists, or on the trade associations they belonged to, to drive their agendas.But as we sat down in his new conference room, Stryk was already looking beyond the Beltway. He saw Trump\u2019s disruption spreading beyond Washington, to foreign capitals and overseas markets. The chaos in Trump\u2019s government was creating a vacuum abroad, one that entrepreneurs like Stryk could fill with deal-making and private diplomacy. \u2018\u2018I want to grow a business that\u2019s 200 million a year,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to get that arranging dinners in Washington.\u2019\u2019The new contracts with Afghanistan and Kenya, Stryk explained, were prototypes for the kind of business he wanted to do, an escape from the washing machine. The Afghans and the Kenyans didn\u2019t just want help with the Trump administration. They wanted help with everything: attracting American investment, troubleshooting problems in other foreign capitals, finding companies that could build them roads or manage their health care records.So recently, Stryk had begun pitching investors on a new venture: a $5 billion private-equity fund that would specialize in infrastructure and procurement. One side of the business, the lobbying, would identify government customers abroad; the other side would invest in companies that could deliver what those governments needed. Secure voting systems, border-security hardware \u2014 the opportunities were limitless. \u2018\u2018It is our job, as conservatives and capitalists, to take the chaos and do with it what we can,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Our goal is to take an environment that was created by the president and use it to \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused for a second, thinking. \u2018\u2018To do some good.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Are We Undercounting the Homeless?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief. Is California\u2019s homeless crisis much worse than the official data show?Using the estimates in the study, Los Angeles has 60,000 homeless, not 47,000, and San Francisco has 9,000 homeless, not 7,000, according to the research, which used 2016 data.The study is important, experts say, because it could provide justification for greater federal funding for programs that address homelessness.The federal government measures homelessness by commissioning teams that spread out through cities, counting the homeless at a particular point in time, often in a single night.The authors of the new study point to research showing that this way of counting is particularly unreliable for counting homeless who are not in shelters \u2014 as is often the case in California \u2014 and the research uses a statistical model to estimate what it calls the \u201ctrue\u201d number of homeless.The study was led by Chris Glynn, a statistician at the University of New Hampshire, and was sponsored and initiated by the real estate data company Zillow.An expert on homelessness who was not involved in the study, Dennis P. Culhane, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, calls the study \u201cimportant\u201d and says it builds on research showing that only 60 percent of unsheltered homeless are counted in the federal statistics.\u201cThere are certainly more homeless than are counted in the one-night counts, and this study has created a method for estimating what that undercounting might be,\u201d Professor Culhane said in an interview.The study also highlights how much more visible homelessness is in the West compared with the East Coast, where much higher percentages of homeless are provided with shelter, Professor Culhane said.\u201cBeing on the East Coast, where unsheltered homelessness is much less common, we are not aware of how urgent and visible this problem seems in West Coast cities,\u201d Professor Culhane said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Californians can now renew their car registrations while stocking up on soda and peanut butter.The terminals can\u2019t do every task. But they handle one of the most common: registration renewal.If you have a renewal notice and a credit card, cash or check, you can knock it out about two minutes. The new tags are printed on the spot.Armando Botello, a D.M.V. spokesman, noted that Californians can already renew their registrations online. But many people fail to act early enough to get the tags through the mail before the old ones expire.But stand by, said Mr. Botello. The San Francisco Bay Area is expected to see a rollout in the next couple of months.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Are Markets Due for a Reckoning?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a decade after the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, concerns are rising that euphoric markets may be headed for a hard fall.Technology companies have been an important driver behind the increase in financial markets in recent years, with seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies now coming from that sector.The so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and the Google parent Alphabet \u2014 have had some of the biggest gains in the past 12 months.And a stunning amount of money (more than $60 billion a year for the past three years) has flowed into the tech sector through venture capitalists and private equity funds.\u2022 Many of the gains have been concentrated around a small number of stocks, rather than resulting in a broader rise.\u2022 Tech companies may face increasing scrutiny from regulators.Google was fined a record $2.7 billion this summer by European Union antitrust officials for unfairly favoring some of its own services over rivals. The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Critics say that too often campuses have resorted to looking for any excuse to revoke offers.\u201cThose deadlines \u2014 we tell students all the time, \u2018They are the smallest thing, but it\u2019ll make or break whether you get into the college,\u2019\u201d said Bernadine Diele, who advises high school students in Merced. \u201cAnd it has nothing to do with your competitiveness.\u201dLast year, U.C. Riverside rescinded more than 300 admission offers over missing paperwork; U.C. Merced revoked about 160; and U.C. Davis nearly 100.Jill Orcutt, U.C. Merced\u2019s associate vice chancellor for enrollment management, said incoming freshmen were repeatedly reminded about the transcripts deadline. Many of those who fail to meet it, she suggested, most likely had no real intention to attend the university.As of last week, roughly 280 of the students had been reinstated. Others were under review.Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat, has been a vocal critic of what he described as a \u201cgotcha game\u201d in U.C. admissions.He\u2019s pushing Janet Napolitano, the system president, to adopt policies across all 10 campuses that ensure young people are given every chance to meet their enrollment conditions.\u201cThese are people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Ting said. \u201cGoing to college is a transformative experience and to deny that over some paperwork seems to me mind-boggling.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Several thousand white crosses dot a hillside in Lafayette, a bedroom community near Berkeley.The first of them were planted in 2006 to represent American service members killed in the Iraq war. Later, more were added for those who died in Afghanistan.Protests were held, residents complained before the City Council, and vandals periodically ripped up crosses.Yet 11 years later, the display remains.It was created by Jeff Heaton, 64, a local antiwar activist. He said his hope was for a memorial to the military\u2019s dead that also \u201cexpresses a desire for a peaceful world.\u201dVolunteers stopped adding crosses on the crowded hillside some years ago, but they still update a death toll painted in black on a prominent white sign.

{"Headline": "Outraged in Private, Many C.E.O.s Fear the Wrath of the President", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAt what point do the C.E.O.s of the largest companies in the United States tell President Trump that enough is enough?Not yet, apparently.\u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\u201d Mr. Frazier said.pic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5Within minutes on Monday, Mr. Trump, in far less time than it took him to react to the violence in Charlottesville, was on Twitter criticizing Mr. Frazier. \u201cNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President\u2019s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201dThe silence from the larger C.E.O. community about Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to the situation in Charlottesville has been remarkably conspicuous, even as one of their own has now been attacked online by the president.By Monday evening, at least two other C.E.O.s had stepped forward. Kevin Plank, the founder of Under Armour, announced on Twitter that he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council, saying, among other things, that his company \u201cengages in innovation and sports, not politics.\u201d He did not refer to the president, though.Mr. Plank was followed shortly after by Brian Krzanich, the Intel chief executive, who announced on the company\u2019s website that he would step down from the council as well. \u201cI resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,\u201d he said.A few big-name corporate leaders released innocuous statements over the weekend condemning the violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. But with the exception of Mr. Frazier, none appear to have directly condemned the president\u2019s choice of words, which have been a lightning rod for Americans from many quarters, even among many Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters.At a news conference on Monday, after a barrage of blistering criticism, the president said that \u201cracism is evil.\u201dAs the day wore on, several executives, including Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, made statements in support of Mr. Frazier, while others \u2014 including Tim Cook of Apple, and the Business Roundtable, which represents some 200 C.E.O.s \u2014 condemned the racism on display in Charlottesville.But notably, not one executive on any of the president\u2019s various councils said anything directly about the president.The statements from American chief executives that came closest to criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s language came from Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Krzanich of Intel.Mr. Blankfein tweeted on Monday morning: \u201cLincoln: \u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand.\u2019 Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\u201d (Mr. Blankfein is not on any of the president\u2019s councils, which may make it easier for him to be critical.)But how can so many other American business leaders and senior executives remain quiet about the president\u2019s reaction? Where is the moral courage to stand up?After all, most companies these days spend countless hours talking about their culture and values. Just last week, Google publicly fired one of its engineers within days of his writing a memo that questioned whether \u201cpersonality differences\u201d between men and women led to there being fewer female engineers in the technology industry.As Justice Marshall himself famously said, \u201cWhere you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy.\u201dMr. Ogunlesi declined to comment, through a spokesman.What about Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo? She is a member of the president\u2019s business council and has long been a vocal advocate for minorities. The company said this year that it \u201cdoes not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\u201dWhen I contacted her about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks over the weekend, a spokesman directed me to a tweet that clearly didn\u2019t mention the president: \u201cHeartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans.\u201dIn truth, it should not fall to C.E.O.s who are members of minority groups to speak up. They face enough pressure already.Some people who have less at stake are going on the record to support Mr. Frazier\u2019s stance against the president. Tom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, wrote on Twitter on Monday: \u201cKen has stood up for true American values. I call on all other members of Trump\u2019s image-burnishing committees to do the same.\u201dPrivately, many chief executives say they are fuming, outraged by the president. (This after many of them campaigned to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s committees.) But many are too scared to say anything publicly that could make them or their company a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol against Mr. Frazier and Merck \u2014 a company that depends on the government as a buyer for many of its drugs \u2014 will perhaps have an even greater chilling effect on other C.E.O.s who may consider speaking out. (The potential for economic retribution against Merck also demonstrates just how brave Mr. Frazier was in taking a stand.)When I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: \u201cJust look at what he did to Ken. I\u2019m not sticking my head up.\u201d Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name.The same trepidation may explain why people like Mr. Ogunlesi don\u2019t say anything. He runs an infrastructure fund that will most likely have to do business with the federal government. And Ms. Nooyi\u2019s PepsiCo, for example, was briefly boycotted by Trump supporters when she made some comments that were construed as critical of him.Other C.E.O.s, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, have contended that they consider it part of their patriotic duty to remain on the president\u2019s business council, even when they disagree with things Mr. Trump says or does.\u201cIt is very hard if you say, I\u2019m going to go off an advisory group or not do A-B-C, because you disagree on one issue,\u201d Mr. Dimon said in early June after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, a move that Mr. Dimon was against. Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert Iger of Disney resigned from the council in protest.\u201cHonestly, no one is going to agree with every president or prime minister on every issue, so I don\u2019t want to overreact to it,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.Lawrence Summers, who has served as Treasury secretary and president of Harvard, said in response to Mr. Dimon\u2019s rationale at the time to Bloomberg News: \u201cAt what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country rather to your president? I\u2019ve always thought of my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Dimon, who is the chairman of the Business Roundtable, put out his own statement about the violence in Charlottesville, but nothing about the president.C.E.O.s have faced the question of how to address the president when they disagree with him before \u2014 over immigration, say, or the Paris climate accord. Each time, the executives have justified their silence by saying it is more valuable to be at the table than not.That\u2019s a valid argument \u2014 to a point. If the president isn\u2019t following your advice or the values you espouse, when should you get up? Of course, big policy decisions like tax reform remain just around the corner, so many executives are desperate to keep a line open to the president even if it is only one-way.It is a fair critique of the president that he didn\u2019t immediately and directly condemn the bigoted actions over the weekend and call them out for what they were \u2014 remarks that tacitly helped normalize such hate.While C.E.O.s may call out the hate, will they have the fortitude to call out the president?An earlier version of this column misquoted part of President Trump\u2019s statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Va. He blamed \u201cmany sides,\u201d not \u201call sides,\u201d for the violence that left one woman dead.An earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly part of a statement from Merck. The company said \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values,\u201d not \u201cfundamental views.\u201dTwitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uproar Over Omarosa Manigault-Newman at Black Journalists Convention", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Manigault-Newman, whose role in the Trump administration as an advocate on issues concerning African-Americans was also scrutinized, appeared at the annual gathering for a panel that was called \u201cBlack and Blue: Raising Our Sons, Protecting Our Communities.\u201d It was moderated by a longtime journalist, Ed Gordon, a host at Bounce TV.The event began cordially, but within minutes, it devolved into a shouting match between Ms. Manigault-Newman and Mr. Gordon. She interrupted him, accusing him several times of attacking her as Mr. Gordon pressed for answers about her role in the Trump administration and changes to criminal justice policies under Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In one of the tensest exchanges, Ms. Manigault-Newman said, \u201cShame on you,\u201d to Mr. Gordon. He replied, in part, \u201cSo here\u2019s what you\u2019re not gonna do,\u201d before explaining that he would not let her \u201crailroad\u201d the event.The panel started with Ms. Manigault-Newman answering a question about the deaths of her father and brother to violence in Ohio. She said she understood the pain of losing a family member and that she was dismayed by accusations that she does not sympathize with families whose loved ones have been killed by the police.Ms. Manigault-Newman is the director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison. She also noted that in her role, she is often the \u201conly African-American representative\u201d in the White House and frequently tries to be an advocate on behalf of black people.But the discussion quickly worsened from there. It became a 25-minute argument during which Ms. Manigault-Newman called Mr. Gordon \u201caggressive,\u201d with Mr. Gordon pointedly asking what effect Ms. Manigault-Newman had made on the president.Mr. Gordon replied that he was not suggesting that, and that he would like to finish asking the question. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your question,\u201d Ms. Manigault-Newman said, talking over him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear a lecture.\u201dIn response, Mr. Gordon began to walk closer to her. Ms. Manigault-Newman, who had been seated, stood up and walked across the stage and said Mr. Gordon was being \u201caggressive.\u201dShe also accused the crowd of journalists of not having sympathy for the deaths of her father and brother. \u201cI came out to laughter as if this was a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cWalking into a room where you get shut down does not open a line of communication so change can happen.\u201dAt one point, Ms. Manigault-Newman accused Mr. Gordon of brushing aside her relatives\u2019 deaths. When Mr. Gordon said she was wrong, she replied, \u201cI have it on tape, boo.\u201d His response: \u201cO.K., boo, play it.\u201dMr. Gordon also asked Ms. Manigault-Newman about what she told the president after his remarks on Long Island. Ms. Manigault-Newman said she could not \u201cdisclose confidential conversations with the president,\u201d which led to loud sighing and snickering in the crowd, though Ms. Manigault-Newman did say she thought it was wrong for Mr. Trump to make those comments.She later said she had invited several law enforcement officials to come to the White House to discuss criminal justice issues. But at one point, asked how she worked with the Justice Department on issues of policing, Ms. Manigault-Newman suggested that people in the room should \u201cGoogle\u201d her work. Pressed about the topic later, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not even part of my portfolio.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand here and defend everything about Donald Trump,\u201d she said, to loud sighs in the audience.Heading into the forum, many of the conference attendees said they were steeling themselves for the appearance of Ms. Manigault-Newman, who became famous on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and has had several fiery exchanges with journalists. Several journalists who were scheduled to be on the panel pulled out of the event after Ms. Manigault-Newman was added.A handful of people in the audience, including Brittany Packnett, a prominent Black Lives Matter activist and a founder of a policy group called Campaign Zero, stood up and turned their backs toward Ms. Manigault-Newman to protest her presence.The panel ended abruptly when Ms. Manigault-Newman walked off the stage after Mr. Gordon said it was a \u201cquagmire\u201d that had \u201creached the point of diminished returns.\u201dHe ended the event by joking, \u201cI\u2019ll see y\u2019all at the White House Christmas party in December.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sundar Pichai Should Resign as Google\u2019s C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are many actors in the whole Google/diversity drama, but I\u2019d say the one who\u2019s behaved the worst is the C.E.O., Sundar Pichai.Damore was tapping into the long and contentious debate about genes and behavior. On one side are those who believe that humans come out as blank slates and are formed by social structures. On the other are the evolutionary psychologists who argue that genes interact with environment and play a large role in shaping who we are. In general the evolutionary psychologists have been winning this debate.When it comes to the genetic differences between male and female brains, I\u2019d say the mainstream view is that male and female abilities are the same across the vast majority of domains \u2014 I.Q., the ability to do math, etc. But there are some ways that male and female brains are, on average, different. There seems to be more connectivity between the hemispheres, on average, in female brains. Prenatal exposure to different levels of androgen does seem to produce different effects throughout the life span.Damore was especially careful to say this research applies only to populations, not individuals: \u201cMany of these differences are small and there\u2019s significant overlap between men and women, so you can\u2019t say anything about an individual given these population-level distributions.\u201dThat\u2019s the crucial point. But of course we don\u2019t live as populations; we live our individual lives.We should all have a lot of sympathy for the second group of actors in this drama, the women in tech who felt the memo made their lives harder. Picture yourself in a hostile male-dominated environment, getting interrupted at meetings, being ignored, having your abilities doubted, and along comes some guy arguing that women are on average less status hungry and more vulnerable to stress. Of course you\u2019d object.What we have is a legitimate tension. Damore is describing a truth on one level; his sensible critics are describing a different truth, one that exists on another level. He is championing scientific research; they are championing gender equality. It takes a little subtlety to harmonize these strands, but it\u2019s doable.Of course subtlety is in hibernation in modern America. The third player in the drama is Google\u2019s diversity officer, Danielle Brown. She didn\u2019t wrestle with any of the evidence behind Damore\u2019s memo. She just wrote his views \u201cadvanced incorrect assumptions about gender.\u201d This is ideology obliterating reason.The fourth actor is the media. The coverage of the memo has been atrocious.The mob that hounded Damore was like the mobs we\u2019ve seen on a lot of college campuses. We all have our theories about why these moral crazes are suddenly so common. I\u2019d say that radical uncertainty about morality, meaning and life in general is producing intense anxiety. Some people embrace moral absolutism in a desperate effort to find solid ground. They feel a rare and comforting sense of moral certainty when they are purging an evil person who has violated one of their sacred taboos.That is a blatantly dishonest characterization of the memo. Damore wrote nothing like that about his Google colleagues. Either Pichai is unprepared to understand the research (unlikely), is not capable of handling complex data flows (a bad trait in a C.E.O.) or was simply too afraid to stand up to a mob.Regardless which weakness applies, this episode suggests he should seek a nonleadership position. We are at a moment when mobs on the left and the right ignore evidence and destroy scapegoats. That\u2019s when we need good leaders most.Advertisement"}

What would keep Amazon from diving into the business of delivering prepared meals, or even meal kits like the ones Blue Apron offers? The possibilities are endless.That said, the deal hasn\u2019t closed quite yet. We\u2019ll see what happens.For both companies, this sounds like a fine short-term hedge against Amazon. But they can\u2019t expect this to actually work out in the long run, can they? Amazon has more items and manages the logistics of the whole shopping process. Two companies with different interests working as one seems a bit kludgy to me.In any case, I\u2019m curious to see if this actually makes a dent. Amazon is already my default for so much of my online shopping.Building a car is hard. Building a self-driving car is even harder. And building a self-driving car from scratch, in house, when you\u2019re a tech company that has only ever built phones and computers, seems near impossible. But perhaps I\u2019m being too pessimistic.Honestly, Mike, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m yelling into a void. But really, why is Uber doing so well despite acting so badly? Do customers really just not care? Is there some danger in the numbers we aren\u2019t seeing?That, or more likely: People just don\u2019t care. Uber is incredibly convenient and works well if you\u2019ve got the money to spend on it. Why go back to waiting on yellow cabs or fighting your way onto a crowded bus if you don\u2019t have to?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driverless-Car Outlook Shifts as Intel Takes Over Mobileye", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout three years ago, the chip giant Intel seemed like a bystander in Silicon Valley\u2019s race to develop self-driving cars.Even in microchips, its strength, Intel was scrambling to catch up to its rival Nvidia, whose superfast processors were attracting automakers because of their ability to fuse images from the cameras and radar sensors to detect obstacles.\u201cIntel now has a very big footprint in all parts of the autonomous vehicle, the brains, the sensors, the information side, the mapping,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who tracks the development of self-driving cars. \u201cThe acquisition clearly puts Intel in the conversation. It guarantees they will be a player.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Intel announced its intention to acquire Mobileye in March. The two companies have been working with BMW on self-driving cars and are partners with Delphi Automotive, a supplier of advanced automotive electronics and software.Intel and Mobileye aim to demonstrate the strength of their combined capabilities in the next several months by building a fleet of 100 self-driving test vehicles.\u201cThis is our way to put the technology out so it can be demonstrated not only for automakers but for society, for regulators,\u201d Mr. Shashua, who will become a senior vice president of Intel, said in an interview.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Test cars will be sent first to Arizona and then to Jerusalem, a challenging environment with narrow streets and aggressive drivers. \u201cIf you can successfully drive autonomously in Jerusalem, you can drive almost anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Shashua said.Such a fleet would give Intel something to rival Google\u2019s autonomous driving division, now called Waymo. Over the past year, Waymo has built a sizable test fleet using minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and it is operating them in several cities. Uber is running tests in Pittsburgh, while General Motors, Ford Motor and other traditional automakers are creating their own test fleets.At the same time, the combination of Intel and Mobileye will begin working on a new self-driving system that combines Intel chips and Mobileye\u2019s technology. Mr. Shashua said the new system would be about twice as powerful as Mobileye\u2019s current product based on its EyeQ5 processor.The system will include several key components of a self-driving car \u2014 cameras, image-processing capabilities, microprocessors and mapping technology, as well as software that determines how to react to driving situations, pedestrians and other vehicles, known as \u201cdriving policy.\u201dThe technology will be designed to allow automakers to add their own self-driving software. \u201cCar manufacturers will want to imprint their own characteristics on the system, how they want it to feel and how they want it to drive,\u201d said Brian M. Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive.Still, it will not be easy for Intel to pull automakers away. Nvidia offers chips with more raw processing power, which \u201chave been getting a lot of wins lately,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Ramsey said.Toyota recently chose Nvidia technology for the self-driving cars it is developing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Identity Thieves Hijack Cellphone Accounts to Go After Virtual Currency", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHackers have discovered that one of the most central elements of online security \u2014 the mobile phone number \u2014 is also one of the easiest to steal.In a growing number of online attacks, hackers have been calling up Verizon, T-Mobile U.S., Sprint and AT&T and asking them to transfer control of a victim\u2019s phone number to a device under the control of the hackers.Once they get control of the phone number, they can reset the passwords on every account that uses the phone number as a security backup \u2014 as services like Google, Twitter and Facebook suggest.\u201cMy iPad restarted, my phone restarted and my computer restarted, and that\u2019s when I got the cold sweat and was like, \u2018O.K., this is really serious,\u2019\u201d said Chris Burniske, a virtual currency investor who lost control of his phone number late last year.But a particularly concentrated wave of attacks has hit those with the most obviously valuable online accounts: virtual currency fanatics like Mr. Burniske.Within minutes of getting control of Mr. Burniske\u2019s phone, his attackers had changed the password on his virtual currency wallet and drained the contents \u2014 some $150,000 at today\u2019s values.Most victims of these attacks in the virtual currency community have not wanted to acknowledge it publicly for fear of provoking their adversaries. But in interviews, dozens of prominent people in the industry acknowledged that they had been victimized in recent months.\u201cEverybody I know in the cryptocurrency space has gotten their phone number stolen,\u201d said Joby Weeks, a Bitcoin entrepreneur.Mr. Weeks lost his phone number and about a million dollars\u2019 worth of virtual currency late last year, despite having asked his mobile phone provider for additional security after his wife and parents lost control of their phone numbers.The attackers appear to be focusing on anyone who talks on social media about owning virtual currencies or anyone who is known to invest in virtual currency companies, such as venture capitalists. And virtual currency transactions are designed to be irreversible.Accounts with banks and brokerage firms and the like are not as vulnerable to these attacks because these institutions can usually reverse unintended or malicious transactions if they are caught within a few days.But the attacks are exposing a vulnerability that could be exploited against almost anyone with valuable emails or other digital files \u2014 including politicians, activists and journalists.In a number of cases involving digital money aficionados, the attackers have held email files for ransom \u2014 threatening to release naked pictures in one case, and details of a victim\u2019s sexual fetishes in another.The vulnerability of even sophisticated programmers and security experts to these attacks sets an unsettling precedent for when the assailants go after less technologically savvy victims. Security experts worry that these types of attacks will become more widespread if mobile phone operators do not make significant changes to their security procedures.\u201cIt\u2019s really highlighting the insecurity of using any kind of telephone-based security,\u201d said Michael Perklin, the chief information security officer at the virtual currency exchange ShapeShift, which has seen many of its employees and customers attacked.Mobile phone carriers have said they are taking steps to head off the attacks by making it possible to add more complex personal identification numbers, or PINs, to accounts, among other steps.But these measures have not been enough to stop the spread and success of the culprits.In several recent cases, the hackers have commandeered phone numbers even when the victims knew they were under attack and alerted their cellphone provider.Adam Pokornicky, a managing partner at Cryptochain Capital, asked Verizon to put extra security measures on his account after he learned that an attacker had called in 13 times trying to move his number to a new phone.But just a day later, he said, the attacker persuaded a different Verizon agent to change Mr. Pokornicky\u2019s number without requiring the new PIN.A spokesman for Verizon, Richard Young, said that the company could not comment on specific cases, but that phone porting was not common.\u201cWhile we work diligently to ensure customer accounts remain secure, on occasion there are instances where automated processes or human performance falls short,\u201d he said. \u201cWe strive to correct these issues quickly and look for additional ways to improve security.\u201dMr. Perklin, who worked at a Canadian mobile phone operator before joining ShapeShift, said most phone companies would write down any additional security requests in the notes of a customer account.But agents can generally act on their own, he said, regardless of what is in the notes, and can easily miss what is in the notes.The vulnerability of phone numbers is the unintended consequence of a broad push in the security industry to institute a practice, known as two-factor authentication, that is supposed to help make accounts more secure.Many email providers and financial firms require customers to tie their online accounts to phone numbers, to verify their identity. But this system also generally allows someone with the phone number to reset the passwords on these accounts without knowing the original passwords. A hacker just hits \u201cforgot password?\u201d and has a new code sent to the commandeered phone.Mr. Pokornicky was online at the time his phone number was taken, and he watched as his assailants seized all his major online accounts within a few minutes.\u201cIt felt like they were one step ahead of me the whole time,\u201d he said.The speed with which the attackers move has convinced people who are investigating the hacks that the attacks are generally run by groups of hackers working together.Danny Yang, the founder of the virtual currency security firm BlockSeer, said he had traced several attacks to internet addresses in the Philippines, though other attacks have been tracked to computers in Turkey and the United States.Mr. Perklin and other people who have investigated recent hacks said the assailants generally succeeded by delivering sob stories about an emergency that required the phone number to be moved to a new device \u2014 and by trying multiple times until a gullible agent was found.\u201cThese guys will sit and call 600 times before they get through and get an agent on the line that\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Mr. Weeks said.Coinbase, one of the most widely used Bitcoin wallets, has encouraged customers to disconnect their mobile phones from their Coinbase accounts.But some customers who have lost money have said the companies need to take more steps by doing things like delaying transfers from accounts on which the password was recently changed.A spokesman for Coinbase said the company \u201chas invested significant resources to build internal tools to help protect our customers against hackers and account takeovers, including compromise through phone porting.\u201dThe irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions has often been lauded as one of the most important qualities of virtual currency because it makes it harder for banks and governments to intervene in transactions.But Mr. Pokornicky said the virtual currency industry needed to alert new users to the added risk that comes with the new features of the technology.\u201cIt\u2019s powerful to be able to control your money and move things without any permission,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that privilege requires a clear understanding of the downside.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Think Tank for the Spandex Set", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFit City\u201cEveryone in this room is now a pyro girl,\u201d exclaimed Ms. Godso through a microphone. \u201cThat means you don\u2019t just accept anything, you are going after more, you are fiery. We are going to get lit up.\u201dThe class, a mix of strength work and high-interval training, was carefully created by the trainers, who are close friends. Participants, dressed in bright-colored leggings, cut-up T-shirts and the latest name-brand footwear, grunted through intervals of burpees with names like hot sauce, Bloody Mary, and jalape\u00f1o.By the end of the 50-minute workout participants were drenched in sweat and keeled over. But rather than run straight to the locker rooms, they stayed behind to chat with the instructors. Some requested selfies. Others needed clarifications on moves. A large group headed to the adjacent lounge where they helped themselves to free cold brew, laced with nitrogen for an extra kick, and analyzed the workout.\u201cEveryone is very passionate about working out here,\u201d said Sara Angle, a 27-year-old fitness editor for Shape magazine who was at the class. \u201cNo other studios have this space to build this kind of community.\u201dEquinox, the luxury health club chain, opened the new space, Project by Equinox, in March to experiment with new kinds of exercise, equipment and teaching methods. Instructors get to invent new classes and practice them with willing participants before rolling some of them out to the wider world.\u201cIt\u2019s a think tank, or incubator, or lab, or start-up, or whatever you want to call it,\u201d said Vanessa Martin, the studio director.This space is a welcome addition for instructors and customers who like to experiment, said Ms. Martin. Many New York fitness studios, in order to scale their offerings, ask teachers to follow set scripts and workouts, stifling their creativity, she said. Other clubs turn to gimmicks that have no real physical benefit. \u201cNew Yorkers have 45 minutes a day to exercise, and they want results.\u201dTo that end, traditional Equinox clubs aren\u2019t the ideal places to experiment, since members expect a constant, high-level experience.\u201cThis is our Google Garage, our 20-percent time,\u201d Chloe Heckman, the vice president of business development at Equinox, said.There are eight to 10 instructors at any given time working in the studio. They must first audition, and prove that they have an entrepreneurial spirit and the potential to build a brand. Once accepted, they get whatever equipment they want \u2014 one requested a pull-up bar big enough for a group; another, resistance bands with a specific type of clutch. Instructors can play around with a lighting system that has 110,000 different settings, or a video camera that provides short clips of their workouts for social media.Every afternoon, the space is reserved for instructors to collaborate and experiment. \u201cOnce I was asked to hang from a pull-up bar with a resistance band on my ankle\u201d for a \u201chuge core engagement\u201d exercise, said Ms. Martin.Some fitness experts are dubious, however. Jason Kelly, the author of \u201cSweat Equity: Inside the New Economy of Mind and Body,\u201d agreed that there is a desire for innovation. \u201cThe appetite for the next fitness thing is robust, especially with the 20- or 30-something set,\u201d he said.Still, he worries about the ramifications of following trends. \u201cDoing the next cool thing sometimes feels like making sure you\u2019ve eaten at the greatest restaurant or gone for a drink at the cool new rooftop bar. If fitness turns into this strange one-upmanship of, \u2018If you aren\u2019t doing this cool new thing, you aren\u2019t doing it right,\u2019 that can be a bit of a turnoff,\u201d he said. \u201cAt heart, I still love the idea of just going out for a run.\u201dA perk for some trainers at Project by Equinox is that they are finally given the resources and time to develop their dream class \u2014 something they don\u2019t see as trendy at all. Patrick McGrath, a Pilates expert, teaches a sculpt and strength class that focuses on core work. \u201cWhen we sat down for a meeting, I knew what I wanted to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what I do in my own life.\u201dMs. Godso and Ms. Williams used to have brunch and talk about the class they wanted to teach together. \u201cThis was the first time we had a space to do it,\u201d said Ms. Godso.At $35 a class, the experience is not cheap, but it is open to the public, not just Equinox members. Dennis O\u2019Reilly, a 28-year-old sales executive at a tech company, seems fine with the price tag, and likes the vibe of the studio, which welcomes men, he said. \u201cThis studio offers core workouts and a Nordic vibe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t go out of fashion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ellen Ullman\u2019s New Book Tackles Tech\u2019s Woman Problem", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Then Ullman retired as a programmer, logging out to go write two intense character-driven thriller novels and the occasional nonfiction essay. The digital economy bounced back after the Epic Fail of 2000 and two decades later, those techno-seeds planted back in 1997 have bloomed. Just look at all those smartphones, constantly buzzing with news alerts and calendar notifications as we tell the virtual assistant to find us Google Maps directions to the new rice-bowl place. What would Ullman think of all this? We can now find out, as she\u2019s written a new book, \u201cLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology,\u201d which manages to feel like both a prequel and a sequel to her first book.Don\u2019t panic, non-nerds. In addition to writing code in multiple computer languages, Ullman has an Ivy League degree in English and knows how to decode her tech-world adventures into accessible narratives for word people: \u201cTime went on; I graduated from Cornell and moved to San Francisco, where, one day in 1979, I walked past a Radio Shack store on Market Street and saw in the window a microcomputer called the TRS-80. Reader, I bought it.\u201dHer work as an active programmer spanned about 20 years, ending in the 1990s, but some experiences stay with you forever. \u201cThe role they assigned to me, translator, is perhaps the most accurate description of everything I have ever done concerning technology,\u201d she writes of one gig. As I\u2019ve found in my own scribbling about tech, language skills and accurate translation are essential to understanding in both human and computer systems. The most useful bit of prep I had for that came from the two years of Attic Greek I once took to fulfill a curriculum requirement for a theater degree. Converting text into plain language for the inquiring masses is vital, whether it be wrestling Xenophon\u2019s \u201cAnabasis\u201d or Linux engineer notes into English.The first three-fifths of \u201cLife in Code\u201d is primarily composed of essays published elsewhere between 1994 and 2004, while newer material from 2012 to early 2017 fills out the rest. The technology mentioned within those early chapters often recalls quaint discovery, like finding a chunky, clunky Nokia cellphone in the back of the junk drawer. The piece on preparing computers for the Year 2000 has a musty time-capsule feel, but the philosophical questions posed in other chapters \u2014 like those on robotics and artificial intelligence \u2014 still resonate.While the electrified economy had yet to complete its first dramatic cycle of boom and bust when her first book came out, a 1998 essay in \u201cLife in Code\u201d shows Ullman, Cassandra-like and ever the pragmatic pessimist, already bracing for the coming storm. \u201cI fear for the world the internet is creating,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBefore the advent of the Web, if you wanted to sustain a belief in far-fetched ideas, you had to go out into the desert, or live on a compound in the mountains, or move from one badly furnished room to another in a series of safe houses.\u201d These days, she\u2019s still concerned about the damage the internet is doing to culture, privacy and civility. What hasn\u2019t changed in the past 20 years is the dominant demographic of the technology industry and its overall lack of diversity. Ullman addresses these topics in the latter part of the book, as she observes online classes for newer programming languages like Python and feels put off by the \u201cunderlying assumption of male, white, geeky American culture\u201d with science fiction TV shows woven into the course material.

{"Headline": "A Hunt for Ways to Combat Online Radicalization", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLaw enforcement officials, technology companies and lawmakers have long tried to limit what they call the \u201cradicalization\u201d of young people over the internet.The term has often been used to describe a specific kind of radicalization \u2014 that of young Muslim men who are inspired to take violent action by the online messages of Islamist groups like the Islamic State. But as it turns out, it isn\u2019t just violent jihadists who benefit from the internet\u2019s power to radicalize young people from afar.White supremacists are just as adept at it. Where the pre-internet Ku Klux Klan grew primarily from personal connections and word of mouth, today\u2019s white supremacist groups have figured out a way to expertly use the internet to recruit and coordinate among a huge pool of potential racists. That became clear two weeks ago with the riots in Charlottesville, Va., which became a kind of watershed event for internet-addled racists.Ms. Donovan and others who study how the internet shapes extremism said that even though Islamists and white nationalists have different views and motivations, there are broad similarities in how the two operate online \u2014 including how they spread their message, recruit and organize offline actions. The similarities suggest a kind of blueprint for a response \u2014 efforts that may work for limiting the reach of jihadists may also work for white supremacists, and vice versa.In fact, that\u2019s the battle plan. Several research groups in the United States and Europe now see the white supremacist and jihadi threats as two faces of the same coin. They\u2019re working on methods to fight both, together \u2014 and slowly, they have come up with ideas for limiting how these groups recruit new members to their cause.Their ideas are grounded in a few truths about how extremist groups operate online, and how potential recruits respond. After speaking to many researchers, I compiled this rough guide for combating online radicalization.Recognize the internet as an extremist breeding ground.The first step in combating online extremism is kind of obvious: It is to recognize the extremists as a threat.When it comes to fighting white supremacists, though, much of the tech industry has long been on the sidelines. This laxity has helped create a monster. In many ways, researchers said, white supremacists are even more sophisticated than jihadists in their use of the internet.After the horror of Charlottesville, internet companies began banning and blocking content posted by right-wing extremist groups. So far their efforts have been hasty and reactive, but Ms. Ramalingam sees it as at the start of a wider effort.\u201cIt\u2019s really an unprecedented moment where social media and tech companies are recognizing that their platforms have become spaces where these groups can grow, and have been often unpoliced,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really kind of waking up to this and taking some action.\u201dEngage directly with potential recruits. If tech companies are finally taking action to prevent radicalization, is it the right kind of action? Extremism researchers said that blocking certain content may work to temporarily disrupt groups, but may eventually drive them further underground, far from the reach of potential saviors.One factor is a skepticism of mainstream media. Whether on the far right or ISIS, people who are susceptible to extremist ideologies tend to dismiss outlets like The New York Times or the BBC, and they often go in search of alternative theories online.Another key issue is timing. There\u2019s a brief window between initial interest in an extremist ideology and a decision to join the cause \u2014 and after recruits make that decision, they are often beyond the reach of outsiders. For instance, Jigsaw found that when jihadists began planning their trips to Syria to join ISIS, they had fallen too far down the rabbit hole and dismissed any new information presented to them.Jigsaw put these findings to use in an innovative way. It curated a series of videos showing what life is truly like under the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The videos, which weren\u2019t filmed by news outlets, offered a credible counterpoint to the fantasies peddled by the group \u2014 they show people queuing up for bread, fighters brutally punishing civilians, and women and children being mistreated.Then, to make sure potential recruits saw the videos at the right time in their recruitment process, Jigsaw used one of Google\u2019s most effective technologies: ad targeting. In the same way that a pair of shoes you looked up last week follows you around the internet, Jigsaw\u2019s counterterrorism videos were pushed to likely recruits.Moonshot CVE, which worked with Jigsaw on the Redirect project, put together several similar efforts to engage with both jihadists and white supremacist groups. It has embedded undercover social workers in extremist forums who discreetly message potential recruits to dissuade them. And lately it\u2019s been using targeted ads to offer mental health counseling to those who might be radicalized.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s really effective to go beyond ideology,\u201d Ms. Ramalingam said. \u201cWhen you offer them some information about their lives, they\u2019re disproportionately likely to interact with it.\u201dStill, just about every hate crime and terrorist attack, these days, was planned or in some way coordinated online. Ridding the world of all of the factors that drive young men to commit heinous acts isn\u2019t possible. But disrupting the online radicalization machine? With enough work, that may just be possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Coffee Shop Tales", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles. When Jackson Defa, 34, began scoping out spaces for a coffee shop in Los Angeles, he considered West Hollywood, Los Feliz, Mt. Washington and several other neighborhoods he thought he and his business partners could afford. The criteria were not complicated: Other than rent, their major concern was finding an area where there weren\u2019t scores of baristas within walking distance.The spot on Cesar E Chavez Avenue fit the bill perfectly, Mr. Defa said. When his shop, Weird Wave Coffee Brewers, opened its doors for the first time this summer, it was the only spot in Boyle Heights with latte art. Customers came quickly. But so did the protesters. For weeks now, protesters have become a regular fixture in front of the fledgling shop.Mr. Defa insists they are not going anywhere.\u201cWe have a five-year lease and people are coming through our doors all the time,\u201d he said as he prepared an espresso one recent morning. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people who are stoked to have us.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Flocks to Foiling, Racing Above the Bay\u2019s Waves", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 What happens in the San Francisco Bay every Thursday night does not look real or even possible, and it certainly does not look safe. Dozens of people skim across the waters at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, kites far ahead and their boards floating two feet above the chop of the waves. They move so smoothly and quietly that some riders are on their cellphones.They call it hydrofoiling \u2014 or, if you\u2019re hip to it, foiling.And every week, the foilers of San Francisco race.\u201cIt\u2019s like flying,\u201d said Ariel Poler, a 50-year-old start-up investor, standing by the winged doors of his Tesla and pulling on body armor and a helmet. \u201cThe board doesn\u2019t touch the water. It\u2019s like an airplane wing.\u201cIt\u2019s like a powder day,\u201d he added, referring to snow skiing.He walked into the water, strapped his feet onto the small, oddly shaped board and latched his kite onto his harness. Then he leaned back in the water like an overturned turtle. As the kite caught wind, Poler popped up and blasted toward Alcatraz Island.The Silicon Valley elite have long loved extreme water sports (there is an entire tech and kitesurfing conference circuit). Now they have upgraded them. And suddenly, the tech world is participating in a sport most of the country has never seen.In workshops around San Francisco and Hawaii, craftsmen and technologists are hooking hydrofoils \u2014 a lifting surface attached to the bottom of a watercraft \u2014 onto seemingly everything. Versions include a jetfoiler, which looks like a surfboard with a rudder and a tiny hidden motor; the SUP foil, a stand-up paddle board with a foil; and the kitefoil, which is like a kiteboard but has a foil.\u201cNow we all foil,\u201d Poler said.Just as it did for the America\u2019s Cup, foiling adds both speed and danger.\u201cFalling from four feet in the air at 40 miles an hour, the wipeouts are pretty spectacular,\u201d said Joey Pasquale, 34, a tugboat captain and foiler. \u201cI broke two ribs earlier this year.\u201dIt was a typical cold summer night in San Francisco as the racers competed.Stretching against his van was Johnny Heineken, 29, one of the world\u2019s top foilers, and a mechanical engineer for Alphabet Inc.\u2019s experimental technologies lab, X.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of tactical sailing and a high-performance action sport,\u201d said Heineken, who wore a straw hat and Tevas. \u201cAnd then it just feels great. You fly around the bay.\u201dNico Parlier, 22, a professional foiler visiting from France, said that the French racers had been using the technology for years but that Americans took it more seriously.\u201cThey took it to a different level,\u201d Parlier said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very cheap sport, and people here are very wealthy, so it\u2019s a good combination.\u201d\u201cThey look you up, or they have a friend, and all of a sudden you\u2019re hanging out with Larry and Sergey,\u201d Montague said, referring to Google\u2019s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.At a massive former naval base in Alameda, Calif., Montague has a staff of 10 working on inflatable foils, jetfoils and giant foil boats. His investors and clients include the Google founders and its former chief executive Eric Schmidt.Montague, with messy brown hair and a surfer\u2019s drawl, had made a name for himself building kitesurfing gear, selling more than 20,000 of those boards (he claims to have named the sport). In 2013, he founded a wind-power company and sold it to Google. But a motorized inflatable jetfoil is more complicated than a simple kiteboard, so he moved from Hawaii to the Bay Area and assembled a staff of mechanical engineers and designers.\u201cI had to come here to build the team,\u201d Montague said. \u201cThis is the foiling spot for America.\u201dMontague is a regular on the private-island and yacht circuit with people like the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Google\u2019s Page, whose islands are close enough to foil between. There is some competition in the small community. When Google\u2019s Brin surfed with two girls on his board, Montague said, Branson took a photo with three.\u201cIt\u2019s just way better than golfing,\u201d Montague said.Now, once a week, Montague said, he takes Page on a four-hour kitefoiling trip, with a chase boat and a water scooter in tow. Long trips are easier by foil, since the board is not bouncing on every wave.\u201cThere\u2019s less wear on the body because you\u2019re not absorbing the chop,\u201d Montague said.Montague\u2019s jetfoil goes to market this spring, selling for around $5,000. His competition is the Lift eFoil, which costs $12,000 and will ship in September (with a five-month waiting list).Just a few miles north of Montague in El Sobrante, Calif., is the craftsman Mike Zajicek, who foilers say makes the best in the world.\u201cTo get a foil from Zajicek takes a year,\u201d Montague said. \u201cIf he likes you.\u201dFor the past few years, Zajicek has made his hydrofoils by hand, selling them for around $6,000 each. In total, he estimates he has sold 110 foils, and has 50 in construction. This year, the demand skyrocketed. He said hundreds are on a waiting list.\u201cNow the whole world is banging on my door, and I have to attempt to answer emails I have no answers for,\u201d Zajicek said.What kind of questions?\u201cLike, \u2018When am I getting my board?\u2019\u201d he said.Zajicek\u2019s house and workshop in El Sobrante are covered in wisteria. Inside, he has laid out layers of carbon fiber. An intern is in charge of duties such as altering the weld nuts. Nothing was originally built to be a foilboard, so Zajicek came up with his design through trial and error.\u201cIts limitless in the choices you can make,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 100 different pieces go in this thing. I kept fiddling, combining different wings and masts and fuselages.\u201dHe cuts the carbon fiber with scissors, brushes each layer with epoxy resin, then carefully applies the next layer. He puts on \u201csome pretty powerful reading glasses\u201d to aid in his precision. After 20 layers, which usually takes him about three hours, he puts the foil in an oven.He tests each foil, flexing it between his hands for give and tension. He takes most of them on the water himself. Then he sends the board out to the buyer.Back in San Francisco Bay, the foilers were wrapping up. The water was cold and choppy. The foilers made a nearby windsurfer look as if he were standing still. Some foilers fell, their kites sweeping down as the chase boat went to pick them up.Afterward, they shared a beer in the parking lot before heading to the nearby St. Francis Yacht Club for burgers and fish tacos. The club decided to classify the foils as yachts to allow the peculiar new athletes in.They brag to one another about gaming their corporate calendar systems for more foiling time. Stefaans Viljoen, 40, tailgating before joining the rest of the foilers at the club, had not won that night\u2019s race but said he would be back in the water by morning.\u201cI have my C.T.O. book Fridays as busy 11 a.m. onward,\u201d Viljoen said of his chief technology officer.Advertisement"}

Those fortunate hundreds \u2014 she was a discerning collector \u2014 knew Nora the stinging commentator as well as Nora the productive romantic-comedy queen of the Upper West Side. And when she died in 2012, at the age of 71, following an illness she kept so secret that many of those closest to her were stunned, they were able to mourn Nora Ephron as a woman and artist in full.The rest of us each embraced the kind of Nora we needed, based on our age and experience with romantic heartburn. And by \u201cus\u201d I of course invite men, but really, it\u2019s women who have always considered Ephron family, allying with \u201cMy Nora\u201d the way \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d devotees might claim \u201cMy Jane\u201d Austen. Those of us who lived through the times she wrote about in her classic essay collections \u201cCrazy Salad\u201d (1975) and \u201cScribble Scribble\u201d (1978) \u2014 indeed, who read the books when they were too new to qualify as \u201cclassic,\u201d and who feel the melancholy that drives the mordant humor of her 2006 collection, \u201cI Feel Bad About My Neck\u201d \u2014 cherish Our Nora as a lively, opinionated sister who cut through crap.Those who weren\u2019t around the first time are the audience for \u201cI\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having,\u201d written by Erin Carlson, a 30-something entertainment journalist who, through no fault of her own, wasn\u2019t there either. Carlson has done her library research, conducted informational interviews and Googled her unfamiliar names. She is able to explain to her generation that the movie producer Ray Stark was \u201ca towering Hollywood figure\u201d whose \u201ctactics were cutthroat, part of the legend,\u201d and that Leona Helmsley, \u201cnicknamed the Queen of Mean, was a very successful hotelier and real estate developer joined in marriage and business to self-made billionaire Harry Helmsley, her third husband.\u201d She also assumes her readers will know what she means when she says that \u201cNora, like a proto-Taylor Swift, channeled heartbreak into pop art,\u201d and that Tom Hanks\u2019s emails in \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d are \u201cthe fantasy edition of what every woman hopes to find, and rarely does, on Tinder (where grammar goes to die).\u201d Old-school Ephron ladies say, Say what?As any fan of any generation probably knows, the title \u201cI\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having\u201d comes from a defining verbal zinger in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026,\u201d the enduring 1989 romantic comedy written by Ephron, directed by Rob Reiner, and starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as the title couple exploring the possibilities (and impossibilities) of nonsexual friendship between a man and a woman. What Sally is having is a fake orgasm, in a crowded deli, demonstrated for Harry to make a point about women and sex.The movie won Ephron a screenwriting Oscar nomination and landed an entry of honor in modern cinema history as an unconventionally literate variation on the conventions of romantic comedy. It also set Ephron on an unexpected path to fame in a territory those of us who were around the first time would never have believed of My Nora who wrote the 1972 essay \u201cOn Never Having Been a Prom Queen.\u201d Bringing tousled Ryan and her sparkle along with her, folding in reliably delightful Hanks, and learning her way on the job as director as well as co-screenwriter, Ephron went on to devise a twist on the 1957 Leo McCarey beaut \u201cAn Affair to Remember\u201d with \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d in 1993, and a variation on the peerless 1940 Ernst Lubitsch confection \u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d with \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d in 1998.More movie work followed that \u2014 some good, some less so, since Ephron\u2019s strength was never as a distinctive filmmaker with a cohesive style or graceful storytelling structure; she was always more interested in words on the page than in cinematic movement. That Carlson lacks the authority or experience to confidently analyze what Nora Ephron did and didn\u2019t do as a filmmaker of romantic comedies \u2014 and fills the empty space with blog-post-like extras about what the director wore on the set \u2014 is the main reason this reader of neck-fretting age is not having what the impressionable author and her underanalyzed pop-culture project is having. Even as my generation steps aside, willingly, for younger writers and younger readers, we on the way out can be caught up short by the perspective lost as the parameters of \u201cback then\u201d shift in the analysis of pop culture.But I digress! I have other harrumphs, too, from someone too old for this party. The author lures the browser with the subtitle \u201cHow Nora Ephron\u2019s Three Iconic Films Saved the Romantic Comedy,\u201d anchoring her survey on \u201cHarry/Sally,\u201d \u201cSleepless\u201d and \u201cMail.\u201d My Nora would hate the hot air in the word \u201ciconic,\u201d but never mind: Nothing in \u201cI\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having\u201d makes a persuasive case for why \u201cSleepless\u201d and \u201cMail\u201d can be considered in the same category of excellence as \u201cHarry/Sally\u201d (me, I say they\u2019re not); neither does Carlson make a convincing argument for why the romantic comedy needed saving (me, I say it didn\u2019t, not if one looks at Hollywood history more fully); nor does she elucidate how Ephron saved the genre and shaped what came after (me, I say hooey).So it\u2019s back to the factoids, the digressive details about ancillary players and the awkwardly shoehorned, slapdash sociological observations (\u201cAs it happened, the Sandra Dee-ification of Meg Ryan held a mirror to sexually anxious times\u201d). There is also an obligatory race-and-gender disclaimer, during which Carlson soberly notes that Ephron\u2019s \u201cfatal flaw\u201d was living in a bubble. \u201cWhile Nora created worlds in which we all wanted to live, her daffy, urban universes included mainly straight white people and couples at the unfortunate expense of diversity,\u201d she recites, like a pledge of allegiance \u2014 and even then, she doesn\u2019t stick to her own undeveloped thought. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d Carlson continues, \u201cNora persists as an icon in the same big league as equally complex, multifaceted rom-com pioneers Woody Allen, Preston Sturges and Ernst Lubitsch, the master himself.\u201dI would like to challenge every word of that sentence \u2014 on Twitter, where grammar goes to die.Lisa Schwarzbaum, a former critic at Entertainment Weekly, is a freelance journalist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anita Hill: Class Actions Could Fight Discrimination in Tech", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe recent leak of a Google engineer\u2019s screed against the company\u2019s diversity initiatives is a reminder that the notion of Silicon Valley as the seat of human progress is a myth \u2014 at least when it comes to the way the women behind the latest in technology are treated.The tech industry is stuck in the past, more closely resembling \u201cMad Men\u201d-era Madison Avenue or 1980s Wall Street than a modern egalitarian society. It may take the force of our legal system to change that.Sadly, these types of cases represent only one element of the industrywide discrimination against women in tech. There\u2019s also an alarming gap in pay and promotions, which has devastating effects on women\u2019s careers.Instead, women in the industry should collectively consider their legal options. Top among these would be class-action discrimination cases against employers.The tech sector is not the first white-collar \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d to demand an industrywide correction. In the 1990s, Wall Street firms faced a slew of class-action discrimination lawsuits. Perhaps the most notable was the 1996 \u201cBoom Boom Room\u201d case. A group of 23 women filed a class-action lawsuit against the Smith Barney stock brokerage firm, charging it with rampant harassment and gender discrimination. By the time Smith Barney settled the case for $150 million, nearly 2,000 women had joined the suit and helped expose a culture of sexism to the outside world.As a result of this and other cases that similarly challenged systemic practices at other Wall Street firms, many of these companies now have more extensive human-resource policies addressing sexual harassment and gender discrimination. While pay and promotion discrimination still exists, more women on Wall Street are advancing in their careers to managing directorship and other leadership roles. The lesson of these cases is clear: Class-action lawsuits can force industrywide change, even in the most entrenched, male-dominated industries.Women in tech no doubt have hurdles to bringing class-action lawsuits, including the requisite preponderance of statistical evidence and the prevalence of confidentiality clauses and arbitration agreements, which are, in effect, designed to pre-empt class actions. But this challenge doesn\u2019t mean the suits cannot be brought, or won. This is a route that the women of Silicon Valley should consider, especially if regulation is not an immediate and viable solution.It\u2019s not just the female plaintiffs who would win if they were to be victorious in court. The economic benefits could be remarkable. Advancing women\u2019s equality, which includes minimizing the gender gap in labor force participation, holds the potential to add $12 trillion to global G.D.P. by 2025.The male-dominated leadership of Silicon Valley has proved unwilling or unable to solve systemic gender inequality, and the leaked Google memo should serve as an alert about how deeply and passionately anti-equality attitudes are held. It\u2019s time women in tech consider taking advantage of the law to disrupt the industry once and for all.Anita Hill is of counsel to Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, a national plaintiffs\u2019 law firm.Advertisement"}

Lee in the West \u2014 has said he was na\u00efve.\u201cIn retrospect I had a lot of shortcomings and didn\u2019t take care of the things that needed to be taken care of, and that\u2019s all my fault,\u201d he told the court earlier this month. \u201cIt was my responsibility. I have no excuses.\u201dMr. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, has been the top leader of the Samsung group of companies since its chairman and his father, Lee Kun-hee, slipped into a coma three years ago. While Samsung is famous around the world for its smartphones and televisions, the Lee family also controls companies that make ships and pharmaceuticals, issue credit cards and manage hotels, among many other businesses.Like other rich South Korean families, the Lees maintain control over the Samsung empire through a complex web of cross-shareholdings between their companies rather than through controlling stakes. Controlling stakes could expose heirs like Mr. Lee to steep inheritance taxes.Prosecutors say Mr. Lee and top Samsung executives paid $38 million in bribes to maintain that control without paying taxes.Mr. Lee and his attorneys say the payments were signed off on without his knowledge. In terms of bribes, he told the court, he mostly reads American and Japanese publications instead of South Korean news outlets, leaving him ignorant of which officials he would need to influence to begin with.\u201cI do receive a summary of daily news, but my work is mostly electronics and I.T.,\u201d he said during the trial, referring to information technology.Regardless of the trial\u2019s outcome, Mr. Lee\u2019s reputation as a corporate leader has been damaged, say some Samsung watchers.\u201cIn the trial you come away with the impression that he is incompetent or at least he didn\u2019t know his own company,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book about Samsung.\u201cEither way his image is taking a hit, and people are starting to see he\u2019s not that good under pressure. He doesn\u2019t speak that fluidly, he tends to pace around and look at the floor, or look nervous. He doesn\u2019t come off as a profound and visionary leader like his father was.\u201dThose who have worked with Mr. Lee describe a man well-mannered and relatively soft-spoken. He is an avid golfer despite receiving dispensation from military service for back problems related to an equestrian accident.Mr. Lee rarely visited factories and did not call the shots day-to-day, according to one former top Samsung official who declined to be named out of concern that he might damage his career by speaking about Mr. Lee.Inside and outside the company, Mr. Lee is often compared with his father, who despite his legal troubles was well regarded for improving quality at Samsung Electronics and for making it a major global brand.Perhaps mindful of the comparisons, Samsung has touted Mr. Lee\u2019s own accomplishments, including solidifying relationships with American technology companies like Google and Apple. But until he became Samsung\u2019s de facto leader he was not known for running a business by himself.His first high-profile venture was created in 2000, during the dot-com boom, when he had an incubator set up to fund and support a series of start-up investments through Samsung. Called eSamsung, the venture struggled as the dot-com bubble burst, and the shares were eventually bought up by Samsung.At the trial, Mr. Lee has said he tried to live up to the reputation of his father and his grandfather, Samsung\u2019s founder.\u201cI\u2019ve been anxious, and I\u2019ve struggled under heavy pressure to follow their footsteps and not lead Samsung down a wrong path,\u201d he told the court earlier this month.\u201cBut I missed the biggest part: The expectations of people and society on Samsung have grown stricter and bigger. I\u2019ve learned a lot from the investigations and the trial. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201dJeyup S. Kwaak reported from Seoul, and Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Investor Sues Travis Kalanick for Fraud", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the heart of the suit is how Mr. Kalanick obtained outsize control of several Uber board seats in 2016, which Benchmark said he achieved through \u201cmaterial misstatements and fraudulent concealment\u201d of information. Mr. Kalanick\u2019s \u201coverarching objective is to pack Uber\u2019s board with loyal allies in an effort to insulate his prior conduct from scrutiny and clear the path for his eventual return as C.E.O. \u2014 all to the detriment of Uber\u2019s stockholders, employees, driver-partners, and customers,\u201d the suit said.The suit added that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position on Uber\u2019s board \u201cis thus improper and inequitable, and should be invalidated.\u201dBenchmark\u2019s suit shows that the balance of power is delicate. Investors will go to great lengths to undercut a company founder if they believe their investment is endangered.A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.\u201d The spokesman said Benchmark was acting in \u201cits own best interests\u201d instead of those of Uber, and added that Mr. Kalanick \u201cis confident that these entirely baseless claims will be rejected.\u201dMr. Kalanick is not interested in returning to Uber as chief executive, according to a person involved in the proceedings, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Others have said Mr. Kalanick wants to be a shadow leader without necessarily having the chief executive title.Benchmark invested in Uber six years ago, when the ride-hailing service was a minnow. Bill Gurley, a Benchmark partner, joined the company\u2019s board at the time. Benchmark\u2019s then-20 percent stake in Uber has now ballooned into one worth of billions of dollars.Benchmark currently owns a 13 percent stake in Uber, and Mr. Kalanick has a 10 percent chunk, according to the suit. Even so, Mr. Kalanick has significant clout over the company.That\u2019s partly because of a move he made in June 2016, which the suit hones in on. At the time, Mr. Kalanick got Benchmark to approve an amendment to the company\u2019s charter that gave him the right to nominate three new directors to add to Uber\u2019s eight-member board. According to the suit, Benchmark would never have agreed to the move had it known of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s \u201cgross mismanagement and other misconduct at Uber.\u201dYet Mr. Kalanick deliberately hid the problems at Uber, Benchmark claimed in the suit, and therefore he obtained the rights over the three new board seats fraudulently.After Mr. Kalanick stepped down in June, he also left the board seat that is designated for the chief executive, the suit said. Mr. Kalanick then immediately reappointed himself to one of the three new board seats that he controlled through the 2016 amendment. He has since refused to give up control of the other two board seats, according to the suit.In public, the board said there was a d\u00e9tente. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to serve with him on the board,\u201d said the board about Mr. Kalanick in a statement at the time.In the suit, Benchmark said it was seeking a judgment that the 2016 amendment to Uber\u2019s corporate charter should be voided, and asked for an injunction to stop Mr. Kalanick from participating in Uber board matters.\u201cKalanick\u2019s improper actions, if allowed to continue, would cause irreparable harm to Uber by exposing it to reputational, regulatory and other risks,\u201d Benchmark said in the suit.In bold, black lettering splayed across a PowerPoint slide behind Mr. Kalanick was the following phrase: \u201cV.C.s tend to kill founding C.E.O.s.\u201d\u201cThere are forces all around you to take you out,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in his presentation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crisis Forces Google to Uphold Its Values While Fostering Debate", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemegen, an internal forum that uses images overlaid with funny captions, was filled with irreverent posts that openly mocked how an email discussing the memo from Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, had leaked to the media so quickly. Other posts, seen in screenshots of Memegen that were shared with The New York Times by a Google employee, questioned why Google seemed to be taking cues from outsiders.Memegen is one of many outlets provided by Google to allow employees to express themselves, argue, criticize products or policies, and even protest decisions by management.Google\u2019s liberal stance toward self-expression, enabled by those online forums, was created in part to show that it is not bound by the conventions that stifle more stodgy companies.And Google employees typically have a lot to say. There are about 87,000 Google groups \u2014 essentially email lists formed around a central theme \u2014 and more than 8,000 discussion groups like \u201cmisc\u201d \u2014 short for miscellaneous \u2014 where employees debate and disagree on topics ranging from the optimal temperature in the office to the brand of laundry detergent the company should use for washing employee towels.That openness has gone hand-in-hand with the expectation that what was said at Google would stay within Google. That\u2019s a big challenge when Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, now employs 76,000 employees around the world.He was fired on Monday, and the situation quickly escalated. Someone with access to an employee-only version of Google Plus made screenshots of messages written by Google employees pledging to create blacklists of colleagues not supportive of the company\u2019s diversity measures.\u201cIn recognition of Googlers\u2019 concerns, we need to step back and create a better set of conditions for us to have the discussion,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote.\u201cSome of the recent discourse on Memegen and elsewhere within the company has been, shall we say, less than civil. Memegen, Misc, Internal G+ and our many discussion groups are a big part of our culture \u2014 they keep us honest \u2014 but like any conversation amongst colleagues, we should keep it respectful,\u201d wrote Brian Katz, a Google director of protective services, investigations and intelligence.Erica Baker, the engineer who created the document and has since left the company, said she was reprimanded by her manager for the spreadsheet and was denied bonuses awarded to her peers. Google employees said the spreadsheet caused some headaches for human resources, but the company did not take down the document.In his memo, Mr. Damore suggested that Google wasn\u2019t quite so open. He said the company\u2019s political biases created \u201ca politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.\u201d He said that if Google couldn\u2019t have an honest discussion about the gender gap at the company, it could never truly solve the problem.Perhaps not surprisingly, his memo was also mocked on Memegen.Shortly after Mr. Pichai canceled the companywide meeting, he spoke at a coding event for young women being held on Google\u2019s campus in Mountain View, Calif. He stressed the importance of women in the technology and urged them to build things that will be used widely in the future.\u201cI know the journey won\u2019t always be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to the girls who dream of being an engineer or an entrepreneur, and who dream of creating amazing things: I want you to know that there\u2019s a place for you in this industry, there\u2019s a place for you at Google.

{"Headline": "Google and Walmart Partner With Eye on Amazon", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google and Walmart are testing the notion that an enemy\u2019s enemy is a friend.The two companies said Google would start offering Walmart products to people who shop on Google Express, the company\u2019s online shopping mall. It\u2019s the first time the world\u2019s biggest retailer has made its products available online in the United States outside of its own website.But working together does not ensure that they will be any more successful. For most consumers, Amazon remains the primary option for online shopping. No other retailer can match the size of Amazon\u2019s inventory, the efficiency with which it moves shoppers from browsing to buying, or its many home delivery options.Walmart customers can link their accounts to Google, allowing the technology giant to learn their past shopping behavior to better predict what they want in the future. Google said that because more than 20 percent of searches conducted on smartphones these days are done by voice, it expects voice-based shopping to be not far behind.Google is a laggard in e-commerce. Since starting a shopping service in 2013, it has struggled to gather significant momentum. Initially, it offered free same-day delivery before scrapping it. It also tried delivery of groceries before abandoning that, too.If Amazon is a department store with just about everything inside, then Google Express is a shopping mall populated by different retailers. There are more than 50 retailers on Google Express, including Target and Costco. Inside Google Express, a search for \u201ctoothpaste\u201d will bring back options from about a dozen different retailers.Google said it planned to offer free delivery \u2014 as long as shoppers met store purchase minimums \u2014 on products purchased on Google Express. Google had charged customers a $95 a year membership for free delivery. Amazon runs a similar program called Amazon Prime, offering free delivery for members who pay $99 a year.In January, Walmart began offering free, two-day shipping on more than two million items \u2014 a move that takes direct aim at Amazon Prime, whose members who pay an annual fee for fast shipping and other services like movie streaming.Walmart has also been trying to integrate its digital business with its vast network of more than 4,690 stores.Many brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling with what to do with their increasingly empty stores, but Walmart is partially repurposing its stores into e-commerce fulfillment centers.Customers can now order their groceries online and then pick them up at hundreds of stores. For some items that they purchase online and pick up in a store, customers receive a discount. In-store pickup reduces shipping costs for Walmart, but offers a similar level of convenience to the shopper as home delivery.The efforts seem to be paying off. Walmart said last week that its online sales \u2014 including online grocery \u2014 increased 60 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. It was a big driver in the company\u2019s overall increase in quarterly sales.Efforts like online grocery seem to be gaining traction, but Walmart hopes the benefits of other moves \u2014 like its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an online retailer focused on urban millennials, and its purchase of the boutique clothing businesses Modcloth and Bonobos \u2014 will come down the road.Some analysts question how Walmart will add to its core low-price retail business at the same time it is trying to manage bolt-on acquisitions. While the company\u2019s sales were up, its profit margins in the second quarter slipped, in part because of its spending on e-commerce initiatives. With this new partnership, Google Express will offer items only from Walmart.com, and not from Jet.com or Walmart\u2019s online clothing sites.\u201cWalmart can\u2019t lose on the low-cost proposition,\u201d said Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of Vivaldi, a brand consulting firm. \u201cBut convenience, convenience that is where the game lies.\u201dWalmart has a long way to go to catch Amazon. Walmart\u2019s website sells 67 million items, up from 10 million early last year. Amazon sells hundreds of millions of items.In July, about 83.6 million people visited Walmart\u2019s website, nearly half as many visitors as Amazon had, according to comScore, a media measurement company. Jet drew an additional 10.9 million visitors.\u201cI am not saying Walmart is ever going to catch Amazon online,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. \u201cBut instead of being embarrassed by Amazon, it can be a strong No. 2.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a partnership between Walmart and Google misstated the role of the Google Assistant, the artificially intelligent software assistant, in the relationship with Walmart. The eventual plan is for Walmart customers to be able to buy products using the Google Assistant; customers cannot do that now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge University Press Removes Academic Articles on Chinese Site", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 One of the world\u2019s oldest and most respected publishing houses, Cambridge University Press, has bowed to pressure from Beijing and removed sensitive content on its site in China.The content is published in China Quarterly, an academic journal run by the press. In a letter made public on social media on Friday, the editor of the journal, Tim Pringle, said Cambridge University Press had informed him that the authorities had ordered it to censor more than 300 articles related to issues like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the Cultural Revolution. The publishing house\u2019s site risked being shut down if it did not comply with the request, the letter said.In response to the government\u2019s actions, the journal issued a statement expressing its \u201cdeep concern and disappointment.\u201d\u201cWe note, too, that this restriction of academic freedom is not an isolated move but a further reflection of policies that have narrowed the space for public engagement and discussion across Chinese society,\u201d the statement said.Dr. Pringle said in a telephone interview that Chinese academics, who had been publishing in the journal in increasing numbers, would suffer the most. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a retrograde step in principle, but it affects Chinese scholars in particular\u201d he said, because they will not have access to global scholarship on the country.\u201cIt\u2019s a real pity that as China goes out to the world, it is accompanied by restrictions on academic freedom,\u201d he added.Cambridge University Press confirmed the deletions in a statement, saying it had done so to safeguard its other publications. It also vowed to raise censorship with the authorities at meetings next week. \u201cWe will not change the nature of our publishing to make content acceptable in China, and we remain committed to ensuring that access to a wide variety of publishing is possible for academics, researchers, students and teachers in this market,\u201d the publishing house said.Some of the censored articles date from the journal\u2019s founding in the 1960s. They are available to subscribers outside China, but searches in China omit them.In addition, the press voluntarily removed more than 1,000 e-books from its site, according to Dr. Pringle\u2019s letter.Until now, foreign academic presses were largely immune to this sort of censorship. In recent years, the websites of most foreign news organizations have been blocked in China, as have social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and the search engine Google.But because of their small readership, and high subscription costs (one China Quarterly article costs more than $20), academic journals were not targeted.The new measures seem in line with announcements made by President Xi Jinping in February 2016 that all media content on any platform must come under the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cguidance.\u201d\u201cThe same rules apply to any foreign content, academic or otherwise, that is accessible within China,\u201d said David Bandurski, the co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. \u201cGiven Xi Jinping\u2019s determination to rein in dissenting views in the information space, foreign publishers are misleading themselves if they believe they can escape pressure like that facing China Quarterly.\u201dPerforming the same search within China, however, yields only five hits, either tangential mentions or urban-planning articles about the square.The block appears to go beyond Cambridge University Press\u2019s website to include searches through third-party databases, including JSTOR, a digital library that academics around the world use to perform full-text searches of nearly 2,000 journals, including China Quarterly.As of Friday night, it was unclear whether all JSTOR access was now blocked in China.After news of the censorship spread, academics inside and outside China expressed alarm.\u201cThis is unprecedented that the censorship has reached out to the academic sphere,\u201d said Zhan Jiang, a professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, adding that for Chinese scholars, \u201cThis means that there will be limits and more hardships on their research.\u201dThe block can be bypassed by using software known as a virtual private network, or VPN, which makes it seem as if the user is in a different location. VPNs are commonly used by foreigners and a small minority of Chinese internet users to reach blocked sites.But the vast number of Chinese internet users, including academics, do not have access to reliable VPNs, which require some sort of foreign payment method, like a credit card.Such decisions underline the difficulties of doing business in China while offering any sort of delicate content. Already, foreign media companies including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times have had to ratchet back business plans in China because the government has blocked access to their services, making it hard to attract Chinese readers and slowing advertising revenue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How The Times Coordinated Coverage of Hurricane Harvey", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, the Times correspondent Alan Blinder was in Atlanta. Julie Turkewitz was in Denver; Audra Burch, Miami. Monica Davey was in Chicago, where she is the Times bureau chief, as was the photojournalist Alyssa Schukar.But by Tuesday, they were all in Texas, fanned out across the swath of devastation left by Hurricane Harvey. They are among nearly two dozen reporters, photojournalists and videographers sent by The Times to cover what has become a national disaster of staggering scale.Coordinating that effort \u2014 articles, videos, photography and graphics \u2014 falls to The Times\u2019s national editor, Marc Lacey, and a team of 20 editors. Before the airports closed, Mr. Lacey dispatched Ms. Turkewitz and Mr. Blinder to Houston to prepare. Already there were Manny Fernandez, the Houston bureau chief, and Clifford Krauss, who covers the energy industry. By Sunday, Mr. Krauss\u2019s own home would be flooded.As Harvey loomed, Mr. Fernandez went to Rockport, Tex., where the storm made landfall Friday night. Mr. Blinder and Ms. Schukar spent Saturday reporting from Victoria, Tex., which was left without running water or electricity. \u201cBy Sunday morning,\u201d Mr. Blinder said, \u201cit was becoming very clear that Houston was at the beginning of an extraordinary natural disaster.\u201d They called Mr. Lacey in New York and said it might still be possible to get back into Houston before the water was too deep. Mr. Lacey agreed that they should try.As they entered Houston, Mr. Blinder and Ms. Schukar\u2019s rental car stalled out and had to be abandoned by the road. They found their way to a section of Interstate 610 where emergency workers were staging rescues. By then the water was so high, Mr. Blinder said, \u201cthey were basically using the interstate as a boat ramp.\u201dMs. Schukar headed into the floodwaters on a resident\u2019s boat to document the flood and rescue efforts. Mr. Blinder stayed on the interstate to speak with survivors arriving there. \u201cEvery time I looked up, it seemed there were more people coming in,\u201d he said. They \u201clooked so weary and tired and terrified, and they just kept coming.\u201dOn the boat, Ms. Schukar passed landmarks she\u2019d driven past two days before. They were constantly in danger of hitting submerged cars, which \u201cwould have either capsized us or ruined the propeller, rendering us stranded and useless,\u201d she said. Navigating by Google Maps, the men she rode with tried to find the homes of friends. \u201cAs the day went on, we saw more and more people who needed help. It was heartbreaking to be so powerless.\u201dIn East Houston, Ms. Turkewitz weighed the dangers of wading through the water when it got too deep to drive. At one point, attempting to reach an interviewee, she had a realization. \u201cI was like, you know what? This is gasoline all around me. I should not be in this.\u201d Later, she came across a man carrying a machete \u2014 for snakes and crocodiles, he said.Back in New York, Mr. Lacey was working to expand and deepen The Times\u2019s coverage. \u201cThe key for the editors now,\u201d he said, as more and more Times personnel began arriving in Texas in the immediate wake of the storm, \u201cis coordinating, and keeping them on top of a story that is breaking out over a large area in which it\u2019s hard to get around.\u201dThe goal, Mr. Lacey said, was to put readers in the shoes of those affected by the disaster. \u201cStories that make me feel like the water is up to my waist and the wind is blowing and I\u2019m in the middle of that storm,\u201d he said.Even more striking than the storm itself for Mr. Blinder have been the people he has encountered while covering it.\u201cPeople are often very willing to share their stories with us, and we consider it a privilege to hear those stories,\u201d he said.Even when he has time to snatch some rest, he finds himself waking up, worrying about his colleagues and the people he has met. \u201cEven when you\u2019re tired, you wake up in the night wondering if you\u2019ve missed something,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wake up wondering what else is going on out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A sector that is getting somewhat less attention? Driverless trucks.In the British trial, up to three vehicles will travel in a convoy, each with a driver who can take control if required.

Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn.The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts.Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues.Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon\u2019s cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall.While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale. In particular Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba runs its own cloud services, which have grown rapidly in China.

For one thing, there is probably no easier place to be a Democrat, given the party\u2019s utter dominance of state government. For another, many of the country\u2019s Democrats have looked to California for hope and leadership in this age of Trump.So it may come as something as a surprise that the Democratic Party is enmeshed in a divisive leadership fight. The new chairman, Eric C. Bauman, won by 57 votes out of 3,000 at the party convention in May, but his main opponent, Kimberly Ellis, has challenged the outcome, saying she will take it to court. This has left a pained Mr. Bauman struggling to put the election behind him even as he tries to move forward.But should this be that much of a shock? That old line \u2014 a happy Democrat is an unhappy Democrat; or maybe it\u2019s the other way around \u2014 applies as much in California as anywhere (and as much to Republicans as Democrats). There has always been a divide here between liberal and moderate Democrats, and with the party so firmly in control of the state, the stakes here have only become higher.Peter Ragone, who worked for the Democratic Party in New York and California, said the left wing in California was now ascendant, unsettling an uneasy truce and creating the kind of problems Mr. Bauman is facing now.\u201cAs California party chair, you are always under scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Ragone said. \u201cAnd since we are going through a transition, it makes the job all the more harder.\u201dMr. Bauman also is dealing with accusations that he comes across as a bullying New York boss (he was born in the Bronx). Nothing new there: Political leaders here tend to be colorful, combative and more profane than profound. But Mr. Ragone had one bit of advice for Mr. Bauman, an old friend: Watch that New York stuff, which doesn\u2019t work so well on this coast.\u201cHe has the affect and probably some of the political skill set which comes from being a New Yorker, where every day is a knife fight in a phone booth,\u201d Mr. Ragone said. \u201cIn the long term he won\u2019t be able to sustain that.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Never heard of it?

That is where Aina, a modern Hawaiian restaurant whose brunch has spawned a citywide mania, opened last year in April in a small light-flooded corner space.Aina\u2019s chef, a tall 30-year-old man with a broad smile named Jordan Keao, grew up in the rural hinterlands of the Big Island of Hawaii. After a stint at the celebrated Bay Area restaurant La Folie, Mr. Keao labored in Silicon Valley, running the Hangout Cafe at Google for a time. But he missed the heady mash-up of the food on which he was raised and bristled at the ignorance in which his ancient culture was held.\u201cThe only thing anyone knew about Hawaiian culture out here,\u201d he said, \u201cwas pineapple and ham on a pizza.\u201dThus Aina was born. The name comes from a Hawaiian concept that conveys love of the land. Since the 38-seat restaurant is about 2,300 miles from the land he loves, for Mr. Keao that means a lot of air miles.Aina\u2019s menu is both international and uniquely Hawaiian. It courses with the often fractious history of the island. Influences include Portuguese (plump guava-stuffed doughnuts called malasadas), Japanese (bento boxes and furikake rice) and American (artisanal Spam from Stone Valley Farm).But there are plenty of native Hawaiian dishes, like pipikaula, a type of Hawaiian beef jerky here made with shoyu-cured short rib and accessorized with puffed paiai, or taro root. Even better-known dishes like poke are creatively tweaked: Aina\u2019s comes with limu (Hawaiian algae), inamona (a relish made of kukui nuts), fresh hearts of palm, smoked sesame oil, shiso and sea grass. (Mr. Keao is planning a tasting menu for later this summer.)\u201cI\u2019m here to challenge people about what they think they know about Hawaii,\u201d Mr. Keao said, \u201cand teach them about the land I love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Well, the other day I found the whole bear family lounging around the pool. Papa bear was firing up the grill.\u201d Naturally when I rented a house in the woods outside of Woodstock this July, I wondered if I had a chance of spotting a bear, too.My landlord, who has lived here for 50 years and was once a wilderness guide, hasn\u2019t seen them much on this property. He saw one once in the woods behind the yard. There was a bear in Woodstock this spring that broke into a house, he says. The conservation guys \u201csent it to heaven.\u201d The problematic critter around here is a woodchuck that\u2019s been destroying the garden. He plans to send the woodchuck to heaven also.He runs through the usual landlord instructions: how not to burn the house down, the owner-specific intricacies of the compost heap. His method: Toss the food waste over the fence into the woods.I settle into country life. Much of that involves battling the kitchen ants, which are the sea gulls of the Catskills \u2014 they see the tiniest crumb, they\u2019re on it. These ants are specks themselves. I thought they were coffee grounds until one of them yelled, \u201cCharge!\u201dI also keep an eye on the woodchuck, which runs like a fat man. I have grown fond of it, and I am relieved to see it is not the garden perp. All it eats is the lawn.I forget about bears. Then, early one morning, I look out my bedroom window and there one is, just a few feet from the house.It\u2019s dark brown and much, much bigger than I expected \u2014 my estimate, based on a full-length mink I once owned, is 400 pounds. It\u2019s enormous; a Smart car with fur. I run upstairs to wake my guest but by the time we come down the bear is gone.I text my landlord:\u201cThe brown ones are afraid of us, right?\u201dHe texts right back:\u201cYes, they are afraid to the extent that they don\u2019t need to protect their young. It was probably looking for ants among the rocks, although compost can attract them. If I were very concerned I would not have a compost pile. It may have been dark brown, but we only have the black bear species here. I would not try cornering it or running past it in a bunny outfit.\u201dThese ants are tiny \u2014 what nutritional value or taste could they have? Bears must have some palate. Still, I hate those ants. If the enemy of my enemy is my friend, does that mean the bear is on my side and we should go for lunch?I also find a lot of vitriol about stupid city people who don\u2019t dispose of garbage properly and even feed wild animals, which annoys me. I might have put out a few cherries for the woodchuck, but we were pals.You know how things get scarier at night, particularly when there are no streetlamps? This is how it goes with me.What I can\u2019t stop thinking about are those bear break-ins. I am not in my 15th-story Manhattan apartment with a doorman who would say to the bear, \u201cIs Joyce expecting you?\u201d and then the wily creature would say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a surprise.

I hear she likes that.\u201d I am in a house in the woods, with a flimsy back door that is mostly glass.Doing a Google search for \u201cbear break-ins\u201d is not helpful. A bear broke through a window into a kid\u2019s bedroom in Alaska; others have smashed through screen doors. Bears have an acute sense of smell; one ripped open a car to get to an empty potato chip bag. There are peaches ripening on my living room table; to a bear three miles away that\u2019s probably like walking past Fairway. If confronted by a black bear stand your ground and speak calmly to it, establishing that you are not prey. If it attacks, use bear spray. (Oh, darn, I forgot to pack it.)I call my college roommate, who for many years had a house in the woods.\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be afraid of noise,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could put a pot next to your bed and bang on it.\u201d\u201cYou mean like New York in the \u201970s, when you\u2019d hear a noise in the hall and put a kitchen knife next to the pillow?\u201d I say.\u201cYou could also go home,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s your vacation.

{"Headline": "Disney, Ditching Netflix, Grabs a New Key to the Kingdom", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIs content still king?It was Bill Gates of Microsoft who declared it so in 1996, but the proposition has been repeated so often by Disney executives that it could have served as the company\u2019s corporate slogan.When AT&T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said the deal proved yet again that \u201ccontent is king.\u201d\u201cIs the network \u2014 the platform \u2014 now most important?\u201d asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution \u2014 and a potential new revenue source.These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\u201cAnyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,\u201d said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.\u201dNetflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney\u2019s popular children\u2019s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney\u2019s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming \u2014 especially in the coveted children\u2019s market long dominated by Disney.Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children\u2019s programming.\u201cDisney served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix \u201chas reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn\u2019t really need Disney anymore.\u201dThe question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.And it\u2019s hedging its bet. For now, Disney\u2019s Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn\u2019t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s Disney \u2014 and only a few others.\u201cAfter Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\u201cDisney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cBut they\u2019re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they\u2019ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.\u201dAs Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney\u2019s move is putting \u201ca very settled and successful part of the business model\u201d at risk and \u201cmore aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dMr. Olson agreed. \u201cIf anyone can do it from a content perspective, it\u2019s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming from way behind.\u201dInvestors didn\u2019t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney\u2019s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company\u2019s move wasn\u2019t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. \u201cWe can both do really well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no zero-sum game here.\u201dAlthough it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney\u2019s move into direct-to-consumer distribution \u2014 not to mention the tech world\u2019s rush into original programming \u2014 demonstrates that \u201ccontent is everything these days.\u201dUnlike the old world of cable and broadcast, \u201cthe barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,\u201d he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. \u201cAll the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We\u2019re already good at both.\u201d (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)In short, from Disney\u2019s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, \u201ccontent is more king than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Scales Back Its Ambitions for a Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As new employees were brought into Apple\u2019s secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the company\u2019s next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry.A notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.Five people familiar with Apple\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cTitan,\u201d discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple\u2019s plans.The project\u2019s reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars. Even Waymo, the Google self-driving spinoff that is probably furthest along among Silicon Valley companies, has said repeatedly that it does not plan to produce its own vehicles.Apple\u2019s testing vehicles will carry employees between its various Silicon Valley offices. The new effort is called PAIL, short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the address of the company\u2019s main office in Cupertino, Calif., and a few miles down the road from Palo Alto, Calif.Apple\u2019s in-house shuttle service, which isn\u2019t operational yet, follows Waymo, Uber and a number of car companies that have been testing driverless cars on city streets around the world.But the initial scale of Apple\u2019s driverless ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle.It was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware.From the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays.The team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone.But the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines.There was disagreement about whether Apple should develop a fully autonomous vehicle or a semiautonomous car that could drive itself for stretches but allow the driver to retake control.Steve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people.A similar debate raged inside Google\u2019s self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldn\u2019t be trusted to retake control in an emergency.Even though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apple\u2019s own programming language, or the industry standard, C++.Mr. Zadesky, who worked on the iPod and iPhone, eventually left Titan and took a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons in 2016. He is still at Apple, although he is no longer involved in the project. Mr. Zadesky could not be reached for comment.Mr. Mansfield shelved plans to build a car and focused the project on the underlying self-driving technology. He also laid off some hardware staff, though the exact number of employees dedicated to working on car technology was unclear.More recently, the team has grown again, adding personnel with expertise in autonomous systems, rather than car production.While many companies are pursuing driverless technology and see it as a game changer for car ownership and transportation, no one has figured out how to cash in yet.With expectations reset and the team more focused, people on the Titan project said morale has improved under Mr. Mansfield.

Its sprawling score demands that performers master three hours of complex music: the painstakingly transcribed sounds of European birds.But both those programs were far shorter than the 13-part \u201cCatalogue,\u201d which Messiaen wrote in the 1950s for Yvonne Loriod, his wife and muse. And learning the work requires more than just skill; a successful performance is also a deep dive into ornithology.As Mr. Kigawa prepared for his coming performance, he found himself falling into Messiaen\u2019s obsession. \u201cFor the last couple of months, I was solely into birds,\u201d he said in a recent interview at Le Poisson Rouge. \u201cI can go to Europe and explain everything about them now.\u201dMr. Kigawa also spoke about the intellectual demands of Messiaen\u2019s music, how Google changed his performance of \u201cCatalogue\u201d and why he lies down during intermissions. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Depending on tempo, the duration of this piece can vary pretty widely.Yes, mine is longer. It\u2019s about three hours 15 minutes: a lot of fermatas. I try to take a lot of space and silence, which to me is important. Just like nature. The notation is very meticulously written, very precise. But if you play it as written, it can sound like a metronome. A birdcall is sort of an improvisation, though. Birds don\u2019t read the score. So you have to make it alive.The music is also a form of scientific research. It quotes more than 75 birdcalls. Seventy-seven, to be exact.So how does studying this compare with other piano music? I spent more time at a desk this time. You\u2019re not only trying to arrange the notes. You have to study birds \u2014 how birds sing and also the nature they live in. Messiaen immerses you. It\u2019s now easy, thanks to the internet.You just Googled the birds? Yes, and YouTube. It\u2019s quite amazing. But I actually first studied it before the internet era. European birds \u2014 they aren\u2019t in Japan, so it was completely out of my imagination. Now it\u2019s much easier. You can actually hear a European bird and see a picture. Watching them inspired me a lot. They give the music character.During marathon concerts you never really seem exhausted by physically and intellectually challenging music.People say I look like a monk. I\u2019m just trying to concentrate. And at intermission I will have a Gatorade or bananas, and I\u2019ll lie down.You literally lie down?It\u2019s a good way to refresh your brain. Everyone should do it, for just a few minutes. But I try not to sleep \u2014 that\u2019s no good.Do you mean to seek out long and difficult music? I just play what I like best. I go to libraries, and I go to other people\u2019s concerts and think about what kinds of composers are interesting. There is so much beautiful piano music. I feel sometimes like I\u2019m on a beach. The sand is made up of little grains, and I\u2019ve played only a handful. There\u2019s so much more.Are you planning to play more Messiaen?Well, I\u2019ve played \u201cVingt Regards sur l\u2019Enfant-J\u00e9sus,\u201d \u201c\u00cele de Feu,\u201d \u00e9tudes \u2026Would you play the solo part in \u201cTurangal\u00eela-Symphonie\u201d?I\u2019d love to!

{"Headline": "Comedian Sues Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer as Site Resurfaces From Dark Web", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe comedian and writer Dean Obeidallah filed a defamation lawsuit against the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer on Wednesday, around the same time that the website briefly resurfaced from the dark web with a Russian domain name.\u201cSome of them actually believe I\u2019m a terrorist,\u201d he said.An article on the revived website on Wednesday morning praised President Trump, claiming that his friendly relationship with Vladimir V. Putin was responsible for the site\u2019s new home. \u201cThe Daily Stormer never dies!\u201d the article exclaimed.The website was no longer available by the afternoon.Andrew Anglin, the website\u2019s publisher, told The Associated Press in an email that he had essentially been \u201cbanned from the internet\u201d and that he was having trouble finding a domain registry service that would allow The Daily Stormer\u2019s content.Johnathan J. Smith, a lawyer for Mr. Obeidallah, said in a conference call with reporters that the site\u2019s Russian domain registration placed it \u201caway from any ability for America to hold it accountable.\u201dIf its server is in the United States, however, there may be legal recourse. Until this week, The Daily Stormer used Cloudflare to prevent users from seeing the web server\u2019s location. It was not immediately clear whether that company would provide the IP address of one of its clients if a legal request were made. Samantha Spielman, a spokeswoman for Cloudflare, said, \u201cWhile our policy is to not comment on any user specifically, we are cooperating with law enforcement in any investigation.\u201dCloudflare does not host websites; rather, it \u201cprovides performance and security services,\u201d Ms. Spielman wrote before the termination was announced. Terminating a user, she said, \u201cwould not remove their content from the internet, it would simply make a site slower and more vulnerable to attack.\u201dMr. Prince called his decision \u201cdangerous\u201d in its implications for freedom of speech and due process. \u201cYou, like me, may believe that The Daily Stormer\u2019s site is vile,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou may believe it should be restricted. You may think the authors of the site should be prosecuted. Reasonable people can and do believe all those things. But having the mechanism of content control be vigilante hackers launching DDoS attacks subverts any rational concept of justice.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cWe could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare.\u201d\u201cIn response, they wrote an article calling me a terrorist,\u201d Mr. Obeidallah said in a phone interview, adding that Daily Stormer readers also came after him on Twitter.Mr. Obeidallah didn\u2019t mention The Daily Stormer or Mr. Anglin in that article. But Mr. Anglin responded by fabricating tweets that appeared to be written by Mr. Obeidallah, and posting an article titled \u201cDean Obeidallah, Mastermind Behind Manchester Bombing, Calls on Trump to Declare Whites the Real Terrorists.\u201dMr. Obeidallah said he has been threatened and berated online, and called \u201cthings that I\u2019ve never been subjected to before \u2014 and I\u2019ve been called everything in the world.\u201dOne person said he should be hanged. Another told him that he hoped Mr. Obeidallah died of natural causes \u201cbefore we get to you.\u201dMr. Anglin did not respond to an emailed request for comment.He and other publishers of The Daily Stormer are named as defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Ohio. Mr. Obeidallah is seeking compensatory damages and a jury trial, alleging libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201cThere aren\u2019t two sides to white supremacy, white supremacism, anti-Muslim bigotry or racism,\u201d Mr. Obeidallah said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be silent.

{"Headline": "The Meaning of \u2018Despacito\u2019 in the Age of Trump", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Friday, \u201cDespacito,\u201d the hit song by the Puerto Rican artists Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, became the most watched video on YouTube ever, with nearly three billion views. And it got there faster than any music video in history. Just over two weeks ago Universal Music announced it was also the most streamed song in history, if you combine the number of times people played the original song or video with a remixed version featuring vocals from the Canadian singer Justin Bieber.The ascendance of \u201cDespacito\u201d is remarkable for a number reasons: Except for Mr. Bieber\u2019s intro, the song is almost entirely in Spanish. (Despacito means \u201cslowly,\u201d and depending on how you interpret the lyrics, the song is about what you\u2019d do slowly to someone you really like.) The rhythmic backbone of the song is reggaeton, a style with roots in Jamaica that developed in Puerto Rico and has long been popular in Latin America but has only occasionally broken through to the English-speaking world. The video is set in a storied Puerto Rican slum called La Perla and features a joyously multiracial cast.And maybe most notably, the song has achieved worldwide fame at a time when nativism is surging, anxiety over borders and immigration is rising, and the executive branch of this country seems determined to make it whiter.The song\u2019s success highlights the truism that the soul that moves so many of us, that we groove to, that animates our lives, that in some ways binds us as a global community \u2014 pop music \u2014 is the opposite of nativist. It\u2019s promiscuous. It doesn\u2019t respect borders or stick to racial categories. It borrows willy-nilly, encouraging cross-fertilization of cultures and styles. It courses with energy from the African diaspora. And those billions of views say that people, lots of them American, can\u2019t get enough of it.Of course, the song\u2019s success doesn\u2019t mean that President Trump\u2019s project will fail, or that cranky nativism will give way to happy multiculturalism. Plenty of people might be willing to watch a video by Puerto Rican artists and still not want a Spanish-speaking neighbor next door. (Although Puerto Rico is a United States territory, so if you\u2019re American, get over it.)But the song\u2019s success does highlight a side of humanity that, these days, often seems overshadowed by uglier tendencies. We know that humans can be tribal, that we quickly organize ourselves into in-groups and out-groups, that we can treat those out-groups cruelly and even savagely. These tendencies probably predate our being human. Even groups of chimpanzees wage war against one another.But we have this other side that\u2019s curious, that doesn\u2019t cringe from difference so much as find inspiration in it. A transcendent side that takes joy in bringing together disparate parts, in creation, in play.The song is a fusion, an amalgam. As such, it doesn\u2019t just illustrate the genius of pop music but also serves as a model of how creativity works generally. Innovation often involves organizing old pieces into new configurations. Tech companies, like Apple and Google, know this. Hence their emphasis on cross-pollination \u2014 their open work spaces and public areas designed to encourage intermingling.And this was also, until recently, how I\u2019d conceived of the American project. Then came President Trump and the news that some still viewed the United States as a fundamentally white, Christian nation with European roots. Which means what, exactly? Modern genetics tells us that Europeans are themselves a mixture of different peoples, a hunter-gatherer population mixed with farmers who, thousands of years ago, immigrated from what\u2019s now Turkey (near Syria), topped off by herders from what\u2019s now the Russian steppe. Christianity, the supposed glue of Europe, was imported from the Levant. And I\u2019m writing this in a language \u2014 English \u2014 that consists of French and Latin grafted onto an Anglo-Saxon base, sprinkled with Old Norse and grains of Celtic.Yes, nations exist. Yes, they have borders. Yes, distinct cultures and languages arise. There are bedrock ideas that we can perhaps call Western. But when you look closely at the boundaries demarcating these supposedly discrete entities, you find them to be remarkably porous.In the battle for hearts and minds represented by pop music, of course, all this goes without saying. \u201cDespacito\u201d has won the day.Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Disease,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even After the Glass Ceiling Yields, Female Executives Find Shaky Ground", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "Sheri McCoy of Avon is the third prominent female chief executive to head toward the exit since June, making 2017 anything but the breakout era it was expected to be.Supported byFor the better part of five years as the chief executive of the cosmetics giant Avon Products, Sheri McCoy battled collapsing sales, a plunging stock price, a bribery scandal in China and the constant drumbeat of an attack from an activist investor.Several months ago, it appeared as if 2017 would be a bit of a breakout year for women in the C-Suite because, for the first time, more than 5 percent of chief executive roles at publicly traded companies on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index were held by women.Women continue to make inroads as directors on corporate boards, a critical step toward landing more women in top spots, since those boards select the chief executive. Even so, there are 610 companies in the Russell 3000 \u2014 a broad index that seeks to be a benchmark of the United States stock market \u2014 that have no women on their boards, according to the research firm Equilar.\u201cAll of this just underscores how tenuous progress for women in the C.E.O. job really is,\u201d said Brande Stellings, a senior vice president at Catalyst, a nonprofit group that pushes for the advancement of women in business. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad to see we\u2019re struggling to tread water at having women represent 5 percent of C.E.O.s.\u201dResearchers at Utah State University concluded in a report last year that women were more likely than men to be promoted to the top job of a troubled company. And then, the researchers found, the women \u201coften lacked the support or authority\u201d to make the kind of changes the company needed, leading to shorter tenures.Female chief executives in their first year on the job were also 34 percent more likely to be targeted by an activist investor agitating for a change in strategy, a separate study by an Arizona State University researcher found. In looking at all chief executive appointments from 2003 to 2013, the researcher found that one in four women had led companies that had landed in the cross hairs of such investors.\u201cWe were astounded at the size of the gender effect in activist campaigns,\u201d said the researcher, Christine Shropshire, an associate professor of management and entrepreneurship in the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.Trian Fund Management, led by the activist investor Nelson Peltz, has led campaigns in recent years against three companies led by women, with Trian often trying to earn a seat in the boardroom from which it can push for a change in strategic or financial direction.In an email response to questions, Trian said that the firm has invested in several dozen companies since it was founded in 2005 and that three companies were led by women at the time of the initial investment and two others had named women as C.E.O. during the course of Trian\u2019s investment.\u201cAs a highly engaged share owner,\u201d the statement said, \u201cTrian is a gender blind investor that seeks to invest in high quality underperforming public companies and to work collaboratively with management teams and boards of those companies to achieve operational excellence. Furthermore, when we join boards, we are strong proponents of diversity at all levels.\u201dBut there are modest glimmers of hope on the horizon for women in corporate leadership, particularly at smaller companies.The proportion of women named to the boards of companies included in the Russell 3000 continues to slowly tick up and now stands at 16.2 percent, according to a gender diversity index maintained by Equilar.Moreover, a growing number of mega-investors are pushing corporate boards toward greater diversity, and adding more women is one method. In the second quarter of this year, 32 companies in the Russell 3000 added women to their boards.And even as some female chief executives head for the exit doors, others are entering.Earlier this year, the former Google executive Margo Georgiadis was named chief executive of troubled toymaker Mattel. And in April, Weight Watchers International hired Mindy Grossman, the chief executive of HSN Inc., the corporate parent of the Home Shopping Network, to run the company.But as Ms. Georgiadis\u2019s appointment to Mattel, which has seen its stock slump as its products have taken too long to develop and its appeal to an ever-younger digital audience has waned, illustrates the way that women are regularly entrusted with turnaround projects \u2014 a phenomenon that can be a double-edged sword.To distinguish themselves early on, \u201cwomen feel they must take on the most risky, most challenging roles,\u201d Christy Glass, a Utah State University researcher who studied the career trajectories of female chief executives in the Fortune 500, wrote in an email.

Avon on Thursday did not respond to a request to speak with Ms. McCoy. Barington declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Now Has Its Own Populist Pundit", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 It\u2019s not easy being the first and only Fox News host in Silicon Valley.But Steve Hilton, a tech entrepreneur who was once chief adviser to former Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, added that role to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in June.All of which makes life complicated for Mr. Hilton in overwhelmingly liberal Silicon Valley, where supporters of President Trump are nearly nonexistent and few think populism would improve their lives.He gets hassled for it. Recently, someone left novelty toilet paper with Mr. Trump\u2019s face on it on Mr. Hilton\u2019s desk at Crowdpac, the political fund-raising start-up he helped found in 2013. A vandal also took down the Trump campaign T-shirt that had been hanging on the office\u2019s \u201cbipartisan wall.\u201dNot to mention his friends. \u201cFox? Thank God it\u2019s on Sunday nights,\u201d said Gisel Kordestani, a co-founder of Crowdpac along with Mr. Hilton. \u201cHe just keeps it separate. We all have our things.\u201dMr. Hilton is unfazed. \u201cI certainly have experienced a degree of curiosity, yes,\u201d he said.Now he is Fox News\u2019s newest host, representing its first major foray into the tech world, and the network is experimenting with Mr. Hilton\u2019s more esoteric take on the brash Fox News style.\u201cTraditional television anchors might ask more shorter, pointed questions; they might try to trap their guests,\u201d said John Finley, senior vice president for development and production at Fox News. \u201cSteve\u2019s about having an intellectual discussion.\u201dCan it work? \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of finding out,\u201d Mr. Finley said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something different.\u201dOn a recent Sunday in Los Angeles, Mr. Hilton arrived for breakfast a little late, wearing a gray T-shirt, neon green shorts and flip-flops. He is petite but muscular, clean-shaven and with bright blue eyes. On his wrists were worn-out festival bracelets from Glastonbury and Coachella.He had chosen one of the trendiest places in the city, Rose Cafe (with a menu featuring avocado tartine and lemonade made with tangerine oil and filtered water), to talk populism. Mr. Hilton ordered shakshuka, beet hummus and tea with milk.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on for half the country? Who\u2019s lost out? The victims of elitist agenda; standing up for them, being a voice for them,\u201d Mr. Hilton said. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea behind positive populism, that\u2019s what drives the content.\u201dMr. Hilton\u2019s mission with his Fox News program, he said, is to create a working-class coalition uniting supporters of Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders with the rage that fueled the Brexit movement.\u201cMy argument is: Let\u2019s blame the people who are responsible,\u201d he said. Those people, he added, are the \u201cglobal elite.\u201dIt\u2019s an ironic position for Mr. Hilton to take given that he is part of that global elite \u2014 he and his wife live in a $12.5 million home in one of America\u2019s richest ZIP codes.But Mr. Hilton insisted he is not one of the elites he targets in his show. Over a subsequent meal in Menlo Park, Calif., he hit the table with his fist as he described how being elite \u201cis about what you believe in \u2014 those people, I see them as my enemy. They have taken control of the levers of power.\u201dSome of that sense of being an outsider may come from his childhood. The son of Hungarian refugees, Mr. Hilton was raised by his stepfather, who was a construction worker, and his mother, a clerk, in the seaside town of Brighton, England. As a child, he won a scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital School in Horsham, a school for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201cHe was a scholarship boy,\u201d said Michael Gove, a British Conservative politician. \u201cSheer talent brought him into that orbit, but he wasn\u2019t really cut from the Savile Row cloth. To call him an outsider would be an exaggeration, but he\u2019s certainly not an insider.\u201dMr. Hilton does not think his childhood was the factor. \u201cIt\u2019s no hard-luck story,\u201d he said.Mr. Hilton attended Oxford University and afterward took a job at the Conservative Central Office in 1990. Mr. Cameron was then head of the political unit, and Ms. Whetstone had joined three months earlier. In 1992, Mr. Hilton coordinated the advertising in a surprise general election in which the Conservatives won.Over time, Mr. Hilton became Mr. Cameron\u2019s closest adviser and godfather to his first son. With Mr. Hilton\u2019s advice, Mr. Cameron softened his look, ditching his tie and hugging a husky on a trip to highlight global warming.Mr. Hilton soon developed a reputation as the quirky, secretive figure behind a radically conservative agenda and was often featured in the tabloids for his casual clothes, bare feet and sweaty post-bike-ride look. In 2008, he married Ms. Whetstone.\u201cDavid Cameron was immensely able and charismatic,\u201d Mr. Gove said, \u201cbut it was Steve who was the idea dynamo.\u201dYet by 2012, their relationship was fraying. Mr. Hilton thought Mr. Cameron was compromising too much with the European Union and moving too slowly on their vision to cut bureaucracy. The two began to drift apart, and Mr. Hilton moved to California. The fallout was complete when Mr. Hilton returned to Britain last year to campaign against Mr. Cameron in favor of Brexit. The two no longer speak, Mr. Hilton said.When Mr. Hilton landed in Silicon Valley, he was known locally as the eccentric husband of Ms. Whetstone, who later left Google for Uber\u2019s top communications and policy job. (She left Uber this year and has joined Facebook.)Mr. Hilton took a teaching job at Stanford\u2019s design school. Then he had an idea for a website that makes it easier to find and give to small-time political campaigns.Crowdpac, which has raised $8.5 million from investors like Index Ventures and SV Angel, has since become part of the tech world\u2019s sometimes shaky efforts to engage with politics.For Mr. Hilton, Crowdpac is where his conservative leanings stand out the most. He said the company isn\u2019t excited to be part of \u201cthis whole thing,\u201d referring to his Fox News program. \u201cWe\u2019re nonpartisan, but most of our employees are very liberal,\u201d he said.\u201cI literally don\u2019t know any others,\u201d he said, before clarifying that he doesn\u2019t quite identify himself as a supporter of the president but rather of the populist movement that Mr. Trump rode to the White House. Mr. Trump is \u201cjust the start,\u201d Mr. Hilton said.His friends said they see the fiery conservative as an unusual and fun addition to a typically homogeneous social scene, especially in Silicon Valley.\u201cSteve wants to disrupt the political status quo, and that\u2019s what Silicon Valley is good at doing,\u201d said Joanna Coles, chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, who is a frequent guest at his dinner parties. She said that she doesn\u2019t agree with his politics but that his dinner parties are \u201cfabulous.\u201d\u201cYou just have to smile,\u201d Juliet de Baubigny, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said of Mr. Hilton. \u201cI hope that we\u2019ll always have different points of opinion around the table. I hope that we will always have Trump supporters in the mix.\u201dAre there a lot of Trump supporters in the mix?\u201cAt the moment, sadly, he\u2019s the only one,\u201d Ms. de Baubigny said. \u201cBut I\u2019m grateful for the fact that we have one.\u201dMr. Hilton said the tech industry\u2019s lack of interest in politics gives it the potential to be radically conservative. \u201cA lot of the foundational philosophical approaches of tech leaders are actually all about decentralization of power,\u201d he said.Mr. Hilton\u2019s program has also become a surprising landing spot for liberals.\u201cWhen I went on the show, a bunch of progressive friends of mine were complaining, like, \u2018Why would you go on this right-winger\u2019s show?\u2019\u201d said Zack Exley, a former senior staff member for Mr. Sanders, who appeared on the program last month. \u201cWhat Fox does all day every day is they point at immigrants, they point at activists, whipping up racism, that\u2019s what they do all day long. But Steve for an hour points at corporate power. If we can\u2019t engage with somebody who\u2019s doing that, that\u2019s crazy.\u201dMr. Hilton said he\u2019s staying for the long haul.\u201cWe didn\u2019t move here so I could save American democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve embraced it with the zeal of a convert.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Besides Mr. Washington, other figures whose images are cast in bronze, gold and silver within the single-room show on Wall Street in the financial district include Joe Louis, Bessie Coleman and the Tuskegee Airmen.A few of the objects, like a 2016 Harpers Ferry National Historical Park quarter, representing Washington, D.C., and another from Washington, featuring the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, issued in 2017, are currently in circulation. But most, like two for President Barack Obama from his first and second terms in office, and Rosa Parks\u2019s 1999 bronze medal, were pressed strictly to honor the subject, not to be used as money. Still, they represent what Ms. Williamson called a funky twist in how people think about the United States Mint.Ms. Thomas and Ms. Williamson opened their online museum, which has all the usual elements of the brick-and-mortar kind, including a gift shop with T-shirts and coffee mugs, as a way of celebrating their blackness and their mutual love of 1970s black culture. \u201cFat Albert and the Cosby Kids\u201d cartoon cels and blaxploitation movie posters can be viewed at the museum site. So can recorded interviews with James Brown, Isaac Hayes and Teddy Pendergrass, and the work of the pioneering black cartoonist Morrie Turner, whose comics appeared in publications like Negro Digest and Ebony.Ms. Thomas, 55, and Ms. Williamson, 53, who live together in New Jersey but won\u2019t disclose where because a large portion of their collection lives with them, met through a personal ad 20 years ago. \u201cWhen I saw that Loreen had a collection of animation art,\u201d Ms. Thomas recalled, \u201cI said, \u2018Where are the black cartoons?\u2019\u201d She had studied African-American history in college, and Ms. Williamson had always been interested in black history. \u201cI thought it was a good question,\u201d Ms. Williamson said.They started the collection with one \u201cFat Albert\u201d cel. By about a year later, they had about 30, and now the collection has ballooned to around 12,000 objects, including black advertising tins and black postage stamps, and all of it is self-funded. In the late \u201990s, they opened a gallery in Summit, N.J. But the aftermath of 9/11 forced them to close.\u201cThe community was in mourning,\u201d Ms. Thomas said, and foot traffic slowed so much it didn\u2019t make sense to stay open.\u201cHaving the gallery space, just the physicality involved in moving stuff and hanging art, was hard enough, and something I would rather not do again,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cSo I said, \u2018How about we put our stuff online first, and maybe we can have a physical space later?\u2019\u201dThe move from physical to digital worked so well that they never looked back.Hundreds of thousands of people have now visited the site, including representatives of colleges, libraries and institutions like the Museum of American Finance.If the online address sounds like a destination for the nostalgic or the lighthearted, it is. \u201cWe\u2019re basically stuck in the \u201970s, and we know other people are, too,\u201d said Ms. Williamson, who works on the site full time. Ms. Thomas is a preschool teacher \u2014 she limits her funky endeavors to after-school hours.\u201cWhen we were kids growing up eating cereal in front of cartoons on Saturday mornings, we saw some of the first positive representations of black people on television,\u201d through shows like \u201cThe Jackson 5ive,\u201d Ms. Williamson said.Ms. Thomas said, \u201cWe were the first generation that benefited from that, and we know other people appreciate those memories and want to relive them too.\u201d But they recognize that the UnCut Funk museum is also becoming a place for serious scholarship. This is by design.\u201cWe sort of realized that things have come full circle, with happy slaves being depicted picking cotton on Confederate currency just before the Civil War, to Obama\u2019s bronze medals for being the first African-American president, to Harriet Tubman being on the new 20 and Sojourner Truth having a turn on the 10 and Marian Anderson being on the 5 in 2020 \u2014 which I hope still happens,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.The plan is to keep expanding the collection, and to keep curating and lending it.

{"Headline": "Six-Second Commercials Are Coming to N.F.L. Games on Fox", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new kind of advertising is coming to N.F.L. games and other programming on Fox Sports this fall: the six-second television commercial.\u201cWhen the six-second ads are placed in unique positions, it has the potential to gain even more attention than a traditional unit,\u201d Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, said in an interview.N.F.L. fans will first see the ads on Fox on Sept. 10 just before kickoff in the network\u2019s games on the regular season\u2019s opening weekend, and Mr. Shanks said they were also being offered for the World Series and other \u201cmarquee events.\u201d The network is working to integrate them sparingly into some in-game breaks with 15- and 30-second spots; it may also place them through new formats, like in a box adjacent to players on a field during pauses. The hope is that they will eventually help reduce the overall commercial time that people sit through.\u201cSo, for example, if a pitching coach comes to the mound just to have a conversation and you know that conversation is going to last 30 seconds, is a six-second unit in there going to add to the experience and then be able to decrease the amount of ad inventory somewhere else?\u201d Mr. Shanks said.The effort underscores the new strategies that broadcasters are deploying to keep the attention of consumers who often clutch a smartphone or tablet \u2014 or both \u2014 while watching their shows, or avoid ads entirely through Netflix. It\u2019s a major shift from the typical spots that TV networks sell and will put a new burden on marketers to not only attract viewers\u2019 attention but also pitch a product in less time than it takes to read this sentence out loud.On network television, the trend has been toward shorter commercials: In the first half of this year, 36 percent of national TV ads were 15 seconds long while 49 percent lasted 30 seconds, Nielsen data shows. In 2014, 29 percent of ads were 15-second spots, while 61 percent were 30 seconds long.Part of the network\u2019s pitch with the Teen Choice Awards was the messaging around the shorter commercials, such as telling viewers that their programming would return in less than 30 seconds, then airing several of the short ads. That improved the odds people would stay in their seats while fostering some good will with a quicker interruption.That rationale helped Fox charge roughly as much for the six-second spots on the show as it did for 15-second ads, according to people familiar with the negotiations, and reduced the program\u2019s overall commercial time.Similarly, Fox has been able to maintain the premium for the six-second ads it is selling now by pointing to lucrative placements, like just before kickoff for an N.F.L. game, the people said. While the ads are being sold as part of broader packages, a six-second spot could cost, at the high end, around $200,000, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s a long enough amount of time to actually tell a story, whether it\u2019s to convey an emotion or deliver a product message or a piece of news, and yet short enough that the consumer is not irritated by being forced to watch an ad,\u201d said Tara Walpert Levy, vice president of agency and media solutions at YouTube and Google.Mr. Marchese is aware of the challenges but unperturbed. \u201cThe brands and agencies that are able to buy these new models, not stuck in legacy-only buying structures, will be the ones that get to take advantage,\u201d he said in an email.Dave Penski, who oversees media investments as chief executive of Publicis Media Exchange Americas, said that while six-second ads might not work for brands aiming to sell complicated products, he anticipated interest from large sports advertisers that want to reinforce longer messages or simply remind consumers about already recognizable goods.\u201cIt\u2019s an innovation that\u2019s more cross-screen than others because there\u2019s already, certainly in the digital world, a huge amount of six-second advertising that\u2019s going on out there,\u201d he said.Dave Campanelli, who oversees video investments at Horizon Media, an ad-buying firm, said he would explore Fox Sports\u2019s six-second TV ads but was skeptical that the unit would become a new standard, partly because of the constraints around crafting messages of that length.He agreed, though, that broadcasters needed to find more ways to shorten commercial breaks and the number of brands featured there.\u201cWith so many different ways to record and fast-forward, or look at your phone during the commercial break and not pay attention, or just change the channel, that\u2019s hurt commercial retention and hurt commercial viewership,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaying with pods and commercialization will definitely change over time and become a bigger piece of what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teaching A.I. Systems to Behave Themselves", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting inside OpenAI\u2019s San Francisco offices on a recent afternoon, the researcher Dario Amodei showed off an autonomous system that taught itself to play Coast Runners, an old boat-racing video game. The winner is the boat with the most points that also crosses the finish line.The result was surprising: The boat was far too interested in the little green widgets that popped up on the screen. Catching these widgets meant scoring points. Rather than trying to finish the race, the boat went point-crazy. It drove in endless circles, colliding with other vessels, skidding into stone walls and repeatedly catching fire.That\u2019s a concern as these techniques move into online services, security devices and robotics. Now, a small community of A.I. researchers, including Mr. Amodei, is beginning to explore mathematical techniques that aim to keep the worst from happening.At OpenAI, Mr. Amodei and his colleague Paul Christiano are developing algorithms that can not only learn tasks through hours of trial and error, but also receive regular guidance from human teachers along the way.With a few clicks here and there, the researchers now have a way of showing the autonomous system that it needs to win points in Coast Runners while also moving toward the finish line. They believe that these kinds of algorithms \u2014 a blend of human and machine instruction \u2014 can help keep automated systems safe.For years, Mr. Musk, along with other pundits, philosophers and technologists, have warned that machines could spin outside our control and somehow learn malicious behavior their designers didn\u2019t anticipate. At times, these warnings have seemed overblown, given that today\u2019s autonomous car systems can even get tripped up by the most basic tasks, like recognizing a bike lane or a red light.But researchers like Mr. Amodei are trying to get ahead of the risks. In some ways, what these scientists are doing is a bit like a parent teaching a child right from wrong.Many specialists in the A.I. field believe a technique called reinforcement learning \u2014 a way for machines to learn specific tasks through extreme trial and error \u2014 could be a primary path to artificial intelligence. Researchers specify a particular reward the machine should strive for, and as it navigates a task at random, the machine keeps close track of what brings the reward and what doesn\u2019t. When OpenAI trained its bot to play Coast Runners, the reward was more points.This video game training has real-world implications.If a machine can learn to navigate a racing game like Grand Theft Auto, researchers believe, it can learn to drive a real car. If it can learn to use a web browser and other common software apps, it can learn to understand natural language and maybe even carry on a conversation. At places like Google and the University of California, Berkeley, robots have already used the technique to learn simple tasks like picking things up or opening a door.All this is why Mr. Amodei and Mr. Christiano are working to build reinforcement learning algorithms that accept human guidance along the way. This can ensure systems don\u2019t stray from the task at hand.The field is small, but it is growing. As OpenAI and DeepMind build teams dedicated to A.I. safety, so too is Google\u2019s stateside lab, Google Brain. Meanwhile, researchers at universities like the U.C. Berkeley and Stanford University are working on similar problems, often in collaboration with the big corporate labs.In some cases, researchers are working to ensure that systems don\u2019t make mistakes on their own, as the Coast Runners boat did. They\u2019re also working to ensure that hackers and other bad actors can\u2019t exploit hidden holes in these systems. Researchers like Google\u2019s Ian Goodfellow, for example, are exploring ways that hackers could fool A.I. systems into seeing things that aren\u2019t there.That becomes problematic when neural networks are used in security cameras. Simply by making a few marks on your face, the researchers said, you could fool a camera into believing you\u2019re someone else.\u201cIf you train an object-recognition system on a million images labeled by humans, you can still create new images where a human and the machine disagree 100 percent of the time,\u201d Mr. Goodfellow said. \u201cWe need to understand that phenomenon.\u201dAnother big worry is that A.I. systems will learn to prevent humans from turning them off. If the machine is designed to chase a reward, the thinking goes, it may find that it can chase that reward only if it stays on. This oft-described threat is much further off, but researchers are already working to address it.Mr. Hadfield-Menell and others at U.C. Berkeley recently published a paper that takes a mathematical approach to the problem. A machine will seek to preserve its off switch, they showed, if it is specifically designed to be uncertain about its reward function. This gives it an incentive to accept or even seek out human oversight.Much of this work is still theoretical. But given the rapid progress of A.I. techniques and their growing importance across so many industries, researchers believe that starting early is the best policy.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around exactly how rapid progress in A.I. is going to be,\u201d said Shane Legg, who oversees the A.I. safety work at DeepMind. \u201cThe responsible approach is to try to understand different ways in which these technologies can be misused, different ways they can fail and different ways of dealing with these issues.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article identified the three people in the picture in the wrong order. They are Dario Amodei, standing, and from left, Paul Christiano and Geoffrey Irving.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his. I proposed that I escort him in the game. Soon after that, we had the contract signed.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong. Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Tom Perrotta Returns to Familiar Turf: Sex, Schools and Suburbia", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOriginally, Tom Perrotta wanted to title his new novel, about an attractive 46-year-old divorced suburban mother, \u201cThe MILF.\u201d The editorial team at Scribner, his publisher, was skeptical. What if readers Googled the title to search for the book online? Mr. Perrotta had searched for the term himself, and he knew the answer: They were likely to encounter a flood of porn.\u201cWe decided it might be off-putting for some people,\u201d Mr. Perrotta said.Another strand of the narrative follows her son, Brendan, an entitled bro\u2019s bro, who is crushed when college doesn\u2019t turn out to be the endless, booze-fueled orgy he\u2019d envisioned. Meanwhile, Eve manages to make new friends at her community college and engages in drunken hookups, essentially having the college experience that Brendan is missing.At times morbidly funny and, at others, grim, \u201cMrs. Fletcher\u201d signals a return to familiar territory for Mr. Perrotta \u2014 sex, school and suburbia \u2014 after he flirted with supernatural themes in his previous novel, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d (2011), a dark, apocalyptic tale set during the aftermath of an unexplained mass disappearance.\u201cFor whatever reason, I\u2019m always interested in sex and I\u2019m always interested in school \u2014 those are like my two subjects,\u201d Mr. Perrotta said during an hourlong interview at his publisher\u2019s office in Midtown Manhattan.He seemed cheerful and relaxed, perhaps because he was coming off a monthslong sabbatical of sorts, following a brutally intense period of work when he was finishing the novel and also writing the final season of the HBO show \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d adapted from his book. \u201cI was exhausted, and I haven\u2019t done anything with my life for the last six months,\u201d he said.Mr. Perrotta originally planned to focus the novel on Eve, and aimed to write a tight novella from her perspective, but as soon as he got to the scene where she drops her son off at college, he wanted to follow Brendan \u2014 a bratty jock who behaves contemptuously toward the women around him. \u201cPart of this cultural moment is that guys like this are being vilified, but they\u2019re all over the place, and you don\u2019t see them much in fiction,\u201d he said.The subject of sex on college campuses has never been more charged, and Mr. Perrotta wades into current controversies about hookup culture, sexting and dating apps and consent, and he uses terminology like \u201ccisgender,\u201d \u201cdysphoria,\u201d \u201cheteronormative\u201d and \u201cperformativity,\u201d both in conversation and in his writing.\u201cWhat I became very conscious of was that there are these two levels of discourse about sex, this high-minded academic discourse, which is about re-evaluating gender, challenging the patriarchy, focusing on consent and sexual assault, and underneath it is this porn thing, which is full of old stereotypes; weird, racially charged fantasies; women objectified down to a single body part,\u201d he said. \u201cSexual behavior in college is happening in the space between those two things.\u201dWhile \u201cMrs. Fletcher\u201d may sound, from a plot summary, like an R-rated comedy or the outline for a raunchy Judd Apatow movie, it is more melancholy than many of his earlier books. Sex and pornography often serve as shorthand for characters\u2019 loneliness and their search for self-worth.The novelist Dennis Lehane, who has known Mr. Perrotta for roughly two decades, said that \u201cMrs. Fletcher\u201d fit into a larger pattern in Mr. Perrotta\u2019s work, as the tone of his novels has gradually shifted from comic and satirical to more tragic. \u201cThere\u2019s a palpable sadness that goes through every single strand of the book,\u201d he said.In many ways, Mr. Perrotta\u2019s fiction has also followed the arc of his life. He was raised in a small town in New Jersey, where his father worked for the Postal Service, and his mother took care of their children and then became a secretary. Some of his earliest works, like \u201cBad Haircut\u201d and \u201cJoe College,\u201d were semi-autobiographical coming-of-age stories about suburban boys on the cusp of adulthood. After Mr. Perrotta married and had children, he began writing about suburban families and the strain that having small children puts on a marriage, with his breakout novel, \u201cLittle Children.\u201d When his kids were older, he wrote \u201cNine Inches,\u201d a collection with stories that unfold during football rallies, Little League games and school dances.Now Mr. Perrotta is 55, and his children have left home, and \u201cMrs. Fletcher\u201d reflects his fixation on empty-nest syndrome and the awkwardness of late middle age, which can almost seem like a second adolescence. \u201cI was really thinking about that moment when you send your kids out into the world,\u201d he said.Screenwriting has started to shape his fiction subtly, Mr. Perrotta said. Instead of writing fragmented scenes or \u201ca collection of moments\u201d that adds up to a novel, he\u2019s started thinking of chapters as distinct episodes with their own narrative arcs, a technique that gives \u201cMrs. Fletcher\u201d a strangely propulsive quality, even though the dramatic stakes are not all that high.Mr. Perrotta has become so enamored of the narrative possibilities of television that he plans to be even more heavily involved in the adaptation of \u201cMrs. Fletcher,\u201d which HBO has optioned as a 30-minute series. If the show is made, he hopes to be its lead writer and producer, he said.He worries sometimes about the toll this could take on his fiction writing, as he attempts to juggle parallel careers. But he also recognizes what a rare position he is in.\u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger. If I\u2019m going to do it, this is the time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Samsung Verdict Sends a Tough New Message to South Korea Inc.", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 More than two decades ago, South Korean prosecutors indicted the chairman of the powerful Samsung conglomerate on charges of bribing the president. He was let off with a suspended sentence and then a presidential pardon.About a decade later, he was indicted again, on tax evasion and embezzlement charges. And again he escaped prison time.The message was clear: Samsung was essentially untouchable, and the family that ran the company wielded the true power in South Korea.On Friday, the country\u2019s courts sent a different message.Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation heir to the Samsung empire, was sentenced to five years in prison over a bribery scandal that has already contributed to the downfall of the country\u2019s former president and shaken the country\u2019s political and economic foundations.It was the most remarkable sentence yet for a South Korean business titan, and a sign that the country is no longer willing to offer its business leaders political impunity in exchange for untrammeled economic growth.Now South Korea and Samsung \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest business empire and a global force in the technology industry \u2014 are at a turning point. Friday\u2019s verdict could embolden efforts to weaken the hold that major family-run business groups have maintained over one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies.\u201cUntil now, Samsung had always been considered above the law in South Korea,\u201d said You Jong-il, an economist at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management. \u201cThis marks a big stride in establishing judicial justice in the country because it has kept failing before Samsung.\u201dFor Samsung, a vast conglomerate, the verdict offers a test of whether the company can wean itself from the family that founded it and has long used it to amass wealth and power. Mr. Lee and other family members could still wield power behind the scenes, say people who study South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, the way some of the country\u2019s other business empires have been run from jail cells.\u201cHe still has controlling power, even though he\u2019s in jail,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore, speaking of Mr. Lee. \u201cHe can fire any chief executive, and the professional managers should have to keep reporting to him.\u201dMr. Lee and four other Samsung executives were convicted on Friday of paying $7.8 million in bribes and other inducements to ensure that the country\u2019s disgraced former president, Park Geun-hye, supported a complicated corporate deal. That deal strengthened Mr. Lee\u2019s grip on Samsung Electronics, the famous maker of smartphones and televisions and the conglomerate\u2019s crown jewel.The verdict could still be reversed on appeal, which Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers have said they will pursue. Their hope is not senseless: Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, twice received presidential pardons for wrongdoing. But the current president, Moon Jae-in, and his political party have pledged to crack down on shady practices at South Korea\u2019s family-run business empires, which are known as chaebols.In 2005, conversations recorded between a senior Samsung executive and a newspaper magnate, both close to the Lee family, were leaked to local news media. In those conversations, which took place eight years earlier, they discussed bribes paid to top politicians and senior prosecutors. Samsung apologized, but the recordings were not used as evidence because they had been illegally recorded.Mr. Lee\u2019s father \u2014 Lee Kun-hee, the son of Samsung\u2019s founder \u2014 was twice pardoned by presidents after being convicted of bribery and other charges. But he won a measure of respect from South Koreans because he helped make Samsung Electronics into a high-quality brand.Being in prison does not necessarily mean that Mr. Lee will give up control, however. He has two sisters, but neither has been heavily involved in the electronics business and they generally have not been considered rivals to Mr. Lee.Perhaps the most daunting challenge to Samsung is one that the company has not been able to solve even with Mr. Lee free and in charge. While the company dominates hardware, from memory and chips to the finished smartphone and television, it has long struggled in the realm of software and services.Another challenge could arise with the death of the elder Mr. Lee, which could set off the type of infighting that split up other chaebol families and empires in recent years, said Park Sang-in, a professor of public administration at Seoul National University and a chaebol critic.\u201cCronies inside Samsung will start taking sides, and this is a risky situation you can\u2019t control from a jail cell,\u201d he said.For many in South Korea, the question is whether the authorities will keep up the pressure on the country\u2019s big business groups. Some groups critical of the chaebol say Friday\u2019s Samsung verdict was not as severe as it could have been, and that the five-year sentence was the weakest legal penalty allowed for the crimes Mr. Lee committed.\u201cThis is another court ruling proving that in South Korea, if you don\u2019t have money, you are guilty,\u201d said a statement from Spec Watch, a Seoul-based civic group that monitors corporate crimes, \u201cbut if you have money, you are innocent.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article, using information from Reuters, provided an incorrect photographer credit.

{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler Is at a Crossroads. It\u2019s Looking to China for a Solution.", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The event scheduled for Thursday at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Illinois assembly plant was supposed to shine a light on what the company does best: build high-margin Jeep sport utility vehicles.Then, for a second time in two months, Fiat Chrysler abruptly called off the official celebration of the plant being retooled to turn out Jeep Cherokees, where the chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, was to have taken center stage.Bigger things are on the horizon for Jeep and Fiat Chrysler, however \u2014 including a possible breakup of the company.For months, according to two company officials, Fiat Chrysler has been in discussions with a number of Chinese companies about potential equity investments or other deals involving its Ram pickup division and the Jeep brand. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks have not been publicly disclosed.As early as last year, Fiat Chrysler sent a team specializing in mergers and acquisitions to China, according to the officials, who added that discussions were continuing with various companies. The officials said an investment or partnership involving a Chinese automaker could be a prelude to a larger agreement.A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman declined on Tuesday to comment on those accounts.One Chinese company, Great Wall Motor, emerged publicly this week as an eager suitor for Jeep, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s fastest-growing and most profitable unit.\u201cThere is nobody saying there\u2019s no way we would sell the Jeep brand,\u201d said Thomas W. LaSorda, the former chief executive at Chrysler who helped engineer its merger with Fiat. \u201cThat sends a message to boardrooms around the world.\u201dThe Great Wall overture sent Fiat Chrysler\u2019s shares up almost 7 percent in New York trading on Monday, to their highest point in more than two years.The Italian-American automaker began to take shape after the bankruptcy and government bailout of the former Chrysler. Mr. Marchionne was showered with credit for blending the companies. But for most of the past two years, Fiat Chrysler has been openly seeking a merger partner to survive as a long-term player in the global auto industry. Several major automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen, have disavowed interest.Mr. Marchionne has been unavailable for comment on potential deals. The twice-canceled factory event in Belvidere, Ill., would have been his first public appearance in the United States since the Detroit auto show in January. (Scheduling conflicts were cited for both cancellations.)Known for his outspoken views on hot-button issues like the potential of electric vehicles and the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Marchionne has been uncharacteristically cryptic in his recent comments about the possibility of selling off Fiat Chrysler in pieces.\u201cWe have an obligation to purify that portfolio,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said last month during an earnings call with analysts, referring to whether the company was considering divesting business units.Asked whether the European brands Maserati and Alfa Romeo might be sold, Mr. Marchionne said he would \u201creserve judgment\u201d on that possibility, then cut off further questions.Industry analysts believe Fiat Chrysler is in a weak business position compared with much larger rivals like Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors.The bulk of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s global profits are generated by Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups sold in the American market, and the company has lagged far behind competitors in pursuing advanced technology for autonomous and electrified vehicles.Sales of its passenger cars, like Chrysler and Dodge vehicles in the United States and Fiat models in Europe, have struggled mightily in a market shifting away from traditional sedans.To compensate, Fiat Chrysler is rapidly converting its American production facilities, including the Belvidere plant, from building cars to making Jeeps and pickups. By the end of 2017, all six of its assembly plants in the United States will be devoted to S.U.V.s and trucks. Plants in Mexico and Canada still produce the passenger cars the company sells here.It is almost unprecedented for a large automaker to abandon entire segments like compact cars, and the move has been challenging for dealers who have to adjust to smaller lineups in their showrooms.\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d said Brett Saslow, who owns a Fiat Chrysler dealership in St. James, N.Y., on Long Island. \u201cCar sales are down but they\u2019re not going away. It\u2019s still a big segment, so it would be nice to at least have some representation there.\u201dThe increased emphasis on trucks and S.U.V.s has only fed speculation that the company is beefing up its most attractive assets for sale.Giuseppe Berta, an economic-history professor at Bocconi University in Milan and a longtime consultant on Fiat\u2019s historical archives, said that Mr. Elkann might be pushing for a larger deal before Mr. Marchionne\u2019s expected retirement next year.\u201cWhat we see now is a strong desire by the ownership to sell F.C.A.,\u201d Mr. Berta said. \u201cI think there is only one chance, and that is to break the company up.\u201dMr. Berta said the uneven performance of business units at the company made it difficult to sell as a whole, and that the initial merger of Fiat and Chrysler was ill equipped to stand the test of time.\u201cSince the beginning, there has been limited capacity to invest in the business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been no plans for autonomous cars or electric cars, and two years ago Mr. Marchionne said that the car sector in general was consuming too much capital.\u201dIndustry analysts also question whether the company has the financial capacity to compete in the emerging era of self-driving vehicles.Fiat Chrysler said recently that it would join a partnership with the German automaker BMW to develop such technology, but that hardly ensures it will be able to keep up with automakers like G.M. or Silicon Valley competitors like Tesla and Google.One analyst, Kristin Dziczek from the Center for Automotive Research, said the company had significant debt that could hamper its ability to spend money on new technology and models. \u201cThat does not bode well for investing in future product,\u201d she said.The possibility of selling Jeep to a Chinese buyer could be problematic. Any deal would probably be subject to government review in China and in the United States. And Fiat Chrysler would have trouble replacing the profits and market share generated by its prized S.U.V. division.Mr. Marchionne cautioned in the recent earnings call that the company could not simply sell off its choicest parts to the highest bidder.\u201cWe do have to worry about the stump that\u2019s left behind,\u201d he said. Otherwise, he added, Fiat Chrysler will \u201cend up with a suboptimal business that cannot run.\u201dMr. LaSorda thinks the recent expression of interest by Great Wall will ignite enthusiasm among other automakers. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a major company that wouldn\u2019t want Jeep,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, what is the cost to get it?\u201dThe prospect of a breakup or sale comes at a particularly difficult time for Fiat Chrysler.In the United States market, it is suffering from slowing consumer demand and a Jeep lineup stocked with older models. In the first seven months of the year, its sales fell more than 7 percent, and those of the Jeep unit declined more than 12 percent. Worldwide, Fiat Chrysler said, Jeep is still growing, thanks to rising sales in China and elsewhere, although it does not break out global sales by brand.But controversy and crisis have touched the former Chrysler for decades, dating back to the federal government\u2019s loan guarantees to keep the company operating in the late 1970s.Since then Chrysler has been sold three times: first in 1998 to German automaker Daimler-Benz, and later to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management and then to Fiat.Mr. LaSorda traveled the world in 2007 as Chrysler\u2019s vice chairman looking for a partner to save the automaker from extinction. While the company ultimately joined up with Fiat, one of the sales calls was with Great Wall. \u201cThey always had an interest in getting into the U.S. market,\u201d he said.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venice, Invaded by Tourists, Risks Becoming \u2018Disneyland on the Sea\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVENICE \u2014 \u201cYou guys, just say \u2018skooozy\u2019 and walk through,\u201d a young American woman commanded her friends, caught in one of the bottlenecks of tourist traffic that clog Venice\u2019s narrow streets, choke its glorious squares and push the locals of this enchanting floating city out and onto drab, dry land. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time!\u201dNeither, the Italian government worries, does Venice.The soundtrack of the city is now the wheels of rolling luggage thumping up against the steps of footbridges as phalanxes of tourists march over the city\u2019s canals. Snippets of Venetian dialect can still be heard between the gondoliers rowing selfie-snapping couples. But the lingua franca is a foreign mash-up of English, Chinese and whatever other tongue the mega cruise ships and low-cost flights have delivered that morning. Hotels have replaced homes.Italian government officials, lamenting what they call \u201clow-quality tourism,\u201d are considering limiting the numbers of tourists who can enter the city or its landmark piazzas.\u201cIf you arrive on a big ship, get off, you have two or three hours, follow someone holding a flag to Piazzale Roma, Ponte di Rialto and San Marco and turn around,\u201d said Dario Franceschini, Italy\u2019s culture minister, who lamented what he called an \u201cEat and Flee\u201d brand of tourism that had brought the sinking city so low.\u201cThe beauty of Italian towns is not only the architecture, it\u2019s also the actual activity of the place, the stores, the workshops,\u201d Mr. Franceschini added. \u201cWe need to save its identity.\u201dThe city\u2019s locals, whatever is left of them anyway, feel inundated by the 20 million or so tourists each year. Stores have taken to putting signs on the windows showing the direction to St. Mark\u2019s Square or Ponte di Rialto, so people will stop coming in to ask them where to go.Some of the roughly 50,000 Venetians who remain in the city, down from about 175,000 in 1951, have organized associations against the \u201cBig Ships,\u201d selling T-shirts that show cruise boats with shark teeth threatening fishermen. In June, almost all the 18,000 Venetians who voted in an unofficial referendum on the cruise ships said they wanted them out of the lagoon.\u201cOne problem is the ships,\u201d said Mr. Franceschini, who called their passage in front of St. Mark\u2019s Square \u201can unacceptable spectacle.\u201dBut the ships bring in money, and since Venice is not the trading power of yore, it needs all the euros it can get. The cruise ships don\u2019t just bring fees into the city, they also create jobs down a whole supply chain, benefiting mechanics, waiters and water taxis. The gondoliers who change into their striped shirts early in the morning and put sunscreen on their bald heads have steady work.When a visitor, or at least this visitor, arrives at the Venice train station and encounters that iconic watery avenue, a strange sensation occurs of being in the Las Vegas version of Venice rather than in the real thing. Maybe it\u2019s all the luggage, the shopping bags, the lack of Italians.Tourists looking to take home souvenirs \u2014 Venetian masks, toy gondolas, imitation Murano glass beads or bowls, striped \u201cVenezia\u201d sailor caps, assorted soccer jerseys, San Marco-themed aprons or purses from Italy\u2019s luxury giants \u2014 are in luck. But it has gotten harder and harder to stumble onto a local boutique run by a young entrepreneur. The young are mostly leaving.\u201cIt\u2019s always harder to live here,\u201d said Bruno Ravagnan, a 33-year-old local as he took a water bus packed with tourists carrying suitcases.Many of Venice\u2019s locals reside in the Castello section of the city, far enough away from San Marco Square, the center of tourist gravity, to enjoy a semblance of normal life. But only a semblance.\u201cIf you want to get some prosciutto, you can\u2019t because the Salumeria is gone,\u201d said Tommaso Mingati, 41.His family kept a small apartment here but, like most former residents, had moved out to Mestre, the mainland section that no one has ever called Queen of the Adriatic. As his mother regretted the city becoming a \u201cDisneyland on the Sea,\u201d Mr. Mingati said that the expanding empire of bed-and-breakfasts was now forcing people out of Mestre.All of those bed-and-breakfasts, and the city\u2019s roughly 2,500 hotels, produce a lot of towels and linens that need laundering. Venice no longer has the capacity for such an undertaking. So, at dawn, boats carry the dirty laundry and garbage out to Tronchetto, an artificial island and parking lot for trucks coming from the mainland.In turn, they deliver fresh towels but also untold gallons of drinking water, foodstuffs, bottles of orange Aperol to make the city\u2019s ubiquitous Aperol Spritz and anything else consumed inside the lagoon.One weekend a year, during the Feast of the Redeemer in July, Venetians take back the city. They flow back in from Mestre to drink wine on the banks of the Grand Canal and wait for a fireworks show that puts New York\u2019s Fireworks by Grucci to shame.This year, the celebration coincided with the Venice Biennale, which draws thousands of sophisticated, globe-trotting visitors to Venice to check out the latest in art, dance and theater. The locals and the art enthusiasts have developed a sort of alliance against the crowds who march on St. Mark\u2019s.\u201cWe are a model of what could be,\u201d said Paolo Baratta, the president of the Biennale, as he watched the fireworks from the terrace of the festival\u2019s headquarters. The people emptying out of the cruise ships, he said, \u201caren\u2019t concerned with what happens in Venice.\u201dFor me it is the one I first encountered nearly 20 years ago, before Google Maps, when I could get lost and stumble onto seemingly deserted or forgotten campos. At night, away from the city center, a couple of tourists celebrating their wedding at a divey cafe was not cloying, but charming.Those enchanting hours stretched into the early morning, before the tourists stirred, when St. Mark\u2019s Square itself was empty except for the pigeons and the early risers headed to work.Those hours, with the shadows still long and the light reflecting off the lagoon and the triforia windows, reminded me of what Raffaelle Nocera, who otherwise sounded depressed about the state of his city, told me as he navigated a water bus around the Grand Canal.\u201cIf you get up early enough,\u201d Mr. Nocera said, \u201cyou get all of Venice to yourself.\u201dIt reminds you of why it is so worth protecting, and why Italians have been taking a stand.\u201cToday it\u2019s Piazza San Marco or Ponte di Rialto,\u201d Mr. Franceschini said. \u201cIn a few years it could be that the problem spreads.\u201dBecause of an editing error, earlier versions of two picture captions with this article misspelled the name of an island in the Venetian lagoon. It is Giudecca, not Guidecca.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Cancels Employee Meeting Because of Harassment Fears", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google on Thursday canceled a scheduled companywide meeting at which executives had planned to discuss a memo that questioned the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s diversity efforts after employees expressed concern that they would be exposed to harassment online.Google is grappling with the fallout from the memo, which was written by a software engineer who argued that biological differences \u2014 such as women experiencing higher levels of anxiety and a lower tolerance for stress \u2014 helped explain why there are considerably fewer women than men in key engineering positions and leadership roles at the company.On Thursday, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, sent an email to staff members canceling the meeting a half-hour before it was to start.\u201cWe had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote, referring to Dory, the company\u2019s internal moderator system. \u201cGooglers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be \u2018outed\u2019 publicly for asking a question.\u201dGoogle had received hundreds of questions from employees before the meeting. The top ones involved how the company was dealing with employees being harassed for speaking out against Mr. Damore\u2019s memo. Other concerns included how to make it clear that Google did not have lower standards for hiring women and minorities, and what it could do to make political conservatives feel more welcome.As the harassment continued, it focused on specific employees who had spoken out in favor of Mr. Damore\u2019s dismissal. One Twitter account encouraged Google workers to expose the true identities of colleagues and \u201cruin their lives.\u201dMr. Pichai, who was on vacation in Africa as the controversy over the memo spilled into the open, returned to California to hold a town hall-style meeting at Google headquarters in Mountain View.\u201cIn recognition of Googlers\u2019 concerns, we need to step back and create a better set of conditions for us to have the discussion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo in the coming days we will find several forums to gather and engage with Googlers, where people can feel comfortable to speak freely.\u201dMr. Pichai said a \u201cvast majority\u201d of the emails he had received supported the decision to fire Mr. Damore but he noted that some employees had raised concerns about being unable to speak freely.To many in the technology industry, which has struggled to explain why women are paid less than men and promoted less frequently to leadership positions, the memo was evidence of the false justifications offered for the unequal treatment of women.After being fired, Mr. Damore said he was reviewing his options because he viewed the company\u2019s actions as illegal. He said he had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of \u201cmaking threats of unspecified reprisals.\u201d\u201cBut while people may have a right to express their beliefs in public, that does not mean companies cannot take action when women are subjected to comments that perpetuate negative stereotypes about them based on their gender,\u201d wrote Ms. Wojcicki, one of the most powerful women at Google. \u201cEvery day, companies take action against employees who make unlawful statements about co-workers, or create hostile work environments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lampert, Sears borrowed heavily to buy back shares. But Mr. Lampert also appears to be building a moat around his investment. Last year, Sears sold much of its property to another publicly traded company, Seritage Growth Properties. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage. The move meant that Sears had to pay rent on real estate it once owned, to the benefit of Seritage investors.Some analysts say that it is now almost inevitable that, in spite of fixes that Sears is pursuing in its stores, the company is eventually destined for Chapter 11.\u201cThere has been a long, steady sale of assets to the point where the cupboard is pretty bare,\u201d said Ken Perkins, the president of the research provider Retail Metrics.Netflix\u2019s announcement early Monday that it had secured Ms. Rhimes, the creator of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d to an exclusive deal took a key creative force away from ABC, which is owned by Disney.\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal\u201d will stay at ABC, as will some shows already in development, like a \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff.

I mean, it\u2019s an existential sadness. I\u2019m not going to hitch my sadness to what happened over the weekend, but...I was on vacation. The show was on vacation. For some reason, all hell breaks loose in Charlottesville, Virginia.JW: For many reasons, which we\u2019re going to get into.WM: And I don\u2019t know. I feel like we had to come back and talk to each other about it because it seemed crazy not to. What is the point of having the show if when things like this happen we can\u2019t talk about them?

How are you?JW: I\u2019m recovering from this surreality. Is that a word? Surreality.WM: Sure, yeah.JW: Of looking at the lawn in Charlottesville at the University of Virginia that I streaked the night before graduation, woke up the morning of graduation on, and then walked down later that afternoon to graduate and enter into the real world being transformed into a white nationalist/supremacist rally. I can\u2019t get over that. Although I shouldn\u2019t be surprised given what I know about UVA\u2019s history, which is that it had its own chapter of the Ku Klux Klan which also donated money many times over that school\u2019s history, and that UVA was once the site of one of the best known eugenics research programs in the country during the first half of the 20th century.WM: Oh, boy. With that, let\u2019s actually talk about what is going on right now.JW: Let\u2019s do it.WM: I guess...what happened? What is happening? We\u2019re having this conversation on Tuesday, the Tuesday after the Friday of the precipitating events in which a group of white supremacists went on a march with tiki lamps and heil Hitler signs in Charlottesville. That was Friday, and then Saturday, a rally turned into a melee between the supremacists and the anti racists and the anti fascists and some other groups that were there to allegedly keep the peace.JW: A lot of people were hurt, a woman was killed, and now we\u2019re all let scratching our heads going, what\u2019s going on in America? What\u2019s going on in our country?WM: Yeah. And I think part of the reason that we\u2019re having this conversation right now \u2014 like, the two of us are having this conversation right now \u2014 is that nobody seems to know what to do. I mean, there\u2019s a camp of people that thinks this is some kind of turning point. I\u2019m not sure for whom and for what.JW: Right. I\u2019ve definitely seen online people talk about this being the marker of some sort of larger social revolution, but it\u2019s not clear which way we\u2019re turning and whether things are turning for the better or for the worse.WM: Well, first of all, you lived in Charlottesville for more than a minute.JW: Ugh, I did. Well, I was an undergraduate at UVA until 2004.WM: So what happened over the weekend isn\u2019t necessarily new to you?JW: No. I think what\u2019s been really interesting \u2014 I found out about what was happening in Charlottesville via a series of texts. My mom happens to live right outside of Charlottesville and her partner needs medical treatment in Charlottesville, so they go there quite regularly. And this outburst was precipitated by a couple of other events that happened in Charlottesville. There was a KKK rally. There\u2019s been heightened racial tensions in that town in May and July. For those of us who live in Charlottesville, none of this really feels that surprising. When I was there as an undergraduate, there were multiple blackface events. There were racial attacks. One of the first black student body presidents \u2014 or a black student to run for student body president, I guess \u2014 was attacked and told there will never be an n word for president. I looked at her Facebook yesterday and she was just like, of course this is Charlottesville. This is UVA. This is America. Which has been this common refrain to come out of this, right? People keep saying, well, this isn\u2019t our country. It\u2019s actually the most American thing about America, this kind of racialized violence.WM: It is America. America was founded on this very thing.JW: Right. If you were a student of color at UVA \u2014 and I would say, during my time, but any time because subsequent graduates have reported the same thing, you know \u2014 it was not uncommon if you were a black male to be racially profiled on campus. A good friend of mine was walking home one night from studying at the library and was stopped by the police and they took a DNA sample from him to put it on file, which is a violation of so many rights. And he was a student, and they didn\u2019t believe him. But you comply, right, because what else are you taught to do? You\u2019re a student. You don\u2019t know any better. It was a very oppressive feeling place, and it was the kind of place too that really prided itself on a certain kind of southern gentility, which is really important in the context of why Charlottesville matters and also why Robert E. Lee matters. And if you were a student there, it was very common \u2014 people dressed up for football games, boys wore suits, the girls wore pearls. Charlottesville and UVA, of course, is the home and university built by Thomas Jefferson who is seen as this great founder of American modern democracy. When you\u2019re a student there, you get to take a tour of the Jefferson plantation, and they definitely, there\u2019s like a little wink, wink, nod about his relationship to Sally Hemmings. On Valentine\u2019s Day, there are all these signs that go up that say, like T.J. loves Sally. I mean, there\u2019s a way in which that town \u2014WM: Shut up.JW: Mm hmm. There\u2019s a way in which that town \u2014WM: Sally Hemmings, for anybody who doesn\u2019t know, was one of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s many slaves and his most prized. He had a relationship with her for many years.JW: And it\u2019s part of this larger rewriting of a historical narrative and a historical record, right, that slaves had it good, and that slavery was actually kind of benevolent. And it wasn\u2019t that bad. How bad could it have been? And that town really exists as a weird fantasy of what it was like to be part of the Confederacy. The campus is absolutely beautiful. It does have this slow, syrupy feeling of what it meant when America was great again, before, you know? And it does feed into this idea that if you come there and you fit in and you do the things that make you part of the culture, which is there\u2019s a very much a code of conduct, there\u2019s very much a code of dress, then somehow that makes you more American. But it\u2019s really subversive, and it\u2019s really disastrous. It\u2019s why I didn\u2019t really last there for more than a semester or two before I had to go abroad, and then I immediately moved downtown \u2014 and it\u2019s just confusing, too, because you\u2019re just like, this is colloquial college experience. This is what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. And you don\u2019t realize how you get coopted into this way of thinking, and...kind of like...you just get really pushed into believing the myth of the south, right. But when you look closer, there\u2019s a history of erasure and disappearance of blackness in all of Charlottesville, and especially in downtown Charlottesville where this park is. The Robert E. Lee park, which has since been renamed Emancipation park. And by the way \u2014 the groups just wanted to move the statues. They weren\u2019t saying melt them down and turn them into, I don\u2019t know, cool footwear.WM: The city council agreed to just move the statues somewhere else and change the name of the part.JW: Which is what incited all this stuff. But I guess the point I wanted to make is, the people who believe that this heritage, this southern way of life \u2014 which, by the way, includes the minimization and marginalization of people of color, black people and anyone else that\u2019s not white \u2014 are part of this larger group that really believes in this lost cause, the Confederacy. That there was this sort of, you know, if you google lost cause, it comes up that the war that was lost was like a noble one, a heroic one, and a lot of that in part of inspired by the conciliatory speech that Robert E. Lee made when he was announcing defeat. So, it\u2019s all weirdly very connected and Robert E. Lee has become, I think in a lot of ways, very emblematic to this struggle for what was once good. And I\u2019m using air quotes. It was not good for us. It was not good. But I think that\u2019s important to remember. That these groups have effectively rewritten the past, and they\u2019re fighting to preserve what they believe was the past for the present and for the future. And on the other side of it, you have people that are saying, oh, no, no, no, we have to aggressively rethink the past now, otherwise we\u2019re going to be screwed in the future. And that\u2019s actually really what the fight is coming down to: the way we want to think about what happened in the past.WM: I think that thinking about the future and the past in the context of the present is really useful. I think that one thing about being a black American is that you carry that around with you all the time. I think you are always aware of your physical place in any space. I\u2019m always aware of my blackness, whether I\u2019m among other black people and I can feel how special in some ways that is, or if I\u2019m in predominantly white environments as I frequently am and you are very quietly bracing yourself for something that probably won\u2019t even happen, but could.JW: And that\u2019s actually the point of those statues, and the Confederate memorials that are both very visible and not. There was a huge boom after the civil rights movement to build these memorials because this was the point. Just this subtle reminder of the racial terrorism that had happened in the past and that it could happen again at any moment. Gone but not forgotten.WM: Right. So, I think that there are really two important events that kicked off this current situation that we\u2019re in. Well, I mean, there are three, the first of which is the election of Barack Obama in 2008. But I also think that within that context, I think Dylann Roof\u2019s murder of nine people at the Emanuel AME church in June of 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 that same month, Donald Trump announces his presidential campaign. And he doesn\u2019t just announce his presidential campaign. He basically kicks it off with this announcement that Mexicans are \u2014 you know, the famous, now infamous Mexicans are rapists and murderers speech, or observation, or lie. It sets a climate that never goes away, but the storm clouds keep gathering. They\u2019ve been gathering for two years. And frankly, they\u2019ve been gathering since \u2014 well, I mean, in the Donald Trump context, because really, Donald Trump\u2019s relationship to all of this, in my mind, he and Barack Obama are nationally, psychically conjoined. Obama becomes elected, Trump starts his birther campaign. The constant nagging question that he creates in people\u2019s minds about Barack Obama\u2019s \u2014JW: Legitimacy.WM: Legitimacy as an American citizen. Constantly otherizing him. It really satisfied a lot of white people. That seed of doubt has flowered, I think, into this awful organism that showed up in Charlottesville over the weekend.JW: Right.WM: It\u2019s not that it\u2019s new. But it is the first active, violent manifestation of what Donald Trump is about, like the vessel that he is. And that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really upsetting. It\u2019s not so much that what happened is necessarily new. It\u2019s now, you are seeing these physical manifestations in the real world of what was going on at his rallies as egged on by him. In February, in suburban Kansas City, a white man shot an Indian man under the assumption that he was a Muslim from the Middle East. A few months later, there was a stabbing on a train in Portland. A man stabbed two men who were trying to protect a couple Muslim women.JW: Muslim American women.WM: Muslim American women, sorry, from him, who was just defiant in the courtroom about what he did. I hope they all die, he said. I\u2019m going to say that on the stand. I\u2019m a patriot, and I hope everyone I stabbed died.JW: I think it\u2019s easy for people to view that man and his views as an anomaly, as an abnormality. But he\u2019s not. It\u2019s becoming the new norm. Southern Poverty Law Center reported recently that the number of hate groups in the U.S. rose for the second year in a row. The most dramatic growth was the near tripling of anti Muslim hate groups, which went from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year. The FBI also said that hate crimes against Muslims grew by 67 percent in 2015, the year in which Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign. So, it\u2019s a clear correlation between the two things, and it feels really terrifying to have a president who won\u2019t come out and say, these are deplorable acts. And so, it now perpetuates this feeling of very state sponsored and government sponsored violence of racial terror. That if you are a person of color walking around these United States, at any moment, you could be a target of racial violence or racial terrorism that is essentially state and government sponsored. Very few of the people who have perpetuated crimes against black people, whether they be police officers or anybody else, have been prosecuted for it.WM: Right. That\u2019s a fact. Okay, we\u2019re going to take a break here, and we\u2019ll be right back. I think that one of the striking things about what happened on Saturday was that a lot of the clashing was being done between white people.JW: Right.WM: I was talking to a number of people who found those images confusing because they couldn\u2019t tell who was which, and that was really fascinating to me, because in the history of battles against white supremacy in this country, it\u2019s been black people confronting white people or white state controlled or government controlled apparatus turned against black people. And so, in a sense, there is something new about a race melee featuring more white people fighting each other than black people and white people.JW: I found it comforting.WM: It was perversely comforting.JW: It was perversely comforting to see how many white people showed up.WM: Because \u2014 and this gets to this idea that people don\u2019t want to hear about white supremacy, because they aren\u2019t white supremacists \u2014 but you are white. And I think part of the problem with the conversation around white supremacy is that white people might not feel like they\u2019re white supremacists at all. In fact, most aren\u2019t. But there\u2019s a system by which white supremacy operates, and it is set up to benefit white people. Now, you don\u2019t have to be a practicing racist to benefit from racism.JW: It\u2019s basically just interest on whiteness, you just collect the checks.WM: You have, as a beneficiary, as a permanent beneficiary of that system, a duty to challenge it when it loses its mind and actively begins to start doing things like taking away people\u2019s rights and actively harming people, which is what this administration seems intent on doing from policy proposal to policy proposal to policy proposal.JW: Mm hmm. And there are a lot more anti fascists in this country, too, than I think we realize, and I think that\u2019s why a lot of the signs that were making the rounds on social media \u2014 there was that older woman holding a sign that was like, I escaped the Nazis once, I\u2019m not going to do it again. You know, and I think that\u2019s also closely aligned with other Americans in this country who are just like, I am not for this racism either. I think those two groups are coming together in a really significant way, which is encouraging to me.WM: Yes. I\u2019m a little bit of a wimp when it comes to this, like the violence. I don\u2019t want to see anybody hurt, killed, whatever. I understand that for some people, it took the death of Heather Heyer who was killed by the crazy person who \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t even give him the benefit of being crazy \u2014 the racist who drove a car into the crowd on Saturday afternoon. It\u2019s going to take something like her death to galvanize people to understand that \u2014JW: That next time it could be them.WM: It could be you. I also find it \u2014 and this is the point at which I think it\u2019s really important to talk about Donald Trump in like a real way, because his refusal to say anything on Saturday was unsurprising to me. But his failure to acknowledge the deaths of three people involved in this, and the many injured people...the very least a president can do is condemn racism, racists, and white supremacists. The second easiest thing to do as president, and crucial, I would say, is to acknowledge the pain and suffering of people who didn\u2019t have to die \u2014 over the weekend, for instance \u2014 but did.JW: Instead, we got a tweet from Ivanka Trump, which made her the highest ranking official in the White House to acknowledge.WM: The failure of this man to lead in any direction is...it\u2019s a travesty of American democracy in the most perverse sense. I would have more respect for him if he went up there and said, you know what, guys? Thanks for doing my bidding out there. I\u2019m so glad to see you guys come out.JW: Jesus. I understand but \u2014WM: But wouldn\u2019t that be something? Rather than like, this non answer. And then, so like two days later, we this B.S. thing where he condemns all racism as evil? Donald Trump, you don\u2019t fool me for one second. First of all, I mean, the idea that we can\u2019t talk about Donald Trump being a racist and all the racist energy is being directed at Stephen Bannon, who is one of his advisors? And Stephen Miller, who also is advising Donald Trump? Uh uh. That\u2019s lunacy to me. He\u2019s as racist as anybody.JW: But it feels like the beginning of a tide, though.WM: Oh? What kind of tide?JW: I don\u2019t know. Like purging, like the purge.WM: You know what? Purge Donald Trump. Because getting rid of Steve Bannon does nothing for me. It\u2019s not like \u2014 I mean, Steve Bannon didn\u2019t deny anybody the right to live in a Trump building in 1970 something. Stephen Bannon didn\u2019t take out an ad in 1989 to condemn the Central Park Five, who were accused of raping a woman they didn\u2019t actually rape, were exonerated like 25 years later, and Donald Trump then takes out an editorial in the same newspaper saying that the settlement and the exoneration were stupid and bogus.JW: Look, I know the rod goes all the way up to the top. I know. I know. I know. However, the purge has to start somewhere, and at least it feels there are now starting to be some checks and balances, whereas before there were none. And if it takes Google and AirBnB and tech companies who have pushed back and said, you know, we\u2019re not going to host the websites of these companies, we\u2019re not going to host neo-Nazis...when the president won\u2019t say it, if the people around him are saying it, even if it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m the most cynical person about when tech companies and CEOs and various people do things in their own interest, because it\u2019s always in their own business interest, but when they make these stands, they\u2019re highly public, they\u2019re highly visible. They\u2019re the most visible signs we can get, since the president won\u2019t say this is deplorable and I condemn this behavior. When we have CEOs who are \u2014 frankly, the CEO of Google is as powerful as the president in a lot of ways \u2014 saying I don\u2019t condone this behavior, I\u2019ll take it, because we\u2019re not getting much else right now. We\u2019re not getting anything else right now.WM: Well, you know what we got on Saturday at about like 8 PM?JW: What?WM: Speaking of presidential. Barack Obama went on Twitter.JW: What\u2019d he say?WM: He just basically quoted Nelson Mandela, and he had this quote about \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ll read the whole thing. \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate. And if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\u201d Ah...I just can\u2019t believe that nobody in that administration could find it in their hearts to like...JW: Yeah.WM: It\u2019s so crazy to me. This is like insane.JW: But look, they will be \u2014 I honestly am starting to believe, though \u2014 there will be more Bree Newsome, who is the woman who shimmed up the pole to take down the Confederate flag. There will be more Mitchell Andrews, who was the mayor of New Orleans who facilitated the taking down of Confederate statues. And when we were in New Orleans, people were saying to me, well, we need more Mitches. Because we\u2019re going forward. We\u2019re not going back. Change is violent. The transition from the last century was violent, too. This one\u2019s also going to be violent. We\u2019re moving forward.WM: Well, we\u2019re moving forward, but he still can\u2019t fix the water pumps to keep the flooding out of New Orleans. So...I know, I don\u2019t expect anything from this administration, and it doesn\u2019t really matter what they say, as long as they\u2019re trying to repeal affirmative action policy. As long as they\u2019re trying to stop people from entering this country lawfully or to escape persecution in other places. As long as they are trying to do any of the other number of things \u2014 like take back voting rights from people? Like all the stuff that our ancestors marched and died for. To repeal those things like it\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t care what they say. They can say whatever they want. They can get rid of whoever they want, as long as there are people in place to keep those policies from being enacted or to repeal them or to water them down. Donald Trump can condemn racism every day for the rest of his administration as long. As long as he\u2019s trying to get this other stuff done, that contradicts \u2014 any statement against white supremacy he can, he is still practicing white supremacy in his presidency.JW: These are dark times. I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat it. There are dark times. The outcome can\u2019t be, this is only bad when it gets bloody. Because the blood is invisible but it\u2019s everywhere all the time. And that\u2019s what I was trying to say earlier in a very muddled way about people who are posting on social media. Like, white silence is violence. I\u2019m like, my dude. Your Facebook post is white silence. Organize a dinner. Raise money. Do something. Support an organization. If you\u2019re a journalist, write a story. Don\u2019t...like, I had to go to yoga yesterday and really work out some emotions, because the number of people posting on Facebook ... I also saw, I will say, an equal number of people actively protesting at Trump power \u2014 oh my God! I saw, I saw as many if not equal or more posts from white friends in my feeds who were protesting at Trump Tower, which makes me feel good because I\u2019m like, that is an active action, not a passive one to me, but I\u2019m, I need people to take action. Because the administration is not going to do it. A Facebook post is not going to do it. All the attention that was focused on Charlottesville has energized white supremacists, has energized right wing supremacists, many of whom are organizing various satellite versions of exactly what went down. They\u2019re going to San Francisco to protest Google. They\u2019re going to Berkeley. The flames are being fanned.WM: Mm hmm. Yeah. The rallies are coming to your town, so fasten your seatbelts.JW: There\u2019s a quote from a guy in the article the Times ran today that said, every city needs to watch out. We are everywhere.WM: I think Make America Great Again is ... you know, one of the most savagely brilliant marketing campaigns ever. I mean, it\u2019s the sieg heil of the 21st century.JW: Absolutely.WM: Well, one of the crazy things I\u2019ve been thinking was \u2014 I mean, this is kind of grim, but I think about it all the time when you see these white nationalists co-opt the language of oppressed people. The optics of what happened on Friday with that march with the tiki lamps to me looked like a Take Back the Night rally on a college campus. And...I think a lot about like, what do these people, what do they want? And it\u2019s kind of a miracle that you and I are even sitting here, given all the other people who have died over the course of the last 200 years. Well, beyond 200 years. It\u2019s amazing like they didn\u2019t just kill us all and just make us all go away. I mean, it\u2019s not so much that I want to die or like, I just think it\u2019s a miracle that they didn\u2019t just round us up in 1865 when there was just, there was no more...there was no more slavery, basically, and just kill us all because otherwise, to incorporate us into society would just be impossible. And as it turns out, it\u2019s still kind of impossible to get total peace. And, of course, they couldn\u2019t do that because slavery was part of a capitalist system and they still needed the work. They needed labor. But I think about the American Indians all the time, and how \u2014 I mean, you and I have like cried about this on the show before...JW: I know. Which has also gotten rewritten in this whole thing, where there was a Times story taking first person accounts from the various events on Friday and Saturday in Charlottesville, and someone who came out to support the white nationalist party said, well, America is for white people. Africa is for black people. Forgetting that before that, America was for brown people! It\u2019s like, so your memory only goes back a century or two? Like, what the hell?WM: You know, I just \u2014 and I also don\u2019t mean to make it seem like freed slaves would have allowed themselves to be killed, like willy nilly, but I think that, as campaigns go, I object to calling these guys Nazis, because...JW: It affords a kind of distancing.WM: It creates a very safe distance from actual white nationalist, KKK racists. There are a lot of young people \u2014 I mean, many people have noted the number of young people who have been out there on Friday and Saturday \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what you do about that. That\u2019s the part of me that feels a little bit hopeless. Like...lost cause, lost cause in one direction, lost cause in another direction.JW: Yeah.WM: I don\u2019t know what we do. I mean, I think we, we cannot forget what this administration is about, no matter what they say in the coming days and weeks about supporting black people.JW: But on a hyperlocal level, we\u2019re beyond safety pins. I mean, that\u2019s my takeaway from all this, though, which is that like, the situation is as dire as it\u2019s going to get.WM: I don\u2019t know what happens now, but we\u2019ll be here.JW: We\u2019ll be here next week.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "What a Fraternity Hazing Death Revealed About the Painful Search for an Asian-American Identity", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "FeatureWhen Michael Deng, a college freshman, joined an Asian-American fraternity, he was looking for a sense of belonging and identity. Two months later he was dead.Supported byOn an overcast, chilly day in October 2015, Sheldon Wong, Charles Lai, Kenny Kwan, Raymond Lam and Daniel Li were arraigned in the Pocono Pines courthouse. All five belonged to Pi Delta Psi, an Asian-\u00adAmerican college fraternity. All five were young men from Chinese families who grew up in Queens. When I arrived at the courthouse that morning, one of the TV cameramen who had gathered in the parking lot began following me. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not on trial,\u2019\u2019 I said. He chuckled and tilted his head at his colleagues, who had perked up and slung their rigs up to their shoulders. \u2018\u2018Well, you\u2019re going to get more of the same when those guys see you,\u2019\u2019 he said. He was right: The cameras swarmed. And I suppose, given the surroundings, that I couldn\u2019t much blame them. By choosing these gray hills for an initiation ceremony, the fraternity brothers had unintentionally made it possible that their fates could be decided by a jury made up of locals who wondered just what these Asian men had been doing here.Friends and families of the defendants sat in the back of the courtroom, staring stolidly into space. When the proceedings started, the younger relatives of the defendants quietly translated, for their elders in the gallery, the greetings between Judge Richard S. Claypool and the small army of defense lawyers and the lengthy reading of charges, which included hazing, hindering the investigation, assault, conspiracy and murder in the third degree.Claypool, a tall, bald man who looked as if he had rolled out of bed in his magisterial robes, appeared to be unmoved by the defense lawyers\u2019 attempts to reduce the $500,000 bail or to characterize their clients, none of whom had a criminal record, as law-\u00adabiding citizens. \u2018\u2018I know that what I\u2019m supposed to be seeing in front of me are some nicely dressed, cooperative kids,\u2019\u2019 Claypool said in a flat drawl. \u2018\u2018What we\u2019re seeing here is different from what happened that night. Reading the affidavit shows a lot of poor judgment from the kids.\u2019\u2019 Claypool\u2019s mild manner then veered into something closer to exasperation: \u2018\u2018Reviewing the charges, I am surprised that the D.A.\u2019s office came in as low as they did. The $500,000 bail stands.\u2019\u2019Now came the business of sorting out who could pay bail and who would be headed to jail. The lawyers whispered instructions to their clients, who tried to put on a brave face for their visibly shocked parents. Lam and Wong left with their lawyers. Kwan and Lai, who could not come up with bail at the time, were escorted to a side room and handcuffed. (Kwan would eventually make bail, as would Li, for a lesser amount, $150,000.)Outside, as the press waited for Kwan and Lai to be led to a waiting police car, I spoke to an Asian television-\u00adnews producer who had also made the trip from New York. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m just imagining what my parents would think about all this,\u2019\u2019 she said. We had one of those talks common among people of any marginalized group, in which it\u2019s possible to unload your neuroses without having to explain everything. I told her, absurdly, that if I had been charged with murder, I would have faked my death so my parents wouldn\u2019t know.The families of the defendants straggled out the front door of the courthouse, some holding up their forearms to shield their faces from the cameras.\u2018\u2018What are they thinking?\u2019\u2019 the producer asked under her breath.When Chun Hsien was born in 1995, his mother realized that he would need an American name. She found a ranking of the most popular names for American boys and chose \u2018\u2018Michael\u2019\u2019 when she saw it at the top. While Michael\u2019s father flew to and from China for work, young Michael and his mother trudged through the mundane adjustments and small humiliations of life in America \u2014 new grocery stores, new bus systems, a Balkanized gathering of fellow immigrants who may look like you but who are not like you in the ways that matter.Michael quickly became ensconced within the Asian bubble of Queens. In 1990, Asians made up 22.1 percent of Flushing\u2019s population. By 2010, that figure topped 70 percent. The population began to creep out into nearby middle-\u00adclass neighborhoods like Bayside, where the schools were better and the relatively spacious houses sat on quiet streets with tidy, uniformly rectilinear front lawns. By the time Michael entered Middle School 74, in Bayside, the school\u2019s population was majority Asian.Michael\u2019s mother left her job and studied up on the subjects Michael was taking in school. \u2018\u2018Math and science, of course I could help him with that,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But English and history \u2014 those things \u2014 I could only encourage him and try to keep up.\u2019\u2019 In his free time, Michael roamed the handball courts in Bayside and became a formidable player. In eighth grade, he took the city\u2019s Specialized High School Admissions Test and placed into Bronx Science, which is in New York\u2019s top tier of selective public schools, with Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech.Like Middle School 74, Bronx Science\u2019s student body is majority Asian. There are all-\u00adAsian cliques from Flushing, all-\u00adAsian cliques from Manhattan, all-\u00adAsian cliques from Sunset Park in Brooklyn. These groups might be created by immigration patterns, school districts and real \u00adestate developments, but they are reinforced through long hours in standardized-\u00adtest tutoring, weekends spent at Chinese- or Korean-\u00adlanguage classes and long subway trips up to the Bronx.It was on one of those long rides that Michael got to know William Yuan. They recognized each other from art class and decided to skip school to play handball. The boys became fast friends.Deng and Yuan were popular enough \u2014 not quite in the party crowd at Bronx Science but not quite nerds. When I asked Yuan what he and his friends had done for fun, he began to describe a life that would feel very familiar to anyone who grew up in any of the Asian enclaves in the United States: boba shops, Pok\u00e9mon, study groups, rich F.O.B.s (Asian immigrants who are \u2018\u2018fresh off the boat\u2019\u2019) and the uneven attention from parents who feel the need to pressure their children but who, because of the language barrier and cultural ignorance, often don\u2019t know what they have become.\u2018\u2018We\u2019d play League of Legends\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a multiplayer computer game \u2014 \u2018\u2018and play handball and eat,\u2019\u2019 Yuan said, describing a typical weekend. \u2018\u2018I know it might sound like a simple life, but it never felt all that simple to us. When we hung out, we hung with almost all Chinese kids, but it wasn\u2019t racist or anything. I guess it\u2019s human nature to hang out with people who are like you.\u2019\u2019When it was time to choose a college, Deng was faced with a choice between following Yuan to Stony Brook University on Long Island or going somewhere more local. He didn\u2019t want to leave his mother, so he decided to enroll at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York and a commuter school whose entire campus consists of a handful of buildings near Gramercy Park in Manhattan. Most of Baruch\u2019s students live off campus, but Deng wanted a college experience that felt a bit more like what he had seen in the movies \u2014 pranks, girls and freedom from parents \u2014 so he moved into the nearby dormitories. His assigned roommate was Jay Chen, an 18-year-old freshman from Long Island. Deng and Chen tried to build their own small version of campus life, with Deng taking the cockier, worldly lead and Chen playing his sidekick. Two years after Deng\u2019s death, Chen recalled their time together in a letter addressed to the memory of his old roommate: \u2018\u2018I remember on my birthday, freshman year, you brought home a six pack of Corona for us to celebrate. I never questioned how you were able to get your hands on it, but I was just glad you did. Of course, being the type of people we were, we didn\u2019t have bottle openers. Obviously the most important thing to do at that moment was to figure out ways to open a bottle without a bottle opener. Thanks to you, I now know about 900 different ways to open a bottle without a bottle opener.\u2019\u2019What little social life existed on campus at Baruch was dominated by its tiny Greek system, and freshmen, especially those who showed any interest in campus life, were aggressively recruited. At night in their room, Deng and Chen lay in their beds and debated whether to rush one of two big Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternities at Baruch, Pi Delta Psi and Lambda Phi Epsilon. Chen decided fraternities weren\u2019t for him. Deng chose Pi Delta Psi.\u2018\u2018Michael would come home and tell me about all the people he had met,\u2019\u2019 Chen said. \u2018\u2018He seemed enthusiastic at first. But as pledging continued, he seemed to get more tired, and he became less of his normal self. We spoke less. Every time he came home, he was absolutely exhausted and usually fell straight to sleep.\u2019\u2019On Thanksgiving weekend, Deng went home to Flushing. His new friends from Baruch, many from families who lived nearby, came and went from his house. Deng had started dating a member of one of Baruch\u2019s Asian sororities who grew up a few miles away from the Dengs in Queens. She told him that her family did not eat turkey on the holidays, so Deng had his mother cook more than usual and took a box of leftovers to her house. He did not tell his mother, his girlfriend or Jay Chen about his coming trip to the Poconos.Discrimination is what really binds Asian-\u00adAmericans together. The early scholars of Asian-\u00adAmerican studies came out of the \u2018\u2018Third World Liberation Front\u2019\u2019 of the late \u201960s, which pushed against the Eurocentric bent of the academy. When Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies programs began spreading in California in the early \u201970s, their curriculums grew out of personal narratives of oppression, solidarity forged through the exhumation of common hardships. \u2018\u2018Roots: An Asian-\u00adAmerican Reader,\u2019\u2019 one of the first textbooks offered to Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies students at U.C.L.A., was published in 1971; the roots of the title referred not to some collective Asian heritage but, the editors wrote, to the \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018roots\u2019 of the issues facing Asians in America.\u2019\u2019The project of defining Asian-\u00adAmerican identity was largely limited to Ivy League and West Coast universities until 1982, when Vincent Chin, who worked at an automotive engineering firm in Detroit, was beaten to death by assailants who blamed Japanese competition for the downturn in the American auto market. When Chin\u2019s killers were sentenced to probation and fined $3,000, protesters marched in cities across the country, giving rise to a new Pan-\u00adAsian unity forged by the realization that if Chin, the son of Chinese immigrants, could be killed because of Japanese auto imports, the concept of an \u2018\u2018Asian-\u00adAmerican\u2019\u2019 identity had consequences.\u2018\u2018His death was this great moment of realization,\u2019\u2019 Christine Choy, a Korean-\u00adAmerican filmmaker and former member of the Black Panther Party, told me. \u2018\u2018It galvanized a lot of people who said they can\u2019t stand by anymore and let things go without any sort of legal or political representation.\u2019\u2019Chin\u2019s death came at the beginning of a huge demographic shift on college campuses. The children of the hundreds of thousands of Asian immigrants who flooded into the country after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 had grown up. Between 1976 and 2008, the number of Asian-\u00adAmericans enrolled in four-year colleges increased sixfold. Many of these young men and women had graduated from the same magnet schools, attended the same churches, studied together in the same test-prep classes, but their sense of Asian-\u00adness had never been explained to them, at least not in the codified language of the multicultural academy.\u2018\u2018Who Killed Vincent Chin?\u2019\u2019 a 1989 documentary directed by Choy and Renee Tajima-\u00adPe\u00f1a, was shown in Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies classes across the country. Over the next decade, a rhetoric took hold that argued for a collective identity rooted in both the death of Vincent Chin and the debates over affirmative action, but it still felt strange to those who had grown up Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino. Whether expressed through scholarship or private, daily conversation, this vocabulary was imprecise and cloistered within the academy. By the early \u201990s, when the Los Angeles riots thrust Asian-\u00adAmericans onto the national stage, the brio of \u2018\u2018Roots\u2019\u2019 had mostly been supplanted by a shy, scholarly neurosis that sought to figure out why Asian \u2014 particularly Korean \u2014 businesses had been targeted by rioters, but lacked the platform or the confidence to ask.The modern Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternity was born out of the protests of the \u201980s and the growing alienation that Asian-\u00adAmericans felt on campus. Of the 18 Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternities and sororities recognized by the National Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Panhellenic Association, 16 were founded between 1990 and 2000. Their mission statements promise the \u2018\u2018making of successful leaders,\u2019\u2019 as well as a commitment to service and \u2018\u2018community awareness.\u2019\u2019 The messages from the fraternities and sororities are remarkably similar \u2014 unity to achieve unexpected success, brotherhood and sisterhood devoted to establishing a professional network of high-\u00adfunctioning alumni. Initiations tend to promote a vague vision of Pan-\u00adAsian identity that reflects the history of Asian-\u00adAmerican scholarship and activism, but whose urgency has been hollowed out by years of apathy.In 1994, the same year Michael Deng\u2019s parents immigrated from China, 11 students at Binghamton University founded the first chapter of Pi Delta Psi. By 2000, the fraternity had chapters at 11 colleges in four states. In those early days, the brothers pieced together a mission from bits of what they had been learning in Asian-\u00adAmerican-\u00adstudies classes. Each fraternity chapter\u2019s \u2018\u2018educator\u2019\u2019 developed a curriculum for pledges. Some weeks were devoted to more predictable topics like ethnic foods or the origin of Asian flags, but the focus was overwhelmingly on instances of racism experienced by Asian-\u00adAmericans. Over the last two decades, the curriculum has been updated modestly, depending on the chapter. There is, for example, a \u2018\u2018function\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the fraternity\u2019s term for an educational activity \u2014 in which pledges research and write reports on the murder of Vincent Chin. Another function centers on the Los Angeles riots and their catastrophic impact on Korean small-\u00adbusiness owners. Around the time of Deng\u2019s death, there were plans to introduce a function highlighting the death of Danny Chen, a young man from Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown who committed suicide after a military hazing incident. \u2018\u2018It was kind of like taking a half-course credit,\u2019\u2019 Lex Ngoto, a Pi Delta Psi alumnus from New York University who now works in banking, told me. \u2018\u2018We would even meet in classrooms and get assignments and reports. Then we\u2019d get tested by the brothers, and if we missed a question, we\u2019d have to do push-ups.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018I ended up appreciating it. I hung out with Asian kids in high school, but we weren\u2019t really aware, if that makes sense. Learning about what happened to us \u2014 you know, Asian people in America \u2014 it awakened me to a lot of things.\u2019\u2019This was a common refrain among many of the Pi Delta Psi alumni I spoke to: kinship through a common history of suffering, consciousness through education. They also told of pledge functions that sound much more like typical, if sometimes even laughably innocuous, hazing. While always dressed in black sweats or military fatigues, they took part in trust falls, scavenger hunts and the \u2018\u2018divide and conquer\u2019\u2019 function, in which pledges were dropped off in different locations without their cellphones and instructed to find one another at a predetermined meet-up spot. Before \u2018\u2018crossing\u2019\u2019 into brotherhood, the pledges were subjected to \u2018\u2018hell week,\u2019\u2019 deprived of sleep and made to carry book bags typically filled with bricks, concrete blocks or bowling balls.Not all Pi Delta Psi pledges experienced a profound racial awakening. A former member of the University at Buffalo\u2019s chapter told me that he was more ambivalent about the fraternity\u2019s cultural curriculum. \u2018\u2018The fraternity says they are about raising awareness of Asian-\u00adAmericans, but it\u2019s all [expletive],\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really just about partying and feeling like you belong to something.\u2019\u2019 All the Pi Delta Psi alumni I spoke to said push-ups were one of the most common forms of physical punishment. The University at Buffalo brother recalled being blindfolded for hours during his initiation ceremony and shoved into the dirt. Everyone recalls being roughed up in a ritual called the Glass Ceiling.The night before, Deng drove with some classmates from New York City to a house on Candlewood Drive in Tunkhannock Township, a tiny community in the Poconos. The place, which had been rented for the weekend, was big and plain in the sprawling style found in towns where acreage is no object. A line of spindly young trees marked the border of a grassy, flat backyard where Deng and his fellow pledges would be initiated into Pi Delta Psi.As older brothers from Baruch and St. John\u2019s University in Queens arrived throughout the night, Deng and the pledges served food, dealt cards and performed some of the fraternity\u2019s initiation rituals, including the \u2018\u2018Bataan Death March,\u2019\u2019 in which, in some Pan-\u00adAsian effort to understand the hardships inflicted upon Filipino P.O.W.s by the Imperial Japanese Army, they dragged themselves across the ground on their elbows.Sometime after midnight, the brothers gathered for the Glass Ceiling, one of the fraternity\u2019s most hallowed rituals. Also known as the Gauntlet, or just the \u2018\u2018G,\u2019\u2019 the ceremony varies from chapter to chapter, but it typically plays out in three stages: First, a pledge is blindfolded and separated from his assigned \u2018\u2018Big,\u2019\u2019 an older fraternity brother, by a line of brothers whose arms are linked together. For the most part, this line signifies the barrier between glumly accepting America\u2019s vision of emasculated, toadying Asian men and the great promise of success and masculine fulfillment. As his Big calls out his name, a pledge, or \u2018\u2018Little,\u2019\u2019 crosses his arms across his chest and walks toward his Big\u2019s voice. He soon runs into the line of brothers, who call him \u2018\u2018chink,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018gook\u2019\u2019 and whatever other racial slurs they can muster. The verbal abuse lasts for 10 minutes or more. In the second stage, the pledge is instructed to push through the wall of brothers, who in turn shove him back toward his starting spot. The third stage isn\u2019t much different from the second: The pledge is still wandering blindfolded toward his Big\u2019s calls, but instead of being pushed, he is knocked to the ground or, in some chapters, even tackled. Once the pledge educator determines that the pledge has had enough, he calls for a halt and may ask, Why did you not ask your brothers for help?I did not know to ask, the pledge responds.Ask your brothers for their help, the pledge educator instructs.The pledge asks for help. His brothers form a line behind him and, in solemn unison, guide him to his Big.While all this is happening, the pledge is supposed to be thinking about his parents and the sacrifices they made as immigrants, the humiliations they faced and the oppressive invisibility of Asian lives in America. The pushing, the tackling and the racial abuse are meant to be the physical expression of their struggle. That final walk, in which the pledge is shepherded to his Big by all of the fraternity\u2019s members, is intended to teach him that solidarity with his fellow Asians is his only hope of making it in a white world.Officially, the national fraternity does not allow the sort of tackling that took place during Deng\u2019s initiation. A lawyer representing Pi Delta Psi refers to it as \u2018\u2018a direct violation of the fraternity\u2019s policies.\u2019\u2019 But every former member I spoke to, from several different colleges, told me that the Glass Ceiling is deeply ingrained in the fraternity\u2019s culture. \u2018\u2018In reality,\u2019\u2019 Daniel Li told the court, referring to the ritual\u2019s rendition at Baruch \u2014 he was the president of Pi Delta Psi there at the time of Deng\u2019s death \u2014 the national Pi Delta Psi leaders \u2018\u2018knew what was going on.\u2019\u2019Deng was the last of his pledge class to go through the Glass Ceiling. He made it through the first two stages, but in the middle of the third he got up unsteadily after one tackle. Then, according to testimony later given by Li, the pledge assistant Kenny Kwan, starting 10 to 15 feet away, ran at full speed into Deng and slammed him to the ground. Deng did not get up.Li, 21 at the time, would later tell prosecutors that Deng was making \u2018\u2018groaning sounds.\u2019\u2019 According to Li, Sheldon Wong, who was 21 and the pledge educator, picked Deng up and, with others\u2019 help, carried him inside the rental house. Charles Lai, who was 23 and Deng\u2019s Big, told detectives that Deng\u2019s body felt \u2018\u2018straight like a board.\u2019\u2019 Fraternity members stripped off his clothes, cold and wet with frost, and laid him down by the fireplace and covered him with a blanket. At 5:05 a.m., the police timeline indicates, one brother called his girlfriend, a nurse, to ask what she thought could be causing Deng to be so unresponsive. Eight minutes later, another brother Googled \u2018\u2018conscious\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018unconscious.\u2019\u2019 At 5:55, a fraternity brother named Revel Deng texted a friend four times to ask about his grandfather\u2019s fatal fall down the stairs. During this period, none of the three dozen brothers in the Poconos called 911. Nobody summoned an ambulance because, according to a statement given to detectives, someone had looked up how much it would cost and determined that the price would be too high.Around 6 a.m., Wong, Lai and a third brother drove Michael Deng to the emergency room of Geisinger Wyoming Valley hospital. Shortly after they arrived, at 6:42, Deng\u2019s mother received a call from the hospital telling her that her son was in a coma and asking if he had any medical allergies. The hospital also contacted the local police.As Lai waited for an update on his Little\u2019s condition, he started sending texts, the police later discovered, to the national president of Pi Delta Psi, Andy Meng, the brother of Grace Meng, a congresswoman who represents the heavily Asian Sixth District in Queens. At 7:25 a.m., Lai texted Revel Deng: \u2018\u2018Put everything away.\u2019\u2019 Lai told a detective at the hospital that he had been in contact with a brother at the national fraternity; texts on Lai\u2019s phone showed that Andy Meng encouraged the hiding of fraternity items.Andy Meng\u2019s lawyer, Michael A. Ventrella, says Meng is cooperating with police. \u2018\u2018He was not at the scene,\u2019\u2019 according to Ventrella, \u2018\u2018and only found out about it after the incident. Under his watch, the fraternity had previously handed out strict guidelines prohibiting the actions that took place.\u2019\u2019 (Revel Deng, Lai and Lam refused to comment for this article.)Michael Deng died the next morning with his mother by his bedside. A forensic pathologist later determined that he had died from multiple traumatic injuries to the head and that the delay in treatment had \u2018\u2018significantly contributed\u2019\u2019 to his death.As Li testified, the four remaining brothers slumped in their chairs and stared at their hands. There were none of the courthouse theatrics that they must have seen in Mafia movies when a rat takes the stand; no one glared at Li or whispered angrily to their lawyers. Instead, an awkward hush fell over the courtroom, in part because Li couldn\u2019t make it through an answer without being reprompted by the prosecutor, but also because the lie of solidarity was being unraveled and laid out in front of the young men who had been stupid enough to believe in it. For Li\u2019s cooperation in the case against his four brothers, the State of Pennsylvania reduced the charges against him \u2014 they no longer include murder \u2014 and delayed his court proceedings.A few days later, Kwan called me at home in Brooklyn. He said he had heard that an Asian writer was going to write about the case from an Asian perspective. I told him that I was, indeed, an Asian writer. He paused and asked if I knew someone who could help him get his story out in a way that wasn\u2019t biased against Asians. I told him that I\u2019d be happy to talk to him, but I wanted to be clear: I wasn\u2019t working on an article whose aim was to exonerate him and his brothers, and he should talk to his lawyer before calling me back. Over the past year, I\u2019ve found myself wondering what exactly Kwan might have meant by an \u2018\u2018Asian perspective.\u2019\u2019 Was he asking for fairness or was he asking me to choose sides?Kwan never called back, but he wasn\u2019t the only Baruch brother who wondered if there might be some value in talking to me. Months before, I met Sheldon Wong at his lawyer\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan. Wong is tall and handsome, with sharp cheekbones and a puckered mouth that twitches when he\u2019s anxious. At the arraignment in the Poconos, Wong stared at a spot on the carpet as his fraternity brothers squirmed and slouched and tried to screw on brave faces. During our meeting, Wong switched between what looked like nerves and a quiet earnestness. In those more candid moments, I could see why he had taken on the role of pledge educator \u2014 why, he said, his mother had encouraged him to seek a career as a psychologist.His life, at least on the surface, wasn\u2019t much different from Michael Deng\u2019s. He was born in Flushing but spent his early childhood in a predominantly Italian-\u00adAmerican neighborhood in Jamaica, Queens. His mother, who immigrated from Hong Kong to New York as a teenager, left his father, a construction worker, when Wong was 5 and moved the two of them to Flushing, where she worked as a waitress. \u2018\u2018When I was in Jamaica, most of my friends were the Italian kids in the neighborhood,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018When we moved to Flushing, there weren\u2019t as many Asian kids as there are now. I was still one of the only ones. Most of my friends were black or Hispanic \u2014 I just hung out with whoever I was around at the time.\u2019\u2019Wong attended Junior High School 185 in Flushing, not far from Deng\u2019s childhood home. \u2018\u2018The Asian kids hung out with each other,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018The cliques went by race and extracurricular activities \u2014 sports, clubs, whatever. As the years went by, I noticed it was harder for kids to branch out and talk to people outside their race.\u2019\u2019 He continued in a careful, almost scholarly way: \u2018\u2018I know New York is supposed to be this melting pot, but if you\u2019re from Queens, it\u2019s more like a bubble. The people you meet are pretty similar to yourself.\u2019\u2019In the spring of his freshman year at Baruch, Wong was approached by a \u2018\u2018neophyte\u2019\u2019 (the word for a newly anointed brother) in Pi Delta Psi. Given Baruch\u2019s commuter-\u00adstudent culture, where most students socialized with their friends from city high schools, Pi Delta Psi\u2019s recruitment strategy was to approach all eligible males, even some non-\u00adAsians, and ask them to join. Wong went to a meeting, got along with a few of the guys there and decided to give the fraternity a shot.Until he pledged Pi Delta Psi, Wong said, he did not know how badly his people had suffered. He did not know about the death of Vincent Chin. He did not know about Korematsu v. United States, the 1944 Supreme Court case that upheld Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s executive order to send Japanese-\u00adAmericans to internment camps. As he immersed himself in Pi Delta Psi\u2019s misshapen yet still revelatory history of Asian-\u00adAmerican oppression, he grew increasingly frustrated with the gaps in his New York City public-\u00adschool education. Wong said the omissions were unfair. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t understand why we wouldn\u2019t focus on a certain ethnic group or why we would ignore it,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018Sometimes, it felt like things that happened to Asians were less important.\u2019\u2019The new education changed him; the silence that separates so many immigrant children from their parents began to close. For the first time in his life, Wong talked to his mother about her early days in the United States, the fear she had felt in a country where she did not speak the language, the small yet persistent flare-\u00adups in which she could feel both her invisibility and her irrelevance in a country dominated by whites. He said he never felt closer to his mother than in those early days of his awakening. \u2018\u2018You know how it is with Asian parents,\u2019\u2019 Wong said. \u2018\u2018If you don\u2019t ask them about their lives, you won\u2019t find out.\u2019\u2019 He started to feel as if he were part of something. Wong was offered a \u2018\u2018bid\u2019\u2019 and began Pi Delta Psi\u2019s pledging process, where he learned more about the oppression of Asian-\u00adAmericans, the same lessons he would teach Michael Deng a couple of years later.Kimberly A. Metzger, an assistant district attorney, sat at the table reserved for the state. She leaned back in her chair, staring out at the gathering gallery. The families squirmed, and their narrow, wooden seats creaked, but there were none of the consoling or furtive glances among the defendants that there had been on earlier court dates. They did not look at one another as Metzger briefly summarized the roles they had played in Michael Deng\u2019s death \u2014 the tackles, the text messages, the delays in seeking medical help, the scramble to dispose evidence that would tie them to Pi Delta Psi. When the judge asked if they were aware of what their pleas meant, they said \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 in meek unison.The Pi Delta Psi brothers pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension. (About 30 members of Pi Delta Psi, including Andy Meng and Revel Deng, are still facing lesser charges connected to Michael Deng\u2019s death. The fraternity itself has also been charged with third-\u00addegree murder and other crimes. And the Dengs have filed a civil suit against the defendants.) Lai, Wong, Lam and Kwan will not be sentenced until the end of this year. According to Pennsylvania guidelines, the recommended sentence for these charges for a defendant with no criminal record is 22 to 33 months.Asians are the loneliest Americans. The collective political consciousness of the \u201980s has been replaced by the quiet, unaddressed isolation that comes with knowing that you can be born in this country, excel in its schools and find a comfortable place in its economy and still feel no stake in the national conversation. The current vision of solidarity among Asian-\u00adAmericans is cartoonish and blurry and relegated to conversations at family picnics, in drunken exchanges over food that reminds everyone at the table of how their mom used to make it. Everything else is the confusion of never knowing what side to choose because choosing our own side has so rarely been an option. Asian pride is a laughable concept to most Americans. Racist incidents pass without prompting any real outcry, and claims of racism are quickly dismissed. A common past can be accessed only through dusty, dug-up things: the murder of Vincent Chin, Korematsu v. United States, the Bataan Death March and the illusion that we are going through all these things together. The Asian-\u00adAmerican fraternity is not much more than a clumsy step toward finding an identity in a country where there are no more reference points for how we should act, how we should think about ourselves. But in its honest confrontation with being Asian and its refusal to fall into familiar silence, it can also be seen as a statement of self-\u00adworth. These young men, in their doomed way, were trying to amend the American dream that had brought their parents to this country with one caveat:I will succeed, they say. But not without my brothers!Michael\u2019s mother took me upstairs to what had been his part of the house: a bedroom with the blinds drawn and a study room with an ornate dark wooden desk that looked as though it had been salvaged from a TV lawyer\u2019s office. She said she hadn\u2019t touched the rooms since Michael left for Baruch. SAT prep books and a handful of composition notebooks lined the bookshelves in which Michael, in neat, rounded handwriting that slanted a bit to the left, had written out his thoughts on the Ace style of handball, breakdowns of New York City\u2019s Specialized High Schools and his observations about the world around him. In October 2008, when he was in eighth grade, he wrote, \u2018\u2018Wearing a winter coat, going to Alley Pond Park, getting under a tree (to hide from the snow) and watch the snow fall down to the trees and ground is my favorite way to pass time in winter.\u2019\u2019His mother told me about the night she spent at the hospital in the Poconos. Her son was already past saving, but she decided to keep him breathing so that his father would have time to arrive from China. That night, she stayed by Michael\u2019s bedside and stuck acupuncture needles in his arm in a desperate attempt to save her son. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t believe that this could happen to such a big healthy, happy boy,\u2019\u2019 she told me. \u2018\u2018I learned acupuncture back in China, and I thought maybe it will help his comeback. The doctors knew he was already gone, so they let me do it, because they wanted me to have that moment of hope that I could bring him back.\u2019\u2019An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a university. It is University at Buffalo, which is part of the State University of New York system; it is not University of Buffalo.An article on Aug. 13 about a fraternity hazing death misstated the name and location of a public school in New York City. It is Junior High School 185 in Flushing, Queens; there is no Middle School 185 in Bayside.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Americans Who Saved Health Insurance", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany Americans look back on the heroic political fights of the past \u2014 for suffrage, Social Security, civil rights, Medicare \u2014 and wonder why today\u2019s politics never produce inspiring victories.

Birth defects, cancer, diabetes and other conditions would have gone untreated.And it came depressingly close to happening.

They are the people who have helped save decent medical care for their fellow citizens. They are an antidote to cynicism in this often cynical time.Jessi Bohon was able to join Indivisible because of a group of millennials who reacted to Trump\u2019s election not with despair or blame games but by trying to make a difference.I\u2019ve never seen a major political fight inspire such an expert consensus, across the ideological spectrum.The bills had virtually no independent defenders. This intellectual honesty \u2014 the avoidance of false balance \u2014 helped the public understand that this wasn\u2019t a classic partisan fight with each side making some good points. It was a case of cynical politicians willing to hurt their constituents in order to keep a misguided campaign promise.At least nine Republican senators expressed grave doubts about the bills. But only two voted no consistently: Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.John McCain is also deeply conservative. Yet, like Roberts, he realized that taking health coverage from millions, in a hasty, secretive process, could damage his favorite institution \u2014 the Senate.When his colleagues didn\u2019t heed his warning to abandon that approach, McCain flipped his vote. \u201cNo,\u201d he announced at 1:30 a.m. on Friday, shocking Democrats who had given up on him and Republicans who had assumed he wouldn\u2019t really break ranks on principle.I know it\u2019s unfashionable to praise a political party, and I have plenty of complaints about the Democrats. But the fact is, many Americans would soon lack health insurance were it not for the unity of elected Democrats.\u2022Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Superfans Unite: A New Breed Reimagines Criticism for a Digital Age", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A few Sundays ago, as millions of people were sitting down to watch the season premiere of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d those gathered at a small house party in the Van Nuys neighborhood here were still figuring out dinner.The host, Filup Molina, didn\u2019t have the right pizza delivery app installed on his iPhone, so he paused DirecTV\u2019s East Coast live feed to sort it out. \u201cHow many pizzas do we want?\u201d he asked. \u201cTwo? Three?\u201d A half-hour into the much-anticipated episode the doorbell rang, so he stopped the show again when the Domino\u2019s delivery guy arrived with three pies. All the while the armchair analysis continued apace.\u201cDo they literally bring winter with them?\u201d Mr. Molina asked about the White Walkers, referring to the zombielike army of the dead descending on a mostly oblivious human population in the south.His longtime friend Erik Voss nodded as he finished a mouthful of pizza. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about this idea that winter doesn\u2019t bring White Walkers \u2014 that White Walkers bring winter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be that winter didn\u2019t exist in this world until the White Walkers were created.\u201dThis is how America watches live TV in 2017 \u2014 starting late, pausing to grab food, debating the finer points of a show\u2019s mythology. But for Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss, this is more than an enjoyable pastime; it\u2019s a living.They are superfans \u2014 sophisticated ones \u2014 using visual aids to break down shows and movies for superfans. And their handiwork makes the audience for these pop-culture spectacles even bigger and more engaged.\u201cWe are in a world where the cacophony of coverage, whether it\u2019s Vanity Fair or New Rockstars, drives the cultural zeitgeist around the show,\u201d said Sabrina Caluori, HBO\u2019s senior vice president for digital media and marketing. \u201cThat breeds the FOMO \u2014 the Fear of Missing Out \u2014 that\u2019s driving continued growth of the show this season.\u201dThe morning after the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere, Mr. Molina, 32, and Mr. Voss, 29, started work early at their one-room studio, which is across the street from Universal Studios. Mr. Molina had watched the episode twice, made extensive notes and built the motion graphics for \u201cWesteros Weekly,\u201d a new show that New Rockstars is producing during this season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Mr. Voss was in another corner rewatching clips from the premiere and writing a script for an hourlong episode breakdown that he and Mr. Molina would begin taping the next day.The two men both have comedy backgrounds, and both are working on their own film and TV scripts even as they\u2019re becoming known online as film and TV personalities. New Rockstars, though, will be their full-time gig for the foreseeable future.\u201cThe moment we saw the response to that \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 video, we decided to reduce all the coverage on all the YouTubers,\u201d said Jeben Berg, a former Google executive and a partner in Zealot Networks, which owns New Rockstars. \u201cPeople wanted to see heightened, sensible, intelligent speculation on what was happening on big Hollywood film properties.\u201d(Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss have focused nearly all of their attention on the YouTube channel, which has about a million subscribers and is supported by advertising and sponsors, though this fall New Rockstars will begin making content for Facebook. So far the company has not delved into podcasts, Instagram or Snapchat as some other sites do.)There\u2019s a D.I.Y. spirit and modest scale to the New Rockstars operation. When Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss taped their breakdown video on Monday night, they were the only two people in the studio. They watched themselves on a monitor and advanced their teleprompter with an iPhone. No one yelled \u201ccut\u201d; they just kept recording.The next morning, as Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss were preparing to finish the video, an editor discovered that Mr. Voss\u2019s microphone had failed during the taping the night before. They didn\u2019t have time to rerecord, so they trudged ahead. That afternoon, Mr. Molina used an audio app to isolate and tweak Mr. Voss\u2019s vocal track from what his own microphone had captured.\u201cYou could replace everything in that studio with $5,000 and an Amazon Prime account,\u201d Mr. Molina said, \u201cand it would all be here in two days.\u201dNew Rockstars has only been in a studio since May; before that, Mr. Molina\u2019s apartment or whatever space they could find sufficed. But the smarts of their analysis, and the engaging presence the two men have on camera, more than make up for the bare-bones production.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Says Waymo Can Tell Jurors That Uber Withheld Evidence", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a strongly worded ruling on Thursday, a federal judge presiding over an intellectual property fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit spun out of Google, said jurors in a coming trial may be told that Uber has been withholding key evidence.The trial, in United States District Court in San Francisco, is not expected to start until October, but Judge William Alsup did little to hide his frustration with the resistance or inability of Uber and its lawyers to hand over evidence in a pretrial discovery process, according to a hearing transcript provided by the court.\u201cYou misled the judge time and time again,\u201d Judge Alsup told Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez, Uber\u2019s outside counsel from the law firm Morrison & Foerster.The trial is one of the most important courtroom fights for the tech industry in years, and its outcome could affect the future of driverless car technology.Uber has repeatedly missed deadlines to hand over material, irking Judge Alsup and Waymo\u2019s lawyers.\u201cSince the start of this case, Uber and its attorneys and agents have refused to produce key evidence, continued to harbor Waymo\u2019s stolen files, and obstructed discovery at every turn,\u201d Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe welcome Alsup\u2019s decision to allow Waymo to propose instructions to the jury regarding Uber\u2019s misconduct and we look forward to trial.\u201dIn court on Wednesday before the ruling, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez blamed a mistake made by his law firm, Morrison & Foerster, for his failing to present a series of files downloaded by Mr. Levandowski during the discovery process. He said the firm intended to hand over the material.Uber contends that it has turned over files in the case. \u201cWhile Waymo has obtained over 238,000 pages of production documents from Uber and conducted a dozen inspections over 61 hours of our facilities, source code, documents, and engineers\u2019 computers, there\u2019s still no evidence that any files have come to Uber, let alone that they\u2019re being used,\u201d said Chelsea Kohler, a spokeswoman for Uber.Judge Alsup\u2019s rebuke is another hit to Uber\u2019s reputation. The privately held company, valued at $70 billion, is in the middle of a boardroom battle between its largest shareholders and is still searching for a new chief executive after the ouster of Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.In early 2016, Mr. Levandowski left Google to form his own start-up, Otto, which focused on building a self-driving long-haul trucking business. Months later, Uber agreed to purchase Otto, and its team of autonomous vehicle engineers, for nearly $700 million.Waymo claims the creation of Otto was a setup created by Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Kalanick to pave the way for the eventual sale to Uber. Uber maintains Waymo\u2019s claims are meritless.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Weekend Can Span Centuries at Tanglewood", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookJuanjo Mena leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Julian Anderson\u2019s \u201cIncantesimi\u201d at Tanglewood.\u201cThe Fairy Queen\u201d skirts the principal action of \u201cMidsummer,\u201d throwing minor characters into relief, so a narration is useful, and the actress Antonia Christophers, Mr. Christophers\u2019s daughter, made a fine, sassy job of it. Two soprano soloists, Sarah Brailey and Sonja DuToit Tengblad stood out in a raft of rapidly shifting characterizations, as did the countertenor Robin Blaze. Matthew Brook, a bass-baritone, was especially entertaining as the Drunken Poet, tippling lustily into his first entry.A listener\u2019s head spun a few hundred years forward the next day, as the Tanglewood Music Center\u2019s annual Festival of Contemporary Music began in Ozawa Hall. That event \u2014 typically directed of late by one or two composers (and awaiting another, Thomas Ad\u00e8s, next season) \u2014 has veered wildly from year to year.It was at its most concentrated in 2008, when it was devoted entirely to music of Elliott Carter, in celebration of his 100th birthday. Last year it was programmed by Steven Stucky, who died months before the actual festival, and this year it was at its most democratic, programmed (curated, in the festival\u2019s term) by three alumni of the Tanglewood Music Center: Jacob Greenberg, a pianist; Kathryn Bates, a cellist; and Nadia Sirota, a violist.Mr. Greenberg\u2019s program, which opened the festival, offered two works commissioned for the occasion, both with heady intellectual conceits but relatively little to move the soul. Nathan Davis\u2019s \u201cThe Sand Reckoner,\u201d a meditation on vast quantities and multitudes for six voices and celesta, supplemented a basic declamation of a text by Archimedes with words of the Wycliffe Bible, William Blake and a French children\u2019s counting song. Anthony Cheung\u2019s \u201cAll thorn, but cousin to your rose\u201d set \u201cThe Art of Translation\u201d by Vladimir Nabokov and tried to show how experiments with Google\u2019s translation program could devolve into a game of telephone. Both brainy and clever, but no cigar.Ms. Bates\u2019s concert, on Friday, was generally more involving. The commissioned work was Kui Dong\u2019s \u201cA Night at Tanglewood,\u201d a work for string quartet with the players doubling on an array of water glasses and bowls. Real depth came mainly at the end of the program, in the String Quartet No. 4 (\u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d 1973) by the veteran Ben Johnston, using an exotic tuning.But Ms. Sirota\u2019s program, on Sunday, was the most emotionally compelling of the three. It began with David Lang\u2019s stunningly simple and lovely \u201cjust\u201d (2014), a setting drawn from the Song of Songs, in a beautiful performance by three singers, Mary Bonhag, Fotina Naumenko and Jazimina MacNeil, and ended with Mr. Dennehy\u2019s \u201cSurface Tension.\u201d Again there was a newly commissioned work, \u201cClip\u201d by Nico Muhly, but even at a mere 10 minutes or so, it eventually wore out its welcome.The Boston Symphony concert on Saturday evening opened with Julian Anderson\u2019s \u201cIncantesimi\u201d (2016), just after a festival prelude concert had offered his ensemble work \u201cVan Gogh Blue\u201d (2015). Both showed a sure compositional hand but involved relocating players to puzzlingly little effect. Caroline Shaw\u2019s string quartet \u201cBlueprint\u201d (2016) probed deeply in the prelude concert, but then, in a quick pizzicato exit, seemed to suggest that it had all been something of a joke.Another concert packed in on Saturday afternoon at Ozawa Hall featured Ken-David Masur conducting the Young Artists Orchestra of the Boston University Tanglewood Institute. The reading of Lutoslawski\u2019s difficult and underperformed Concerto for Orchestra was especially notable, with Mr. Masur showing complete command and the students playing at a near-professional level.Alas, decamping early on Sunday, I had to miss the Boston Symphony concert that afternoon and the final contemporary program, on Monday. But I couldn\u2019t have absorbed much more scintillation just then anyway.A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the Shakespeare play on which Purcell\u2019s \u201cThe Fairy Queen\u201d is based.

{"Headline": "Teaching Kids Coding, by the Book", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsOne sunny summer morning this month, a group of 20 teenage girls gathered in a conference room in the sleek offices of a tech company in Manhattan. It was their fifth week of coding camp, and they were huddled around laptops, brainstorming designs for their final projects. One group was building a computer game that simulates the experience of going through life with depression and anxiety, while others were drafting plans for websites that track diversity at companies and help connect newly arrived immigrants with local community groups.They were working intently when Reshma Saujani, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit organization Girls Who Code, dropped in to offer some encouragement.\u201cHow many of you take computer science class at your schools?\u201d she asked. Hands shot up. \u201cAre you the only girls in your class?\u201d she asked. Most of the girls nodded.Over the past five years, some 40,000 girls have learned to code through the organization\u2019s summer camps and afterschool programs. But Ms. Saujani wanted to expand the group\u2019s reach, and was looking for new ways to recruit girls into the tech industry.For a tech evangelist, her solution was surprisingly retro and analog: books. Girls Who Code is creating a publishing franchise, and plans to release 13 books over the next two years through a multibook deal with Penguin. The titles range from board books and picture books for babies and elementary school children, to nonfiction coding manuals, activity books and journals, and a series of novels featuring girl coders.This week, the organization is releasing its first two books \u2014 an illustrated nonfiction coding manual by Ms. Saujani, and a novel, \u201cThe Friendship Code,\u201d which features a group of girls who become friends in an after-school coding club.\u201cI wanted to create a series of books that girls could see themselves in, where you could sneak in the algorithms and you sneak in the coding,\u201d Ms. Saujani said.Lately, the niche has gotten considerably more crowded. A growing number of children\u2019s books authors are using fiction to teach the fundamentals of coding, a trend that has coincided with a push by Silicon Valley to fund and expand technology training in schools. The organization Code.org provides free online coding lessons, and has crafted coding curriculums for elementary, middle and high school students. Last year, Apple released a free app to teach the programming language Swift. Scratch Jr, a coding program designed for 4- to 7-year-olds, now has some five million users.Ms. Saujani\u2019s effort to counter the industry\u2019s gender imbalance, with coding clubs and now books, seems to have won over some major tech industry figures. Her new coding book features glowing endorsements from the philanthropist Melinda Gates; Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter; and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.The daughter of two engineers who came to the United States as political refugees from Uganda, Ms. Saujani is in some ways an unlikely advocate for computer literacy. Her academic and professional background is in law, history and politics, not technology. Before founding her coding organization, she worked as a lawyer for a hedge fund and ran for Congress in 2010. She lost, spectacularly, and decided to start a nonprofit to teach computer literacy to girls.Since its founding in 2012, the organization\u2019s coding clubs have rapidly spread across the country and now meet in 50 states. But demand has outstripped growth: 7,000 girls applied for 1,600 seats at the group\u2019s 80 summer camps.So in early 2015, to extend the group\u2019s reach, Ms. Saujani, who published a book for adults about women and leadership in 2013, went to her literary agent and proposed a series of children\u2019s books about coding. At the time, it seemed like an untapped market. Ms. Saujani met with several publishers, and was excited by Penguin\u2019s strategy of flooding every corner of the children\u2019s market, with board books like \u201cBaby Code!\u201d for 3- to 7-year-olds and novels for preteenage girls.Some tech experts say books could prove an effective way to recruit future coders, particularly girls, if the stories make programming seem creative and appealing. But others caution that books aren\u2019t a substitute for hand-on instruction. Josh Funk, a software engineer and the author of the picture book \u201cHow to Code a Sandcastle,\u201d which will be published next year as part of the Girls Who Code line, sees books as a way to get kids interested in the subject, not as a stand-in for coding classes. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn how to code by reading a picture book,\u201d he concedes.Some of the coding books for kids probably work better as gag gifts than as a training manual for mini Mark Zuckerbergs. John Vanden-Heuvel has created a lucrative subgenre in picture books with his series of coding books for babies, with titles like \u201cHTML for Babies,\u201d \u201cJavaScript for Babies,\u201d and \u201cCSS for Babies.\u201d Mr. Vanden-Heuvel, who created and self-published the books after his son was born sold some 100,000 copies on his own, then got a publishing deal with Sterling Children\u2019s. He later moved on to writing coding books for older kids, like \u201cC++ for Kids,\u201d which is aimed at 3- to 5-year-olds.Other authors are weaving coding concepts into the narratives of novels. In September, Disney Hyperion will publish Tamara Ireland Stone\u2019s middle grade novel, \u201cClick\u2019d,\u201d about a girl named Allie who builds an app that goes viral at her CodeGirls summer camp, then realizes a glitch could expose users\u2019 private data. (At the end of the book, Ms. Ireland includes exercises that explain how binary code and algorithms work.)\u201cI wanted to play with the similarities between magic and coding,\u201d said Mr. Yang, who taught computer programming at a high school in Oakland, Calif., for 17 years.Stacia Deutsch, who wrote \u201cThe Friendship Code\u201d series, had no background in coding when Penguin hired her to co-write the books in consultation with Ms. Saujani. So she went to afterschool coding workshops at schools around Orange County, Calif., where she lives, and studied the organization\u2019s teaching manual. Using their curriculum, she focused on a handful of programming concepts and integrated them into the plot.The novel centers on Lucy, who joins an after-school coding club and starts getting mysterious notes on her locker. To understand the messages, she has to master coding concepts like input/output, loops and variables.Ms. Deutsch struggled at times to get those ideas across.

{"Headline": "Police Brace for More White Nationalist Rallies, but Have Few Options", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter events in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend showed how much violence white nationalist rallies could provoke, police chiefs from Richmond, Va., to Boston were taking steps to avoid a repeat of a situation in which the police appeared to have little control of the crowd.Texas A&M University canceled a \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d rally at which Richard Spencer, a white supremacist leader, was to appear, citing safety concerns. Officials in Mountain View, Calif., where Google has its headquarters, were gearing up for one of several marches at the company\u2019s offices around the country to protest the firing of a male employee who wrote a memo criticized as sexist.But to deal with these new circumstances, the police have few new tactics.\u201cCharlottesville turned into a riot,\u201d said Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston, where a free speech rally was thought to be planned for Saturday, although some of the details were murky. \u201cBoth sides were able to connect. In our city, we will do everything we can that those two sides never connect.\u201dMayor Walsh said that Boston wanted to discourage the rally\u2019s organizers from coming, and that William B. Evans, the police commissioner, was developing a plan to keep the rally and any counterdemonstrations separate. By late Monday, it appeared that some of the billed speakers were backing out.But if there is a rally, unlike the authorities in Charlottesville, officials in Boston will probably not be forced to confront a large number of armed protesters because Massachusetts allows only those with a gun license to openly carry a firearm. In Virginia, no license is required for those over 18.In South Carolina, where there were dozens of protests related to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from government buildings, firearms are prohibited from the State Capitol grounds. Leroy Smith, the state director of public safety, said that intense anger over such issues combined with the presence of firearms would have been a toxic mix.\u201cWith the added element of open carry, it creates more of a challenge for law enforcement officers because usually when you see a weapon and that person is not a law enforcement officer, you know you need to defuse the situation,\u201d he said.Many urban police chiefs have opposed open-carry laws, even in states where people feel fiercely protective of their gun rights.John Eterno, a former training instructor with the New York Police Department who now teaches at Molloy College, said the presence of weapons combined with the unexpectedly large crowds in Charlottesville might have thrown off that city\u2019s planning. When people have the right to carry firearms, the police must balance caution with respect, he said. Officers can do little more than check the person\u2019s demeanor for signs of aggression and monitor whether the firearm is properly holstered.On Monday, officials defended their response, noting the lack of property damage in the city, and the Virginia governor said little could have been done to prevent a driver from hitting pedestrians.At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Al Thomas, the Charlottesville police chief, acknowledged that there were times when police officers were spread too thinly. \u201cWe had to actually send out forces to multiple locations to deal with a number of disturbances,\u201d Chief Thomas said. He added: \u201cIt was certainly a challenge. We were spread thin once the groups dispersed.\u201dBut he also noted a central problem with the strategy of keeping opponents away from each other: The police cannot always control who is going to go where. \u201cWe did make attempts to keep the two sides separate. However, we cannot control which side someone enters the park,\u201d Chief Thomas said.He said that there had been a plan to keep the Unite the Right rally separate from counterprotesters, but that few cooperated.Virginia\u2019s governor, Terry McAuliffe, cited a police estimate that 80 percent of the protesters and counterprotesters were armed, and that the militias, who described themselves as neutral peacekeepers, had arsenals superior to that of the police. But Chief Thomas denied that his officers were \u201cintimidated by the firepower of the alt-right.\u201dOfficers began the day in regular uniform. \u201cOnce the violence erupted, once the plan was altered, we had to quickly transition our officers into their protective gear,\u201d Chief Thomas said.Charlottesville had known that it would be ill prepared. The city, fearing that many more than the estimated 400 people would attend, said it would issue the permit only if the location were moved.\u201cBecause Emancipation Park is a relatively confined space of just over one acre in a densely populated urban area with limited parking space, it is unable to accommodate safely even a peaceful crowd of this size,\u201d the city manager, Maurice Jones, warned rally organizers in a letter on Aug. 7.\u201cThe city\u2019s law enforcement, fire and emergency medical personnel cannot adequately protect people in and around Emancipation Park due to the number of anticipated attendees trying to occupy such a small and confined space.\u201dThe city wanted to move the protest to another park, but the American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued in federal court on behalf of Jason Kessler, the organizer of the event, that the city was retaliating against him because of the \u201ccontent\u201d of his speech, citing the fact that none of the counterprotesters\u2019 permits were revoked. Thousands attended.The leaders of the Unite the Right rally have pledged to return to Charlottesville.This weekend, the mayor of Lexington, Ky., announced plans to try to take down two Confederate statues.The chief of police in Lexington said he had already spoken with officials in Charlottesville for details on what worked and what had not.\u201cYou\u2019ll have people feeling passionate wanting to come in, but you\u2019ll also have professional protesters who want to come in and fight. We\u2019ll be prepared for them also,\u201d said the chief, Mark Barnard.But, he added, \u201cYou can have as much intelligence about the groups and their past behavior, you can have all planning and all the training, but you can\u2019t predict what will go on.\u201d Kentucky is an open-carry state.He said he doubted the city would give permits to groups with opposing views to speak from the same location at the same time.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t allow that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to make a decision and have it at a different time.

An abundance of digital tools makes the clock seem like it\u2019s ticking faster as we gain efficiency. Meanwhile, video conferences and real-time messaging collapse the distance between far-flung colleagues and customers. And knowledge \u2014 arguably the most important asset of an organization \u2014 is now right at our fingertips, not stashed away in file cabinets.But what technology giveth, technology can taketh away. Time, space and knowledge move in the opposite direction when you\u2019re juggling logins, forgetting passwords and getting locked out of all those marvelous apps. Same goes for running a report that incorporates stats from multiple databases and then sharing it via email before holding a presentation \u2014 that only happens after scheduling and rescheduling through yet another app. But the messaging platform Slack has helped wrangle all these disparate channels into one place. Slack is not just a home for chats \u2014 it\u2019s become an indispensable portal for connected apps, workflows and processes. Here\u2019s how Slack is reshaping the day for office workers around the world and helping bend time, space and knowledge for the better.Sometimes the most time-consuming tasks are the toughest to automate because they involve many small decisions, each requiring a little bit of judgment \u2014 for example, setting up a meeting. Finally found the perfect slot after negotiating different time zones and shifting online calendars? Try again \u2014 one VIP now has a conflict! Time is our most valuable asset, so cutting down the hours a typical office worker spends scheduling meetings is imperative.Jill\u2019s workdays were mired with the drudgery of scheduling and paperwork......instead of seeking and meeting potential hires.Now she\u2019s back to spending most of her days doing her real work \u2014 finding talent.Time isn\u2019t the only thing bent by modern office technology. Consider space, or distance. It\u2019s often easier to work from home or do business from wherever you happen to be, whether it\u2019s a remote office or, better yet, a remote beach. The distance between your company and its employees, business partners and customers can shrink \u2014 or grow \u2014 based on the apps you use and how you\u2019re using them.Nancy oversees a sprawling call center that connects her company\u2019s customers around the world with the people who can fix their issues. The problem is that those workers are also scattered. Trouble tickets by the hundreds are logged in each day \u2014 it\u2019s Nancy\u2019s job to make sure not only that the call center is staffed but that trends are identified and escalated to the right people.Here\u2019s Nancy in crisis mode at her company call center.Using Slack\u2019s integrated customer-service apps, she can monitor every stage of a trouble ticket from a single screen......and with the help of her colleagues around the globe, disaster is averted!Knowledge is a company\u2019s most important asset, and networks like the internet have made all sorts of information accessible. That is, if you can find what you need fast enough: You may know the right database, but you\u2019re not sure how to navigate its arcane menus.Slowed down by piles of data from various sources, Drew used to spend ages creating a report for his boss.But then he discovered a bot that consolidates key bits of information in Slack to make them searchable for future reference.Now, Slack can process his data and present it in a single location......and Drew\u2019s boss is thinking about giving him a promotion.Today, comprehensive communication platforms like Slack have become vital to focus on the jobs we were hired to do. Office software is meant to help us, but it can be overwhelming \u2014 the average enterprise now uses more than 1,000 apps to manage everything from entire departments to birthday celebrations.

A high-wage worker is buying more goods. A high-wage worker is less dependent on the public health system.How do you assess Eric Garcetti\u2019s tenure as mayor of Los Angeles?Oh, I\u2019m not running against Garcetti.You\u2019re the former mayor, you must ... I take a page out of Bush\u2019s playbook, where he didn\u2019t comment about Obama, and Obama doesn\u2019t comment for the most part about Trump \u2014 you would think he\u2019d comment a lot more given what Trump does \u2014 but you know Garcetti is a very popular mayor in this town.

{"Headline": "In the Land of Internet Subcultures, Try Not to Look Like a Tourist", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCovering any large subculture \u2014 particularly one with an explicit ideological component \u2014 is a surefire way to garner a passionate response. So is attempting to place it in a taxonomy, or to identify a precedent for what it does \u2014 in this case, conservative talk radio, whose power has been perilously underestimated for three decades. I received messages objecting to the article\u2019s political descriptions, which wasn\u2019t a surprise: Many such YouTubers self-identify with more granularity, as classical liberals or libertarians, as \u201cidentitarians,\u201d or as mere contrarians. There were people urging me not to give extreme politics a platform as others claimed these ideas were anything but.But reactions to the piece crystallized something else about the state of the media \u2014 all media \u2014 today. The most useful way to understand the disparity in responses inspired by the piece isn\u2019t to understand audiences as living on different parts of an ideological spectrum, or on a continuum of tech-savviness. Rather, I learned to understand where they were coming from in a much more literal sense. Media consumers\u2019 internet of 2017 is divided up among enormous, distinct and powerful platforms \u2014 Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. And their experience of the broader media universe is informed by the contexts in which they spend the most time, or to which they feel allegiance.Those immersed in this subculture were, of course, skeptical and defensive, critical of what felt to them like a glancing take on their hometown, dismissing it as condescending or antagonistic. Other active YouTube users begged me to understand that the YouTube Right is not representative of their platform, and reasonably suggested that I had overstated their importance. A few more responded: \u201cWho?\u201dReaders from Twitter, where the YouTube Right maintains a visible secondary presence, were more receptive to the story\u2019s premises. To politically engaged Twitter users, the YouTube Right represents a powerful but remote, somewhat mysterious force. The story\u2019s subjects were more familiar to a typical Reddit user than to, for example, the average Facebook user. They\u2019re well-known objects of mockery on Tumblr, and something like mainstream figures on a site like 4chan.One user\u2019s home platform is another\u2019s foreign land. A point made by a subculture at home on Facebook might look funny to another on Twitter, which can read as evidence of a conspiracy to yet another on YouTube, which might be seen as offensive on Tumblr, which could be a joke on Reddit. One\u2019s sense of these things \u2014 whether a meme is funny, whether an argument is persuasive, whether a statement amounts to a threat \u2014 is informed not just by what the subculture stands for, but by which platform you use to make sense of the vast internet around you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap Stumbles Through Another Disappointing Quarter", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe technology world is scrutinizing Snap as an indicator of whether smaller social media companies can compete with behemoths like Facebook. And Wall Street is using Snap to gauge whether investors will embrace other unprofitable tech companies if they go public.Snap will soon face a make-or-break year, said Norm Johnston, the chief strategy officer at Mindshare, a global media agency. \u201cEither it will realize its full potential by delivering growth in daily users, or it will end up as the next Twitter,\u201d the social media service that has been grappling with stalled growth, he said.On Thursday, Snap did little to change its trajectory when it reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street projections. The company reported a loss of 36 cents a share, versus estimates of a 33-cent loss. Revenue rose to $181.7 million, versus expectations for $185.8 million. The company recorded a wider quarterly loss than a year ago of $443.1 million, up from $115.9 million.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with our advertisers to improve our offerings and become a more integral part of their strategy,\u201d said Imran Khan, the chief strategy officer at Snap. He said that existing customers were also spending more money with the company.For Snap, there have long been signs that it would face bumps as a public company. Before its I.P.O., the company said it was losing money and made no guarantee that those losses would subside. Snap also said that its user growth rate was slowing and that it did not have a firm international expansion plan.\u201cSnap was massively overvalued because, as a private company, it could set a valuation based on the opportunity for growth,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group.Mr. Spiegel said during a call with analysts that neither he nor Mr. Murphy would sell their stock this year. \u201cWe believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.For a few months, Snap\u2019s stock stayed above its I.P.O. price. But investor doubts began to set in as Snap\u2019s user growth continued to slow, especially as rivals like Instagram began copying innovative features that once set Snapchat apart, including augmented reality images and disappearing content.More alarmingly, concern over Snap\u2019s advertising business started to rise. Some brands are beginning to question whether Snapchat is a niche product, like Twitter, or an essential piece of their digital marketing strategy, like Facebook or Google, said several advertising buyers.Last month, Morgan Stanley, which helped underwrite Snap\u2019s I.P.O., issued a report on the company that questioned the measurement tools that Snap makes for advertisers. These tools are regarded as subpar compared with the ones offered by Facebook, which is important because the tools help brands determine whether an ad was effective.Snap has introduced new tools for advertisers this year to make it easier to buy and manage ads on Snapchat. It also teamed with companies that can help measure and predict the effectiveness of specific marketing tactics on Snapchat. Snap now measures whether customers shop in stores after they see ads and in June, it confirmed it acquired a start-up called Placed that tracks retail foot traffic.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the early performance of our self-service platform, which makes it easy for advertisers of all sizes to reach our unique audience,\u201d said Mr. Khan. On a call with analysts, he said that 60 percent of all Snap ad impressions were now delivered through those tools.Mr. Spiegel has long maintained that the amount of time that users spend in Snapchat makes it unique. The average user spends more than 30 minutes a day in the app. And in the most recent quarter, users under the age of 25, a demographic that advertisers covet, are spending more than 40 minutes a day in the app.He told analysts that it could become less costly to advertise on Snapchat, a platform that has been notoriously expensive. \u201cLower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said, and the change could get more advertisers to learn how to use Snap.Price has been one of several barriers that have made it hard for marketers to make a significant investment in Snapchat, said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re dropping prices,\u201d she said. \u201cNow marketers will need Snap to help them measure the performance of their ads.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Wall Street estimate for Snap\u2019s earnings.

{"Headline": "To Fit Into Silicon Valley, Wear These Wool Shoes", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFounded by a New Zealand soccer star and a clean-technology entrepreneur, Allbirds makes the sneakerlike shoes from wool and castor bean oil. Slightly fuzzy to the touch, Allbirds have minimal styling (tiny logos only) and come in two versions: a runner and a lounger. Both styles, for men and women, sell for $95. Next month, Allbirds is opening its first store in Manhattan.In true Silicon Valley fashion, Allbirds is a start-up. Is it venture funded? Of course it is. The company has raised $9.95 million over the last year to spread its vision. But this being start-up land, a shoe is never just a shoe.\u201cWe\u2019re about the distillation of solutions, the refinement and crafting of forms in a maniacal way,\u201d said Tim Brown, the Allbirds co-founder from New Zealand.And so, for now, this insular world has settled on Allbirds.At a gathering last month hosted by the venture capital firm August Capital on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., about 1,000 entrepreneurs and investors mingled on a concrete patio over margaritas and deviled eggs to celebrate summer. Guests wore other shoes \u2014 New Balance, Top-Siders, Tevas and a rare dress shoe were spotted \u2014 but the furry-looking Allbird was by far the most common.Serik Kaldykulov, the managing partner for Elefund, which finances early-stage start-ups, wore a pair as he waited to get into the party.\u201cEveryone\u2019s wearing them. Sometimes it is awkward, especially if we\u2019re wearing the same color \u2014 but then it\u2019s an icebreaker,\u201d said Mr. Kaldykulov, who owns four pairs in different colors.\u201cAnything with laces becomes less efficient,\u201d said John Kim, chief executive of SendBird, a start-up that helps software engineers build chat features within their apps. He sported a pair of light gray Allbirds.Mr. Kim said he wore Allbirds for \u201call reasons and purposes\u201d \u2014 except to a recent barbecue, for fear that sauce could seep in. Allbirds, which are machine washable, are meant to be worn without socks. (Some have complained about how quickly the shoes wear out, though Allbirds has said in a statement that the latest line is more durable than earlier iterations.)At Allbirds\u2019 office, in one of San Francisco\u2019s oldest buildings on a high-end shopping street downtown, he and Mr. Brown, both 36, told the story of how they became Silicon Valley\u2019s cobblers.In 2009, Mr. Brown, then vice captain of the New Zealand soccer team, was trying to figure out his next chapter. He liked design and, before attending business school, made simple leather shoes for his friends. But the shoes were uncomfortable.\u201cI didn\u2019t understand how it could be made,\u201d he said.Mr. Zwillinger, an engineer in biotechnology, was working in Silicon Valley and struggling to sell algae oil as a replacement for petroleum. (It was too expensive to catch on.) Their wives, who are best friends and former Dartmouth roommates, introduced the two men. Mr. Brown traveled to Northern California to meet Mr. Zwillinger and get advice on supply chains. Mr. Zwillinger cooked a lamb stew, and the two decided to form a business.\u201cOne of the worst offenders of the environment from a consumer product standpoint is shoes,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the making; it\u2019s the materials.\u201dAllbirds are made of a very fine merino wool, each strand 17.5 microns wide. \u201cWhich is 20 percent of the width of the average human hair,\u201d he said.The shoe\u2019s name comes from what explorers supposedly first said of New Zealand: \u201cIt\u2019s all birds.\u201d Also, Mr. Zwillinger is an avid birder.For a while, there was little tech interest. Then, in mid-2016, Mr. Zwillinger noticed tech leaders posting about the shoes on Snapchat and Twitter.\u201cAll of a sudden, men size 12 and 13 went out of stock,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said. \u201cOur demo went from mostly female to way male. A run started happening.\u201dToday, the two men have 50 employees in their San Francisco headquarters, 350 contractors in a factory in South Korea and 40 at a warehouse in Nashville. The Brooklyn-based Red Antler consultant firm worked with them on branding and design.The office is packed. The meeting room is up a ladder; there\u2019s a fros\u00e9 machine for frozen ros\u00e9. At 4 p.m. every day, the founders host an all-office push-up session called \u201c40 at 4.\u201dDave Morin, an investor at Slow Ventures, which put money into Allbirds, said the start-up was a place to invest \u201cin the material science and the dream.\u201d\u201cNo. 1, breakthrough material; two, you didn\u2019t need socks, that changes the idea of shoes; and No. 3, it was a single shoe,\u201d Mr. Morin said. \u201cI think of it as classic Apple simplicity strategy.\u201dOthers were more hesitant.\u201cI don\u2019t think Silicon Valley has ever set, is currently setting, or ever will set any fashion trends,\u201d said Mr. Costolo, the former Twitter chief executive who wears Allbirds.Mr. Brown and Mr. Zwillinger said they planned to release new colors of shoes (currently six are available, including pine and moss) and, eventually, shoes for children. A reporter saw a pair of flip-flops that appeared to be made of bamboo or very firmly packed leaves. \u201cMarket research,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said.\u201cIf you were going to design one sneaker and only one, what would it look like? We focused on this idea of a singular solution,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThe right amount of nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Alt-Right Finds a New Enemy in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftBut for the alt-right, the battle was just beginning.For alt-right activists, who occupy the rightmost flanks of a powerful conservative internet subculture, Google\u2019s response to Mr. Damore\u2019s memo was low-hanging fruit for mockery. But there is another reason that the alt-right\u2019s opposition campaign appeared so quickly, with such well-practiced maneuvers.For the last several months, far-right activists have mounted an aggressive political campaign against some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest players. Extending their attacks beyond social networks like Facebook and Twitter, tech\u2019s typical free-speech battlegrounds, they have accused a long list of companies, including Airbnb, PayPal and Patreon, of censoring right-wing views, and have pledged to expose Silicon Valley for what they say is a pervasive, industrywide liberal bias.Complaints like these might once have been easily dismissed. But in the Trump era, as the right wing\u2019s internet warriors have refined their tactics and gained legitimate political influence, they are putting Silicon Valley in an uncomfortable position.\u201cWe\u2019re just doing what the left has done for a while,\u201d Mr. Cernovich told me. \u201cYou use activist tactics to apply pressure to corporations, and the corporations respond.\u201dIt\u2019s a tech company\u2019s right, of course, to bar whomever it wishes. The First Amendment, often cited by right-wing activists as a bulwark against censorship, does not apply to the activities of companies, and tech companies almost always have terms in the fine print that give them the right to cut off access to users for any reason.But the latest wave of right-wing activism has still forced the hands of large Silicon Valley companies, many of which have tried to avoid the appearance of partisanship even as they promote progressive values.There is a certain poetic justice in the alt-right, largely an internet-based political movement, turning against the companies that enabled it in the first place. Like most modern political movements, the alt-right relies on tech platforms like YouTube and Twitter to rally supporters, collect donations and organize gatherings. In that sense, Silicon Valley progressivism isn\u2019t just an ideological offense to the alt-right \u2014 it\u2019s an operational threat.These companies are still tiny by Silicon Valley standards, but their supporters say that one day they could serve as the foundation for a kind of parallel right-wing internet where all speech is allowed, no matter how noxious or incendiary.It\u2019s unlikely that any alt-right protest will make a dent in the bottom lines of multibillion-dollar Silicon Valley behemoths. But by forcing these companies to take sides in an emerging culture war, these activists have already achieved a kind of perverse goal. They have found a new punching bag, and they have proved that in the hyper-polarized Trump era, there is no such thing as neutrality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dutch Utility Bets Its Future on an Unusual Strategy: Selling Less Power", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 When Eneco, a major Dutch utility, tested a promising energy monitor in several dozen homes, things could not have gone much worse. The company making the devices failed to deliver enough of them, and some of those provided did not work.But when Eneco sent workers to recover the monitors, something strange happened \u2014 a tenth of customers refused to open their doors. \u201cThey wanted to keep it,\u201d said Tako in \u2019t Veld, a former Eneco executive who now leads the \u201csmart energy\u201d unit at Quby, the company that makes the energy meter. \u201cThey were so happy with the energy insight.\u201d\u201cWe said \u2018we have to create an increasing customer loyalty by doing something different,\u2019\u201d said Hans Valk, chief executive of Quby and formerly the leader of Eneco\u2019s consumer business. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is switch from selling a pure commodity to selling energy as a service.\u201dFor instance, Eneco owns Jedlix, an electric vehicle charging unit, which has partnerships with Tesla and BMW and allows car owners to recharge their vehicles inexpensively when there are large supplies of renewable energy on the grid. Jedlix sometimes even pays them to do so.Eneco is also starting a business called CrowdNett which, unusually, pays customers for some of their power. Eneco looks for people who already have solar panels at home and tries to sell them a large home battery, like a Tesla Powerwall. Surplus power generated by the solar panels is stored in the battery and Eneco taps into a portion of that storage to help balance the electricity grid. Customers will receive 450 euros, or $530, a year for allowing use of their batteries.Eneco\u2019s leaders concede that they are proceeding more by trial and error than following a grand plan. Still, these efforts may, over time, aid the company\u2019s survival and contribute to creating ways to help consumers shift to cleaner energy.\u201cThey are very forward-looking in terms of strategy and mind-set,\u201d said Roberta Bigliani, a vice president at IDC, a market research firm. If Eneco\u2019s experiments flop, though, \u201cthey definitely will not be in operation in the future,\u201d she said.So far, the experiment with its wall-mounted energy monitor, known as Toon, has been among its more successful.When Eneco first considered the test, the utility was locked in a profit-zapping battle with competitors, cutting prices for electric power and natural gas while giving customers gifts for signing up. Seeing the danger signs, Eneco\u2019s management decided that a radical change was necessary.The Toon offered Eneco an opportunity to shift course and, despite early teething problems, Eneco expanded the rollout. The meters allow customers to control their domestic heating settings through a smartphone app, and they have displays that show electricity and natural gas consumption in detail, along with other information like weather forecasts.Much as telephone companies offer discounted devices with longer-term contracts, the Toon typically comes as part of a utility contract; Eneco customers pay \u20ac3.50 a month for the meter. In return, customers say it helps them save energy, offering the dual benefits of saving money and cutting the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change.Quby says it has placed more than 300,000 Toons in Dutch homes and has deals to supply the devices to other utilities, like Engie in Belgium and Viesgo in Spain.In his home north of Amsterdam, Marco Westenbrink has a Toon on his living room wall. \u201cIt is always there like it\u2019s my big brother, and it is always staring at me,\u201d the graphic designer said in an interview in his garden, overlooking a canal. \u201cYou can call it annoying, but it makes you completely aware.\u201dMr. Westenbrink, who lives with his wife in a cozy, century-old house in Krommenie, estimates that the Toon has helped them cut their annual energy bills by nearly a third, to about \u20ac2,000.His wife, Karin Krol, says the Toon is also helping their family battle climate change. \u201cWe believe that small things can change the environment,\u201d she said.Those who sign up for the Toon cut their average annual energy consumption by around a tenth, according to Quby. Lower energy consumption would not necessarily seem to be in Eneco\u2019s interests, but it figures that any loss in revenue will be more than offset by growth in its services business. (The company does not provide details on its services unit in its public filings.)Already, through Toons, Eneco can monitor the performance of natural gas boilers and solar panels and can send repair people when equipment needs servicing. And, as Mr. Valk, the Quby chief, had hoped, the devices have helped reduce the number of customers who leave Eneco for other providers by 60 percent, the company says.Mr. Valk envisions a future where customers pay for various services, rather than kilowatts of energy. Unlike today\u2019s dominant sources of electricity, wind and solar power are essentially free once equipment is installed. So, \u201cyou are going to pay for flexibility, not for the \u2018neutrons,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valk said.Eneco has also invested heavily in wind power, in part so that it can assure environmentally minded customers that their power comes from cleaner sources. That has paid dividends: The company has a 10-year contract to supply Google with clean energy for an electricity-hungry data storage center that opened last year in Eemshaven, in the north of the Netherlands.Much of Eneco\u2019s strategy is in its infancy. CrowdNett, the battery storage service, has only a few dozen clients, but the utility has big ambitions for the initiative. If enough battery owners sign on, Eneco says, it can use software to electronically aggregate and sell the power, like a conventional utility.Daan Berkouwer, who works for a water management company, said the combination of financial incentives and the promise of cutting emissions helped him decide to buy a lozenge-shape Tesla Powerwall battery to use with CrowdNett.\u201cWhen everybody is doing this, then the oil companies can quit with their production,\u201d said the 27-year-old Mr. Berkouwer, who lives with his wife on the outskirts of Gouda, the town famous for its cheese. \u201cWhy take out all the oil and demolish the planet if you can do it with clean energy?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Based on what I had read in the media, I was prepared for a rabid sexist screed. Instead, I found a closely reasoned discussion, expressed in moderate terms.I did not agree with everything that Mr. Damore said. In my career as an engineer, I have seen both overt sexism and the softer sexism of social assumptions. But most of what he said was simply a restatement of what we already know or suspect about the biological differences between men and women. Agree or disagree, this is not the kind of provocation that warrants dismissal.I fear that our society is suffering from a new McCarthyism, in which, as Mr. Damore and, before him, Larry Summers discovered, even to mention the possibility that inborn differences play a role in our vocational affinities is to lose one\u2019s livelihood.To the Editor:Mr. Damore argues that there should be a meritocracy regardless of gender, but as long as women are viewed as innately inferior then achieving meritocracy is not possible.

For kindergarten teachers, I imagine it would take quotas capping the number of women and/or significant recruitment bonuses for men.JAMES G. RUSSELL, MIDLOTHIAN, VA.To the Editor:Mr. Damore\u2019s memo is exactly that: a complaint about workplace policies. Reading the entire memo reveals that it is a well-researched and constructive piece about how to potentially reduce gender discrimination.To the Editor:As a longtime information technology manager and consultant, now retired, I am puzzled by the carping about gender diversity in the American I.T. industry. I always saw underappreciated women programmers as a recruiting opportunity \u2014 you don\u2019t want them, then I\u2019ll take them.In recent years the I.T. industry has increasingly turned to Asian workers, who are predominantly male because of gender prejudice in Asia far more egregious than America\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Crowded TV Marketplace Gets Ready for Three Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has more than $1 billion budgeted for original programming, Facebook wants its own version of \u201cScandal\u201d and Google is ready to spend up to $3 million per episode on a drama.The three digital giants have signaled to Hollywood that they are serious about entering a television landscape that Netflix and Amazon shook up just a few years ago. Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.With the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.That budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201dMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.It is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.But as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.And while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.It has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.Unlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.YouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.Although Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine. Originally, YouTube and its subscription YouTube Red channel were largely focused on creating bigger budget shows for YouTube stars.Data searches, Mr. Kyncl said, provided a \u201cwindow into the demand of Hollywood product on YouTube.\u201d\u201cWhy not fulfill this demand?\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes absolute sense. It\u2019s in the service of our users.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The new money will go to redesigning the site and creating a better mobile version, in the mold of more modern services \u2014 it will look like Facebook or Twitter, per Recode, the technology site. This sounds smart, but entrenched communities tend to hate change, so we\u2019ll see what Reddit\u2019s hordes have to say about this.I can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do with a virtual assistant, though perhaps it would help me remember to pay rent on time, which I am constitutionally incapable of doing. In any case, I\u2019m curious to see how Facebook decides to use the tech. Perhaps they\u2019ll incorporate it into Messenger, the chat app that was playing around with its own virtual assistant ideas.I thought it was crazy and something I\u2019d never use, but a lot of folks on Twitter told me it\u2019s absolutely perfect for older people like their grandparents, who love to use video chat to keep in touch with family. Maybe I\u2019m wrong? Maybe I\u2019m just too young and cool to understand? Help me, Farhad.That\u2019s not good! But I can stomach it as long as they don\u2019t start leaking \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spoilers all over the place.Do you have any Bitcoin, Farhad? Or perhaps now some Bitcoin Cash?The caveats: This all happened last year, and Snap said the rumors were false (though there may have been \u201cinformal\u201d talks, according to B.I.). It may not have been a real serious possibility, and often when rumors like these get floated, it stems from folks who have quite a vested interest in making an acquisition actually happen.Advertisers are noticing. I keep hearing chatter about ad budgets being moved from Snapchat over to Instagram, which offers a nearly identical product but with better advertising technology and a much larger base of users. If you\u2019re an ad exec looking to spend dollars on digital ads aimed at youngsters, it seems like kind of an easy choice.So perhaps a bailout acquisition by Google would actually make a modicum of sense. Think back to when Facebook bought Instagram. Mark Zuckerberg basically said, \u201ckeep doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d to Instagram, and acted to help supplement Instagram\u2019s growth only by providing some of Facebook\u2019s strongest assets. Facebook is sitting on a mountain of sophisticated ad technology, not to mention hundreds of thousands of eager advertisers looking for more space to buy ads.I could see Google and Snap in a similar situation, especially since Snap is actively in the market to improve its advertising technology through a potential acquisition or two, as we\u2019ve heard rumors of over the past few months. Selling out seems like a no-brainer to me, even if it\u2019s a tacit admission that the company couldn\u2019t make it alone on the public markets.Also, it\u2019s expensive.

{"Headline": "\u2018Thought Bullies\u2019 or Right Move: A Divide Over James Damore Firing", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen in technical positions believed sexism was the reason for a lack of diversity in the industry and spoke of their own experiences with discrimination. As a woman who has worked in IT for over 15 years, I have been sexually harassed, put up with denigrating comments from my male colleagues, been excluded from \u201cbonding\u201d and networking events where my female presence would have undermined their fun guys\u2019 night out on the company dime at cigar bars, strip clubs or pub crawls.As Americans, we\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve risen above the discriminatory attitudes of the past, but 40 years of women in the workplace isn\u2019t going to undo centuries of ingrained attitudes of subordination. Sexism is still as alive and well as it always has been. There are just new ways and old ways of rationalizing it.Not only am I good at math, I love it. I can\u2019t fully describe how math makes me feel. It makes me feel awesome and empowered. I looked for work for three and a half years in my field. Now I\u2019m a glorified secretary in a hospital. I don\u2019t get to do any math as part of my job. Tell me again how reinforcing ideas about women\u2019s inherent differences is a valid opinion that deserves my respect and time. Tell me again that my frustration is neuroses and probably PMS. Tell me again.Some female readers in the technology industry criticized Google for firing Mr. Damore; others supported his arguments. I am a female scientist. I know why women do not succeed at the same levels as men in science fields and it is not because we are neurotic. It\u2019s because we are the ones who bear and nurse children, and day care is expensive.Firing a man who expresses his opinion that there are so few women in tech is because they are inherently incapable of succeeding in tech only gives fodder to those who feel men are being pushed aside so women can succeed. With his firing, this opportunity to open his eyes is lost.As a female software developer, I also believe that Mr. Damore has a right to present his arguments. I will go so far as to say that some of them are correct and that I see those traits in myself. Maybe we don\u2019t need to go around pretending that every human is just the same, and maybe if we can accept the differences, we can move forward to finding a place for \u201cfeminine\u201d behavior within the IT community.Many readers suggested that Mr. Damore\u2019s error was writing his memo on a company computer on company time. Actually, he\u2019s not protected within the company as an employee using company time and computers. And Google was right to fire him for violating its policies.That employee exercised his free speech. The company exercised their right to fire an employee who contributed to a hostile workplace.Everyone has the right to their own backward, sexist, racist views, but when you utilize company property and resources to spread those views in violation of company policy you are likely to be disciplined and/or terminated.Some readers thought Google stymied Mr. Damore\u2019s attempt to openly discuss his viewpoints. Anyone who questions the politically correct orthodoxy, whether on race, sex, climate change, etc., is derided as a bigot, a boor or worse. It\u2019s true he had no First Amendment protection, but shame on Google. They\u2019re a bunch of thought bullies.So much for allowing employees to openly discuss their opinions. This is what true discrimination and intolerance looks like.Google missed an opportunity to engage this guy (who is the tip of an iceberg in Silicon Valley, which is just as libertarian as it is leftist) and discuss openly why his claims were simplistic.Other readers believed Mr. Damore was a victim of his own privilege. As an employee of privilege, he\u2019s probably unaccustomed to earning his way to a seat at the table. He\u2019s always had it. Fortunately, in a meritocracy, privilege is something you earn. And what better way to demonstrate it than by firing an utterly clueless person who doesn\u2019t demonstrate the skills required at Google.Mr. Damore is not a biologist yet felt privileged enough to speak like an expert on the subject.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China, Facebook Tests the Waters With a Stealth App", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the social network is trying a different way into China: by authorizing the release of a new app there that does not carry the Facebook name.Facebook approved the May debut of a photo-sharing app, called Colorful Balloons, in China, according to a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans, who declined to be named because the information is politically sensitive. The app, which has not previously been reported, shares the look, function and feel of Facebook\u2019s Moments app. It was released through a separate local company and without any hint that the social network is affiliated with it.Now Colorful Balloons gives the Silicon Valley company a way to see how Chinese users digitally share information with their friends or interact with their favorite social media platforms.\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.It is unclear whether China\u2019s various internet regulators were aware of the app\u2019s existence. The under-the-table approach could cause Facebook new difficulties with a Chinese government that has maintained strict oversight and control over foreign tech companies.\u201cIt\u2019s not a mere business thing,\u201d said Teng Bingsheng, a professor of strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s politics.\u201dThe Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Before the release of Colorful Balloons, Facebook had taken an unusually high-profile approach to courting China.Colorful Balloons represents the opposite approach \u2014 one that is low profile.The app was released in China by a company called Youge Internet Technology, according to a post in Apple\u2019s app store. It is registered to an address in eastern Beijing, yet the room number listed in company registration documents could not be found amid a series of shabby, small offices on the building\u2019s fourth floor.Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Zhang\u2019s relationship to the company, and Ms. Zhang did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.If Facebook did little to promote Colorful Balloons in China, it did work to tailor the app to a local audience. In the rest of the world, the company\u2019s Moments app connects users through Facebook. Colorful Balloons instead links users through China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat.While photos can be shared, Facebook appears to have taken steps to ensure the app could not spread widely. For example, people who post photos from Colorful Balloons on WeChat will see a link that lets other users download Facebook\u2019s Chinese app. But the link does not work, meaning people have to seek out Colorful Balloons in an app store instead of grabbing it from their friends, which may limit its distribution.The risk Facebook is taking with the new app is high. The company appears to have handed over a fully functioning product to Youge for release, and has done so without indicating in any public way that it is connected to Facebook. Coming just ahead of a key meeting of the Chinese Communist Party this autumn, the secretive release of Colorful Balloons could also undermine trust between the company and the Chinese government.\u201cThe government\u2019s control and surveillance of media is strict, and it is almost impossible for them to open that door,\u201d said Mr. Teng, the Cheung Kong professor. \u201cAlthough Mark Zuckerberg has visited China many times and practiced his Chinese very hard, I don\u2019t foresee any major breakthroughs for Facebook.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.

{"Headline": "The Vatican\u2019s America Problem", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn European politics this was a novel gambit, but for American Catholics at the time it amounted to a tacit endorsement of what they were already doing. In the United States there was no ancien regime to imagine restoring, no plausible scenario in which the integration of church and state might be achieved \u2014 and Catholics had been trying to prove their patriotism in a largely Protestant country by rallying to the republic since the founding era.So Leo\u2019s letter began a long (and complicated) process of harmonization between America and Rome, sealed in the 1960s at the Second Vatican Council, in which the church\u2019s political thought was tacitly Americanized. No more would the Vatican emphasize the necessity, for Catholics, of supporting an \u201cintegralist\u201d relationship between their government and church. Instead the American way of doing religious politics \u2014 in which a secular political framework allowed a great deal of room for religiously inspired activism \u2014 was blessed and accepted as the Catholic way as well.Their essay is bad but important. Its seems to intend, reasonably enough, to warn against Catholic support for the darker tendencies in Trumpism \u2014 the xenophobia and identity politics, the \u201cstigmatization of enemies,\u201d the crude view of Islam and a wider \u201cpanorama of threats,\u201d the prosperity-gospel inflected worship of success.But the authors\u2019 understanding of American religion seems to start and end with Google searches and anti-evangelical tracts, and their intended attack on Trumpery expands and expands, conflating very different political and religious tendencies, indulging in paranoia about obscure theocratic Protestants and fringe Catholic websites, and ultimately critiquing every kind of American religious conservatism \u2014 including the largely anti-political Benedict Option and the pro-life activism fulsomely supported by Francis\u2019 papal predecessors \u2014 as dangerously illiberal, \u201ctheopolitical,\u201d Islamic State-esque, \u201cManichaean,\u201d a return to the old integralism that the church no longer supports.What Spadaro and Figueroa do not grasp is that the tendencies that they see at work in American Catholicism, the religious votes for the cheerfully pagan Trump and the growing interest in traditionalism, radicalism and separatism, are not the culmination of the Catholic-evangelical alliance but rather a reaction to its political and cultural failures \u2014 and the failures of liberal religious politics as well.In increasing numbers, American Catholics (and Protestants) feel that their leaders and thinkers have spent decades rallying to the republic, trying to bring about its moral and political renewal \u2026 only to see republican virtues decaying, liberalism turning hostile to religious faith, and democratic capitalism delivering disappointment and dislocation. So some of them are reaching backward and sideways or ahead, trying to claim Trumpism or socialism or grasp some as-yet-unknown idea, because they sense that the present order might someday soon be itself an ancien regime from which their religion must slip free.This they surely do not mean to do. But it is precisely this tension, between the Spadaro-Figueroa critique of American religious conservatives and Pope Francis\u2019 sometimes harsh assessment of the liberal West, that makes the essay important as well as incoherent \u2014 because it reveals something significant about the dilemmas of the Vatican in a populist moment, in which the future of Western politics seems unusually uncertain.Between Leo XIII and the Second Vatican Council, Rome gradually made its peace with secular and liberal government, and embraced a style of Catholic politics that worked comfortably within the liberal order, rather than against its grain. And the church has good prudential reasons not to lean in too far to any kind of populism or post-liberalism, lest it lead toward authoritarianism or simple disaster.At the same time the church is supposed to be larger than any particular political philosophy, ready to outlast any particular order and capable of speaking prophetically in periods of transition. It could not remain bound to French monarchists forever; there may come a moment when it cannot remain with whatever liberalism might become.At the very least the men in the Vatican who yearn for such a church need to do a better job grasping why so many of their flock, in Europe and the United States, find this vision insufficient to the times.And then beyond that they might consider the possibility that as in the 19th century, American Catholics, in all their present confusion and occasional extremism, might be closer to grasping what our strange future holds for Catholic politics than Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Premier League Heeds the Siren Song of Spend, Spend, Spend", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerNEWCASTLE, England \u2014 Last Wednesday, the English striker Andre Gray moved to Watford from Burnley. At 18.5 million pounds, or about $24 million, it was not the most expensive transfer this summer. It was hardly the most glamorous, and it is unlikely to be the most meaningful or memorable.On Friday, a couple of days after Gray pulled on his new jersey, the Premier League season opened. Arsenal rallied to beat visiting Leicester City, 4-3, having fallen behind twice. The next day, Liverpool traveled to Watford and drew, 3-3, conceding an equalizer that may or may not have been offside in the 95th minute. Hours later, Chelsea, last year\u2019s champion, had two players sent off and lost at home to Burnley, whom many observers have tipped for relegation.It was totally unpredictable, and yet eerily familiar. That sort of chaos, after all, is exactly what has turned the Premier League into the world\u2019s most popular domestic soccer competition, a place where the unimaginable is not only possible, but practically compulsory. The opening salvos of the new season offered a vision of the Premier League as it likes to see itself: not just the world\u2019s richest league, but its most richly entertaining.There is, however, a tension between the two traits that define it. The clubs of the Premier League have spent a billion pounds this summer \u2014 though it should be pointed out that is a gross figure, rather than net; the actual amount of money to leave the league will be hundreds of millions less \u2014 but are back and, in many cases, just the same as ever. All of that money has done little to address many of the clubs\u2019 glaring flaws.Arsenal and Liverpool still cannot defend. Chelsea, somehow, has spent more than $150 million and yet seems to have a squad more stretched than the one that, in May, celebrated a second championship in three years.Manchester City and Manchester United have both, if early indications hold true, improved notably, winning impressively against newly promoted Brighton and old-hands West Ham, respectively. But then Tottenham showed much the same at Newcastle (admittedly aided by a spectacularly dim red card for the home team\u2019s captain, Jonjo Shelvey), and its coach, Mauricio Pochettino, has not spent a cent thus far this summer.It is seen, after all, as proof of English soccer\u2019s potency, its rude physical health. No other league comes close to keeping pace financially. Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, its nearest contender last year, could invest only half as much.The Premier League can spend the most because it raises the most, in television revenue and sponsorships and all the rest. Its status, and its primacy, can be weighed in pounds and pence.Paris Saint-Germain's record-breaking acquisition of Neymar mirrors the importance of Diego Maradona\u2019s transfer in 1982 and Johan Cruyff\u2019s in 1973.This weekend has offered yet more supporting evidence that the Premier League\u2019s belief that money can cure all ills is misguided. England is home to an array of some of the most highly paid, highly regarded managers on the planet, and yet they work in a culture that tells them that the only way to solve problems is to acquire more, and more expensive, players.Even Pochettino \u2014 one of the few to buck the trend \u2014 admits his parsimony is partly enforced, rather than entirely voluntary.\u201cSure, now it is an advantage not to have signed players,\u201d he said, with a laugh, after his team\u2019s 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday. \u201cWe do need to sign players before the end of the window. We have to refresh the squad, to create competition, and the season is so long. We need more quality, more players to keep the level we want.\u201cBut balance is the most important. We need new players to bring energy, and you always have to challenge your best players, but it is true that we are calm, and strong enough to compete in the same way as last season.\u201dIn an age of excess, even that seems almost archaic. It is impossible, in England in August, to escape the sensation that the actual soccer is little more than a distraction from the real business of working out who is going to play for whom for the rest of the year, so overwhelming is the focus on transfers.All managers are asked, relentlessly, about whether their most recent result has encouraged them to go into the market, has proved that they need to spend more money, right up until the window closes, even though those decisions have been made long before. \u201cWe knew before what we wanted,\u201d said Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the Newcastle manager. \u201cAnd we know now.\u201dThat is not enough to feed the addiction, the compulsive spending. Problems must be identified and fixed, with money. The appetite \u2014 often from boardroom to bleachers \u2014 is for wholesale change, for constant accumulation, perpetual revolution.It is not an approach that seems to work. The early-season mayhem witnessed over the last three days is, to some extent, an understandable consequence of so much change: teams still trying to work out what they are supposed to be.It will not abate, though. It will continue. It always does. Just as it is always exposed when England\u2019s representatives meet Europe\u2019s best and brightest in the Champions League. The Premier League will be as wildly chaotic and as feverishly compelling as ever this season, precisely because of the emphasis on spending. It does not solve problems; it entrenches them. That is the charm and the curse: The more England\u2019s teams spend, the more they stay the same.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s War Over the Sexes", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMen and women are different. On this, almost everyone acquainted with reality agrees. How different is the more controversial question, to which there is one particularly interesting answer: A little more different than they used to be.Conservatives sometimes worry that our society features an unhealthy blurring of sexual identities, an androgyne confusion. The left tends to be more optimistic about such blurring, seeing it as a liberation from the rule of patriarchy and the prison of heteronormativity.But the opposite trend, the divergence of the sexes, might be more important. Some of our present difficulties may flow from an excess of feminine and masculine differentiation, from the sexes growing apart and losing common ground, from the decline of marriage\u2019s male-female partnership and the rise of a singlehood that\u2019s often more sex-segregated than family life.Certainly the frontiers of sexual license often feature strong male-female differentiation rather than androgyny or gender-neutrality. Think of the clich\u00e9s that prevail in internet pornography, or the gendered kinks of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d Even our culture\u2019s highest-profile gender transition had a highly sex-specific presentation \u2014 Bruce Jenner was the ultimate male Olympian; Caitlyn Jenner, a busty, hyper-feminized Vanity Fair cover model.If you then asked a left-wing misandrist to do the same sort of parody in reverse, you\u2019d end up with something like the online far-right \u2014 nerds and autodidacts obsessed with cuckoldry, fascist cosplayers eager for evidence of their own racial superiority, would-be lotharios furious at feminism, libertarians with a ten-point case for despotism.The divergence of the sexes also provides a useful context for thinking about this week\u2019s culture-war controversy, the high-profile firing of a Google software engineer, James Damore, for a memo he wrote criticizing the company\u2019s diversity policies.But Damore also made reasonable points about different ways to pursue diversity and the costs and benefits thereof, in an earnest and dialogic style that a healthy corporate culture would have found a way to answer without swiftly giving him the ax.At the same time, there was a sense in which Damore had to be fired, precisely because of the intertwined realities that he described. Silicon Valley is a very male environment, a land of nerd kings and brogrammers whose deepest beliefs tend to be the sort that men come up with when they don\u2019t have very many women around \u2014 arch-libertarian, irreligious, utopian in a mechanistic style.I strongly suspect that more than a few Silicon Valley higher-ups agreed with the broad themes of Damore\u2019s memo. But just as tech titans accept some censorship and oppression as the price of doing business in China, they accept performative progressivism as the price of having nice campuses in the most liberal state in the union and recruiting their employees from its most elite and liberal schools. And for questioning that political performance while defending the disproportionate maleness that makes it necessary, the Google memo-writer simply had to go.This is not a healthy dynamic, obviously. Indeed, part of why the alt-right has such a strong (if sub rosa) presence in Northern California is because it\u2019s a predictable kind of male response to professional life under the rule of political correctness \u2014 a response that the Damore firing will only make more attractive.But since the usual way to reintegrate the sexes is to have them marry one another and raise kids, what Silicon Valley probably needs right now more than either workplace anti-microaggression training or an alt-right underground is a basic friendliness to family, pregnancy and child rearing.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s where the company is planning to open a 30,000-square-foot coffee emporium in December, one that Mr. Schultz believes \u201cwill have a larger consumer impact than the opening of Shanghai Disney.\u201dThe story of Starbucks in China is a nearly 20-year journey that may be a case study for American companies that have struggled to do business there.Starbucks has found a way into the culture of China \u2014 as well as the good graces of the Chinese government \u2014 by investing heavily there, paying significantly higher wages than competitors, and extending its employee ownership benefits to Chinese workers. The company has also been offering housing allowances and health care benefits and, unusually, offering critical illness insurance for the parents of employees and inviting those parents to an annual meeting of the company\u2019s Chinese staff. Today, Starbucks China is run by a female executive, Belinda Wong.All these efforts have built up an extraordinary level of trust. But they took time and money \u2014 too much money, some shareholders complained in the early days of the endeavor.\u201cThe years of losses built pressure from both within and from the street to leave and abandon the China market,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. Part of the company\u2019s challenge, he added, was the need to teach an entire country known for its tea about the culture of coffee drinking.Starbucks faced many of the same pressures in China as Yum Brands, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Last year, Yum Brands spun off its China unit under pressure from shareholders who were concerned about the costs and volatility of trying to expand a business there.Even Mr. Schultz acknowledged that his early foray was a teachable moment for him. At first, he was desperate to import the Starbucks philosophy to employees and customers in China.\u201cThe natural answer was to move senior tenured Starbucks managers to China to run the business and to imprint the Starbucks culture with our Chinese employees,\u201d he said. But as it turned out, he added, \u201cit was a mistake.\u201dMr. Schultz and his team realized that to gain the trust of Chinese customers, employees and government officials, they needed to show that they trusted them, too.\u201cThe unlock was when we realized it had to be a combination of both U.S. and Chinese leaders, and over time a totally dedicated Chinese leadership team led by a Chinese C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Schultz said.Today, he explained, \u201cthey are the most self-contained autonomous business unit within the company.\u201d Letting that dynamic develop, he said, involved \u201ctrusting them to know what\u2019s best for our partners, our customers, and how to build an enduring relationship with all constituencies on the basis of trust.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say it always worked. Starbucks faced protests in 2013 in China when a newscaster for CCTV reported that the company charged a third more for a latte in China than it did in the United States. (It was true, and Starbucks did not change the price.)The company was also forced to abandon its store in the Forbidden City \u2014 the former Chinese imperial palace, in Beijing \u2014 after a sustained campaign to evict it by protesters who contended its presence was undermining Chinese culture.But over time, Starbucks has continued to invest more deeply in the vast nation. Recently that involved growing coffee in Yunnan Province \u2014 which lies in China\u2019s southwest and abuts Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam \u2014 and creating a new high-end Arabica coffee and hundreds of jobs in the process.The company has discussed the prospect of ultimately creating a global brand of Yunnan coffee with the Chinese government, which would be similar to what Starbucks has done in promoting its coffee from Colombia, Ethiopia and Sumatra.So why did China work for Starbucks, but prove a stubborn challenge for so many others, like Yum and McDonald\u2019s?\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to criticize them, but I think both those companies franchised their system early on and were in the fast-food business,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cI think they approached it very, very differently than we did.\u201d(It\u2019s worth noting that companies like Apple and Disney have enjoyed great success in China.)Of course, one of the questions that Mr. Schultz is often asked is about the politics of the Starbucks brand abroad, given how closely the name is associated with the United States. Mr. Schultz himself has been an outspoken Democrat.\u201cThe Chinese have consistently over the years had an affinity for Western brands,\u201d particularly Western luxury brands, Mr. Schultz said. \u201cAnd I think perhaps we have benefited from that.\u201dBut there\u2019s more to it than that, as Mr. Schultz tells it. \u201cThe story and the success we have enjoyed is clearly based on the experience that takes place in our stores,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the halo of America.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the DealBook column on Tuesday, about Starbucks\u2019s expansion plans in China, referred incorrectly to China Central Television, known as CCTV. It has not changed its name to China Global Television Network, or CGTV.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Is the Line? Charlottesville Forces Media and Tech Companies to Decide", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIt took the death of a young woman at the hands of one of the neo-Nazis she was protesting to force the ever-expanding media universe to face a question it has been evading for years: Where\u2019s the line?The Daily Caller, the conservative online publication that has the Fox News host Tucker Carlson as a founder, appeared to identify the line, too. This week it took down a truly vile video it produced in January celebrating motorists who had plowed into \u201cliberal protesters,\u201d advising its readers to \u201cstudy the technique.\u201d (The Daily Caller said on Thursday that the video was a young videographer\u2019s \u201cclumsy attempt at creating some levity\u201d at a tense time, but added that any suggestion that the video had a role in causing \u201cNazis to be stupid, violent maniacs is patently absurd.\u201d)It may come as a relief that people in high places in the media and technology world decided it was no longer tenable to give extra oxygen \u2014 digital and financial \u2014 to those who worship the champions of slavery or march under the Nazi flag, glorifying one of the most morally reprehensible regimes in history.But it is truly remarkable that it only happened now, after the nation had to witness a white supremacist rally gone wrong, a latter-day Munich Beer Hall Putsch in miniature.Then again, that list had been out for three years.As we\u2019ve seen time and time again in recent months, it often takes an extreme moment to push the platforms to address extreme content.Part of the problem is logistical: There is so much material flooding the platforms that the most dangerous items can slip through.But moves to stanch certain kinds of content also clash with the spirit of the First Amendment and, more to the point, the free-speech ethos that is so ingrained in the web.That ethos has been the game-changer, and often for the good.Unlike the last big communications revolutions \u2014 brought about with radio and then television \u2014 this one came with no barrier to entry in terms of expensive equipment like towers and studios. There have been no governmental limits like broadcasting standards and licensing requirements.That has democratized information, giving rise to new political and social movements as well as to a phalanx of innovative media ventures that have diminished the traditional gatekeeper role of the mainstream media. It gave anyone with an internet connection an opportunity to have his or her voice heard widely via Facebook or Twitter, Reddit or Medium.But as the downsides of informational democratization become more evident \u2014 the opening it has provided for nefarious state actors, terrorists and hate mongers \u2014 those who have some control over the web\u2019s content stream have had a hard time figuring out where to build some much-needed dams.Google, in keeping with Silicon Valley\u2019s aversion to the news media, would not provide anyone to speak on the record about its policies but pointed to new moves aimed at starving hateful or violent sites of advertising revenue and to detect and remove terrorist videos.The trouble has come in finding the line between what some may find offensive and what is objectively dangerous speech.YouTube shut down The Daily Stormer. But I had no trouble finding a recording of Thursday\u2019s edition of \u201cDavid Duke Radio\u201d on YouTube, or, for that matter, the latest audio from \u201cStormfront Radio,\u201d which is connected to an older supremacist site.Then again, the efforts to police content can go too far. Mixed in with complaints from right-wing provocateurs who have already been shut down are serious conservative fears that the moves will result in censorship for right-leaning political thought.The conversation needs to continue. It can\u2019t only be had at the height of a crisis, and it can\u2019t only be relegated to social media.But at this point, if we can\u2019t set a line at neo-Nazis and white nationalists inciting hatred and violence, can we set any line at all?Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toyota to Take 5 Percent Stake in Mazda and Build Joint U.S. Plant", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies.The factory\u2019s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said.Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States.The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. \u201cToyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!\u201d he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a \u201cbig border tax.\u201dThe alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology.In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts \u2014 especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars \u2014 many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution.\u201cTotally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said. \u201cWe need to cooperate and compete with them.\u201dJapan\u2019s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew.Toyota has been extending its reach, as well.Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership.With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges \u2014 both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla.Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company\u2019s products more flair.Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda\u2019s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent.Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion.\u201cAs Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi\u2019s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,\u201d said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers.Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. \u201cAny manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,\u201d Gov. Rick Snyder said. \u201cWe are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.\u201dAnd a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: \u201cToyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas \u2014 just recently opening their new North American headquarters \u2014 and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion.Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Online Giants Back $12 Billion Deal to Shake Up State Firm", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Some of China\u2019s biggest technology players are backing a plan to invest nearly $12 billion in one of the country\u2019s telecommunications giants, the latest move in a broader government push to shake up the country\u2019s bloated state-run companies.But it is an effort that, so far, has left experts unimpressed.Chinese leaders hope more private investors will push the leaders of state-run companies to pare down wasteful businesses and shift to more productive ways to make money. It would also put experienced managers in boardrooms and spur more professional practices.Since the plan was announced, under the firm guidance of Beijing, some state-run companies have sought out investments from private firms as well as state-run companies from other industries.In the case of China Unicom, the country\u2019s three biggest internet companies are investing: Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant; Tencent Holdings, which runs China\u2019s most popular social-messaging service; and Baidu, the online search company that is sometimes called the Google of China. The biggest new shareholder would be China Life Insurance, a state-run firm, which would have about a 10 percent stake, China Unicom said.\u201cThere is an immediate, serious problem with this initiative in that the best outcome is more competition, not cooperation\u201d between state companies and private firms, said Derek Scissors, a China-focused resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.\u201cIt still could be an improvement over the current situation, if private firms are permitted to genuinely change S.O.E. practices,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. He added, however, \u201cThere\u2019s been no evidence of this yet.\u201d\u201cIt seems for the last two-and-a-half years the tide has been moving toward state capital at the expense of private capital,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a partner at Gavekal, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not very encouraging.\u201dStill, China Unicom\u2019s deal has the potential to be different because some successful private companies are involved, Mr. Kroeber said.\u201cThis can be fairly interpreted as a signal that there\u2019s a fairly serious effort to restart this mixed ownership reform in more or less the format that was originally planned,\u201d he said.China\u2019s technology firms have quickly outmaneuvered state-run telecom businesses, with social-messaging apps that replaced text messaging and by building their own e-commerce networks. While state-owned firms have built the highways, private companies have learned how to go the fastest.Martin Lau, president of Tencent, told investors on an earnings call on Wednesday that the deal represents a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in China\u2019s economic overhaul effort, and added that Tencent does not expect the deal to result in more regulatory pressure on the company.

Claire Cain Miller, a writer for The Upshot, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Much of reporting on data is no different from other reporting, though it includes a little more Excel. It still requires reading, talking to sources and writing (and Twitter).One thing we\u2019ve been doing at The Upshot is experimenting with the best form for a story, not just defaulting to 1,000 words and a photo. So that has meant making charts, planning art and thinking about layouts for reading on phones and computers.I recently started using Google Keep for note-taking, and it\u2019s made working much more efficient. I\u2019d tried a lot of note-taking apps but didn\u2019t like any of them, so I used to record random ideas on Post-it notes or by sending myself emails \u2014 which usually just led to things getting lost. Now I have notes with titles like \u201cstory ideas,\u201d \u201cgender sources\u201d and \u201cbooks to read,\u201d and can easily access them from anywhere.My sanity at work has been much improved by Slack.

{"Headline": "DreamHost Ordered to Release Some Trump Protest Website Data to U.S.", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Superior Court judge in Washington on Thursday ordered the web hosting company DreamHost to turn over data associated with a Trump protest website to federal prosecutors \u2014 but not as much as the Justice Department had originally sought.The ruling by Judge Robert E. Morin allows the government to proceed with a scaled-back search warrant for records related to the website DisruptJ20.org, which served as a clearinghouse for plans to protest President Trump\u2019s swearing-in on Jan. 20.But DreamHost said that the ruling was an affront to privacy rights and that it would consider an appeal after reviewing a transcript of the hearing. Until the company reaches a decision, the Justice Department will have access to certain emails sent through the domain but must wait to comb through them.To assuage DreamHost\u2019s worries about potential First Amendment violations, Judge Morin will supervise the examination of the data.\u201cIt is in many ways a victory,\u201d Raymond O. Aghaian, a lawyer for DreamHost, said of the ruling. \u201cThe court was having a lot of difficulty trying to balance the government\u2019s right to investigate and prosecute a wrongful activity and the First Amendment rights of innocent parties caught up in the middle.\u201dThe Justice Department did not return requests for comment.The ruling came on an already tumultuous day for DreamHost. The company \u2014 which hosts more than 1.5 million websites, blogs and apps \u2014 spent much of Thursday battling a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack that hobbled parts of its network for hours.DreamHost\u2019s tussle with federal prosecutors began on July 12 with a search warrant seeking proof of criminal activity as the government built a case against about 200 people arrested during Inauguration Day protests.Thursday\u2019s ruling also requires the government to submit to Judge Morin a list of all the data it is requesting and a justification for why it should be included under the warrant.Mr. Aghaian said the scope of the Justice Department\u2019s search now extended only to emails passing through DisruptJ20.org and related mailing lists. But he warned that the ruling on Thursday could still have a chilling effect on political speech.The assault began soon after DreamHost began hosting the website Punished Stormer, which is the newest manifestation of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. The website has spent the past week bouncing from host to host, with GoDaddy, Google and several others refusing it access after the violence at a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Va., this month.DreamHost also hosts websites for the white nationalist groups Northwest Front and National Vanguard. Years ago, the company hosted The Daily Stormer as well, though DreamHost told The New York Times that it later asked the website to leave after it violated the terms of service.\u201cWe think that Dreamhost, where Punished Stormer is, will hold,\u201d he wrote.\u201cSo much for \u2018freedom of speech,\u2019\u201d he wrote.DreamHost said that The Daily Stormer had gone under the radar on Wednesday to use the company\u2019s automated sign-up form to register for a similar domain name \u2014 an evasive tactic that is forbidden by DreamHost.\u201cThat alone was reason enough for us to disable this account, and we did so today,\u201d the company said in an email. \u201cUnfortunately, determined internet vigilantes weren\u2019t willing to wait for us to take that action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ron Lieber, The Times\u2019s Your Money columnist, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Personal finance is indeed deeply personal, and I\u2019ve found over the years that I learn as much from the people who read my work as I do from sources. To tap into that wisdom, I often open up comments on my column and moderate them myself, replying along the way to questions or particularly provocative statements.But because mine is a weekend column and there are sometimes hundreds of comments to approve by hand, I need to have a laptop with me wherever I go in order to keep up, and the lighter the better. So I lean hard on my MacBook Air (and really abuse the Samsonite Xenon backpack I use to lug it around).What do you like about it, and what could be better?A while back, I heard the author Gretchen Rubin say something enlightening about how much happier she was when she realized she could have multiple phone chargers and laptop cords instead of just one. I bought myself a Chromebook to use for office meetings (to go with my desktop machine at work and the Mac at home) so I wasn\u2019t lugging the Mac around on the subway even more than I already do.What\u2019s your favorite fintech app, and why?I love being able to scan checks and deposit them without doing the whole envelope, stamp, mailbox routine. I haven\u2019t maintained checking accounts at banks with branches in over 15 years, and this helps me keep the streak going. I do find it rather curious, however, that Charles Schwab can suck that paper through the air and into my checking account without much delay but still helps itself to a four-day hold on transfers from my external savings account.I have a saying \u2014 more like a lament \u2014 that I repeat so often that I\u2019ve turned it into a hashtag: Nothing is simple or easy. (Nothing!) #Nisoe. Technology has come a long way, but it is almost never as simple as its marketers suggest. My wife and I have rarely managed to touch any aspect of our audiovisual setup in our apartment without needing to pay someone to actually make it work. Now, hiring tech support in this way is reflexive \u2014 a pre-emptive way to buy back time that would surely be lost in figuring the whole thing out and probably failing. So I encourage people to budget for that, whether in hours or dollars.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life, and what do you and your family do with it?Why is Spotify better than alternatives like Apple Music?I haven\u2019t tried Apple Music, so I\u2019m not sure if it would be any better at this, but it would be neat to be able to post these spontaneous playlists to Facebook with some kind of natural language command so that people could play them with just one click. Why can\u2019t I type (or speak) something obviously recognizable, like \u201ctake the last six songs I played and post them to my Facebook account\u201d and have it just happen?If you could dream up a gadget or app that has yet to exist, what would it be and how much would you be willing to pay for it?I don\u2019t even know where to start here. Let\u2019s go from cheap to expensive.A voice (or foot!) operated screen door for when your hands are filled with grilled food or dirty dishes: $10.An app for all kids\u2019 first phones that allows them to help when they see someone on the street in need of help. Hit one button, and $1 moves from their allowance app to the nearest homeless shelter or food bank. I\u2019d pay $20 for this, but maybe Apple or Google will figure this out themselves and give it away in their app stores.And how about an app that finally lets me store all of the restaurants I want to try, so I can pull it up whenever I get hungry to remind myself of what is nearby or at the location that I\u2019m heading to? Maybe $25 for this one.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Loyal Engineers Steering NASA\u2019s Voyager Probes Across the Universe", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "FeatureAs the Voyager mission is winding down, so, too, are the careers of the aging explorers who expanded our sense of home in the galaxy.Supported byA fleet of JPL trucks made the trip under armored guard to the same destination. Their cargo was unwrapped inside the hangar high bay, a gleaming silo stocked with tool racks and ladder trucks. Engineers began to assemble the various pieces. Gradually, two identical spacecraft took shape. They were dubbed Voyager I and II, and their mission was to make the first color photographs and close-up measurements of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons. Then, if all went well, they might press onward \u2014 into uncharted territory.It took six months, working in shifts around the clock, for the NASA crew to reassemble and test the spacecraft. As the first launch date, Aug. 20, drew near, they folded the camera and instrument boom down against the spacecraft\u2019s spindly body like a bird\u2019s wing; gingerly they pushed it, satellite dish first, up inside a metal capsule hanging from the high bay ceiling. Once \u2018\u2018mated,\u2019\u2019 the capsule and its cargo \u2014 a probe no bigger than a Volkswagen Beetle that, along with its twin, had nevertheless taken 1,500 engineers five years and more than $200 million to build \u2014 were towed to the launchpad.By T-minus two hours, a select few engineers, too nervous to sit down, stood at computers outside the high bay, overseeing the spacecraft telemetry. Elsewhere in the hangar, scientists, NASA brass from Washington and several dozen \u2018\u2018nonessential\u2019\u2019 engineers \u2014 Zottarelli among them \u2014 huddled around TV monitors. At T-minus 30 seconds, the spacecraft\u2019s engines roared to life, and many of the nonessentials took off running out of the room and toward the exit \u2014 \u2018\u2018seven, six, five.\u2019\u2019 They burst out into the morning. Shielding their eyes, they peered across a flat expanse at smoke billowing on the horizon. Slowly and silently, the capsule rose out of the cloud, its rockets trailing flames. In an instant, there came a terrific boom as the sound waves from blastoff hit the hangar like a gong, ringing it as the spacecraft disappeared.Two weeks later, after the second launch, everyone headed home. The show was over \u2014 both spacecraft were performing flawlessly \u2014 but behind the scenes, the mission, on a tight budget, lagged in hiring the more than 200 computer engineers needed to shepherd the spacecraft through a planetary encounter. Many of those on the flight team were fresh out of college, running the most sophisticated electronics systems in the world. They had barely had a chance to jell, when, in April 1978, not yet halfway to Jupiter, Voyager 1 experienced a problem. Its scan platform, where the cameras and instruments are mounted, got stuck.As the engineers scrambled to figure out what they could do from more than 100 million miles away, someone forgot to send a weekly command to reset a timer on the other spacecraft. When it ran down without hearing from Earth, it triggered so-called fault-protection software, 600 lines of code that respond to malfunctions automatically. In this instance, fault protection assumed the radio receiver was broken and switched to the backup. On the mission-control monitors in a situation like this, the crawl of numbers reporting the status of the receivers would have turned crimson: a \u2018\u2018red alarm.\u2019\u2019Realizing their mistake, the engineers tried to stop the fault-protection routine, but the newly awakened backup receiver would not register their command. Helpless, they waited for the spacecraft to reason its way back to the original receiver; when it did, and the command went through normally, they were giddy with relief. They were still high-fiving when the working receiver shorted out like a blown fuse. Now it really was dead.Today the Voyagers are 10 billion and 13 billion miles away, the farthest man-made objects from Earth. The 40th anniversary of their launch will be celebrated next month. We tend to think of space as vacant, but it is actually matter, created, as everything in the universe is, by the explosions of ancient stars. Within our planetary neighborhood, this \u2018\u2018space\u2019\u2019 is made up of different particles than the space outside is, because of supersonic wind that blows out from the surface of our sun at a million miles per hour. The wind generates a bubble around our solar system called the heliosphere. Five years ago, Voyager 1 reached the boundary where the heliosphere gives way to interstellar space, a region as novel to us \u2014 and potentially relevant \u2014 as the Pacific was to Europeans 500 years ago. The data the probes are collecting are challenging fundamental physics and will provide clues to the biggest of questions: Why did our sun give birth to life only here? Where else, within our solar system or others, are we most likely to find evidence that we are not alone?The mission quite possibly represents the end of an era of space exploration in which the main goal is observation rather than commercialization. In internal memos, Trump-administration advisers have referred to NASA\u2019s traditional contractors as \u2018\u2018Old Space\u2019\u2019 and proposed refocusing its budget on supporting the growth of the private \u2018\u2018New Space\u2019\u2019 industry, Politico reported in February. \u2018\u2018Economic development of space\u2019\u2019 will begin in near-Earth orbit and on the moon, according to the president\u2019s transition team, with \u2018\u2018private lunar landers staking out de facto \u2018property rights\u2019 for Americans on the moon, by 2020.\u2019\u2019All explorations demand sacrifices in exchange for uncertain outcomes. Some of those sacrifices are social: how many resources we collectively devote to a given pursuit of knowledge. But another portion is borne by the explorer alone, who used to be rewarded with adventure and fame if not fortune. For the foreseeable future, Voyager seems destined to remain in the running for the title of Mankind\u2019s Greatest Journey, which might just make its nine flight-team engineers \u2014 most of whom have been with the mission since the Reagan administration \u2014 our greatest living explorers. They also may be the last people left on the planet who can operate the spacecraft\u2019s onboard computers, which have 235,000 times less memory and 175,000 times less speed than a 16-gigabyte smartphone. And while it\u2019s true that these pioneers haven\u2019t gone anywhere themselves, they are arguably every bit as dauntless as more celebrated predecessors. Magellan never had to steer a vessel from the confines of a dun-colored rental office, let alone stay at the helm long enough to qualify for a senior discount at the McDonald\u2019s next door.Their fluency in archaic programming languages will become only more crucial as the years go on, because even as the probes harvest priceless information from the cosmos, they are running out of fuel. (Decaying plutonium supplies their power.) By 2030 at the latest, they will not have enough juice left to run a single experiment. And even that best case comes with a major caveat: that the flight-team members forgo retirement to squeeze the most out of every last watt.The Voyagers carried cameras and instruments for analyzing atmospheric temperatures, moon masses, gravitational and magnetic fields and radiation levels. Reaching Jupiter in 1979, they captured images of lightning in its cloud tops and astounded scientists \u2014 who had assumed all moons were as barren as our own \u2014 with pictures of eight active volcanoes on its satellite Io; Europa, another Jovian moon, was encased in a shell of water ice, cracked in places by what appeared to be the tides of an ocean below. The photographs revealed themselves on control-room monitors pixel by pixel, row by row. \u2018\u2018I would be sitting in here at night sometimes when the Voyager mission was flying,\u2019\u2019 Esker Davis, project manager for the Saturn encounter, told David W. Swift, who published an oral history of the mission in 1997, after Davis\u2019s death. \u2018\u2018And my wife would call up and ask what I was doing. I said, \u2018Just watching pictures come in, being the first person to see this picture.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019The mission would have ended there, but President Ronald Reagan bestowed an extension, possibly swayed by the real-time briefings hosted by Ed Stone, the project\u2019s lead scientist, on the occasion of every planetary encounter. Hundreds of reporters, as well as politicians and celebrities, attended, packing into a cramped JPL auditorium for the debuts of Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.The final flyby, of Neptune\u2019s moon Triton, took place on a hot August night. Afterward, everyone celebrated with Champagne, cold cuts and drunken singing; on the JPL lawn, Chuck Berry performed \u2018\u2018Johnny B. Goode,\u2019\u2019 one of the tracks included on gold-plated records of human sights and sounds attached to the spacecraft for any intelligent life that might find them. Then, gradually, the hallways grew quiet. Stone and his colleagues moved on to new projects while analyzing Voyager data part time; the flight team laid off 150 engineers (many of whom went on to staff subsequent missions). The probes\u2019 new goal was to reach interstellar space. But though scientists had measured the speed of the solar wind that forms the heliosphere, the properties of the matter beyond it had never been analyzed. How much pressure it exerted on the bubble, and thus the size of the bubble, were a mystery. So, too, was how long \u2014 years? decades? \u2014 it might take a craft to escape it.At the mission\u2019s outset, the flight-team members were mischievous kids. They relieved stress with games and pranks: bowling in the hallway, using soda cans as pins; filling desk drawers with plastic bags of live goldfish; making scientists compete in disco-pose contests. Now, by 1990, they were older, with kids of their own. They had experienced the deaths of colleagues and watched others\u2019 marriages falter as a result of long hours at the lab. With no planets to explore, they spent the decade doing routine spacecraft maintenance with a fraction of their bygone manpower. Six of the current nine engineers were on the team then. Sun Kang Matsumoto, who joined the mission in \u201985, studied so diligently to master the new roles pressed upon her that her sons learned the spacecraft contours by osmosis. When her eldest was 8, he surprised her with a perfect Lego model; now in college, \u2018\u2018he calls and asks, \u2018How is Voyager?\u2019 Like, \u2018How is Grandma?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto says.The mission originally occupied three floors of Building 264 on the JPL campus, home to many of the lab\u2019s highest-profile projects. But soon after Neptune, says Jefferson Hall, who joined the project in 1978, \u2018\u2018we were booted out.\u2019\u2019 Their first move was into the former offices of a mainframe-computer company in Sierra Madre. In 2002, after more staff cuts, they moved to a rental suite in Altadena. NASA reviewed the mission to determine if it should be canceled altogether.The scientists\u2019 models, meanwhile, began to reveal subtle changes in the raw data. By late 2004, it was clear that Voyager 1\u2019s magnetometer had detected an abrupt increase in the strength of the surrounding magnetic field, suggesting the probe had entered the outermost layer of the heliospheric bubble, the \u2018\u2018heliosheath.\u2019\u2019 This is where the solar wind ions abruptly slow as they press outward against the surrounding interstellar matter and swerve to create a cometlike tail. A wind of interstellar ions flows around the outside of the bubble like water around the bow of a ship. Finally, on Aug. 25, 2012, the density of particles around the spacecraft precipitously increased, as though it had plunged from sky to sea. It had crossed the threshold of interstellar space.Last autumn, I drove through the San Gabriel Valley to a squat concrete building beside Scott-Fox Puppy Preschool. Suzanne Dodd, 56, the mission\u2019s project manager, answered the door. She wore red-framed glasses over sharp blue eyes, and her fair hair was cut short. She escorted me past the vestibule to a common room ringed by office doors. Hanging over the cubicle partitions in the center was a shingle that read \u2018\u2018Mission Control.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You can see where we are in the culture,\u2019\u2019 she said, with a mild sweep of her palm. Voyager was her first job. She pointed out a used microfiche reader that Tom Weeks, a hardware engineer and the self-described mission librarian, purchased on eBay to read old diagnostics reports. To conserve power on the spacecraft, the engineers must decide what to turn off when, and for how long \u2014 which means estimating how cold they can let each component get. (On Voyager 2, because of the broken oscillator, any change in temperature also tweaks the receiver frequency.) Turning the heaters off for a while is the safest way to get enough power to run the instruments, but the lower the overall wattage drops, the faster parts will freeze. One of the team\u2019s most valuable insights so far: Spinning the wheels of an eight-track tape recorder \u2014 the spacecrafts\u2019 only data-storage option \u2014 generates a bit of additional heat.Enrique Medina, the power subsystem expert, was preparing to implement a \u2018\u2018patch,\u2019\u2019 an update that would turn off a heater on Voyager 2 in order to run the gyroscope, roll the spacecraft and calibrate the magnetometer. Even though they simulate every patch with software, there is plenty of room for human error. Far more often, hardware fails for no evident reason. In 1998, Voyager 2 reacted to a command by going silent. For 64 hours straight, the flight team studied the specific instruction \u2014 consisting of 18 bits, or 1s and 0s \u2014 that preceded the blackout. Bits have been known to \u2018\u2018flip\u2019\u2019 to the opposite value, changing the instruction the same way that swapping a single letter turns \u2018\u2018cat\u2019\u2019 into \u2018\u2018cut.\u2019\u2019 The question was: What instruction had they accidentally given and how could they undo it? At last, modeling the outcome of each possible bit, they discovered one that turned off the exciter, which generates the spacecraft\u2019s radio signal; when they turned it back on, the transmissions resumed. A similar scare took place in 2010, when a bit involved in formatting telemetry flipped, turning the transmissions to gibberish. \u2018\u2018A lot of our anomalies we\u2019ve come up with workarounds for, and at the time we didn\u2019t know why it happened,\u2019\u2019 Weeks explained. Dodd added, \u2018\u2018The No. 1 rule with spacecraft is: Don\u2019t change it if you don\u2019t have to.\u2019\u2019In the mission-control cubby, Medina, who is 68 and a grandfather of four, with a husky voice and a Tom Selleck mustache, rolled a chair over to two pairs of monitors labeled with construction-paper signs that read: \u2018\u2018Voyager Mission Control Hardware, PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH.\u2019\u2019 He jiggled a mouse, and one of the screens woke to a stream of numbers and letters describing the health of Voyager 1.Because they have only four kilobytes of computer storage, the spacecraft transmit data 24/7, but the radio signals take 19 hours and 12 hours to reach Earth. The three antenna dishes big enough to register them are shared, so Voyager gets only four to six hours of reception time per spacecraft per day; outside these often odd windows, their data dissipate into the ether. Medina gestured to another computer in the corner that monitors the telemetry that comes in when the office is empty and, if it detects an anomaly, phones an on-call engineer: the Voyager Alarm Monitor Processor Including Remote Examination tool. \u2018\u2018We call it Vampire,\u2019\u2019 Medina said, \u2018\u2018because it works in the middle of the night.\u2019\u2019In March 2014, after news broke that Voyager 1 had crossed into interstellar space, I spoke with Medina over the phone. \u2018\u2018I would not leave my wife to go with Angelina Jolie, as exciting as that sounds,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018And I would not leave Voyager to go to the new Mars missions. I will not leave Voyager until it ceases to exist. Or until I cease to exist.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018If the pressure outside got high enough, and there are some areas in the Milky Way galaxy where it would be high enough, it could compress the heliosphere down to where in fact the boundary is almost to where we are. And that would change the radiation environment of the planets, which is important when you want to try to understand anything about the origin of life,\u2019\u2019 Ed Stone, the science-team leader, told me when I visited him at Caltech last fall. \u2018\u2018Here on Earth, wherever there\u2019s liquid water, whether it\u2019s boiling water coming out of the vents or frozen water, there are microbes there. So life is remarkably robust where there\u2019s water.\u2019\u2019He went on: \u2018\u2018I think that one of the biggest questions is, Can we find a spot here in the solar system where there\u2019s microbial life? If there\u2019s no microbial life anywhere else, that would be surprising, given here on Earth it appeared fairly quickly after the end of the bombardment,\u2019\u2019 an epic rain of asteroids some four billion years ago. \u2018\u2018If one could ever find some evidence of it here in the solar system where we could get a sample, then one could look at the DNA. All life on Earth has a related DNA. Is that true for everywhere? Either answer would be amazing. Either there\u2019s only one way that life evolves, or no, there\u2019s more than one way.\u2019\u2019In his office, Stone stood on tiptoe to lift an intricate model of Voyager from the top of a bookcase. At 81, he moves more stiffly than the Stone of NASA archival footage. Otherwise, he is remarkably unchanged. On a bulletin board behind his computer, he pins the latest graphs of the rate of charged particles that each spacecraft has detected. A drastic dip in low-energy ones is what convinced him that Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere, and he is eager for Voyager 2, which entered the heliosheath from a different angle in 2007, to see a comparable drop before it goes quiet.\u2018\u2018When we started this, I realized we were on a mission of discovery,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I just had no idea how much discovery there was going to be. And I certainly had no idea that it would last as long as it has.\u2019\u2019 After we lose contact with them, the spacecraft will continue to orbit the galaxy for billions of years, never striking another star. \u2018\u2018Space,\u2019\u2019 Stone said, \u2018\u2018is really empty.\u2019\u2019Astrophysicists who study the heliosphere wage a constant battle against apathy when it comes to invisible substances nearly 100 times farther away from us than the sun is. \u2018\u2018I hear a lot of people saying, \u2018So what?\u2019 I try to explain: \u2018It\u2019s like your home,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Merav Opher, a professor of astrophysics at Boston University and a member of the Voyager science team, told me. \u2018\u2018You just found out the walls aren\u2019t walls. They\u2019re porous. I think it\u2019s existential.\u2019\u2019 In 2006, Opher and Stone published a landmark paper in The Astrophysical Journal predicting that Voyager 2 would encounter the heliosphere boundary closer to the sun than its twin had, pointing to a startling contradiction: The heliosphere must be asymmetrical; it is not a \u2018\u2018sphere\u2019\u2019 after all.There is passionate disagreement about what its exact shape is. (The Voyager scientists argue over practically every scrap of data; a few holdouts insist that Voyager 1 has yet to reach interstellar space.) In 1961, Eugene Parker, the renowned astrophysicist who first predicted the existence of a heliosphere, hypothesized that it might look like a comet \u2014 compressed in front with a tail in back. Earlier this year, Tom Krimigis, the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and the principal investigator for Voyager\u2019s Low-Energy Charged Particle Experiment, published a paper in Nature Astronomy showing that the heliosphere has a very short tail and \u2018\u2018kind of moves through space like a clenched fist.\u2019\u2019 His instrument has also shown that cosmic rays \u2014 expected to flow toward the heliosphere uniformly from across interstellar space \u2014 actually move quite differently depending on their orientation to the interstellar magnetic field. \u2018\u2018Every once in a while, a tsunami passes Voyager,\u2019\u2019 Krimigis told me, referring to these waves. \u2018\u2018The galaxy was supposed to be a calm sea, and that\u2019s not what we find.\u2019\u2019Opher believes that the influence of the sun\u2019s magnetic field may warp the heliosphere into the shape of a \u2018\u2018croissant.\u2019\u2019 At its plump center, interstellar matter presses in closer than previously thought \u2014 which would mean we are less isolated from the rest of the galaxy than we believe.Later that morning, when Zottarelli entered the conference room to attend his last daily flight-team briefing, his colleague Adans Ko, 58, was arranging takeout containers of dim sum on the table for a celebration. He threw an arm around his shoulders and said, \u2018\u2018Larry is going to give me a kiss today!\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto, who was holding a camera, said, \u2018\u2018O.K., look at me.\u2019\u2019 She was making a photo album for him. When the party broke up, I found Zottarelli\u2019s replacement, Lu Yang, at her desk. I asked her if he had given her any specific advice. \u2018\u2018Whatever the problem, you go there and solve it,\u2019\u2019 she said, and laughed.In retirement, Zottarelli told me, he would like to see Florida again. He wonders how it has changed. In his garage is a 1954 Swallow Doretti, a fixer-upper. \u2018\u2018It probably needs new brakes,\u2019\u2019 he said. I asked him if there was anywhere he liked to drive for fun. \u2018\u2018No,\u2019\u2019 he replied. \u2018\u2018Not anymore.\u2019\u2019I had stopped by his office to say goodbye and ask him what he planned to do with his newfound freedom. I pictured him in the Doretti, flying down the Pacific Coast Highway, wind in his hair. But he seemed to be in no mood for talking. I wished him well and turned to go. Then he spoke. \u2018\u2018I expect my second stroke will be on the 17th of November,\u2019\u2019 he said ruefully, gesturing toward his empty wall calendar. \u2018\u2018Life expectancy is five to seven years at my age on retiring, so \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018That was humor, I guess. I\u2019m not looking forward to being even older. Got no choice in the matter.\u2019\u2019I asked if he ever found himself thinking about the billions of years that the Voyagers will circle the center of the galaxy, long after our sun has exploded, scattering more stardust throughout the universe. \u2018\u2018Of course,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I was raised in the Roman Rite. I\u2019m pretty much an atheist. But what is the meaning of life? It\u2019s not Monty Python, O.K.?\u2019\u2019Had he reached any conclusions about what it is? \u2018\u2018Well, on Earth, yeah,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018One species always prepares the way for the next generation \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u2019\u2019An article on Aug. 6 about the Voyager space probes misstated the title of Tom Krimigis. He is the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, not the emeritus head of the entire laboratory.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Hate Groups Forced Online Platforms to Reveal Their True Nature", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyWhite supremacist marchers had not yet lit their torches when the deletions began. The \u2018\u2018Unite the Right\u2019\u2019 Facebook page, which had been used to organize the rally in Charlottesville, was removed the day before the event was scheduled, forcing planners to disperse to other platforms to organize. And then, in the hours and days after a participant drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others, internet companies undertook a collective purge.Facebook banned a range of pages with names like \u2018\u2018Right Wing Death Squad\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018White Nationalists United.\u2019\u2019 Reddit banned, among others, a hard-right community called \u2018\u2018Physical Removal,\u2019\u2019 an organizer of which had called the weekend\u2019s killing \u2018\u2018a morally justified action.\u2019\u2019 Twitter suspended an unknown number of users, including popular accounts associated with 4chan\u2019s openly fascistic Politically Incorrect message board, or /pol/. Discord, a chat app for gamers that doubled as an organizing tool for the event, and where a prominent white supremacist had called for disrupting Heyer\u2019s funeral, rushed to do cleanup.The clampdown extended beyond the walled gardens of social platforms to a wide array of online services. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site that promoted the march and celebrated its fatal outcome, was banned by the domain registrar and hosting service GoDaddy, then hours later by Google\u2019s hosting service, then lost access to SendGrid, which it had used to deliver its newsletter; PayPal cut off the white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s organization, which later lost access to its web host, Squarespace; Airbnb removed the accounts of a number of Charlottesville attendees before the event, and released a statement saying that \u2018\u2018violence, racism and hatred demonstrated by neo-\u00adNazis, the alt-right and white supremacists should have no place in this world\u2019\u2019; by Wednesday, Spotify was even expunging \u2018\u2018white supremacist\u2019\u2019 music from its library.The platforms\u2019 sudden action in response to an outpouring of public grief and rage resembles, at first glance, a moral awakening and suggests a mounting sense of responsibility to the body politic. You could be forgiven for seeing this as a turning point for these sites, away from a hands-off approach to the communities they host and toward something with more oversight and regulation. An inside-out version of this analysis has been embraced by right-wing users, who have wasted no time declaring these bans a violation of their free speech. But this is an incomplete accounting of what happened and one that serves two parties and two parties alone: the companies themselves and the people they\u2019ve just banned.It is worth noting that the platforms most flamboyantly dedicated to a borrowed idea of free speech and assembly are the same ones that have struggled most intensely with groups of users who seek to organize and disrupt their platforms. A community of trolls on an internet platform is, in political terms, not totally unlike a fascist movement in a weak liberal democracy: It engages with and uses the rules and protections of the system it inhabits with the intent of subverting it and eventually remaking it in their image or, if that fails, merely destroying it.But what gave these trolls power on platforms wasn\u2019t just their willingness to act in bad faith and to break the rules and norms of their environment. It was their understanding that the rules and norms of platforms were self-serving and cynical in the first place. After all, these platforms draw arbitrary boundaries constantly and with much less controversy \u2014 against spammers, concerning profanity or in response to government demands. These fringe groups saw an opportunity in the gap between the platforms\u2019 strained public dedication to discourse stewardship and their actual existence as profit-driven entities, free to do as they please. Despite their participatory rhetoric, social platforms are closer to authoritarian spaces than democratic ones. It makes some sense that people with authoritarian tendencies would have an intuitive understanding of how they work and how to take advantage of them.This was also a moment these hate groups were anticipating; getting banned in an opaque, unilateral fashion was always the way out and, to some degree, it suits them. In the last year, hard-right communities on social platforms have cultivated a pre-emptive identity as platform refugees and victims of censorship. They\u2019ve also been preparing for this moment or one like it: There are hard-right alternatives to Twitter, to Reddit and even to the still-mostly-lawless 4chan. There are alternative fund-raising sites in the mold of GoFundMe or Kickstarter; there\u2019s an alternative to Patreon called Hatreon. Like most of these new alternatives, it has cynically borrowed a cause \u2014 it calls itself a site that \u2018\u2018stands for free speech absolutism\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that the more mainstream platforms borrowed first. Their persecution narrative, which is the most useful narrative they have, and one that will help spread their cause beyond the fringes, was written for them years ago by the same companies that helped give them a voice.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
